Grant us \nto see, O God, that if we undermine this foundation of our Government, \nwe, sooner or later, jeopardize the superstructure which was built upon \nit. As we forsake the root of our national uniqueness, we forfeit the \nfruit.\n  Help us to comprehend, dear God, that this is one explanation for the \nfutility of our best human efforts today. We are struggling to preserve \nthe benefits of a belief which we no longer hold to be true. We have \nsmashed the foundation and are striving to prevent the superstructure \nfrom collapsing.\n  Forgive the secularism, the antisupernaturalism which we have \nexchanged for faith in a Creator God which motivated our Founding \nFathers. Restore unto us their beliefs that we may recover the riches \nof the legacy they transmitted to us before it is too late.\n  We pray this in the name of Him who is the Light of the world.

Mr. President, late last week, the Member of Congress \nfrom the First District in the State of Oklahoma [Steve Largent] was \nvoted into the National Football League's Hall of Fame in the first \nyear during which he was eligible for that honor.\n  While Mr. Largent represents a State a long way from my own State of \nWashington, his entire National Football League career was, of course, \nas a member of the Seattle Seahawks. And so for many years, for more \nthan half of the year he was a resident of the Puget Sound region.\n  Very rarely have so many distinctions come to a person of the age of \nSteve Largent, as an outstanding football player, both in college and \nin the National Football League, as an elected Member of the Congress \nof the United States, and as a person with a great deal of fame. \nRarely, I may say, has anyone so deserved those honors.\n  I think Steve Largent would be the first to say that he was far from \nthe fastest or the most gifted person playing in the National Football \nLeague, but due to a tremendous amount of self-discipline and \ndedication, he became one of the most outstanding persons in our \ngeneration to play that fascinating game.\n  But I believe that Mr. Largent and all of us would say that more \nimportant than his fame as a football player, more important than his \nmembership in the Congress of the United States, has been the example \nhe has presented to those who have come to know him through those \nactivities as a human being: As a husband, as a father, as an activist \nChristian. With those as his No. 1 goals, he has nonetheless been \n[[Page S1728]] professionally successful, now, in two dramatically \ndifferent professions.\n  We speak often of the role model nature of professional athletes. In \nSteve Largent, we have an athlete who is truly a role model for our \nsociety; an individual who has shown that fame and high income is not \ninconsistent with the finest possible family and citizen leadership \nthat it is possible for us to imagine. Last week, Congressman Largent \nwas a part of the debate in the House of Representatives over a \nbalanced budget amendment on which debate will begin in this body in \nless than an hour. So he is now serving in as distinguished a fashion \nas a Member of this Congress as he did as a member of the Seattle \nSeahawks and the National Football League. But most of all, our friend \nand exemplar, Steve Largent, is a person who shows what citizenship and \nmembership in a family ought to be in the United States of America.\n  So it is that we, from the State of Washington, are grateful for his \nlong association with us. We wish, along with the people of Oklahoma, \nand especially of his First Congressional District, to congratulate him \non an honor well earned and to wish him long years of success in his \nnew career and a lifetime of success as a leader of the people he \nrepresents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized. I \nmight suggest the Senator from North Dakota is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1727-7", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1728-S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MONTHLY REPORT TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, and my colleagues in the Senate. On \nNovember 14, I announced that I will not be a candidate for reelection \nto the Senate nor for any other office. I will be leaving with great \nrespect for this body and with great appreciation to the people of \nIllinois who made it possible for me to serve here.\n  The evening of my announcement, President Clinton called me from \nDjakarta, Indonesia, to wish me the best. He made a suggestion: Once a \nmonth I should report to the public on what is happening and what \nshould happen in Congress. He indicated that since I will not be a \ncandidate for reelection, my words might take on added significance and \nnot be viewed as another partisan speech.\n  I am making the first of my monthly comments today, the 113th \nanniversary of the birth of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a President who has \nbeen praised recently by both President Clinton and Speaker Newt \nGingrich. FDR and Congress worked together on the huge problems the \nNation then faced.\n  A glance at the policy landscape provides these recent positive \ndevelopments, from my perspective:\n  First, a peaceful change in the majority party in both Houses of \nCongress. While I personally would have preferred retaining Democratic \nmajorities in the House and Senate, I also recognize that for a free \nsystem to thrive, peaceful change must occur from time to time.\n  Second, Congress has voted to place the laws and regulations that \ngovern our private sector counterparts on itself, and the President has \nsigned that measure. That will protect our employees better and make us \nmore sensitive to the difficulties others face.\n  Third, the Senate Judiciary Committee--and now the full House of \nRepresentatives--have approved a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. The passage of the amendment first urged by Thomas \nJefferson come none too soon as we careen down the fiscal hill toward \nthe fate of far too many nations: monetizing the debt, meeting our \nobligations by printing more and more money that is worth less and \nless.\n  There are negative developments also. I would include:\n  First, excessive partisanship in Congress by both political parties \nas we adjust to the new status each has. That we will differ on issues \nis both natural and healthy; that we are sometime petty in our \ndifferences may be natural for all of us who have above-average egos, \nbut it is not healthy.\n  Second, a mean-spiritedness toward the poor surfaces in too much \ndiscussion of welfare reform, sometimes bordering on racism. We need \ngenuine welfare reform. The danger is that we will move organizational \nboxes around on a chart and try to convince the public and ourselves \nthat we have done something constructive. Even worse, there is talk of \ntaking punitive action against poor people.\n  Third, the two parties have entered into a bidding war on tax cuts. \nMany of the Republicans promised one in their Contract With America, \nand President Clinton pledged the same in altered form. Both sides are \nwrong. If I may personalize this, I face a choice of giving myself a \nsmall tax cut and imposing a further burden on my three grandchildren, \nor sacrificing a little and providing a better future for my \ngrandchildren. I do not have a difficult time making that choice, and I \ndo not believe most Americans do. We should pledge a reduction in the \ndeficit instead of a tax cut.\n  Others can provide additional pluses and minuses.\n  But one issue that dominated the political landscape only a few \nmonths ago is almost absent: health care. Yes, the President--to his \ncredit--mentioned it in his State of the Union Message, but little is \nsaid on the floors of the House and Senate about this massive problem. \nTelevision and radio news programs rarely mention it. What once was a \ndominant issue at town meetings in my State has almost staged a \ndisappearing act.\n  But it will not disappear, not as long as almost 40 million Americans \nremain unprotected, the only citizens of any modern industrial nation \nwith that status. It will not disappear as long as Americans are added \nto the lists of uninsured at the rate of more than 91,000 every month, \n3,055 every day.\n  Since the day President Clinton waved his pen at us in a joint \nsession of Congress on January 25, 1994, 1.1 million more Americans \nhave lost their health insurance coverage, bringing the total to 39.7 \nmillion. And costs continue to escalate. Medicare spending, for \nexample, will double in the next 7 years and will then consume 16 \npercent of our total Federal spending. But we cannot tackle Medicare \ncosts without tackling the health care costs in the rest of our \neconomy. As we cut from Medicare, we shift the burden to the private \nsector--and every private-paying patient makes up the difference when \nMedicare underpays hospitals by about $13 billion every year, as it \ndoes now.\n  Seven days ago marked 56 years since Franklin Roosevelt sent a \nmessage to Congress for a national health program. But early in 1931, \nas Governor of New York, he reported to the legislature of that State: \n``The success or failure of any government in the final analysis must \nbe measured by the well-being of its citizens. Nothing can be more \nimportant [than] * * * the health of its people.'' Since then, Harry \nTruman and Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton have called upon us to \nprotect our citizens better, and Congress has failed to respond.\n  This issue will not go away. It is more than grim statistics. It is \nmy former staff member, now a consultant with the Federal Government \nbut without health insurance coverage because she is technically not an \nemployee. At a dinner with two friends, she suddenly experienced chest \npains, paleness, perspiration, and nausea--often symptoms of a heart \nattack. She refused to go to a hospital for fear of the cost. It turned \nout she has a problem with food poisoning that was not serious. But how \nmany people have died who actually have had heart attacks in that \nsituation? A woman in McHenry, IL, wrote to me about the health \ncoverage horrors her daughter and son-in-law have gone through, facing \nthe loss of their home and car. And then this woman who wrote to me \nadded:\n\n       I have had cancer, so I can never quit my job as no one \n     else will give me insurance. My husband has had ileitis and \n     two types of diabetes so no one will give him insurance. We \n     are trapped in our jobs and could not afford to pay for our \n     own insurance if we ever got permanently laid off or had to \n     switch jobs. We are 48 and 53 years old and this is a scary \n     thought.\n\n  [[Page S1729]] Or listen to this man from Oak Lawn, IL:\n\n       I am a Republican and will continue to vote Republican. \n     However * * * during some lean times I had to let my health \n     insurance lapse. It was not, as some politicans and demagogs \n     so smugly suggest, because I spent the money on recreation. I \n     spent the money on food, rent, and bills. But I was forced to \n     stay in the hospital a while. Now I am completely financially \n     ruined. I'm 41 years old and I'm ruined.\n\n  Or the mother in Ottawa, IL, injured in\n   an automobile accident, whose husband suffered injury in a work-\nrelated accident and must find different work. She writes\n\n       My husband and I and three children ages 18, 12, and 10 are \n     now without health benefits. Due to our disabilities and \n     unfair treatment by insurance companies our financial \n     situation is dire.\n\n  The stories go on and on.\n  Those stories will multiply if we do not act. And other changes in \nhealth care delivery are emerging. Each week fewer and fewer Americans \nhave an independent choice of physician. Each week, for-profit \ncorporations are taking over not-for-profit hospitals, reducing the \nnumber of nurses on duty and requiring resident physicians to see more \npatients in less time, diminishing the quality of health delivery. At \nleast one physician in Illinois has decided to give up the practice \nrather than provide care that uses mass production techniques.\n  And Medicaid patients--poor people-- routinely are given the cold \nshoulder for nonemergency care by many hospitals who prefer patients \nwith insurance coverage.\n  The United States is the wealthiest nation but not the healthiest \nnation. Twenty-one nations have lower infant mortality rates than we \ndo, and 23 industrialized nations have fewer low-birthweights babies. \nYet these countries spend far less on health care then we do, and many \nhave a longer average lifespan. That is not because of an act of God \nbut because of flawed policy. Our poor health record did not come as \nsome divine edict from above but emerged from the indifference of men \nand women in this very room.\n  Why? Part of the reason was complexity and delay on the part of those \nof us who supported a health coverage program. But that is only a part \nof the picture. What primarily caused the confusion and opposition was \nthe greed on the part of those who profit from their cut in this \ntrillion-dollar business. Newsweek reported that opponents spend $400 \nmillion, more than twice what the two major Presidential candidates \nspend in the last two elections combined. When CEO's who are engaged in \nthe present system pocket as much as $10 million in 1 year, do you \nthink they will be anxious to alter the present procedures which help \nthem and hurt millions of Americans? The Wall Street Journal recently \nstated that Health Systems International of Colorado has $475 million \nin cash, and the amount is growing by $500,000 a day, and the Journal \nreports they are ``hunting for new ways to park the money.'' Do they \nwant to change the system? The same article quotes Margo Vignola of \nSalomon Brothers saying that the top nine HMO's have $9.5 billion in \ncash, ``way beyond what HMO's need.'' Do they want to change the \nsystem? Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, gave $221,235 to the \nRepublican national committees in soft money before the election. Did \nthey do that because they want to change the system?\n  The common assumption is that with a Democratic President and a \nRepublican Congress, no significant progress in health care can be \nmade. I challenge that assumption.\n  The greatest contribution of Harry Truman's Presidency--one of many \nsignificant contributions he made--was the creation of the Marshall \nplan. To many it seemed doomed when offered. The first Gallup Poll \nafter its proposal showed only 14 percent of the American people \nsupported it. On top of that, after the 1946 election, President Truman \nhad to work with a Republican Congress. But one man, Senator Arthur \nVandenberg of Michigan, a key Republican, stood up strongly and \nsupported the Marshall plan and helped to save Western Europe. The \nRepublicans in the Senate have designated as their new leader on\n health care Senator Robert Bennett of Utah, one of the more thoughtful \nMembers of this body. Is it possible that he, together with the new \nchair of the Finance Committee, Bob Packwood, can be the Arthur \nVandenbergs of our generation?\n\n  It is politically understandable that Republican Senators might have \nbeen reluctant to work with Democrats on health care reform in the 103d \nCongress, for fear that they would hand Democrats a legislative \nvictory. But now, that is behind us. With Republicans in control of \nboth Chambers of Congress, there is no question that bipartisan \nagreement on health care will be of benefit to the broad public and not \nsimply a political victory for one party at the expense of the other.\n  Could we, for example, at least provide coverage for all pregnant \nwomen and children age 6 and under? Do we have the courage to stand up \nto the profiteers to at least do that?\n  Let me add that it is not enough for Senators to stand up. They are \nnot likely to do it in splendid isolation. Business and labor leaders, \nprofessional people and those who have been abused by this system must \njoin in a chorus for action. Their voices will not be as strong as the \ndecibel level of those who speak from greed, but Senators and House \nMembers should know that there are at least some Americans who know and \nunderstand the dimensions and the importance of the issue.\n  There are occasions when we, in the Senate, must ask ourselves: Why \nare we here? Let us look in the faces of 39 million Americans without \nhealth care coverage and ask ourselves that question. Let us look at \nthe millions more who will lose their coverage if they lose their jobs \nor change jobs. Let us not be silent and unresponsive to their pleas \nfor help. Let us not be so eager to hold public office that we violate \nthe public trust, not by disobeying the law, but by following the \nshifting winds of public opinion and the pressures of big campaign \ndonors.\n  There are no Americans who today look to their forebears and say with \npride, ``He or she voted against creating Social Security.'' There are \nno Americans who look to their grandparents or great-grandparents and \nsay with pride, ``He or she voted against Medicare.''\n  We are not here in the Senate simply to assume an exalted title and \nlet the media message our egos. We are here to create a better future \nfor our people and for generations to come. In the last session, the \nSenate did not even vote on health care. That will not happen again. \nBut we should do more than give ourselves an opportunity to vote. We \nshould, in a fiscally prudent, pay-as-you-go way, give all Americans \nwhat we as legislators and Federal employees have: health care \nprotection. We should give future generations the ability to look back \nupon us with pride and say, ``They were the first political leaders to \nguarantee health care coverage for all our citizens.''\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today for a short tribute to a lady \nfrom Wyoming who passed away last week, a lady who certainly was a rare \nand wonderful gem, not only for Wyoming but for this country as well. \nShe was someone that I had the great privilege of knowing and admiring, \nLorna Kooi Simpson.\n  My friend Al Simpson and the entire Simpson family lost a wonderful \nmother and caregiver last week. We all have lost one of the greatest \nladies of Wyoming and the dearest of souls. Her devotion to her family, \ncommunity, State and Nation are a legacy. Indeed she is part of the \nvery fabric of Wyoming.\n  Lorna Simpson began her long distinguished life on August 19, 1900--\nthe daughter of a Dutch immigrant. With her family Lorna Simpson moved \nWest. In 1929 Lorna married an exceptional young man, a lawyer, from \nCody, WY--Milward Simpson. He was a State legislator for Wyoming and a \nman destined to lead his State. Together they had two sons, Peter and \nAlan. In Lorna, Milward found an equally dedicated soul and a partner \nto do the work few of us have the means to accomplish.\n  Lorna, like the rest of her family, went on to do great things. She \nwas a stalwart of her community and State; active in community service, \nbusiness, the war effort and of course politics. \n[[Page S1730]] She was a special young woman who, along with her \nhusband, made up one of the most successful and respected teams Wyoming \nhas ever known.\n  In 1954 Lorna became the First Lady of Wyoming after helping her \nhusband become Wyoming's Governor. There in Cheyenne her reputation \nonly grew as a caring compassionate person who put so much of her time \nand spirit into the youth of Wyoming.\n  Milward Simpson and his dear wife gave their unique talents and \nthoughtful style to Washington in 1962 when Milward served Wyoming \nuntil 1966 as a Member of this body. During her time here Lorna was \nnamed by the Senate to be the representative of the Women of the United \nStates to the Organization of American States. In addition, she worked \ntirelessly to refurbish and extend the use of the Senate Chapel.\n  Their sons, Pete and Al, have gone on to great things. Pete Simpson \nas the University of Wyoming's vice president for development and \nalumni and university relations, Al Simpson, like his father, of \ncourse, as one of the most respected Members of this body.\n  As a wife, mother, First Lady, adviser, grandmother, and great-\ngrandmother Lorna Simpson touched countless lives and helped so many \npeople. Her accomplishments, the people she touched could never really \nbe fully listed.\n  Susan and I join so many in grieving the passage of a lady who was \ntruly the very best of Wyoming.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1729-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SECOND READING OF A BILL--S. 290\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to commend that committee for its \nimportant role in reviewing the agreement, because there are some \n37,000 American troops on the demilitarized zone in South Korea. They \nare certainly exposed to harm should any conflict arise on the Korean \nPeninsula.\n  It is interesting to note that under Armed Services Committee \noversight, the Department of Defense has seen fit to fund the purchase \nof approximately 50,000 tons of oil. The first shipment called for \nunder the agreed framework.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to briefly raise three specific \nareas of concern about the framework agreement. The first is the fate \nof 8,177 Americans still unaccounted for in North Korea following the \nKorean war north of the 38th parallel. I find it interesting to reflect \non that staggering figure, when we recognize that currently today in \nVietnam, we have somewhat less than 1,700 unaccounted for.\n  We have an obligation, Mr. President, to get the answers. How do we \nget the answers? Well, it is certainly a matter of access. The North \nKoreans must allow the United States access, including joint recovery \nteams that proved so successful in Vietnam. In fact, in North Korea, \nunlike Vietnam, we know the precise location of over 2,000 grave sites \nand prisoner-of-war camps. We simply cannot get in.\n  During our visit to Pyongyang, Senator Simon and I delivered a letter \nto President Kim Jong Il. The letter was given to the Foreign Minister \nand he assured us it had been delivered to President Kim Jong Il.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of that letter be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, to my knowledge we have received no answer to the \nletter delivered to President Kim Jong Il.\n  I call on the North Korean leadership to respond favorably to our \nrequest for joint recovery teams and further cooperation. It is fair to \nsay that the few remains repatriated thus far have not been well \nhandled. Moreover, there appears to be a profit motive associated with \nthose remains. We have had unofficial indications that the DPRK wants \nup to $30,000 U.S. per remain. This is an outrageous sum compared to \nthe $2,000 figure used for reimbursement in Vietnam.\n  It is inconceivable to me, Mr. President, that as to the lack of \ncooperation in fullest possible accounting for those Americans lost in \nthe Korean conflict, there has not been a demand by the administration \nin the framework agreement that this matter be addressed. I think this \nis the highest requirement of Government--fullest possible accounting \nof those who gave so much for our freedoms. Why has it not been \nincluded if the framework agreement? Moreover, the administration has \nnot yet seen fit to respond to the inquiries that this Senator has made \nin that regard.\n  I would also like to call this body's attention to the comparison \nbetween Vietnam and North Korea. The administration has moved faster in \n3 months with North Korea than in the last 3 years with Vietnam toward \ndiplomatic and trade relation, despite the fact that Vietnam has taken \nmany good-faith steps by providing cooperation, including joint \nrecovery teams.\n  One other interesting comparison, not related to the MIA issue, is \nthe fact that we have agreed to provide the North Koreans with light-\nwater. Yet, we are prohibited from selling that same technology to \nChina.\n  The second issue I want to talk about is the lack of dialog between \nNorth and South Korea. One of the requirements of the framework \nagreement is that there be a dialog. Without a meaningful dialog \nbetween the North and South, it will be impossible to implement the \nagreed framework. Based on administration representations, we \nanticipate that South Korea and Japan will pick up substantial costs \nassociated with the delivery of the light-water reactors--at least $4 \nbillion. We also anticipate other countries to cover the delivery of a \nsignificant amount of oil, approximately 500,000 tons per year over a \nperiod of years.\n  I do not believe that South Korea can make such a commitment to the \nNorth without a political dialog. But at this point, there is no such \ndialog. The North is still demanding an apology from President Kim \nYoung-sam for the alleged insensitivity on the death of Kim Il-song, \nand yet the North continues with propaganda against the South.\n  Mr. President, section three of the framework agreement between the \nUnited States and North Korean requires that the North Koreans will \nengage in a North-South dialog and that the North Koreans will \nconsistently take steps to implement the North-South declaration on the \ndemilitarization of the Korean Peninsula.\n  I am gratified that references to North-South issues were included in \nthe agreed framework, but I am concerned that the references do not \nhave \n[[Page S1731]] specificity. For example, at what point will the United \nStates stop fulfilling its commitments under the agreement framework if \nthere has not been progress in the North-South relations? Just a few \ndays ago, I introduced a resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 4 \nthat calls on the executive branch to take steps to ensure that \nimplementation of the agreed framework is linked to the substantive and \nrapid progress in the dialog between the North and the South.\n  I hope this resolution is a step in the right direction.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think it is appropriate to comment on one \nof the administration's defenses of the agreed framework. In response \nto any criticism of the deal itself, the administration response that \nit was this agreement or war.\n  Although I know that this is second-guessing, I maintain we could \nhave negotiated a better deal. The agreed framework is a bad deal \nbecause we left out the inspections of the two suspected nuclear waste \nsites. What does North Korea have to hide? We still do not know. The \nadministration walked up to the line with sanctions because of North \nKorea's refusal to agree to the IAEA inspections of the two suspected \nnuclear sites.\n  But then, if you will recall, President Carter went to North Korea \nand got Kim Il-song to agree to a freeze, which the Clinton \nadministration apparently felt compelled to accept. We lost leverage \nwith our allies, such as China and Japan, to go ahead with the \nsanctions at a time when, in my opinion, North Korea was ready to \ncollapse from within. It could not depend on the Soviet Union anymore; \nit could not depend on the Chinese for subsidized oil. They were \ntotally isolated.\n  Although I readily agree that the North Koreans were desparate and \ndangerous, I would like my colleague to reflect on the comparison to \nthe Soviet Union. During the cold war, the Soviets were a documented \nnuclear threat. The Reagan administration, rather than backing down, \nchose to bring the Soviet Union to its knees in an arms race.\n  So today we have an isolated and broke North Korea. Moreover, Mr. \nPresident, I believe there is a leadership vacuum after the death of \nKim Il-song. So who are we helping?\n  Perhaps we should wait to see if a moderate regime will come forward \nrather than giving the current totalitarian regime a new life? I \nbelieve we are rewarding North Korea's bad behavior, and it sets an \nunfortunate precedent.\n  I have indicated previously that I belive that we are bound by \nagreements executed by our executive branch, even though it is an \nagreement that, in my judgment, is a poor agreement because it carries \na scent of appeasement. But if the administration has to come back to \nthe Congress to fund it--if South Korea and Japan do not come forward--\nthen as far as this Senator is concerned, all bets are off for this \nagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                 December 9, 1994.\n     His Excellency Kim Jong Il,\n     Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n       Excellency: As guests in your country, we are writing to \n     express our hopes concerning the evolving relationship \n     between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the \n     United States of America. It is our hope that this will lead \n     to the resolution of questions concerning the fate of the \n     8,177 Americans and thousands of other United Nations \n     personnel still unaccounted for following the conflict of \n     1950-1953 and believed to be missing north of the 38th \n     parallel.\n       We recognize that determining the fate of these missing \n     service-members will be difficult, as we have seen in \n     attempting to obtain the fullest possible accounting in other \n     countries. Progress will require constant effort and a \n     sincere commitment to resolve this sensitive issue. In this \n     regard, we encourage the Democratic People's Republic of \n     Korea to agree to joint participation by the United States in \n     the recovery of remains of servicemembers still unaccounted \n     for north of the 38th parallel.\n       The American people take most seriously the obligation for \n     the fullest possible accounting of those who are still \n     missing in action. As senior members of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the United States Senate, we appreciate \n     the opportunity to communicate directly with you and we urge \n     your best efforts and decisive leadership on this important \n     and serious humanitarian matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Simon,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Frank H.

Mr. President, Congressional fellows are an integral part \nof our business here on Capitol Hill. They come from throughout the \nexecutive branch and bring a wealth of expertise and perspective to \ntheir work.\n  The most recent fellow to serve in my office was not only an \noutstanding addition to the staff for nearly 2 years, but was rather \nunique to us in that she was a major in the U.S. Marine Corps. She was \nalso a dedicated mother of two, and became affectionately known among \nthe staff as ``Major Mom.''\n  Maj. Debra Biely is a dedicated, intelligent, and extremely \narticulate professional who quickly became a valued and trusted member \nof my legislative staff. As a military LA, she worked on the full range \nof issues relating to national defense and the space program. Her years \nof experience as a Marine officer, together with her in-depth \nunderstanding of the programming and budgeting process, were always \nevident in the quality, accuracy, and timeliness of her work.\n  Major Biely always provided me and my permanent staff with sound, \nthoughtful analysis of often complex national security issues. She \nbriefed me on such issues as United Nations peacekeeping efforts, the \nuse of Armed Forces in Bosnia, the Marines in Somalia, and the \noperational control of American forces in international coalitions.\n  I learned to completely trust her judgment. She often represented me \nin meetings with constituents, defense contractors, veterans groups, \nand military program managers. In so doing, Debra was an impressive \nrepresentative of the Marine Corps to a broad spectrum of people, both \nwithin and outside the Government.\n  She is an excellent writer and researcher. Debra's work during the \n1993 Base Closure Commission hearings proved invaluable as she helped \nprepare me to protect the Nation's only live-agent chemical training \nfacility. She assisted in getting several major programs through the \nauthorization and appropriations processes.\n  Yes, Maj. Debra Biely is the consummate military professional, and \nconducted herself as such while serving in my office. But she is also a \nwarm, friendly, and outgoing person, who come to be emulated by the \nrest of my staff. This ``Major Mom'' is also thoroughly and completely \ndevoted to her husband and children, and we often marveled at how she \ncould do such a superb job in the office and still devote so much of \nherself to her family. She was also a tremendous follower of current \nevents, and often was the first to know of major stories in the news. I \nshould add that ``Major Mom'' only recently completed her master of \nbusiness administration degree. She truly is one of those modern women \nwho\n manage to do it all and do all of it well.\n\n  Perhaps what we will remember most about Debra's work, and what I \npersonally appreciate the most, is her leadership in the battle to save \nthe International Space Station. She proved to be a committed and \ntireless worker on this important cause. Her persistent efforts helped \npave the way for an overwhelming vote of support for the station in \nthis body. She was recognized by Vice President Gore for her efforts in \nthis regard.\n  In short, we were fortunate to have Debra on our staff, and, frankly, \nI wish she could have stayed longer. Her demonstration of loyalty, \nintegrity, and commitment all reflected well on the U.S. Marine Corps, \nindeed on the entire Armed Forces of our country. Major Biely is a \nshining example of the quality and professionalism that characterize \nthe ranks of our military personnel today, as well as a significant \nreminder of the important role that women play in our national defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1731-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n             [[Page S1732]] TRIBUTE TO DR. LESLIE S. WRIGHT\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the Rotary Club of Birmingham, AL honored \nDr. Leslie S. Wright on Wednesday, January 25 for his outstanding \nleadership during the 1985-88 term as Rotary International's PolioPlus \ncampaign chairman. During his 3-year tenure as leader of this worldwide \nfundraising effort, Dr. Wright inspired and motivated Rotarians around \nthe globe to more than double their original goal of $120 million. To \ndate, Rotarians, companies, and individuals have donated over $247 \nmillion to rid the world of polio by the year 2005.\n  Not only has the money been raised, but thousands of Rotarians have \nvolunteered countless hours toward 1 billion children being immunized. \nOur own hemisphere has been declared free of polio and we are well on \nour way to seeing an end to this dreaded disease before the target date \nof 2005. Altogether, 141 countries are now polio free. It is a grand \nunderstatement to say that the response to Dr. Wright's dynamic \nleadership was overwhelming.\n  A native of Birmingham, Leslie S. Wright earned two degrees from the \nUniversity of Louisville. He has been awarded honorary doctoral degrees \nby Auburn University, the University of Alabama, Troy State University, \nSamford University, and the University of Louisville. In 1983, he \nretired as president of Samford University, having served there since \n1958. He remains the university's chancellor.\n  A Rotarian since 1947, Dr. Wright is a member and past president of \nthe Rotary Club of Birmingham. He has served Rotary International as \ndistrict governor, International assembly instructor, committee member \nand chairman, and director. He has received the Citation for \nMeritorious Service and the Distinguished Service Award from the Rotary \nfoundation for his support of its international humanitarian and \neducational programs. He was appointed a charter member of the Alabama \nState Ethics Commission in 1973, serving a total of 6 years. He was \ntwice chairman of the commission.\n  Perhaps more than anyone else, Dr. Wright led the way in the drive to \neradicate polio. I can think of no one more deserving of this honor and \npraise that was recently bestowed by his fellow Rotarians in \nBirmingham.\n  I applaud his vision and congratulate him on his many achievements.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1732-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           THE UAB COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER VACCINE TRIALS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, as we know, a vaccine against cancer is \none of the most eagerly sought objectives of medical science. \nPreclinical studies and patient trials of several potential vaccines \nare under way in the United States and Europe.\n  At the University of Alabama at Birmingham's [UAB] Comprehensive \nCancer Center, at least four cancer vaccine strategies are being \ndeveloped. Two of these approaches are now in clinical trials open to \npatients. The other two are in development in preclinical animal \nstudies.\n  In 1993, the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and the UAB Cancer \nCenter entered into a cooperative agreement which provided the center \nwith $1.5 million in support over 5 years to conduct a series of cancer \nvaccine trials.\n  The UAB Cancer Center is one of 27 such centers in the Nation that \nmeets the high standards for comprehensive designation by the NCI, and \nit was one of the first eight so designated in 1973. Now in its 23d \nyear of core grant support by the NCI, the UAB center was renewed this \nyear for core funding over the next 5 years in the range of $27 \nmillion. After meticulous review, the NCI also gave the center its \nhighest priority rating based on program excellence.\n  The trials currently under way at UAB include those for breast \ncancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. The traditional concept of \nvaccination is to protect against future exposure to disease. Through \nwork such as that being done at UAB, this concept is now being extended \nto include therapeutic applications to stimulate the immune system to \nkill tumor cells or infections like AIDS that already are established \nin the body.\n  I want to commend and congratulate the outstanding physicians and \nscientists at UAB who are working so hard to make the hope of a cancer \nvaccine a reality. I ask unanimous consent that an article detailing \nthe colon cancer vaccine trials from the Birmingham Post-Herald be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n                 New Vaccine Used To Fight Colon Cancer\n\n                            (By John Staed)\n\n       Birmingham scientists successfully used a vaccine to get \n     the body's immune system to fight colon cancer cells, marking \n     the first time in the world the therapy has worked on human \n     patients.\n       The University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers also \n     reported plans to test a genetic vaccine for breast cancer in \n     women. The vaccine causes the immune system to recognize and \n     attack breast cancer tumor cells.\n       Until now, vaccines have normally been used to prevent \n     diseases such as polio or mumps. This new approach by \n     scientists enhances the body's immune system responses to \n     existing diseases, said Dr. Albert LoBuglio, director of the \n     UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center. LoBuglio spoke yesterday \n     during a briefing on developments at the center and UAB's new \n     Vaccine Center.\n       Among its projects, the vaccine center is examining ways to \n     develop immunizations for bugs that cause pneumonia, to \n     introduce vaccine doses in foods to lower immunization costs, \n     and to find new vaccines for infectious diseases that are \n     increasingly resistant to modern antibiotics.\n       In the colon cancer research, four patients who had colon \n     cancer tumors surgically removed but who had a 60 percent \n     chance of recurrence were treated over 16 weeks with the new \n     vaccine.\n       ``Two of the four have developed substantial immune \n     responses,'' LoBuglio said. ``We're hoping it translates into \n     an anti-tumor effect.''\n       Colon cancer, or cancer of the large bowel and rectum, is \n     expected to be diagnosed in 149,000 people this year in the \n     United States. Together, the cancers of the colon and rectum \n     are second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths.\n       About half of the colon cancers are cured by traditional \n     treatments. The genetic treatments came after patients had \n     gone through surgery alone or chemotherapy and surgery.\n       Dr. Robert Conry, co-investigator with LoBuglio, said if \n     the vaccine proved successful through expanded studies, it \n     might be available for clinical use after five years. But, he \n     said, many more safety and reliability studies are needed.\n       Scientists' expanding knowledge of the body's immune system \n     has been critical in development of the new treatments, Conry \n     said. This information ``is allowing us to, in a more \n     informed way, develop vaccines for infectious disease as well \n     as tumors,'' he said.\n       The vaccines could help doctors ``harness the potential of \n     the immune system'' to treat cancers, Conry said. ``Since \n     these vaccines have little or no side effects, it will \n     provide a welcome alternative to chemotherapy, which has \n     significant side effects.''\n       Cancer develops from the uncontrolled growth of cells \n     within the body. Normally, the body's immune system would \n     destroy disease, but cancer, because it developed from the \n     body's own cells, goes undetected.\n       To trick the immune system into attacking the colon cancer \n     cells, scientists enlisted the help of the virus used to \n     eliminate smallpox, the vacinia virus, and a protein called \n     carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).\n       Scientists found a way to use insect cells to safely \n     produce the CEA protein.\n       The smallpox vaccine with the CEA protein genetically added \n     to it triggers an immune response to malignant cells. The \n     scientists' goal is to prevent recurrence of colon cancer by \n     destroying remaining cancer cell ``floaters'' that are left \n     circulating in the body after surgery.\n       In the breast cancer research, scientists will be using a \n     genetically engineered vaccine to both produce an immune \n     response to breast cancer cells and eradicate cancer cells.\n       One woman has been selected to soon begin the anti-tumor \n     vaccine pilot study, and cancer center officials hope to \n     include 30 women in the trial.\n       The women must have breast cancer that has spread, but that \n     is responding to hormonal treatments, said Janis Zeanah, a \n     spokeswoman for the cancer center.\n       Women will be injected with a vaccine containing the CEA \n     protein. Scientists hope that it will cause the immune system \n     to respond the same way as it has in the colon cancer test \n     and destroy the cancerous cells.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1732-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1732-S1733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MEXICAN LOAN GUARANTEE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the New York Times report this morning \nabout the American job losses that may result from Mexico's currency \ncrisis is sobering.\n  The loss of jobs as the economy of Mexico responds to the peso \ndevaluation is a price that will be paid by American workers and their \nfamilies. The past 2 years of strong export sales to Mexico have helped \ncreate about 770,000 American jobs directly tied to that export market. \nWhen that market \n[[Page S1733]] collapses, those jobs are placed in jeopardy.\n  That is why we should recognize that the proposed loan guarantee to \naddress Mexico's economic situation is in our national interest. The \nloan guarantee has been called a bailout and worse, but those who like \nto throw such terms around don't take into account that real working \npeople's jobs are also at stake.\n  The loan guarantee is not a foreign aid package.\n  It is structured to avoid placing Government funds at risk. Mexico \nwould be required to pay loan guarantee fees up front--before the \nguarantee took effect and before loans would be extended. Those fees \nwould indemnify American taxpayers in exchange for Mexico's right to \nuse our guarantee.\n  In addition, Mexico would provide security in the form of proceeds \nfrom the state-owned petroleum company, guaranteeing that America would \nbe repaid if the loan guarantees were ever activated.\n  As a result, the extension of loan guarantees would not implicate any \nTreasury costs in taxpayer dollars. And the risk of exposing tax \ndollars to possible future loss would be protected by our access to \nMexico's export oil earnings.\n  Even today, the Mexican economy is fundamentally sound. It will \nrebound and grow. The question for Americans to consider is how long \nthe rebound will take and what potential depths of turmoil the country \nis likely to encounter in the meantime.\n  Both those questions matter to Americans because turmoil and \njoblessness in Mexico will inevitably lead to even greater pressures on \nour southern border, as people search for a way to earn a living and \nfeed their families.\n  How long it will take for a Mexican economic recovery matters very \nmuch to workers whose products are sold in the Mexican market. They are \nthe Americans whose jobs are at risk today, particularly in the \nsouthern border States.\n  Not only are States like Texas, Arizona, and California the ones to \nwhich illegal entrants are first drawn, these are also the States with \nsome of the highest export sales to Mexico.\n  California sells $5 billion worth of products to Mexico each year. \nNearly 20 percent of Arizona's export sales are made in Mexico. Texas \nrelies on the Mexican market for more than one-third of all its \noverseas sales--$13 billion per year.\n  So, while the jobs of American workers will be placed at risk because \nof the collapse of the Mexican market for their goods, those border \nStates will also face the pressures of increased illegal entrants.\n  But the job and income losses will not be limited to the southern \nborder States. States all over the country sell products to Mexico, and \nresidents of practically every State are employed in the process. Even \nSouth Dakota, which is one of the Nation's smaller States in terms of \npopulation, had sales of $4 million per year to the Mexican market.\n  I know $4 million doesn't sound like much compared to $13 billion \nfrom Texas, but, in a small State, we take our millions very seriously.\n  Changes in traditional export relationships are occurring very \nquickly in today's new global marketplace. Our premier trading partners \nare Canada and Japan. However, last year our sales to Mexico \npractically equalled our sales to Japan.\n  More American exports mean more American jobs. Export-related jobs \nare relatively high-wage jobs, typically paying between 10 and 20 \npercent more than the average American job. So, export jobs are among \nthe most desirable in the economy. When they're placed at risk, more \nincome is jeopardized, and a replacement job at a similar income is \nharder to find.\n  The growth of our Mexican exports to a total of $41 billion in 1993 \nis estimated to have reached more than 10 percent in 1994. In all, \nsince 1987, American sales to Mexico have almost doubled. It's not \nsurprising that private economic forecasters are predicting the \npotential for significantly large American job losses if this market is \nallowed to crumble.\n  We cannot change what has already happened. The peso devaluation that \ncaused the temporary economic reaction in Mexico is a fact of history. \nBut we can help determine how severe its fallout will be for Americans \nby the speed and firmness with which we act now.\n  This should not be an opportunity for partisan posturing. We are not \ntalking about the loss of Republican jobs or Democratic jobs. We are \ntalking about the loss of American jobs. Those workers ought to be able \nto rely on their Congress to set partisanship aside when their \nlivelihood is at stake.\n  The former President of the United States, President Bush, on January \n19, agreed that it is vital for Congress to move promptly on the loan \nguarantee package.\n  President Bush stated,\n\n       The plan is not a giveaway. * * * In my view, the \n     guarantees will never have to be called.\n\n  On January 18, President Clinton said,\n\n       The guarantees we will provide are not foreign aid. They \n     are not a gift. They are not a bailout. They are not U.S. \n     Government loans. And they will not affect our current budget \n     deficit. * * * no guarantees will be issued unless we are \n     satisfied that Mexico can provide assured means of repayment.\n\n  Both Presidents are right. The plan is not a giveaway. It is the loan \nof a hose to a neighbor whose house is on fire. We're not proposing to \nbuild a fire station and equip it. We're just passing the hose across \nthe fence.\n  I hope the Congress can agree to set aside partisan bickering and do \nthe right thing now. It's never easy to stand up and vote for something \nwhen the polls indicate that people may not understand it, or might \ndraw the wrong conclusions.\n  But it is the task of leaders to lead. This is the right thing to \ndo--not just for our neighbor and trading partner to the south, but for \nAmerica. I hope my colleagues in the Senate--on both sides of the \naisle--will work with the administration to approve the proposed loan \nguarantee legislation as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1732-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1733-S1734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PATH TO A BUDGET PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there will be much discussion about what \nwill be in the budget package this year. The President will present his \nlist of program terminations, reforms, and money saving proposals. The \nCongress working with Governors, State and local officials, and many \nothers will start work on a fiscal blueprint for the country's future. \nAnd newspapers every day for the next few weeks will be filled with \nstories about various money saving ideas that are under consideration.\n  I want to describe the decision-making process that will be going on \nover the next few months. I also want to tell you why these budget \nproposals are under consideration in the first place, and how they fit \ninto the bigger picture--the future prosperity of our country. Most \nimportant, keep in mind that these are only preliminary proposals and \nfinal decisions won't be made until a great deal of fact finding has \nbeen done.\n  The United States currently has $4.8 trillion in outstanding debt. \nJust paying the interest on the debt takes 14 cents out of every dollar \nAmericans are paying in Federal income taxes. Every man, woman, and \nchild's share of the national debt is more than $18,000. Current \nestimates show our annual deficit increasing every year, growing from \n$175 billion this year to over $250 billion in the year 2000. We are \nmortgaging our children's and grandchildren's future.\n  This premise was eloquently stated by Laurence Tribe\n   of Harvard Law School:\n\n       Given the centrality in our revolutionary origins of the \n     precept that there should be no taxation without \n     representation, it seems especially fitting in principle that \n     we cannot spend our children's legacy.\n\n  Deficit spending and adding to the national debt cannot go on. \nGovernments are no different than families. We all know friends who \nhave let their personal finances get out of hand. Some of us have \nexperienced it ourselves. At some point the out-of-control spending \ncatches up and the credit cards have to be cut up or the family goes \nbankrupt.\n  When governments let their deficit spending get out of control, \ncitizens suffer. The economy produces fewer and lower paying jobs. This \nrelationship between our Nation's spending \n[[Page S1734]] habits and their impact on our economy's ability to \ncreate good jobs gives every American an important stake in putting our \nfiscal house in order.\n  To achieve this goal, every Federal program and expenditure, except \nSocial Security, is being evaluated in a bottom-up and top-down review. \nDuring the next few months Congress will be considering how to best \nreduce the size of the Federal Government and implement fiscal policies \nthat will create a strong economy and good jobs. There are hundreds of \nproposals that are under consideration. Some are sound, others less so. \nSome are fair, others are not.\n  One of the best fiscal policies for a prosperous future is a balanced \nbudget. A balanced budget constitutional amendment requires the Federal \nGovernment to spend $1.1 trillion less than it is currently projected \nto spend over the next 7 years, and yet total Federal spending will \nstill increase every year. In the year 2002--if we reach balance--the \nFederal Government will expend $1.9 trillion; this year the Federal \nGovernment will expend $1.5 trillion.\n  Part of the task is to establish the appropriate metes and bounds of \nthe Federal Government. We need to determine how and on what programs \nthe Government in Washington should be spending our taxpayers' money. \nThere will be a philosophical discussion about the role of the Federal \nGovernment in our daily lives. Important questions will be answered. \nHow can taxpayer dollars best and most efficiently be spent? How can we \nmake programs work better and save money? Are there better ways to \nprovide Government services? Are there lessons Congress could learn \nfrom State and local governments? Could the private sector do a better \njob in providing those services that are not quintessential government \nfunctions?\n  There is a feeling that the Government in Washington has been trying \nto micromanage everyone's lives. And while the Federal Government has \nbeen attempting to run everyone else's business, there is a sense that \nno one has been adequately managing the Government in Washington. \nReversing this trend is part of putting our fiscal house in order by \ndeveloping this year's budget plan.\n  It would be more consistent with our Founding Fathers' vision of a \nlimited Federal Government with enumerated powers if the Federal \nGovernment did less.\n  Our country would be a better country if some services were provided \nby the State and local governments instead of the Federal Government. I \nbelieve the Federal Government should enter into a new partnership with \nthe States so that the Federal Government imposes fewer strings, fewer \nrules, and fewer regulations. In addition to achieving more sensible \nGovernment, this new Federal-State and local government partnership \ncould provide the same level of service with fewer taxpayers' dollars. \nIf the strings attached to Federal funding were cut, fewer Federal \ndollars would be needed to do the same job and\n fewer taxes being paid by hard working families. This is a win-win-win \nsolution.\n\n  In New Mexico, the Governor and I are eager to forge this new \npartnership so that government, at all levels, sets the right \npriorities.\n  We already know what some of the priorities are; improving crime \nprevention, detection, and prosecution; preserving the national \nlaboratories; and, making sure New Mexico's military bases maximize \ntheir contribution to our national defense.\n  If the future means lower taxes and less Washington-dictated \nGovernment, this evaluation needs to take place. This is what will be \ngoing on in the Senate Budget Committee.\n  On the first day of the new Congress, the Senate cut the size of \ncongressional committee budgets by 15 percent. We are going to lead by \nexample. We are also going to proceed with caution and compassion. I \nwant you to know that throughout this process, it is my intention for \neveryone to be treated fairly. In making the Federal Government more \nresponsive to its citizens, we must keep in mind the neediest among us. \nWe are a great nation founded on the notion of equal opportunity. \nUnfortunately, too many of our programs create unintended dependency \ntraps. Part of this Congress' work program is to provide more \nintelligent programs that provide choices and restore opportunity.\n  I hope the budget we produce will reflect the priorities of the \nAmerican people, forge a new partnership with the States, meet the \nrequirements of the balanced budget constitutional amendment, and most \nimportant, put into law responsible fiscal policies that will let the \neconomy create good paying jobs and a brighter future for our children \nand grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1733-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? YOU BE THE JUDGE OF THAT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is a \nlot like television's well-known energizer bunny--it keeps going and \ngoing--at the expense, of course, of the American taxpayer.\n  A lot of politicians talk a good game, when they are back home, about \nbringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But so \nmany of these same politicians regularly voted in support of bloated \nspending bills during the 103d Congress--which perhaps is a primary \nfactor in the new configuration of U.S. Senators.\n  This is a rather distressing fact as the 104th Congress gets down to \nbusiness. As of Friday, January 27, 1995, the Federal debt stood--down \nto the penny--at exactly $4,805,320,933,038.83 or $18,241.08 per \nperson.\n  Mr. President, it is important that all of us monitor, closely and \nconstantly the incredible cost of merely paying the interest on this \ndebt. Last year, the interest on the Federal debt totaled $190 billion.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that the 104th Congress can bring under \ncontrol the outrageous spending that created this outrageous debt. If \nthe party now controlling both Houses of Congress, as a result of the \nNovember elections last year, does not do a better job of getting a \nhandle on this enormous debt, the American people are not likely to \noverlook it in 1996.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1734-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE LATE LORNA SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate is a place of great \ncamaraderie and congeniality, and over the past four decades, I have \nbeen fortunate to have made a number of very good friends here. \nRegrettably, I rise today to memorialize one of them, Mrs. Lorna \nSimpson.\n  Lorna is known to all of us as the mother of our colleague, Senator \nAl Simpson, the dedicated and gregarious senior Senator from Wyoming. \nWhile most Members probably had the opportunity to meet this kind and \nwarm woman, few are fortunate to have known her as well as I.\n  I first came to know Lorna in 1962 when her husband was elected to \nthe U.S. Senate and he moved into an office near mine. The Simpsons \nquickly became my close friends and I very much enjoyed spending time \nwith Al and Lorna.\n  While Lorna was a consummate entertainer, she was a woman who was \ncivically active and took a strong role in supporting her husband's \nbusiness enterprises. Every community in which the Simpsons lived \nbenefited from the efforts of Lorna as she contributed her time and \nefforts to numerous causes including the Red Cross and programs that \nrestored various historic sites. During World War II, Lorna contributed \nto the war effort by chairing Cody Wyoming's black and scrap metal \ncommittees and even served as the acting editor of the local paper. \nAmong her many other activities in the subsequent years, she assisted \nher husband in negotiations with the Israeli Government concerning gas \nand oil exploration in that country, and later she served as the \nrepresentative of the women of the United States to the Organization of \nAmerican States.\n  Mr. President, I know everyone will agree with me that Lorna Simpson \nwas a unique woman and a lady in every respect. She possessed high \nideals, a lovely character, a friendly personality and all the good \nqualities that signify the perfect lady. She was a woman who was \ndevoted to her husband and family and she added much to the lives of \nthose whom she touched. Senator Al Simpson and his lovely wife Ann have \nmy deepest sympathies and they, along with Al's brother Peter and the \nentire Simpson family, are in my thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1734-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n               [[Page S1735]] BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget, House \nConcurrent Resolution 218, show that current level spending is below \nthe budget resolution by $2.3 billion in budget authority and $0.4 \nbillion in outlays. Current level is $0.8 billion over the revenue \nfloor in 1995 and below by $8.2 billion over the 5 years 1995-99. The \ncurrent estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum \ndeficit amount is $238.7 billion, $2.3 billion below the maximum \ndeficit amount for 1995 of $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated January 17, 1995, there has been no \naction that affects the current level of budget authority, outlays, or \nrevenues.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise to solemnize the 50th anniversary \nlast Friday of the liberation of Auschwitz, the concentration camp \nwhere nearly 1\\1/2\\ million innocents were exter- minated by \nthe Nazi regime, most of them for the simple reason that they were \nJews.\n  The Nazi Holocaust represents one of the blackest eras of the 20th \ncentury, a time which casts a shadow across the landscape of the entire \nsecond half of this century.\n  I quote Paul Johnson, one of our eminent living historians, from one \nof his many great books, ``A History of the Jews'':\n\n       Hitler had wiped out a third of all Jews, especially the \n     pious and the poor, from whom Judaism had drawn its peculiar \n     strength. The loss could be seen in secular terms. In the \n     nineteenth century and early twentieth century the world had \n     been immeasurably enriched by the liberated talent streaming \n     out of the old ghettos, which had proved a principal creative \n     force in modern European and North American civilization. The \n     supply continued until Hitler destroyed the source forever. \n     No one will ever know what the world thereby sacrificed. For \n     Israel the deprivation was devastating. It was felt at a \n     personal level, for so many of its citizens had lost \n     virtually all their families and childhood friends, and it \n     was felt collectively: one in three of those who might have \n     built the state was not there. It was felt spiritually \n     perhaps most of all.\n\n  ``No one will ever know what the world sacrificed.'' We will always \nlive with that absence; we will always live with the darkness of what \nwas lost.\n  Churchill called it ``the crime without a name.'' Last Friday at the \nceremonies in Poland, Lech Walesa spoke of ``the martyrdom of all \nnations, especially the Jewish Nation.'' And in Germany Helmut Kohl \nsaid it was ``the darkest and most terrible chapter in German \nhistory.'' They were all correct.\n  Civilized men and women are fortunate today that the lands where the \nHolocaust occurred are free. But the truly free societies must bear \nburdens, and a burden of freedom is to examine one's past--for the \npurpose of recognizing the most brutal of realities; for the purpose, \nperhaps, of understanding; but most\n importantly, for the purpose of never forgetting. I submit that \nnations are never completely free until they have the ability, will, \nand courage to examine their pasts free of censorship, free of cant, \nfree of willful neglect.\n\n  The Holocaust Museum in Washington provides a somber, moving ,and \ndramatic memorial to man's most evil capabilities, and it draws \nthousands to pay homage to the millions of victims of genocide. There \nis strength in a society that can bear such witness.\n  Fifty years later, we still live in the shadow of the Holocaust, and \nindeed, until we can say that all men will respond instinctively and \ncourageously with the highest outrage against genocide, we can never \nstray far from this darkness.\n  Last week we commemorated the liberation of Auschwitz. In the same \nweek, 19 Israeli men were killed in a terrorist attack by one of the \nextremist groups dedicated to the destruction of Israel. In the same \nweek, more intelligence reports surfaced about Iran's nerve gas \nproduction, which, combined with its current ballistic missile \ncapabilities, puts it in a position to threaten Israel with gas \nattacks.\n  Again, I will quote Paul Johnson:\n\n       The overwhelming lesson the Jews learned from the Holocaust \n     was the imperative need to secure for themselves a permanent, \n     self-contained and above all sovereign refuge where if \n     necessary the whole of world Jewry could find safety from its \n     enemies. The First World War made the Zionist state possible. \n     The Second World War made it essential.\n\n  [[Page S1736]] It is a bitter realization to know that 50 years after \nthe Nazi Holocaust, the Jewish State remains under attack; anti-\nSemitism is growing in certain parts of the world, as in Russia; \ngenocide is practiced and ignored, as in Rwanda and, on the European \nContinent drenched in Jewish blood, in Bosnia.\n  The Nazi Holocaust demonstrated a human depravity that many refused \nto believe was possible. We must never forget that men are capable of \nthe most heinous destruction of their fellow men. The name of Auschwitz \nshould forever echo in the memories and consciences of civilized people \nas one of the pinnacles of evil achieved in the 20th century. For it \nwas in Auschwitz and the other concentration camps of the Nazi era that \ngenocide was practiced as a tool of nationalism. And if we ever choose \nto ignore the shadows of such a loss, of such a despicable past, we do \nso at the risk of blindly allowing it to happen again.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1735-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are happy at this point to have Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, the Hatch-Simon balanced budget constitutional \namendment brought up. It is in the form of the House-passed amendment \nwhich is absolutely identical to the amendment that the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois and I and Members of the House, including Charles \nStenholm, from Texas, and, at that time, Larry Craig back in the early \ndays over in the House, who is now one of the leaders on the Senate \nfloor, have been working on for years, ever since the 1982 balanced \nbudget fight.\n  When I was chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, we brought it \nto the floor and then to the leadership of Senator Thurmond, Senator \nDole, and Senator Baker at that time. We were able to pass it through \nthe Senate.\n  This is slightly changed from then, but the basic principles are the \nsame. Basically, there are three things that the general public needs \nto know are very worthy reasons for passing this balanced budget \namendment that is now in the form of the House resolution that was \npassed by 300 votes to 132 last Thursday evening.\n  No. 1 is that if this amendment is passed by the requisite two-thirds \nvote of the Senate and is ratified by the requisite three-quarters of \nthe States, then from that point on, it will take three-fifths of both \nbodies in order to increase the deficit.\n  That is a supermajority vote, and the reason we have done that on the \ndeficit is because the deficit is going out of control and we would \nhave to have a supermajority vote in order to have real considerations \nas to whether or not we want to continue to expand the deficit.\n  So, No. 1, you would have to have a three-fifths vote if you want to \nincrease deficit spending. No. 2, if you want to increase taxes to pay \nfor the costs of Government, then you no longer can do it by a simple \nmajority vote.\n  Some of the media in this country have had the idea that this \namendment just has a simple majority vote. It is not true. It has what \nis called--and we put it into the 1982 amendment that passed the Senate \nby 60 percent but died in the House, then led by Tip O'Neill; he beat \nus over there--but we came up with the idea of a constitutional \nmajority requisite vote in order to increase taxes.\n  Let me just explain that a little bit more. If this amendment becomes \nthe 28th amendment to the Constitution, then in order to increase \ntaxes, you are going to have to have 51 percent--a majority of the \nwhole body of both the House and the Senate. So to put that in \nperspective, we could pass anything in this body as a general rule by a \nmajority vote if we have a quorum of 51 Senators. We can pass anything \nby a vote of 26 to 25, if that is how close it was.\n  Under a constitutional majority, we cannot increase taxes without, \nNo. 1, a vote and, No. 2, without getting at least, no less, than 51 \nU.S. Senators to vote for it and in the House at least no less than 218 \nMembers of the House.\n  So those are two very important reasons for voting for this: No. 1, \nin order to increase the deficit, this amendment says you are going to \nhave to have a three-fifths vote of both bodies, the Senate and the \nHouse. No. 2, if you want to increase taxes, you are going to have to \nhave a constitutional majority to do so. And No. 3, you have to vote.\n  Right now, many times when we increase the deficit in this country, \nwe do not vote at all. We just have a voice vote. Nobody knows who are \nthe people that have put us into debt or put us into further debt. From \nhere on in, in both cases, that of increasing the debt or increasing \ntaxes, we are going to have to have rollcall votes. Those are the three \npivotal and most important aspects of this amendment.\n  Let me just put it in further perspective, with regard to the \nconstitutional majority necessary to raise taxes. If the President's \nfiscal stimulus bill had come up, as it came up last year, was passed \nthe way it was, the Senate was equally divided 50-50. There were 50 who \nvoted for it and 50 who voted against it. It took the Vice President to \nbreak the tie, and it passed 51 to 50.\n  If this amendment passes, my contention is it will take at least 51 \nSenators, regardless of the way the Vice President votes, in order to \nincrease taxes.\n  So it will not be easy to increase taxes, although we have had many \nvotes in the history of this body where we have had 51 votes for taxes.\n  I believe it will become the focal point from that point on. I \nbelieve the three-fifths vote will become the focal point on increasing \nthe deficit.\n  Why are we even talking about a balanced budget amendment? I have \ntalked to many of my constituents and there was more than one person \nwho came to me and who said: ``What kind of a legacy are we leaving to \nour children? How can I and my generation continue to spend us into \nbankruptcy and leave our children high and dry?''\n  I have had a number of people on Social Security all over my State \ncome to me and say, ``Look, Senator, if you don't get spending under \ncontrol, our Social Security isn't going to be worth anything. We won't \nbe able to survive because that is all we have to live on.''\n  If we do not get spending under control, they say, they are going to \nnot get many benefits out of Social Security.\n  These people put the correct issue first: Are we going to live within \nour means so that our dollar is worth something, so that we do not \nultimately have to monetize the debt, devalue the dollar, and make even \nSocial Security less worthwhile for people? And they are the first to \nadmit that we need a balanced budget constitutional amendment to make \nit necessary for Congress to choose among competing programs.\n  I have had people in the military say, ``What are we going to do? \nMilitary spending keeps going down.'' If we start getting into a range \nof inflation, because interest against the national debt is now over \n$300 billion a year and going up exponentially and will be over $400 \nbillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, after the first \nof the year, how are we going to keep our country safe and clear? And \nthat is based on current interest rates. Will inflation not go up even \nmore?\n The answer to that is probably so.\n\n  They said to me, as much as we want the military to be strong and our \nNation to be secure, you are going to have to pass the balanced budget \namendment.\n  The average person out there understands this. They do not get all \ncaught up in the special interest concerns of the day. People who think \nclearly \n[[Page S1737]] know that we have to do something about this profligate \nFederal spending.\n  So I rise today with a very strong feeling that this is one of the \nmost important debates in this country's history that has ever taken \nplace in the Senate.\n  The subject matter goes to the heart of our Founding Fathers' hope \nfor our constitutional system, a system that has and will protect \nindividual freedoms to the maxim of limited Government.\n  In the latter half of this century, however, the intention of the \nFramers of the Constitution has been betrayed by Congress' inability to \ncontrol its own spending habits. The size of the Federal leviathan has \ngrown to such an extent that the very liberties of our American people \nare threatened.\n  History has already been made in the House of Representatives; 300 of \nour courageous colleagues in the House, both Democrats and Republicans, \napproved this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which \nparallels word for word Senate Joint Resolution 1, the Hatch-Simon-\nThurmond-Heflin-Craig balanced budget amendment, under the leadership \nof the distinguished majority leader, Robert Dole.\n  The eyes of the people, 85 percent of whom favor a balanced budget \namendment, now turn to us in the Senate. They know this is the \nbattleground. They know this is where the real battle is going to \noccur. We need to follow the example of the House and pass this \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  This amendment has broad support in the country, and among Democrats \nand Republicans who believe we need to get this Nation's fiscal house \nin order so that we can leave a legacy of strong national economy and a \nresponsible national Government to our children and our grandchildren.\n\n\n                 The Problem: The Worsening Debt Crisis\n\n  We have a tremendous debt problem, and it is worsening. Mr. \nPresident, our Nation is faced with a $4.8 trillion national debt that \ngets worse and worse every year that we run a budget deficit. The \nGovernment is using capital that would otherwise be available to the \nprivate sector to create jobs and to invest in our future. Increased \namounts of capital are being wasted on merely financing the debt \nbecause of spiraling interest costs. This problem presents risks to our \nlong-term economic growth and endangers the well-being of our elderly, \nour working people, and especially our children and grandchildren. The \ndebt burden is a mortgage on our children and grandchildren's future.\n  The trend is clear and uninterrupted. The magnitude of the annual \ndeficits has increased enormously and continues to do so. During the \n1960's, deficits averaged $6 billion per year. In the 1970's, the \ndeficits averaged $38 billion per year. In the 1980's, the deficits \naveraged $156 billion per year, and in the 1990's so far deficits have \naveraged $259 billion per year.\n  The total national debt now stands at almost $5 trillion. That means \nthat every man, woman and child in America has an individual debt \nburden of $18,500. We each owe that much money. Well, it took us over \n200 years to acquire our first trillion dollars of debt, 200 years of \nhistory before we got to $1 trillion. We have recently been adding \nanother trillion dollars of debt about every 5 years and will continue \nto do so under current projections at a slightly faster rate as we \napproach the end of the decade--$18,500 each of us owes. Back in 1975, \nwe thought it was outrageous that we each owed $2,500.\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1976, it was a little higher than \n$2,500, and we just thought that was unbelievable. Here it is $18,500, \ncaused by both parties, caused by Presidents, whether Republican or \nDemocrat, caused by a profligate Congress mainly that has not been \nwilling to get spending under control.\n  Well, it comes as no surprise that these increases in our national \ndebt are mirrored by increases in Federal spending. The first $100 \nbillion budget in the history of our Nation occurred as recently as \nfiscal year 1962. It took us until then to spend the first $100 billion \na year. That was more than 179 years after the founding of the \nRepublic.\n  The first $200 billion budget, however, followed only 9 years later \nin fiscal year 1971. The first $300 billion budget occurred only 4 \nyears later in fiscal year 1975, the first $400 billion budget 2 years \nlater in fiscal 1977, the first $500 billion budget in fiscal year \n1981, the first $700 billion budget in fiscal 1982, $800 billion in \n1983, $900 billion in 1985, and the first $1 trillion budget in fiscal \nyear 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1995 has been projected to exceed \n$1.5 trillion.\n  And yet, Mr. President, opponents of the balanced budget amendment \nclaim there is no problem. They repeatedly point to the marginal \nslowdown in the growth of the debt last year as though all of our \nproblems are solved. They say that President Clinton has dealt with \nthis problem.\n  But they are dead wrong. Only inside the beltway can people claim \nthat with a debt approaching $5 trillion we are on the right track. \nEveryone on Capitol Hill knows that starting in 1996, President \nClinton's budget leads us on a path of steadily increasing deficits, \nbeyond anything that we have ever seen before. The simple fact is that \nwith every additional dollar we borrow, we throw more coal into the \nfire of the runaway train on which we are all riding.\n\n\n                   Interest On The Debt: A Time Bomb\n\n  Mr. President, one of the most pernicious effects of the enormous \ndeficit beast is the interest costs required to feed it. Interest on \nthe national debt in 1993, the last year for which we have a full \nactual set of budget figures, amounted to nearly $293 billion.\n  Now, that is more than the total revenues to the Federal Government \nwere back in 1975--just interest against the debt. In 1993, interest \ntook 26 percent of all Federal revenues and 57 percent of all \nindividual income tax revenues.\n  The Office of Management and Budget projected last year that interest \non the debt will rise substantially over the next 5 years. It is now \ngoing up exponentially. OMB projected that interest costs will pass the \n$300 billion mark in 1995 and reach $373 billion in 1999.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment suggest that we cannot \nafford to cut the deficit because decreased social spending will have \nsevere adverse effects on our economy. But think of how much we could \ndo in crime control, disaster relief, health, science and education if \nwe had that $300 billion available that we are spending on interest \neach year.\n  I do not understand the logic of continuing to waste over 20 percent \nof our entire budget on interest on the rationale that we cannot afford \nto cut spending. What we cannot afford to do is to continue to throw \naway one-fifth of our national budget on interest payments.\n  Now, my colleagues, to put this in even better perspective, gross \ninterest on the debt in 1993 amounted to more than the entire defense \nbudget, which was $292.4 billion. It was 97 percent of Social Security \npayments, which were $302 billion--it will probably be more than Social \nSecurity this year--55 percent of all discretionary outlays, which were \n$542.5 billion; and 44 percent of all mandatory programs, which \namounted to $666.9 billion.\n  The nearly $293 billion of gross interest costs in 1993 could have \ncovered our entire health spending, including Medicare and Medicaid, \n$207.6 billion; all veterans' benefits and services, $19.3 billion; \nunemployment compensation, $35.5 billion; our entire international \ndiscretionary spending, $21.6 billion; and also covered the costs of \nthe earned income tax credit, $8.8 billion. All of that could have been \npaid for just out of the interest on the national debt we have been \npaying.\n  Without the gross interest on the debt, we would not have even had a \ndeficit last year; in fact, we would have run a budget surplus of $93 \nbillion.\n  Interest on the debt is wasted money. Over the 5 years of so-called \ndeficit reduction under President Clinton's plan, OMB's own calculation \nlast year was that interest on the public debt will total roughly $1.7 \ntrillion. This amount could have fully funded the entire 1994 budget, \nwith money left over.\n  Interest compounds and gets larger by itself, even without new \ndeficits. And, if interest rates go back up, the problem will be \nincreased exponentially. Self-propelled interest costs will continue to \neat a larger share of our national treasury, destroying our choices to \nfund new programs and eroding our ability to keep the commitments we \nhave already made.\n  [[Page S1738]] You can see how interest on the Federal debt through \nthe year 2005 from 1994, which is a little less than $300 billion, will \ngo up because of the exponential increase of compounded interest. Look \nat how it just shoots up in the air until, in 2005 it is somewhere over \n$520 billion. It is really a problem. And we have to face it. The only \nway I know to face it is to enact this balanced budget amendment. I do \nnot know of anybody who has a better idea.\n\n\n                     the need for a balanced budget\n\n  Mr. President, if one thing is crystal clear, it is that we need to \nmove toward a balanced budget. During this debate, both sides will cite \nlots of numbers and figures. One such figure is our current $4.8 \ntrillion national debt. But how does one communicate the implications \nof our staggering debt?\n  In 1975, before this recent borrowing spree, the Federal debt \namounted to approximately $2,500 per person, and the annual interest \ncharges were roughly $250 per taxpayer. At the present, the Federal \ndebt\n amounts to about $18,500 per person, with annual interest charges \nexceeding $2,575 per taxpayer. And that is at today's interest rates, \nwhich could go even higher.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that in 1999, total Federal \ndebt will be nearly $6.4 trillion. That means $23,700 of debt per \nperson, with annual interest costs projected to be over $3,500 per \ntaxpayer. We would each owe that much in annual costs.\n  These last figures would mean a tenfold increase in per-capita debt, \nand a nearly fourteenfold increase in annual interest charges per \ntaxpayer, since 1975.\n  Over time, the disproportionate burdens imposed on today's children \nand their children by a continuing pattern of deficits could include \nsome combination of the following: Increased taxes; reduced public \nwelfare benefits; reduced public pensions; reduced expenditures on \ninfrastructure and other public investments; diminished capital \nformation, job creation, productivity enhancement, and real wage growth \nin the private economy; higher interest rates; higher inflation; \nincreased indebtedness to and economic dependence on foreign creditors; \nand increased risk of default on the Federal debt.\n  Mr. President, this is fiscal child abuse, and it must end. We have \nto end it. We have to end it.\n  This sociopathic economic policy is continued under the Clinton so-\ncalled deficit reduction plan, which does not really reduce the deficit \nin an absolute sense and does not reduce our staggering $4.8 trillion \nnational debt one penny. It only slows the growth in the national debt; \nit does not reverse its upward climb. And, it reduces annual deficits \nonly in the sense that deficits are smaller than what were previously \nprojected. It still has substantial annual deficits which get bigger as \ntime goes on. Even OMB's estimates from last year's budget, which \npredict lower debt totals than CBO, projects that gross Federal debt \nwill top $6.3 trillion, exceeding 72 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct, by 1999. That is only 4 years away.\n  In other words, the so-called Clinton deficit reduction plan only \ncuts the deficit in the Washington sense of not going as far into the \nred as we earlier expected. I do not believe that kind of math works \noutside the beltway. As one commentator suggested, try explaining to \nyour bank after your check bounces that you saved $300 by buying a $200 \nsuit instead of a $500 television. Put another way, it is like putting \na 400-pound man on diet and claiming he lost weight when he only goes \nup to 500 pounds instead of the 600 that was contemplated.\n  What's more, even under the current plan, the Congressional Budget \nOffice's 10-year projections show that after an initial relative \nslowdown in its growth, the deficit roars back up. As I mentioned, the \ndeficit in 1994 was $203 billion. It dips to $176 billion in 1995. But \nthat is as low as it goes. Starting in 1996, it shoots up again, \ntopping $253 billion in 1999 and hitting all time highs of $351 billion \nin 2003, $383 billion in 2004, and $421 billion in 2005.\n  Think about it. That is what is happening even if we give all of the \nbenefit of the doubt to what President Clinton has tried to do. And he \nhas tried.\n  A milestone of sorts will be passed in 2004 when we will rack up over \n$1 billion in debt every day. Personally, I do not think that this is a \nmilestone any one of us should be too proud of.\n  That means the Clinton deficit reduction plan will add over $1 \ntrillion to the national debt in the next 5 years and over $2.7 \ntrillion in the next 10 years.\n  Look, who is to blame for this? Why, we all are, every last one of \nus. If I had to lay real blame why it be on the Congress more than any \nother group, because this is where the money bills originate. This is \nwhere the decisions are made. This is where we have allowed \nentitlements to run out of control.\n  I do not particularly blame any of the Presidents and I certainly am \nnot blaming President Clinton who is trying his best within the \nframework of his political philosophy to do his best. I do not blame \nPresident Bush or President Reagan or President Carter either. The fact \nis, a lot of the buck stops right here in Congress.\n  Really can you blame Congress, too? The polls showed that 85 percent \nof the American people were for the balanced budget amendment. They \nwant us to pass it. They believe it is critical to this country. They \nunderstand deep down. Viscerally, people know we are going to have to \ndo this kind of fiscal restraint. But when you go and ask questions on \nindividual programs, while they want us to pass a balanced budget \namendment they want us to reduce taxes and they want us to increase \nspending on special interest programs.\n  So all of us have faults in this area. How do you overcome it? It \nseems to me you overcome it by putting a fiscal restraint into the \nConstitution that was implied by the Founding Fathers but was not put \nthere. Jefferson thought it should have been in there and I think \nJefferson was right. But, really, he was wrong through most of this \ncountry's history until the 1960's. Whenever we ran a deficit it was \ngenerally during time of war or depression. The minute we got back on \ntop of things they would get the budget balanced. But in the last 30 \nyears the Congress has run us into the ground and it is very difficult, \nunless we are forced to make priority choices among competing programs. \nIt is very, very difficult to get this under control.\n\n\n                 Benefits Of A Constitutional Amendment\n\n  I might add that I think it is time for the Congress to pass this \njoint resolution, this constitutional amendment to permanently restore \nthe linkage between Federal spending and taxing decisions. My friend \nfrom Illinois, the prime sponsor of this amendment, probably believes \nthat taxes will be increased to help pay for these things. I do not. I \nthink it will be tougher to increase taxes than it will be to increase \nthe deficit. But I think both will be more difficult, and there will be \nvotes so the American people know who voted which way.\n  I probably would prefer to cut spending. We are from two opposite \npoles--the two leaders in the Senate. We care a great deal for each \nother. And I have tremendous respect for Senator Simon for being \nwilling to lead the fight. He is much more liberal than I in leading \nthis fight for a balanced budget amendment. He is doing it for the \nright reason. He believes that we will have to be more fiscally \nresponsible. I believe that. That is why we are fighting side by side \nas we have for a number of items, but certainly on this amendment. I \nrespect him for it.\n  On the proposed amendment that we have here--the House-passed \namendment, which is identical to the Senate one we have been pushing--\nwe have worked together on both sides of this Hill. We have done it for \nyears. We have massaged this thing, and worked on it. It is a true \nbipartisan consensus amendment. It is a Democrat-Republican amendment. \nIt is a Republican-Democrat amendment. We have worked together. Any one \nof us thinks we could write it better. This is the consensus amendment. \nThat is the only one that has a chance of being passed. I could write a \nmuch tougher constitutional amendment than this. So could the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois. But this is what we have been able \nto negotiate, and as you can see by the first time in history, the only \none that could pass the House of Representatives. Now we have the job \nof trying to get it through the important U.S. Senate.\n  I believe we can, if the people out there will speak to their \nSenators. But \n[[Page S1739]] it is going to be very close. There is no giving here. \nThis is something we have to earn on the floor. We are going to do \neverything we can do. But the proposed amendment that we have before us \ndoes not propose to read any specific level of spending or taxing \nforever into the Constitution, and it does not propose to insert the \nConstitution into the day-to-day spending and taxing decisions of the \nrepresentative branch of the Government. It merely proposes to create a \nfiscal environment in which the competition between the tax spenders \nand the taxpayers is a more equal one--one in which spending decisions \nwill once more be constrained by available revenues.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for a solution strong enough that it \ncannot be evaded in the short term. We need a constitutional \nrequirement to balance our budget. Mr. President, Senate Joint \nResolution 1, and the House resolution which is before us, the Dole-\nHatch-Simon consensus balanced budget amendment, is that solution. It \nis reasonable. It is enforceable, and necessary to force us to get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  There are those who oppose the balanced budget amendment because they \nsay we can balance the budget right now. As a matter of law, that is \ntrue. But as a matter of real life, real-world politics, it is clear \nthat Congress does not possess the courage to do it. They have been \nsaying this for 30 years without any avail, without any success. Even \nif one extraordinary Congress does come along and manages to stop \ndeficit spending, there would be nothing to prevent the next Congress \nfrom spending irresponsibly once again. We need a constitutional \namendment if we are truly interested in solving this problem.\n\n\n               Restoration Of The Constitutional Balance\n\n  Mr. President, the proposed constitutional amendment will help us end \nthis dangerous deficit habit in a way that past efforts have not. It \nwill do this by correcting a bias in the present political process \nwhich favors ever-increasing levels of Federal Government spending.\n  In seeking to reduce the spending bias in our present system--fueled \nlargely by the unlimited availability of deficit spending --the major \npurpose of this constitutional balanced budget amendment is to ensure \nthat, under normal circumstances, votes by Congress for increased \nspending will be accompanied either by votes to reduce other spending \nprograms or to increase taxes to pay for such programs. For the first \ntime since the abandonment of our historical norm of the balanced \nbudgets, Congress will be required to cast a politically difficult vote \nas a precondition to a politically attractive vote to increase \nspending. We will be forced to do it so the American people will know, \nand it is about time.\n\n\n                             Accountability\n\n  While it is true that much of the enormous growth in Federal \nGovernment spending over the past two decades may be a response to \nevolving notions that the role of the public sector on the part of the \nAmerican citizenry--that is, a genuine shift in the will and desire of \nthe people--it is my contention that a substantial part of this growth \nstems from far less benign factors.\n  In short, the American political process is defective insofar as it \nis skewed toward artificially high levels of spending, that is, levels \nof spending that do not result from a genuine will and desire on the \npart of the people. It is skewed in part because the people often do \nnot have complete information about the cost of programs or about the \npotential for cost growth of many programs. It is skewed in this \ndirection because Members of Congress have every political incentive to \nspend money and almost no incentive to forego such spending. It is a \nfiscal order in which spending decisions have become increasingly \ndivorced from the availability of revenues.\n  In fact, when I was on the Budget Committee I was shocked that we \nnever began with how much we had in revenues available to spend. We \nalways began with what we want to spend, and then we would massage the \nrevenues to try to get them up to where we were spending. I just \nthought it was a backward way of going toward the budget.\n  The balanced budget amendment seeks to restore Government \naccountability for spending and taxing decisions by forcing Congress to \nprioritize spending projects within the available resources and by \nrequiring tax increases to be done on the record. In this way, Congress \nwill be accountable to the people who pay for the programs and the \nAmerican people--including the future generations who must pay for our \ndebts--will be represented in a way they are not now. Congress will be \nforced to justify its spending and taxing decisions as the Framers \nintended, but as Congress no longer does.\n\n\n               the solution: a balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. President, Senate Joint Resolution 1 represents both responsible \nfiscal policy and responsible constitutional policy. Passage of this \nresolution would constitute an appropriate response by Congress to the \npending applications by nearly two-thirds of the States for a \nconstitutional convention on this issue.\n  Mr. President, the Senate must approve Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \nbalanced budget amendment. It is the right thing to do for ourselves, \nour children, and our grandchildren, and it will give us back \nresponsible and accountable constitutional government. The faithful \nstewardship of public funds that was so prized by our Founding Fathers \ncan be restored for 21st century Americans. The virtues of thrift and \naccountability can be rekindled by this very 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, we have to do something about our irresponsible debt \napproaches--the runaway spending that is eating this country alive; \ndestructive welfare which is really not doing any good for the average \ncitizen; our antisaving Tax Code that really destroys savings in this \ncountry; the Washington bureaucracy that is eating us alive by \nmandating more and more on the States and on small business. We have to \neliminate these things. We have to send Washington back home. We have \nto restore the American dream. We have to give our children a future \nthat, and if we keep going the way we are going they will not have.\n  We have to put Government on a diet. At least that is my belief. We \nhave to make the Federal Government afford to live within its means. \nFrankly, I think the Federal Government could afford to be anorexic for \na while. It is far too fat, and it needs to be brought down to a more \ndiet-conscious methodology. We have to cut the waste, cut the fat, and \nget people to work instead of depending upon the Government. And I \nthink we have to just get together as a group and call our Senators to \ntell them they need to support this; create a groundswell of force for \nthis balanced budget amendment. And, if we do, we will save our country \nfor generations to come; for your children, my children, your \ngrandchildren, my grandchildren.\n  In talking about that, I have thought very often. Elaine and I have \nsix children, and our 15th grandchild is on its way. It will be here in \nanother few months. I have to tell you, I just pity these kids and what \nthey have to face if we do not make this decision now. We can no longer \nafford to listen to those who say we should have the will to do what we \nhave to do. It just is not happening and is not going to happen. The \nwill is not there. We have not had a President who is willing to say: \nThis is what we have to do, and blame me if we cannot get it done, but \nthis is what we have to do to help put our fiscal house in order.\n  Pass this balanced budget amendment and you will find there will be a \nrenewed effort to try to get us to live within our means. Your \ngrandchildren and my grandchildren will have a future like we had when \nwe were raised.\n  When I was born in 1934, my folks had just lost their home in the \nDepression. My dad built our home out of a torn-down building. In fact, \nI thought for years afterwards that all homes should be brown like ours \nwas, with burned lumber, and that one side should have a Pillsbury \nFlour sign on it. We did not have indoor facilities, but we were happy \npeople. We raised our own chickens, eggs, and we had our own little \ngarden that kept us alive. We did not have a lot, but we were able to \nsurvive. I have to tell you that those were tough days, but I would not \ntrade them for anything.\n  My future was a sure future. There was no question that I was going \nto go to school and have the opportunity to grow. My dad taught me his \ntrade. I worked in the building construction \n[[Page S1740]] trade union for 10 years, with my bare hands, and I was \nproud of it. I could do that work today if I had to. We used to hang \nsuspended ceilings and build partitions, and other things. I did all of \nthat, and I can still do it.\n  There was no limit to our future. We were able to do it. This \nGovernment was living within its means. At least, it was just at the \nthroes of starting to not live within its means. Today you have to say, \nwith interest exponentially rising, with the debt rising so fast, in \nthe future we might have to monetize the debt and devalue the American \ndollar in order to pay off debts with worthless money--which could be \ndone, by the way, but the United States will never recover from it. We \nwould never again have the recognition financially that we have \nthroughout the world, nor would we be as powerful again, or be as great \nagain, if we have to go to that methodology--which we will do if we do \nnot pass this amendment.\n  I want the future of your children and my children, your \ngrandchildren and my grandchildren, to be secure. That is what we are \nfighting for here today. There is no question that there are many \nwonderful programs all of us would like to have. But there still is a \nnecessity to live within our means, which we are not doing.\n  Mr. President, we are going to do everything we can, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, myself, and others, and I urge \nSenators to join with us--Senators Dole, Simon, Thurmond, Heflin, \nCraig, and so many others--in supporting this resolution, the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment, this bicameral, bipartisan consensus \nbalanced budget amendment. If we do, this country will be much better \noff in 5 years, 7 years, 10 years from today, and our children will \nhave the future we would like them to have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  [Applause in the galleries]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises all in the galleries to \nrefrain from any form of approval or disapproval.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. [Kennedy] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the so-called balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. I strongly support deficit reduction \nto achieve the goal of a balanced budget. But it is unnecessary, \nunwise, and destructive of principles at the core of our constitutional \ndemocracy to adopt this proposed constitutional amendment.\n  As the Senate begins this debate, let us consider some recent \nhistory. For 12 years, during the Reagan and Bush administrations, the \ndeficit soared out of control--largely because of the excessive 1981 \ntax cut, which was described at the time by Senate Republican majority \nleader Howard Baker as a ``riverboat gamble.''\n  Not every Senator supported that riverboat gamble. I am proud to be \namong 11 Senators who voted against it.\n  The budget deficit we face today is the result of that failed gamble. \nThe entire deficit for the current fiscal year represents the interest \nownedon the $2.4 trillion of debt run up during the Reagan-Bush years. \nThe rest of the budget is already balanced, and it did not require a \nconstitutional amendment to do it.\n  What it did require was the courage to make tough decisions. In 1993, \nunder President Clinton's leadership, Congress passed a reconciliation \nbill that will reduce the debt by approximately $600 billion for fiscal \nyears 1994 through 1998. For the first time since the Truman \nadministration, deficits will fall 3 years in a row.\n  That landmark deficit reduction package was passed by Congress \nwithout a single Republican vote in either the House or the Senate. \nIndeed, Democrats in the House and Senate were attacked for supporting \nthe deficit reduction bill.\n  For years, we heard charges from the Republican party that Democrats \nin control of Congress were responsible for the Federal budget deficit. \nFor years, Republican Presidents refused to make the tough decisions \nnecessary to reduce the Federal deficit, choosing instead to blame \nCongress. ``Give us a Republican Congress,'' they said, ``and we will \nreduce the budget deficit.''\n  In November, the voters gave the Republican Party the majority it \nsought. And now, without even so much as presenting a single budget \nbill before either House of Congress, the Republican Party is saying to \nthe American people that the Republican Congress lacks the political \nwill to make the tough decisions necessary to continue the deficit \nreduction achieved during the past 2 years. Before offering a single \npiece of legislation to reduce the deficit, the Republican majority in \nCongress is saying that they need a constitutional amendment to get the \njob done.\n  We do not need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. All \nwe need is leadership. If Congress is not willing to balance the \nbudget, the Constitution can not do it for us.\n  The refusal of the Republican Party to spell out for the American \npeople the specific changes needed to balance the budget is a failure \nof leadership. The American people have a right to know what this \nproposed constitutional amendment would require.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a total of $1.2 \ntrillion in deficit reduction will be required to balance the budget by \nthe year 2002. And that is not including the defense increases called \nfor by the Republicans' Contract With America.\n  If Social Security, defense, and interest on the national debt are \nexcluded from the calculations, all other Federal programs will have to \nbe cut by 22 percent to achieve a balanced budget in 2002. That is a 22 \npercent cut in spending on Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, \nstudent loans, farm benefits, and all of the other Federal programs. If \nthe tax cuts called for in the Republicans' Contract With\n America are also included, the across-the-board cut needed to balance \nthe budget will be 30 percent.\n\n  The Treasury Department has estimated the impact of these cuts on the \nStates. It predicts that that an across-the-board deficit reduction \npackage that excluded Social Security and Defense would require cuts in \nFederal grants to States of $71 billion, and cuts of an additional $176 \nbillion in other Federal spending that directly benefits States in \nprograms such as Medicaid, highway funds, aid to families with \ndependent children, education, job training, environment, housing, and \nother areas.\n  The Treasury Department also estimated how much each State's taxes \nwould have to be raised for the State to offset the reduction in \nFederal grants under the proposed constitutional amendment. State taxes \nwould have to increase an average of 12 percent just to offset the loss \nof Federal grants.\n  The American people have a right to know if that is how the \nRepublican majority will balance the budget. Why will they not tell us? \nWhat have they got to hide. They are using the smokescreen of this \nconstitutional amendment as a trick to hide the scheme of deep cuts in \nbasic social programs that the country will not accept if the reality \nis known.\n  Amending the Constitution could well make all our problems worse. \nAdopting this proposed amendment could jeopardize our economy, diminish \nthe Constitution, distort its system of checks and balances, and \nundermine the principle of majority rule that is at the core of our \ndemocracy.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment could jeopardize our economy by \nrequiring that the Federal budget be balanced each fiscal year, \nregardless of the state of the economy, unless three-fifths of the \nSenate and House vote to approve a specific deficit.\n  All of us know that when the economy is in a recession, revenues \nfall, and outlays increase. Fewer people hold jobs and pay taxes, so \nrevenues go down.\n  Costs for unemployment insurance, food stamps, and public assistance \ngo up.\n  These so-called countercylical actions maintain demand for goods and \nservices during recessionary times. They help to prevent mild downturns \nfrom becoming recessions, and they help prevent recessions from turning \ninto depressions. We have not had a depression in over 50 years.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment could well prevent the \noperation of the countercylical effects needed to help keep the economy \non an even keel. Supporters of the amendment argue that the existing \nbudget deficit has made countercylical deficit spending \n[[Page S1741]] ineffective as a way to stimulate demand and avoid \nrecessions, because the deficit is already so large. But they neglect \nto mention that the constitutional amendment would require the \nGovernment to engage in fiscal practices that will make any recession \nworse.\n  Section 1 of the amendment prohibits total outlays from exceeding \ntotal receipts unless three-fifths of the House and Senate vote to \nauthorize a specific deficit. When a recession causes revenues to fall \nbelow estimates during a fiscal year, the proposed constitutional \namendment would require the Government to reduce outlays to avoid an \nunauthorized deficit.\n  This fundamental point was stated by Alice Rivlin, Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, during her testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n\n       [E]nforcing a rule that we must balance the budget every \n     year, regardless of the state of the economy, would be a big \n     economic mistake. Now one can think that, and still think \n     that budget deficits ought to be much smaller than they are \n     now, and I do believe that.\n       But if we were living in a world in which the budget had to \n     be balanced every year, when a recession threatened * * *, \n     and people were laid off, they would naturally be paying less \n     taxes. So there would be an automatic deficit in the Federal \n     budget. Now, if the Congress were then required to rectify \n     that by either cutting spending, or raising taxes, the \n     recession would be worse. People would have less income. More \n     people would be laid off. The Congress might have to cut back \n     on unemployment benefits, and things like that.\n       So you would have exactly the wrong kind of fiscal policy \n     in a recession. Now, you might say three-fifths of the \n     Congress could be wise enough to foresee that, and do \n     something about it, even if the amendment were in place.\n       But forecasting is very uncertain. Even people who do it \n     professionally, full time, are not very good at it, and the \n     Congress of the United States is unlikely to be very good at \n     it.\n       So I think we would have worse recessions, and it would \n     just exaggerate the boom/bust cycle if we had to balance \n     every year.\n\n  The proposed constitutional amendment is unwise economic policy for \nanother reason--because it would prohibit capital budgeting. Capital \nbudgeting is the commonsense practice of paying for the cost of capital \nassets over their useful lives. If Congress intends to require a \nbalanced budget, at least the calculation of the balance should be made \nsensibly, not irrationally.\n  American families engage in capital budgeting when they borrow money \nto pay the cost of purchasing a home. They spread the payments over \nmany years. This same logic applies to paying for college education or \npurchasing a car. Millions of American businesses use capital budgets \nas well. They depreciate the cost of buildings over many years. They do \nthe same for many other types of long-term assets.\n  We also hear a lot of Republican rhetoric about how States are able \nto live under balanced budget requirements in their State \nconstitutions. But 42 States rely on capital budgets to calculate the \nbalance.\n  Supporters of the proposed Federal constitutional amendment say that \na future Congress will be able to pass implementing legislation that \nallows capital budgeting to be used in meeting the balanced-budget \nrequirement. They should read their own amendment.\n  Section 7 of the amendment states that:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \n     States Government except those derived from borrowing. Total \n     outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n\n  ``All'' means ``all.'' If the balanced budget constitutional \namendment is adopted, Congress cannot pass legislation exempting \ncapital budgets.\n  The language of section 1 also means Congress cannot pass legislation \nexempting Social Security. Adopting this proposed constitutional \namendment would force Congress to include the Social Security trust \nfund in its balanced-budget calculations.\n  As many observers have pointed out, the amendment would enable \nCongress to use the existing surplus in the Social Security trust fund \nto avoid the tough decisions needed to achieve a balanced budget in the \nnear term. The Social Security trust fund will essentially be raided to \nachieve a phony budget balance. As a result, the solemn commitment \nbetween the American people and their Government to keep the Social \nSecurity trust fund separate from the operating expenses of the Federal \nGovernment would be broken.\n  The proposed amendment is also unwise as a matter of basic \nconstitutional principle in our federal system.\n  First, the amendment would embroil State and Federal courts in \ncomplex, endless litigation. It would require them to resolve sensitive \nbudget issues that should be left to the elected branches of \nGovernment. It would empower them to cut spending and raise taxes in \norder to achieve a balanced budget.\n  In The Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton described the judiciary \nas ``the least dangerous branch'' because it ``has no influence over \neither the sword or the purse.'' He then warned ``that there is no \nliberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative \nand executive powers.''\n  Yet the proposed constitutional amendment would do exactly that--\nplace the power of the purse in the hands of unelected judges. \nSupporters of the amendment argue that judges would only rarely have \noccasion to use these powers. That view is not shared by legal scholars \nfrom across the philosophical spectrum. Former Judge Robert Bork \npredicted:\n\n       The result * * * would likely be hundreds, if not \n     thousands, of lawsuits around the country, many of them on \n     inconsistent theories and providing inconsistent results. By \n     the time the Supreme Court straightened the whole matter out, \n     the budget in question would be at least four years out of \n     date, and lawsuits involving the next three fiscal years \n     would be slowly climbing toward the Supreme Court.\n\n  Supporters argue that few people would have standing in court to \nassert claims under the amendment. But the Supreme Court has upheld \ntaxpayer standing to challenge Government action that violates specific \nconstitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the \ncongressional taxing and spending power.\n  Even if taxpayers are not given standing to sue, it is easy to \nimagine numerous situations where individuals will suffer actual injury \nas a result of violations of the proposed amendment.\n  If a President impounds Social Security benefits to avoid an \nunauthorized deficit, Social Security recipients will have standing to \nsue.\n  If a President withholds a pay increase due Federal workers in order \nto avoid an unauthorized deficit, the workers will have standing to \nsue.\n  When courts do hear cases under this constitutional amendment, they \nwill be forced to resolve complex issues in trials that could take \nmonths or even years. What are the total outlays by the entire Federal \nGovernment for a particular year? Are loan guarantees included in those \noutlays? How many home mortgages and student loans did the Government \ninsure? For how much? How may defaulted?\n  Even in the markup in the past week, we inquired of the proponents \nwhether the loan for Mexico, for example, would be included, whether \nthat would be covered or not covered by the proposed constitutional \namendment. And the response we got from the proponents was, ``Well, it \ndepends whether there is a default or not.''\n  Well, with the proposed loan, $40 billion, are we supposed to say \nthat $40 billion loan guarantee must be authorized by a three-fifths \nvote of each House of Congress under the terms of the balanced budget \namendment? How are we going to be able to make those kinds of judgments \nnow that kind of emergency loan guarantee--of which both the \nadministration and a bipartisan group have indicated support--how would \nthat affect all of these deficit calculations? Clearly that has not \nbeen thought through.\n  Just one of the cases that will arise under the proposed amendment \nwould make the O.J. Simpson case look simple.\n  And when a court finds that a constitutional violation has occurred, \nwhat relief should it order? Five years ago, in Missouri versus \nJenkins, the Supreme Court ruled that a Federal court could order a \nlocal government to raise taxes to pay for court-ordered desegregation. \nWill Federal courts order Congress to raise taxes to cure an \nunauthorized deficit? Will they order the Treasury to stop paying \ninterest on Treasury bonds? Will they order the President to stop \nspending Federal \n[[Page S1742]] funds? What future constitutional crises will we face \nbecause of this foolish constitutional amendment.\n  Last year, the supporters of this amendment accepted a proposal \noffered by Senator Danforth that would have prevented the courts from \nraising taxes or cutting spending. The failure to include a similar \nlimitation in this year's amendment means that Federal courts will sit \nas super budget committees under the amendment.\n  The proposed amendment would also give the President unprecedented \nauthority to impound appropriated funds when a deficit occurs. The \nPresident has a sworn duty to uphold the Constitution. When an \nunauthorized deficit takes place, the President will have a duty to \ntake action, including impounding appropriated funds, to prevent a \nconstitutional violation.\n  That is not just my opinion. That is the option of the President's \nown legal advisor, Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger. And it \nis the opinion of a wide range of constitutional scholars from Reagan \nadministration Solicitor General Charles Fried to Johnson \nadministration Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, and many, many \nothers.\n  So, basically, this is the second key area of concern, Mr. President, \nand that is the question of enforcement. Who will have the powers of \nenforcement? We had during the course certainly of the hearings that \nwere held last year by Senator Byrd and others, the direct testimony \nabout whether the President would have the power to impound. The \noverwhelming constitutional authority was that the President would have \nthat kind of power under this amendment. Which means that if the \nPresident made the judgment that the receipts and revenues were out of \nbalance, that they probably have a responsibility to impound funds to \navoid the deficit.\n  Is that what we are saying, that we want the President of the United \nStates to make those judgments, without any instruction as to what \nparticular area we want them to impound? Do we want to give him all of \nthat authority and all of that power? Well, we tried to address that in \nthe Judiciary Committee. I offered an amendment to say that we do not \nwant to do that. We do not want to grant that kind of a power to the \nexecutive. That amendment was defeated. That was defeated in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Then we come back and say are we going to leave enforcement up to the \ncourts and give them the authority and the power? Under the Missouri \nversus Jenkins case, we have seen the consternation that was raised \nabout that order that required the raising of certain funds in order to \nmove ahead to enforce the court's desegregation orders. We heard the \nroar that came from across the country that we do not want our courts \nto be making the judgments about raising taxes.\n  Quite clearly that outcome would be in complete conflict with what \nour Founding Fathers said ought to be the responsibility of the courts.\n  Are we prepared to say, well, all right, we will not let the \nPresident of the United States move ahead on impoundment? We will not \nlet our courts move ahead on enforcement. Who does that leave? What it \nleaves is the legislative branch. That leaves us, which goes just back \nto our point from the very beginning: ultimately the question comes \nback to us. If it ultimately comes back to us, why go through the whole \namendment process? If we believe ultimately that we must deal with \nthese tough issues, why are we not prepared to deal with them now? Why \ngo through these kind of gymnastics and say, ``OK, maybe we will give \nenforcement authority to the President.'' The supporters say, ``We do \nnot want to give it to the President so we will leave it indefinite.'' \nDo we say we will give it to the courts, or say we will not give it to \nthe courts. If the President and the courts are excluded, the only \nother enforcement is the Members of the Congress and the Senate.\n  That is what our Founding Fathers intended. That is what the \nConstitution points out. That is what the principal constitutional \nauthorities from Republican and Democratic administrations and \nthoughtful men and women who have not been a part of administrations \nhave felt. And that, I think, raises some the very, very, important \nweaknesses of this amendment--that there is no certainty on \nenforcement. We do not know.\n  Those proposing are not prepared to tell the American people where \nthe necessary cuts would come. They are not prepared to lay that out \nbefore them prior to the time of the passage of this amendment. They \nare not prepared to tell them how the amendment will be enforced. And \nthat is against a background where the Congress had taken action to see \nimportant reductions in the Federal deficit in the recent times. And \nwhere there certainly can be additional attention to the deficit in the \nfuture.\n  But we are being denied, and the American people are being denied, \nthe right to know what they really intend. What expenditures they \nintend to reduce, what taxes they intend to impose, and they are \nunwilling to state what their position is in terms of the enforcement \nmechanism. Wait down the road, wait another several years. Well, what \nwill happen in the meantime? The problem is that the deficit will be \ngoing up again. Why have we not gotten the balanced budgets coming \nforward from the Budget Committee in the House and the Senate to let \nthe American people understand where they are going, to challenge us to \ntake responsible positions on this deficit? But they are not even \nprepared to do that. They are not prepared to wait and see whether \nthere will be some action in that area. They are just saying go ahead \nand pass this and send it out to the States.\n  I support giving the President statutory line-item veto authority. \nBut the impoundment authority given the President by the balanced \nbudget amendment is far broader. As Professor Dellinger testified, it \nwould enable the President to order across-the-board cuts, or specific \ncuts affecting specific programs or specific areas of the country.\n  The amendment could also be read to give future Presidents power to \nimpose taxes, duties, or fees to avoid an unconstititional deficit.\n  Supporters of the amendment deny any intention to give the President \nauthority to impound funds or raise taxes. But they rejected the \nstraightforward amendment I offered in the Judiciary Committee to \nprevent it.\n  Supporters of the amendment argue that all questions on enforcement \nof the amendment will be answered when Congress passes the enforcement \nlegislation required by section 6. But although balanced budget \nconstitutional amendments have been before the Judiciary Committee and \nthe Congress for many years, year after year, we will hear the \nproponents of that balanced budget talk about how they have supported \nthis for 10, 15 years, and still we do not have any recommendation on \nhow we are going to achieve it. The only one that had the courage to do \nit was Republican Congressman Gerald Solomon, from the State of New \nYork, and that was overwhelmingly defeated in the House of \nRepresentatives a year ago. And many of those who are talking about the \nbalanced budget voted against it and said, well, we can wait. It is not \nnecessary to address that issue at that time.\n  Where is it? We have written budget laws for years in the Congress--\nGramm-Rudman, the 1990 and 1993 budget deficit laws. Why won't the \nproponents of this amendment show us the enforcement legisaltion.\n  Finally, the proposed constitutional amendment will severely \nundermine the principle of majority rule enshrined in our Constitution. \nBy requiring a three-fifths vote to authorize a deficit or raise the \ndebt limit, the amendment would give unprecedented power to a minority \nin either House of Congress.\n  Alexander Hamilton painted an alarming picture in The Federalist No. \n22 of the destructive consequences of these supermajority voting \nrequirements:\n\n       [W]hat at first sight may seem a remedy, is in reality a \n     poison. To give a minority a negative upon the majority \n     (which is always the case where more than a majority is \n     requisite to a decision) is, in its tendency, to subject the \n     sense of the greater number to that of the lesser number. * * \n     * This is one of those refinements which, in practice, has an \n     effect the reverse of what is expected from it in theory. * * \n     * The necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of \n     something approaching \n     [[Page S1743]] towards it, has been founded upon a \n     supposition that it would contribute to security. But its \n     real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy \n     the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, \n     caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or \n     corrupt junta to the regular deliberations and decisions of a \n     respectable majority.\n\n  We should heed Hamilton's warning. The filibuster is bad enough as a \nrule of the Senate. Enacting a supermajority requirement as part of \nthis amendment will enshrine gridlock in the Constitution. It will \nenable a willful minority to prevent any action they wish in connection \nwith the deficit, or to demand unacceptable conditions from the \nmajority as the price of their agreement.\n  For over 200 years, the principle of majority rule established in the \nConstitution has served this Nation well in wars, depressions, and a \nvast range of domestic and international crises. We should not abandon \nit now, simply because the elected Members of Congress at this moment \nlack the political courage to balance the budget.\n  There is nothing wrong with the Constitution. Let us act responsibly \nto deal with the deficit, not irresponsibly by tampering with the \nConstitution. This proposal is a sham and a gimmick, and it deserves no \nplace in the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to respond to certain \narguments presented by Senator Kennedy. These include issues involving: \nFirst, implementation and enforcement; second, judicial taxation; and \nthird, Presidential impoundment.\n\n\n                i. implementation and enforcement issues\n\n  Mr. President, opponents of the balanced budget amendment, including \nSenator Kennedy, have over the past decade carefully crafted \nMachiavellian arguments designed to place opponents of the amendment \nbetween, what Abraham Lincoln termed, ``the devil and the deep blue \nsea.'' One of the most pernicious is the contention that on the one \nhand the balanced budget amendment is a sham because it is \nunenforceable, and on the other hand that there will be too much \nenforcement--particularly that courts will themselves balance the \nbudget by ordering the cutting of spending programs, by placing the \nbudgetary process into judicial receivership, or by ordering that taxes \nbe raised. This contention is, of course, so exaggerated, so \ncontradictory, that it almost refutes itself. Yet it has become so \npervasive that it gives new life to Shakespeare's aphorism that, \n``foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines \neverywhere.''\n\n\n                     implementation and enforcement\n\n  I want to first address the false notion advanced by opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment that it is a paper tiger--that Congress will \nflout its constitutional authority to balance the budget. These notions \nare simply wrong. First, the amendment has sharp teeth. It is self-\nenforcing. Because, historically, it has been easier for Congress to \nraise the debt ceiling, rather than reduce spending or raise taxes, the \nprimary enforcement mechanism of House Joint Resolution 1 is section 2, \nwhich requires a three-fifths vote to increase the debt ceiling. This \nprovision is a steel curtain that will shield the American public from \nan ill-disciplined and profligate Congress.\n  Furthermore, Members of Congress overwhelmingly conform their actions \nto constitutional precepts out of fidelity to the Constitution itself. \nWe are bound by article VI of the Constitution to ``support this \nConstitution.'' I fully expect fidelity by Members of Congress to the \noath to uphold the Constitution. Honoring this pledge requires \nrespecting the provisions of the proposed amendment. Flagrant disregard \nof the proposed amendment's clear and simple provisions would \nconstitute nothing less than a betrayal of the public trust. In their \ncampaigns for reelection, elected officials who flout their \nresponsibilities under this amendment will find that the political \nprocess will provide the ultimate enforcement mechanism.\n\n\n                          judicial enforcement\n\n  I would like at this point to address the contention of opponents of \nthe balanced budget amendment like Senator Kennedy that there will be \ntoo much enforcement--specifically by the courts. They march out a\n veritable judicial parade of horribles where courts strike down \nspending measures, put the budgetary process under judicial \nreceivership, and like Charles I of England, raise taxes without the \nconsent of the people's representatives. All of this is a gross \nexaggeration. This parade has no permit.\n\n  I believe that House Joint Resolution 1 strikes the right balance in \nterms of judicial review. By remaining silent about judicial review in \nthe amendment itself, its authors have refused to establish \ncongressional sanction for the Federal courts to involve themselves in \nfundamental macroeconomic and budgetary questions, while not \nundermining their equally fundamental obligation to say what the law \nis, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). I also strongly agree \nwith former Attorney General William P. Barr who stated that there is:\n\n       * * * little risk that the amendment will become the basis \n     for judicial micromanagement or superintendence of the \n     Federal budget process. Furthermore, to the extent such \n     judicial intrusion does arise, the amendment itself equips \n     Congress to correct the problem by statute. On balance, \n     moreover, whatever remote risk there may be that courts will \n     play an overly intrusive role in enforcing the amendment, \n     that risk is, in my opinion, vastly outweighed by the \n     benefits of such an amendment.\n\n  There exists three basic constraints that prevents the courts from \nbecoming unduly involved in the budgetary process: First, limitations \non Federal courts contained in article III of the Constitution, \nprimarily the doctrine of ``standing,'' particularly as enunciated by \nthe Supreme Court in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130 \n(1992); second, the deference courts owe to Congress under both the \npolitical question doctrine and section 6 of the amendment itself, \nwhich confers enforcement authority in Congress; and third, the limits \non judicial remedies to be imposed on a coordinate branch of \ngovernment--limitations on remedies that are self-imposed by courts and \nthat, in appropriate circumstances, may be imposed on the courts by \nCongress. These limitations, such as separation of power concerns, \nprohibit courts from raising taxes, a power exclusively delegated to \nCongress by the Constitution and not altered by the balanced budget \namendment. Consequently, contrary to the contention of opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment, separation of power concerns further the \npurpose of the amendment in that it assures that the burden to balance \nthe budget falls squarely on the shoulders of Congress--which is \nconsistent with the intent of the Framers of the Constitution that all \nbudgetary matters be placed in the hands of Congress.\n  Concerning the doctrine of ``standing,'' it is beyond dispute that to \nsucceed in any lawsuit, a litigant must demonstrate standing to sue. To \ndemonstrate article III standing, a litigant\n at a minimum must meet three requirements: First, injury in fact--that \nthe litigant suffered some concrete and particularized injury; second, \ntraceability--that the concrete injury was both caused by and is \ntraceable to the unlawful conduct; and third, redressibility--that the \nrelief sought will redress the alleged injury. This is the test \nenunciated by the Supreme Court in the fairly recent and seminal case \nof Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.CT. 2130, 2136, (1992). (See, \ne.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation \nof Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 482-83 (1982)). In challenging \nmeasures enacted by Congress under a balanced budget regime, it would \nbe an extremely difficult hurdle for a litigant to demonstrate \nsomething more concrete than a generalized grievance and burden shared \nby all citizens and taxpayers, the injury in fact requirement. I want \nto emphasize that this is hardly a new concept. (See Frothingham v. \nMellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923)). Furthermore, courts are extremely \nunlikely to overrule this doctrine since standing has been held to be \nan article III requirement. (See Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 41 n.22 (1976)).\n\n  Even in the vastly improbable case where an injury in fact was \nestablished, a litigant would find it near impossible to establish the \ntraceability and redressibility requirements of the article III \nstanding test. Litigants would have a difficult time in showing that \nany alleged unlawful conduct--the unbalancing of the budget or the \nshattering of the debt ceiling--caused or is traceable to a particular \nspending \n[[Page S1744]] measure that harmed them. Furthermore, because the \nCongress would have numerous options to achieve balanced budget \ncompliance, there would be no legitimate basis for a court to nullify \nthe specific spending measure objected to by the litigant.\n  As to the redressibility prong, this requirement would be difficult \nto meet simply because courts are wary of becoming involved in the \nbudget process--which is legislative in nature--and separation of power \nconcerns will prevent courts from specifying adjustments to any Federal \nprogram or expenditures. Thus, for this reason, Missouri v. Jenkins, \n495 U.S. 33 (1990), where the Supreme Court upheld the district court's \npower to order a local school district to levy taxes to support a \ndesegregation plan, is inapposite because it is a 14th amendment case \nnot involving, as the Court noted, an instance of one branch of the \nFederal Government invading the province of another. Jenkins at 67. \nPlainly put, the Jenkins case is not applicable to the balanced budget \namendment because the 14th amendment--from which the judiciary derives \nits power to rule against the States in equal protection claims--does \nnot apply to the Federal Government and because the separation of \npowers doctrine prevents judicial encroachments on\n Congress' bailiwick. Courts simply will not have the authority to \norder Congress to raise taxes.\n\n  Furthermore, the well-established political question and \njusticiability doctrines will mandate that courts give the greatest \ndeference to congressional budgetary measures, particularly since \nsection 6 of House Joint Resolution 1 explicitly confers on Congress \nthe responsibility of enforcing the amendment, and the amendment allows \nCongress to rely on estimates of outlays and receipts. (See Baker v. \nCarr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962)). Under these circumstances, it is \nunlikely that a court would substitute its judgment for that of \nCongress.\n  Moreover, despite the argument of some opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the taxpayer standing case, Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n83 (1968), is not applicable to enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment. First, the Flast case has been limited by the Supreme Court \nto Establishment Clause cases. This has been made clear by the Supreme \nCourt in Valley Forge Christian College, 454 U.S. at 480. Second, by \nits terms, Flast is limited to cases challenging legislation \npromulgated under Congress' constitutional tax and spend powers when \nthe expenditure of the tax was made for an illicit purpose. Sections 1 \nand 2 of House Joint Resolution 1, limit Congress' borrowing power and \nthe amendment contains no restriction on the purposes of the \nexpenditures. Finally, in subsequent cases, particularly the Lujan \ncase, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the need for a litigant to \ndemonstrate particularized injury, thus casting doubt on the vitality \nof Flast. (See Lujan, 112 S. Ct. at 2136.)\n  I also believe that there would be no so-called congressional \nstanding for Members of Congress to commence actions under the balanced \nbudget amendment. Although the Supreme Court has never addressed the \nquestion of congressional standing, the D.C. Circuit has recognized \ncongressional standing, but only in the following circumstances: First, \nthe traditional standing tests of the Supreme Court are met; second, \nthere must be a deprivation within the zone of interest protected by \nthe Constitution or a statute--generally, the right to vote on a given \nissue or the protection of the efficacy of a vote; and third, \nsubstantial relief cannot be obtained from fellow legislators through \nthe enactment, repeal, or amendment of a statute--the so-called \nequitable discretion doctrine. (See Melcher v. Open Market Comm., 836 \nF.2d 561 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Reigle v. Federal Open Market Committee, 656 \nF.2d 873 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1082 (1981)). Because \nMembers of Congress would not be able to demonstrate that they were \nharmed in fact by any dilution or nullification of their vote--and \nbecause under the doctrine of equitable discretion, Members would not \nbe able to show that substantial relief could not otherwise be obtained \nfrom fellow legislators through the enactment, repeal, or amendment of \na statute--it is hardly likely that Members of Congress would have \nstanding to challenge actions under the balanced budget amendment.\n  Finally, a further limitation on judicial interference is section 6 \nof House Joint Resolution 1 itself. Under this section, Congress must \nadopt statutory remedies and mechanisms for any purported budgetary \nshortfall, such as sequestration, rescission, or the establishment of a \ncontingency fund. Pursuant to section 6, it is clear that Congress, if \nit finds it necessary, could limit the type of remedies a court may \ngrant or limit courts' jurisdiction in some other manner to proscribe \njudicial overreaching. This is nothing new. Congress has adopted such \nlimitations in other circumstances pursuant to its article III \nauthority. Here are a few: First, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \nsecs. 101-115, where the courts were denied the use of injunctive \npowers to restrain labor disputes; second, the Federal Tax Injunction \nAct, 28 U.S.C. sec. 2283, where a prohibition on State court \nproceedings by Federal courts was legislated; and third, the Tax \nInjunction Act, 26 U.S.C. sec. 7421(a), where Federal courts were \nprohibited from enjoining the collection of taxes.\n  In fact, Congress may also limit judicial review to particular \nspecial tribunals with limited authority to grant relief. For instance, \nthe Supreme Court in Yakus v. United States, 319 U.S. 182 (1943), \nupheld the constitutionality of a special Emergency Court of Appeals \nvested with exclusive authority to determine the validity of claims \nunder the World War II Emergency Price Control Act. In more recent \ntimes, the Supreme Court, in Dames & Moore v. Reagan, 453 U.S. 654 \n(1981), upheld the legality of the Iranian-United States Claims \nTribunal as the exclusive forum to settle claims to Iranian assets.\n  Mr. President, it is clear from the above discussion that the \nenforcement issues propounded by our opponents do not amount to a hill \nof beans.\n                         ii. judicial taxation\n\n  The contention that the balanced budget amendment would allow Federal \ncourts to order the raising of taxes is absolutely without merit. This \nbelief is based on a misunderstanding of the Supreme Court's opinion in \nMissouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990).\n  In this case, the Supreme Court in essence approved of a lower court \nremedial remedy of ordering local State or county political \nsubdivisions to raise taxes to support a court ordered school \ndesegregation order. Intentional segregation, in violation of the 14th \namendment's equal protection clause, had been found by the lower court \nin a prior case against the school district.\n  The concern that the balanced budget amendment would allow a Federal \ncourt to order Congress to raise taxes to reduce the budget is without \nmerit. This is true for the following reasons: First, Jenkins is a 14th \namendment case. Under 14th amendment jurisprudence, Federal courts may \nperhaps issue this type of remedial relief against the States, but not \nagainst Congress--a coequal branch of Government. The 14th amendment, \nof course, does not apply to the Federal Government; second, separation \nof powers concerns would prohibit the judiciary from interfering with \nbudgetary taxing, borrowing, and spending powers that are exclusively \ndelegated to Congress by the Constitution; and third, Congress cannot \nsimply be made a party defendant. To order taxes to be raised, Congress \nmust be named defendant. Presumably, suits to enforce the balanced \nbudget amendment would arise when an official or agency of the \nexecutive branch seeks to enforce or administer a statute whose funding \nis in question in light of the amendment. Thus, the court in Reigle v. \nFederal Open Market Committee, 656 F.2d 873, 879 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1981), \nnoted that ``[w]hen a plaintiff alleges injury by unconstitutional \naction taken pursuant to a statute, his proper defendants are those \nacting under the law * * * and not the legislature which enacted the \nstatute.''\n\n\n                       iii. impoundment response\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to respond to the impoundment argument. In \neach of the years the balanced budget amendment has been debated, I \nhave noticed that one spacious argument is presented as a scarce tactic \nby the opponents of the amendment. This year the vampire rising from \nthe grave is Presidential impoundment. Supposedly, a President, doing \nhis best Charles I of England impersonation, when faced with the \npossibility of budgetary shortfalls after ratification \n     [[Page S1745]] of the balanced budget amendment, will somehow \n     have the constitutional authority--nay duty--to arbitrarily \n     cut social spending programs or even raise taxes. Well, \n     Charles Stuart literally lost his head when he claimed as a \n     prerogative the powers of the Commons. So too, a President \n     may not claim authority delegated by the Constitution to the \n     people's representatives. The law is our Cromwell that will \n     prevent impoundment.\n  I want to emphasize that there is nothing in House Joint Resolution 1 \nthat allows for impoundment. It is not the intent of the amendment to \ngrant the President any impoundment authority under House Joint \nResolution 1. In fact, there is a ripeness problem to any attempted \nimpoundment: indeed up to the end of the fiscal year the President has \nnothing to impound because Congress in the amendment has the power to \nameliorate any budget shortfalls or ratify or specify the amount of \ndeficit spending that may occur in that fiscal year.\n  Moreover, under section 6 of the amendment, Congress must--and I \nemphasize must--mandate exactly what type of enforcement mechanism it \nwants, whether it be sequestration, rescission, or the establishment of \na contingency fund. The President, as Chief Executive, is duty bound to \nenforce a particular requisite congressional scheme to the exclusion of \nimpoundment. That the President must enforce a mandatory congressional \nbudgetary measure has been the established law since the 19th century \ncase of Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 542 \n(1838). In Kendall, Congress had passed a private act ordering the \nPostmaster General to pay Kendall for services rendered. The Supreme \nCourt rejected the argument that Kendall could not sue in mandamus \nbecause the Postmaster General was subject only to the orders of the \nPresident and not to the directives of Congress. The Court held that \nthe President must enforce any mandated--as opposed to discretionary--\ncongressional spending measure pursuant to his duty to faithfully \nexecute the law pursuant to article II, section 3 of the Constitution. \nThe Kendall case was given new vitality in the 1970's, when lower \nFederal courts, as a matter of statutory construction, rejected \nattempts by President Nixon to impound funds where Congress did not \ngive the President discretion to withhold funding, E.g., State Highway \nCommission v. Volpe, 479 F.2d 1099 (8th Cir. 1973).\n  The position that section 6 implementing legislation would preclude \nPresidential impoundment was seconded by Attorney General Barr at the \nrecent Judiciary Committee hearing on the balanced budget amendment. \nTestifying that the impoundment issue was in reality incomprehensible, \nGeneral Barr concluded that ``the whip hand is in Congress' hand, so to \nspeak; under section 6 [the] Congress can provide the enforcement \nmechanism that the courts will defer to and that the President will be \nbound by.''\n  What we have here then, is an argument based on a mere possibility. \nUnder the mere possibility scenario of an impoundment we would have to \ninclude any possibility, however remote, in the amendment. The \namendment would look like an insurance policy. Why place something in \nthe Constitution that in all probability could never happen, especially \nif Congress could preclude impoundment by legislation?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this afternoon, the issue that brings \nSenators to the floor is the beginning of what I believe will be a \nhistoric debate in this Chamber, as it has been in the House the last \nseveral days of last week, and that is to debate and consider House \nJoint Resolution 1, a balanced budget resolution to the Constitution of \nour country.\n  If I could, for a few brief moments, read to you, Mr. President, and \nto those who might be listening, the actual resolution. The reason I \nbelieve it is so fundamentally important that the American people and \nmy colleagues in the Senate hear and understand what the resolution \nitself says is because a great deal will be said over the course of the \nnext 3 weeks about this single 2-page document that will simply not be \ntrue.\n  By the time we are through debating it, it will appear to some who \nmight listen to be an overburdening action that this Government should \nnot take. I think what is important in the processes of our \nconstitutional requirement is for all of the Senate, and certainly for \nthe American people, to understand that the Congress of the United \nStates is only proposing--is only proposing--to the American people and \nto the 50 States a resolution that would establish a process to cause \nthis Congress to begin to construct a budget for our country that would \ncome into balance.\n  Let me read:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within 7 years after the \n     date of its submission to the States for ratification:\n\n  Therein itself is a very clear statement, Mr. President, that this \nSenate begins today only the debate that would cause us to agree by a \ntwo-thirds vote to send forth to the States this simple document for \nthem to consider, and by three-fourths to ratify, for it to become the \n28th amendment to the Constitution of this country.\n\n       Article--\n\n  One article, not article I, not article II, not article III, but one \narticle with eight sections, 1\\1/2\\ pages in total.\n\n       Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 2. The limit of the debt of the United States held \n     by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such \n     an increase by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays \n     do not exceed receipts.\n       Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n       Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts.\n       Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the \n     United States Government except those derived from borrowing. \n     Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n       Section 8.\n\n  And the last section.\n\n       This article shall take effect beginning with fiscal year \n     2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning after its \n     ratification, whichever is later.\n       Passed by the U.S. House of Representatives January 26, \n     1995.\n\n  And, of course, introduced into the Senate and brought to this floor \ntoday for the purposes of beginning the debate.\n  Mr. President, the reason I read this document and the reason it is \nimportant that the Record show that it is but 1\\1/2\\ pages in length, \nit is 8 sections and only 1 article, as proposed as the 28th amendment \nto the Constitution of our country, is because if the average citizen \njust listened to the debate, they would think that the magnitude of \nthis statement, so defined and so articulated by the opposition to it, \nsurely must be 1,000 pages in length, or it must be one of those 1,700- \nor 2,000-page bills, like the health care bill of a year ago. If it is \nto cause for this country all of the dire predictions that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts just proposed, how could a document so simple cause \nso much problem? In fact, how could a document so simple even suggest \nafter it were ratified by the States that the Congress shall enforce \nand implement this article by appropriate legislation?\n  In fact, what we are hearing and what we will hear for 3 or 4 weeks, \nand potentially hundreds of amendments later, is that the Congress \nitself has the cart before the horse; that we, the Senators, must see \nin great detail every item that will be cut, every \n[[Page S1746]] change in the budget that will be proposed over the next \n7-year period, and yet the constitutional amendment itself, as \nproposed, says that:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation--\n\n  And that will come logically, at least, only after we find out if \nthree-fourths of the States of our Nation are willing to ratify it.\n  I think myself and the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nIllinois know that we will try to do better than that. We will work at \nexplaining and trying to articulate what we believe this process, this \nprocedure would require as it relates to changes in budget and changes \nin budgetary practices.\n  But I think for all of us who will become involved in this debate \nover the next several weeks, it is constantly important that we \nremember that it is but a simple document proposed to the States and, \nyes, out of that simplicity will probably come one of the most \nsignificant changes in the way the central Government of this country \noperates than ever in the history of its central Government since the \nConstitutional Convention and the proposed Constitution that this would \nbecome an amendment of as it was proposed some 208 years ago.\n  The Senator from Utah, who leads the debate on this side, has clearly \nspelled out the efforts and the work that has gone into the crafting of \nthis amendment. Certainly, the Senator from Illinois, who is here in \nthe Chamber this afternoon, and the Senator from South Carolina know, \nbecause they have been involved in this issue for a good many years, as \nhave I, that it is not a partisan issue, that it cannot be a partisan \nissue. By the very nature of the two-thirds vote that is required in \nthis body, it is uniquely bipartisan. And over the years we have worked \nhard to accomplish that.\n  The vote in the House of last week demonstrates very clearly that it \nwas again a uniquely bipartisan debate and vote, with many members of \nboth parties voting for it, to acquire that two-thirds vote.\n  The gravity and the magnitude of changing the Constitution of this \ncountry must be something that a majority, a very large majority, of \nthe American people agree with, two-thirds in the Senate and the three-\nfourths of the States. It is so critically necessary.\n  I have mentioned Paul Simon of Illinois, former chairman of the \nConstitution Subcommittee, leader on the Democrat side on this issue. \nStrom Thurmond, who is here to speak this afternoon, from South \nCarolina, President pro tempore of the Senate and former Judiciary \nchairman who introduced this issue in the 1950's; Orrin Hatch, who now \nchairs the Judiciary Committee, who spoke and opened up this debate as \nhe brought the House resolution to the floor; and Howell Heflin, Carol \nMoseley-Braun, Pete Domenici, and many other Senators including myself \nhave been involved in this issue for well over a decade now.\n  The reason I mentioned breadth of time and all of those from a \nbipartisan point of view that have been involved in this issue is \nbecause, as attitude and ideas change here in this body or in the other \nabout how we govern our country, one idea that has been around now for \nwell over two decades has been this idea. I think it has met the test \nof change and time. And I think all of us recognize that, if we truly \nare going to bring about the kind of changes in the central Government \nof this country that many of us believe the American people spoke to on \nNovember 8, this is the issue, this is the resolution, that can bring \nthat change because while all of those ideas change about how we change \nour Government and how we look at it, this one has not changed.\n  Interestingly enough, it was not just one of those items in the \nContract With America that Republican candidates for the House of \nRepresentatives ran on last year and now work on as Members of the \nCongress. It was the centerpiece. The reason it was the centerpiece, \nand the reason we know why it should be, was the importance it plays in \nwhat it will cause this Congress and this Senate to do differently.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts was talking about a variety of very \nimportant programs. Many of us call them Great Society welfare \nprograms, ideas of the past, ideas that appeared to be good in their \nday, ideas that would have solved a great many problems for our \ncountry. But when you look at the breadth of time that they have been \nfunded and have been operating, have they addressed our problems? Have \nthey solved the problems they set out to solve?\n  The answer is quite simply no, because if they had and had there have \nbeen no more poverty and been no more people on welfare, if the budget \nhad been balanced, I doubt that the election last November would have \nbeen the way it was, that our American people would have spoken so \nstrongly to this issue and to other issues and would have demanded the \nchange.\n  So it is not in spite of them; it is largely because of a variety of \nideas that have transformed our Government that have caused us to have \na $4.6 trillion debt and on average $200 billion deficit and a $300 \nbillion annualized interest payment. The American people are saying in \na very loud way and in a very clear way, Congress, pass a balanced \nbudget amendment and in so doing transform our Government for us and do \nas you will to change it. Be kind. Use good priority. Recognize those \nin need. But do not continue to fund it by deficit in the manner that \nyou have.\n  This year in a Wirthlin poll, 70 percent of the American people said \nthat, or said some form of what I have just said, and 19 percent \ndisagreed. A Washington Post-ABC poll beginning this year showed that \n80 percent of the American people agreed or said something like that \nwhen asked the question. Even when the question was asked, well, what \nabout, or if, or this might be changed, they said, we want a balanced \nbudget because we fear that the Government and those who govern us have \nlost sight of the impact of a debt and a deficit of the kind we have as \na country and its potential impact on future generations.\n  Well, those polls were taken in 1994 and 1995, just this year. But in \nSeptember 1992, again, 81 percent of the American people spoke out and \nsaid change, balance the budget, pass a balanced budget amendment, \nbegin to restrict yourselves, begin to control yourselves as a \ngovernment.\n  So it is an issue that has withstood the test of time. It is not \nsomething new, nor is it unique or different. You will hear in the \ncourse of this debate quotes from our Founding Fathers. You have heard \nthe Senator from Massachusetts refer to the Federalist papers.\n  Let the new Federalist papers of 1995 be crafted by this Congress to \nspeak to the States of our Nation and to tell them the virtues of a \nbalanced budget amendment and what it will do to change the powerful \ncentral Government and what it will do to bring back the 10th amendment \nand the 14th amendment and the power to the States and the power to the \ncitizens to once again control themselves. Yes, this is a most critical \ntime in our Nation's history, and, yes, I believe this is a most \nhistoric debate we begin this afternoon.\n  Coincidentally, as we meet here in the Chamber of the Senate today, \nGovernors from all 50 States are meeting in this Capital City, and they \nare gathered around preparing to convene a national conference of \nGovernors in the coming months to develop a dialog and a presentation \nto the central Government, to the Congress of the United States, \ncajoling, arguing, emphatically stating that it is time the States \nbegan to reclaim some of their power under the 10th and 14th \namendments.\n  A Democrat Governor this morning from Indiana said on national \ntelevision: And if the Congress does not listen, then maybe we will \nhave to do what States did when they brought about a Constitutional \nConvention as a result of a meeting in Annapolis, as a result of a \nfailing document called the Articles of Confederation. That was a \nDemocrat Governor that said that this morning in a mild but direct way.\n  A Republican Governor sitting right beside him said, yes; it is \nabsolutely true. If the arrogance of power today in the central \nGovernment and here in this Senate and in the House is to say to our \nStates, we do not hear you and we do not care; we will continue to put \ndown upon you one Federal law after another that will erode your power \nand your ability to govern under a Constitution that puts States in a \npreeminent power position and put the \n[[Page S1747]] central Government second in almost all, if you do not \ndo that--and that is what those Governors were saying this morning--we \nwill speak even louder to transform our Government once again like the \nStates over 200 years ago had to do because of a central Government \nthat was not working.\n  If we pass this resolution, if we send to the States the 28th \namendment to the Constitution of this country, and if it is ratified, \nthen we will begin a historic dialog with those Governors and State \nlegislatures to decide what of these programs that make up this huge \nFederal budget have priority to the States and to the citizens of those \nStates,\n which should be paid for by the State legislatures and the taxpayers \nof States and which should be funded by the Federal Government. And I \nsincerely believe until we pass this amendment, that kind of debate, \nthat kind of dialog, that kind of cooperative relationship between the \nStates and their central Government will really never begin.\n\n  Last Friday night we passed another historic piece of legislation, \nthe unfunded mandates legislation. My colleague from Idaho authored \nthat and brought it to the floor of the U.S. Senate. There is no doubt \nthat was a phenomenally important step. But, still, there is adequate \nroom for the Federal Government to create great havoc with State \ngovernments and their ability to control. That unfunded mandates bill, \ncoupled with a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal \nGovernment's budget would for the first time in the life and the \nhistory of this Government under this Constitution create a dialog and \ndebate that will go on for a long, long while as we begin the process I \nhave just outlined: A sorting out of our differences and deciding what \nwe can do and what we cannot do and what is within the fiscal means of \nour country to do.\n  Yes, to the Senator from Massachusetts, we would establish a lot of \nunique and new priorities. You see what he was saying a few moments ago \nwhen he talked about all those cuts, is that his vision of America is a \nGovernment like the one we currently have, only bigger and bigger and \nbigger. Not changed, not rejuvenated, not redistributed, not redesigned \nand reenvisioned and recreated. But that is what the American people \nare saying. And that is why we began this debate this afternoon.\n  Over the course of the next several weeks I am sure all of my \ncolleagues who are joined in this debate in favor of a balanced budget \namendment will work overtime to explain to our colleagues here in the \nSenate and to the American people how the processes will work. But one \nthing we know is clear. We must pass a clean amendment, because it is \nnothing but a prescription, a process, a procedure placed in the \nConstitution which mandates to the Congress of the United States that \nthey will bring their receipts and expenditures into balance on an \nannual basis and they will do so in a certain manner.\n  And if they find it impossible to do they will offer it up in another \ndifferent manner under a different prescription. But it will be so \nrequired and the American people will know why we are spending in \ndeficit if we must. But more important, that in the good years we will \npay it off. We will get back in balance. We will do what our Founding \nFathers did for well over 100 years during the history of this country, \nthe first 100 years, when a balanced budget was an ethic. It was \nbelieved to be the responsibility of a central Government. Slowly but \nsurely we have walked away from that. Slowly but surely our debt began \nto mount. Slowly but surely we began to lose control of our Government \nto an autopilot that now many will argue we must retain. I do not \nbelieve that is what our Governors are saying. It is most certainly not \nwhat the citizens are speaking to. And it is something this Congress \nshould never agree to again.\n  So we begin this debate with the recognition that House Joint \nResolution 1 that is before us as a resolution proposed to the States \nto provide a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution can bring \nabout profound change. But it will bring about change so designed in \nthe image of the citizens of this country, as they envision their \ncentral Government.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, we begin consideration of a \nproposed constitutional amendment to require the Federal Government to \nachieve and maintain a balanced budget. We are pleased that the House \nacted with wide bipartisan support as it adopted the balanced budget \namendment by a vote of 300 to 132.\n  Also, before we have extended debate on this proposed amendment in \nthe Senate, I want to commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch. He is to be congratulated on the manner in which he \nhandled this matter in the Judiciary Committee and bringing it to the \nfloor for consideration. I have worked over the years with Senator \nHatch on the balanced budget amendment and due in large part to his \ntireless efforts we are close to sending this proposal to the American \npeople for ratification. I also wish to commend Senator Larry Craig of \nIdaho for his fine leadership on this matter. He has been a stalwart in \nthis fight. Also, I wish to commend Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, who \nhas been a leader in this cause for a number of years.\n  Mandating balanced Federal budgets is not a new idea. The first \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget was proposed in 1936 by \nMinnesota Representative Harold Knutson. Then came World War II and \nattention was distracted from efforts to secure annual balanced \nbudgets, although Senator Tydings and Representative Disney introduced \nseveral balanced budget amendments during that period.\n  Following World War II, a Senate joint resolution on balanced budgets \nwas introduced by Senators Tydings of Maryland and Bridges and reported \nout by the Committee on Appropriations in 1947 but received no further \naction. During the 1950's, an increasing number of constitutional \ninitiatives for balanced budgets came to be introduced regularly in \nCongress. It was during that time that I supported legislation such as \nthat offered by Senators Bridges, Curtis, and Harry Byrd to require the \nsubmission by the President of an annual balanced budget and to prevent \nCongress from adjourning without having enacted such a budget. No \naction was taken on these measures. Yet, since the beginning of the \n84th Congress in 1955, an average of four constitutional amendments to \nrequire a balanced Federal budget have been proposed during each \nCongress. There was little substantive action in the 1960's and 1970's \non our proposals. But finally, in 1982 while I was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the Senate passed a balanced budget amendment \nwhich I authored. Our victory was short-lived, however, because the \nSpeaker and the majority leader at that time led the movement to kill \nit in the House of Representatives. That was our high water mark as we \nfell one vote short in 1986 and four votes short last year. With the \nrecent action in the House of Representatives and wide bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, I am ever optimistic that this is the year the \nCongress will deliver to the American people a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Simply stated, this legislation calls for a constitutional amendment \nrequiring that outlays not exceed receipts during any fiscal year. \nAlso, the Congress would be allowed by a three-fifths vote to adopt a \nspecific level of deficit spending. Further, there is language to allow \nthe Congress to waive the amendment during time of war or imminent \nmilitary threat. Finally, the amendment requires that any bill to \nincrease taxes be approved by a majority of the whole number of both \nHouses.\n  This legislation would provide an important step to reduce and \nultimately eliminate the Federal deficit. The American people have \nexpressed their strong opinion that we focus our efforts on reducing \nthe deficit. Making a balanced budget amendment part of the \nConstitution is appropriate action for addressing our Nation's runaway \nfiscal policy.\n  Over the past half-century, the Federal Government has become \njeopardized by an irrational and irresponsible pattern of spending. As \na result, this firmly entrenched fiscal policy is a threat to the \nliberties and opportunities of our present and future citizens.\n  [[Page S1748]] The national debt as of December 30, 1994 was $4.65 \ntrillion. The Federal deficit in fiscal year 1993 was $225 billion. Mr. \nPresident, in 1957, my third year in the Senate, the entire national \ndebt was less than $275 billion and there was not a deficit, but rather \na $3 billion surplus.\n  Today, the payment of interest on the debt is the second largest item \nin the budget. That accounts for the estimate that this year it will \ntake over 40 percent of all personal income tax receipts to pay the \ninterest on the debt.\n  The tax dollars that go to pay interest on the debt are purely to \nservice a voracious congressional appetite for spending. Payment of \ninterest on the debt does not build roads, it does not fund medical \nresearch, it does not provide educational opportunities, it does not \nprovide job opportunities, and it does not speak well for the Federal \nGovernment. Payment of interest on the debt merely allows the Federal \nGovernment to carry a debt which has been growing at an alarming rate. \nIt is deficit spending which has brought us to these crossroads. \nCongress has balanced the Federal budget only once in the last 32 years \nand only 8 times in the last 64 years. A balanced budget amendment as \npart of the Constitution will mandate the Congress to adhere to a \nresponsible fiscal policy.\n  The American businessmen and businesswomen have become incredulous as \nthey witness year in and year out the spending habits of the Congress. \nAnyone who runs a business clearly understands that they cannot survive \nby continuing to spend more money than they take in. It is time the \nCongress understands this simple yet compelling principle.\n  For many years, I have believed, as have many Members of Congress, \nthat the way to reverse this misguided direction of the Federal \nGovernment's fiscal policy is by amending the Constitution to mandate, \nexcept in extraordinary circumstances, balanced Federal budgets. The \nCongress should adopt this proposal and send it to the American people \nfor ratification. The balanced budget amendment is a much needed \naddition to the Constitution and it would establish balanced budgets as \na fiscal norm, rather than a fiscal abnormality.\n  The tax burdens which today's deficits will place on future \ngenerations of American workers is staggering. Future American workers \nare our children and our children's children. We are mortgaging the \nfuture for generations yet unborn. This is a terrible injustice we are \nimposing on America's future and it has been appropriately referred to \nas fiscal child abuse.\n\n       Our third President, Thomas Jefferson, stated: The question \n     whether one generation has the right to bind another by the \n     deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to \n     place it among the fundamental principles of government. We \n     should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity \n     with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.\n\n  It is time we show the fiscal discipline advocated by Thomas \nJefferson and adopt a balanced budget amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the Senate begins to debate the \nresolution to send to the States a proposed constitutional amendment to \nrequire a balanced budget, I am hopeful it can also be an educational \nexperience for both participants and spectators. Like the gulf war \ndebate, I hope it will lead to an informed judgment for all of us. For \nit has been a debate that has gone on for centuries.\n  The words of Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson have always made \nsense to me. They did not believe in permanent debt. Jackson said,\n\n       I am one of those who do not believe a national debt is a \n     national blessing, but rather a curse to a republic; inasmuch \n     as it is calculated to raise around the administration a \n     moneyed aristocracy dangerous to the liberties of the \n     country.\n\n  I am sensitive to the significance of amending our Constitution and \nthe care we should exercise when we propose to do so. In more than 200 \nyears, the Constitution has been amended 27 times. Two of those \noccasions reflect the effort to annul with the 21st amendment the \nproblems created by the 18th, prohibition.\n  Passage of the repeal amendment could no more undo the damaged caused \nby Prohibition than it could turn back the clock.\n  Throughout most of our history, the discipline of balanced budgets \nwas part of our tradition. It was so much a part of the culture of \ngovernment that no external discipline was necessary to enforce it.\n  That has not been true for the last quarter century. The discipline \nof strong political parties has eroded. In the last quarter-century, \nself-styled conservatives got tired of preaching fiscal austerity. The \nfree lunch theory of politics was born. It proved successful, and we \nare its heirs.\n  History is unforgiving. What has been done changes the world, whether \nor not, in hindsight, we think it should have been done. We are forced \nto deal with the changed world. We can no more return to the tradition-\ninspired fiscal discipline that ruled our Nation's first 150 years than \nwe could undo the damage of Prohibition by repealing it.\n  In this changed world, proponents argue that the only institution in \nAmerican life that still commands the respect necessary to impose \ndiscipline in the face of competing demands is the Constitution.\n  So I have supported the idea of amending the Constitution. I have \ndone so in the hope that it would have a salutary effect on smoke-and-\nmirrors budgeting that has won all too many of the battles while the \nNation is steadily losing the war.\n  From the beginning of the American constitutional system in 1789, the \nFederal budget was in rough balance in most of its first 150 years.\n  Following the end of the Second World War, that has not been the \ncase. Until the end of the 1960's, deficits were small, relative to the \ngross national product, and some fiscal years showed small surpluses. \nThe oil price shocks of the 1970's and other factors began to fuel the \nominous upward drift of deficits.\n  Even then, despite the efforts by some to rewrite history, the growth \nof the national debt was not exponential. Deficits reflected economic \nstress, not an out-of-control budget.\n  That changed dramatically in 1981.\n  Fourteen years ago, with the first Reagan budget, deficits exploded \nand the national debt began its upward spiral.\n  The combination of supply-side economics in the form of a massive tax \ncut and a trillion-dollar defense buildup led to record-setting \ndeficits.\n  In the 12 years of Reagan-Bush economics, a national debt that had \ntaken two centuries to reach $1 trillion was quadrupled.\n  If your family built up a $9,000 debt over 5 years and your feckless \nbrother-in-law ran up $27,000 on your credit card in 45 days, you'd be \nfacing the equivalent of what happened at the Federal level. Your \nmonthly interest charges would go sky high. That happened to Federal \ninterest charges, too.\n  Today the interest payment on our debt is $212 billion. If it were \nnot for the Reagan-Bush portion of the debt, our budget would be \nvirtually in balance today.\n  High deficits that persist in good economic times as well as bad \ndamage our economy. They sap economic growth by diverting resources \nfrom productive investments. They add to the debt burden and its \nservicing cost, the interest we pay on the debt each year. That diverts \nresources from longer range investment in infrastructure and education.\n  Everyone knows what must be done to balance the budget. Revenues have \nto equal or exceed outlays. you can reach that result by increasing \nrevenues or reducing outlays or both.\n  But you can't do it with mirrors.\n  Despite three versions of the Gramm-Rudman Act since 1985, each of \nwhich was supposed to produce a balanced budget, the budget, as we all \nknow, is far from balanced.\n  The first real action to get the deficits under control occurred in \n1990, when Congress and President Bush agreed on $500 billion in \ndeficit reduction.\n  Again in 1993, Congress and President Clinton agreed on another $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction that has given us the first 3 consecutive \nyears of declining deficits in half a century. Yet the 1993 action, \nwhich has been enormously beneficial to our economy, was fiercely \nresisted on a partisan basis. Not one Republican voted for that deficit \nreduction package.\n  We were warned that passing the President's budget would throw the \n[[Page S1749]] country into recession, cost countless jobs, put \nAmericans into the poorhouse through tax hikes, and make the deficit go \nthrough the roof.\n  Exactly the opposite happened. The economy grew stronger and \nexpanded; more than 5 million new jobs were created; 20 million working \nAmericans were taken off the tax rolls; and the deficit has come down \nfor 3 years in succession.\n  The dire warnings in 1993 weren't qualified. They were presented as \nfactual conclusions, predictions so sound they were without possibility \nof error. So supremely confident was the partisan opposition that the \nPresident's plan passed by just a single-vote margin in the House and \nthe Senate.\n  Today, the same people whose confident predictions of economic \ndisaster have been proven so totally wrong are making confident \nassertions about how easy it will be to balance the budget.\n  We are hearing with increased frequency that nothing but a freeze is \nneeded to balance the budget by the year 2002, so States and cities \nneed not worry that programs that target funds for them will be \nseriously affected.\n  The same people who so confidently predicted in 1993 that the \nPresident's budget plan would lead to economic disaster, and who have \nbeen proven so totally wrong, are now asking us to have confidence in \ntheir claims that balancing the budget won't be difficult because it \ncan be done by freezing spending.\n  The same people who want Americans to believe this are hoping no one \nwill notice that they're using the exact opposite argument about \ndefense spending.\n  The defense budget has been frozen since 1987. It has been about $280 \nbillion a year. According to the logic of those who say balancing the \nbudget will be painless if you just freeze all spending, we should \nexpect defense resources to be what they were in 1987.\n  But that is not what you are hearing. What you are hearing is that \ndefense has suffered deep cuts, that spending reductions have done all \nsorts of damage, and, to the contrary, that we must increase spending \nfor the military if we are to avert imminent disaster.\n  But in freeze terms, there haven't been any spending reductions. \nThere just hasn't been inflation-adjusted growth. That, we are told, \nisn't a cut--it's a freeze.\n  Since 1987, the dollar amounts available to the Pentagon have \nremained steady in nominal dollars--and that's exactly what a freeze \nis.\n  Since 1987, the number of Army divisions has fallen from 28 to 20, \nAir Force fighter wings have fallen from 36 to 22, the Navy fleet has \nbeen trimmed from 568 ships to 387, and the number of men and women in \nuniform has fallen from 2.2 million to 1.6 million.\n  The military has discovered that a freeze is not a freeze because \nresources do not stay frozen. Instead, divisions and fighter wings melt \naway. That is because $280 billion just does not go as far in 1995 as \nit did in 1987.\n  It does not take a mathematical genius to figure this out.\n  I do not think anyone in America would have much trouble figuring out \nthat living in 1995 on what they earned in 1987 would mean some \ncutbacks. I do not think most Americans have trouble figuring out that \nif they had exactly the same dollar amounts to spend on rent and food \nand clothing today that they spent in 1987, they would be buying a lot \nless of everything.\n  This is why our city mayors and our Governors are wondering what will \nhappen to their budgets and the services they are responsible for under \nthis freeze theory. No wonder they are concerned. They should be.\n  The proposed balanced budget amendment sets very strong conditions \nand standards to be applied to the budget.\n  It would require a three-fifths majority, not a simple majority, to \nraise the debt ceiling or adopt a budget that is out of balance.\n  This so-called supermajority is the Senate's filibuster rule. All of \nAmerica had a good taste of how the filibuster rule worked in the 103d \nCongress. It brought work to a full stop. It put into the hands of a \nminority the power to bargain for, hold hostage, blackmail, or simply \nblock anything they wanted.\n  The Constitution is straightforward about the few instances in which \nmore than a majority of the Congress must vote: A veto override, a \ntreaty, and a finding of guilt in an impeachment proceeding. Every \nother action by the Congress is taken by majority vote.\n  The Founders debated the idea of requiring more than a majority to \napprove legislation. They concluded that putting such immense power \ninto the hands of a minority ran squarely against the democratic \nprinciple. Democracy means majority rule, not minority gridlock.\n  Even the Senate, with its veneration for the filibuster rule, limits \nits reach when it comes to the budget. The Senate has specifically \nprotected the reconciliation process against manipulation by a \nminority. You cannot filibuster a reconciliation bill.\n  When we seek to override a veto or ratify a treaty, two-thirds of \nthose present and voting decide the issue. If 10 Senators are absent, a \nveto can be overridden by 60 votes instead of the 67 needed when \nthere's full attendance. If 15 Senators are absent, we can ratify a \ntreaty with 57 votes.\n  But when an absolute number of 60 ``yes'' votes is needed, absent \nMembers--Senators who don't even show up to vote--have the same power \nto affect the outcome as if they were present to cast a ``no'' vote.\n  In addition, the proposal before us requires that a majority of the \nentire body, not of those present and voting, is required for the \napproval of any revenue increase and that such approval shall require a \nrollcall vote.\n  I do not understand why we would permit 47 of 88 Senators on the \nfloor to vote the country into war--as we would, if that were the issue \nand 12 Senators were absent--but we should never allow fewer than 51 \nSenators to vote for the smallest revenue increase.\n  This means accelerated gridlock. The Senate could not act on anything \nthat involved revenues, no matter how trivial, if the outcome were \nclose, if just one Senator were absent--not an uncommon occurrence. If \none Senator is absent, and the body is evenly split on an issue, a 50-\nvote win would not suffice. I need not remind anyone how often we \nlegislate with more than one absentee.\n  The proposal requires that this vote be taken by a rollcall. That \nmeans the end of any voice-voted conference reports that include any \nrevenues, no matter how trivial, and no matter how broadly supported.\n  These will strike some as minimal objections to a grand scheme, but \nit is often over the most trivial things that grand schemes come to an \nunhappy end.\n  A failure to observe the requirement would open any law to challenge \nin the courts, as having been enacted unconstitutionally.\n  There are already many Americans, including well-respected economists \nand nonpartisan political observers, who think the effect of a \nconstitutional commandment to balance the budget will be a series of \never-more-ingenious evasions by the Congress.\n  They believe that as the difficulties and inconveniences of living up \nto the promise are encountered in the real world, Congress will create \nloopholes just as it has changed other budgeting laws when they became \ninconvenient in past years.\n  But it is one thing to change statutory budget law. It is quite \nanother to play fix-up games with the Constitution.\n  I support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget because \nonly the Constitution commands universal respect. But I am seriously \nconcerned that the amendment must be crafted carefully. Otherwise, it \nwill invite tampering with a constitutional requirement that will \nundermine that universal respect which we all now recognize.\n  Perhaps we should consider adopting, as a Senate rule, the \nrequirements on voting that are now embodied in the measure.\n  Let us see on a practical basis whether it makes sense to give a \nminority the right to block this year's budget resolution.\n  If this is a good idea to impose on a Congress in which many of \ntoday's Members will not serve, let us consider imposing it on this \nCongress, in which we are all serving. And if not, let us at least \nconsider modifying this language to more closely conform to the \nconstitutional standards for voting on other important legislation.\n   [[Page S1750]] In the present climate of contract-induced hysteria, \nI suppose many are ready to pledge their lives and sacred honor on \ntheir willingness to be present and vote for each and every cent of \nrevenue that may ever be raised in the unknowable future.\n  But how strongly will new Congresses, not in the grip of hysteria, \nfeel about this provision?\n  I note that the House does not intend to apply this requirement as a \nHouse rule when it considers the contract's tax cut bill. I wonder if \nthat is because it is expected that bill will contain some revenue-\nraising offsets as well as spending cuts?\n  The proposal before us has little in the way of interpretative \nlanguage. It is unclear what constitutes a revenue increase. If a tax \nbenefit expires, for example, does that constitute a revenue increase \nwithin the meaning of this language? Does it mean we cannot simply \nallow it to expire but must take affirmative action to vote in favor of \ndoing what an earlier Congress already determined should be done? Would \na taxpayer have standing to sue if a tax benefit expired without an \naffirmative vote?\n  I hope this facet of the proposal can be clarified. I think Americans \nhave a right to know what this language means.\n  We are often told that if the average family can balance its budget, \nwe ought to be able to balance the Federal budget. I do not know how \nmany American families pay for their houses with a single cash payment \nor buy their cars cash down. I know that is not too common in South \nDakota.\n  Likewise, we are told the States balance their budgets each year, and \nso the Federal Government should balance its budget each year.\n  But this is not true, either. States balance their books each year. \nThey do not balance their budgets. State debt has, in fact, been \nrising. State debt rose by $26 billion from 1991 to 1992--8 percent. \nState debt has been rising because States are not balancing their \nbudgets. They are balancing their books.\n  That is what families with mortgages, car payments, and credit card \ndebt to. It is what every business in the country does.\n  Today, the only entity for which investment and operating costs are \nconsidered interchangeable is the Federal Government. That is something \nthat deserves more attention than it has received so far.\n  Another popular idea floating about is that the Consumer Price Index \nso greatly overstates the inflation rate that it could be taken at a \nthird of its value, thus saving enormous amounts of money.\n  The only thing wrong with this is that is not true. It is wishful \nthinking. The measurement of all economic statistics undergoes a \ncontinuous process of refinement, regardless of which political party \nis in power. The Consumer Price Index is in the process of being \nreviewed in this fashion, and the process ought to be left alone. We do \nnot need hopeful economic statistics. We need accurate ones.\n  The thing supporters of this convenient theory do not want Americans \nto remember is that if the value of the consumer price index were \nhalved, the indexing of tax deductions would also be halved.\n  Today, because of the 1986 tax reform bill, the amount of income that \nis excluded from taxes rises along with the cost of living each year.\n  If the Consumer Price Index is devalued, what you get is a backdoor \ntax hike. It will cause taxes to rise significantly, compared to \ninflation. No surprise, the people paying the bulk of the increased \ntaxes will be working, middle-class people whose income comes from \nsalaries and wages, not interest earnings and investments.\n  I said at the outset that there is no magic to balancing the budget. \nYou do it by cutting spending or increasing revenues. Those who are \nrelying on spending freezes or understated consumer price indexes plan \nto use revenues. They just do not want to admit it.\n  The reality is that, if we are going to balance the budget by 2002, \nwe ought to face up to the fact that it will be a difficult process. It \nwill be difficult, because it will mean asking people to give up \nservices and benefits they are used to receiving.\n  That is why I so strongly believe that if we're going to do this, \npeople deserve to find out what is involved.\n  The State officers who deal with State budgets have produced \nestimates of the cost to every State of a balanced Federal budget, \nbased on the funds that States receive today from the Federal \nGovernment. Although the degree of dependence on Federal benefits \nvaries, on average, at least one-fifth of State budgets is now \ncomprised of Federal funds.\n  These are the so-called ``discretionary domestic spending'' funds \nthat are the target of the freeze idea. They are the programs directly \nat risk if we decide to balance the budget by not taking inflation into \naccount and simply keeping all programs level in nominal dollars for \nthe next 7 years.\n  Some say the success of the President's budget plan of 1993 means \nthere is no need to amend the Constitution. I would like to be able to \nagree. But the razor-thin, one-vote margins by which we succeeded in \n1993 are a slender reed on which to rest our prosperity in the next \ncentury.\n  At the same time, the deficit of today and the politics of today are \nnot what they were in 1979, when I first proposed a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  In the intervening years, we have been subjected to free-lunch \npromises, to tax hikes called ``revenue enhancements'' and ``user \nfees,'' to budgets with magical asterisks that stand for spending cuts \nthat cannot be outlined, and prophecies of one disaster after another. \nWe reinvented our Tax Code with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The 1986 \nreform is not even a decade old, and it's already being denounced by \nsome who voted for it. The Speaker of the House says we must now scrap \nthe income tax and turn instead to a national sales tax.\n  It is not surprising that Americans don't know what to think or whom \nto trust. I doubt that anyone casting a ballot last November thought he \nor she had just voted to impose a national sales tax on themselves. \nBecause of the speed with which these ideas flash in and out of the \npolitical spotlight, and because each reappearance of an old \ndiscredited idea tricked out in brand-new slogans adds to the general \nconfusion, I have concluded that it is no longer enough to establish a \nsimple constitutional command to balance the budget.\n  This time, I believe the American people have a right to know what it \nis that we are proposing to do. So I have introduced and, with the \nsupport of over 40 of my colleagues, will be fighting for, the Right to \nknow Act, a resolution whose adoption should precede passage of the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment.\n  I had always hoped that if the Senate ever were to undertake a debate \non a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, our debate would \nbe characterized by seriousness and honesty, not slogans and sound \nbites.\n  I hoped that because it seems to me that what the elected officials \nof Government say and do about the taxes that citizens pay to \nGovernment is as important as anything we do. People work hard for \ntheir wages. Families in my State of South Dakota do not earn the kinds \nof salaries that the aristocracy of wealth here in Washington considers \nnormal. They deserve to have their taxes taken seriously.\n  That is why I am concerned about the freeze hoax and the other \nissue--dodging that is going on around here. It sounds too much like \nthe stuff we have been hearing for years.\n  It does not matter whether you quote David Stockman, Reagan's first \nBudget Director, who concluded, ``After 4 years, I'm convinced a large \nshare of the problem is us. By that I mean Republicans,'' or you quote \nRonald Reagan, who said, ``This administration is committed to a \nbalanced budget and we will fight to the last blow to achieve it in \n1984.''\n  The bottom line is that, when they had the power, they did not fight \nto cut the deficit. When President Clinton proposed to cut the deficit, \nthey fought, all right. They fought him.\n  I have tried to play by the rules. That is why I began with a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget when I was first elected \nto Congress. But it seems that the rules keep changing.\n  [[Page S1751]] When the President offers real cuts, fight him, \nmisrepresent his program, predict disaster, obstruct, vote no. Then, \nwhen you are proven wrong, stick to your guns. When you are asked to be \nspecific, duck the question. Say it will not be too tough. Talk about a \nnational sales tax. Change the subject.\n  That is not my idea of responsible legislating.\n  This year--again, no surprise--we have the new House majority leader \nannouncing that he is not about to present an honest accounting of what \nyou have to cut to balance the budget, because, and I quote him \ndirectly, ``The fact of the matter is that once Members of Congress \nknow exactly, chapter and verse, the pain that the Government must live \nwith in order to get a balanced budget, their knees will buckle.''\n  He knows his membership better than I do. But none of us, including \nHouse Republicans, were sent here to do the easy stuff. We were sent \nhere to do the work. We are being paid to do it, and it is about time \nwe buckled down and did it.\n  I have listened to much talk, on and off the Senate floor, for many \nyears now about the balanced budget. The longer I am here, the more \nobvious it is that those who talk the most act the least.\n  That is why this year I say, no more. I have had enough. We have \nheard the evasions, the hypocrisies, the half-truths and all the rest.\n  I sincerely believe that people on both sides of the aisle truly want \nto achieve a meaningful way with which to accomplish a balance Federal \nbudget by the year 2002. This year, I say Americans cannot accept \nsimply our promise to do so. They cannot accept simply our version of \nTrust us. Americans have the right to know what this means. They have a \nright to know how we will spell it out, how we will set it out, how we \nwill let the people share in our decisionmaking. That is now up to us.\n  What I propose is that we trigger the reconciliation process, the \nprocess that does not let a minority hold us hostage, and start now on \nhow we might go about reducing the deficit for the next 7 years. Let \nMembers set the budget path to a balanced Federal budget by the year \n2002. That is the heart of the right-to-know amendment. It is not just \nhot air or empty talk about people's knees buckling.\n  I want to know and the American people ought to know what all this \ntalk means. If they cannot answer that question for the American \npeople, they cannot answer it for me or anyone else. So today, let the \nSenate begin this debate with high expectations, with a realization \nthat we cannot fail, with appreciation of what we must do to make this \nan honest debate. Let Senators make an informed judgment, and let \nSenators let the American people be a part of it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Laurence \nBlock, Victor Cabral, Michael O'Neill, Steven Schlesinger, and \nElizabeth Kessler, detailees, be granted floor privileges for the \nremainder of this calendar year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to advocate passage of \nthe balanced budget amendment, a measure which will fundamentally \nchange the direction our Government has taken in the last 25 years.\n  Mr. President, if the people of this country said anything last \nNovember, it is that we should change the course of this country. The \nmost important thing we can do to show the American people that we \nheard their call and that we are acting on it is to pass this balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  During the last 25 years, Congress has become desensitized to the \nenormity of the fiscal and moral harm its habitual deficit spending is \ncausing this country. Those of us who support the balanced budget \namendment believe that, contrary to the thrust of many arguments that \nwe will be hearing in the next few days, weeks, or even months, budget \ndeficits of this magnitude are not the norm. With the exception of \ndeficit spending during wartime, this country grew to be the most \npowerful on Earth while enjoying increasingly high standards of living \nwithout spending excessively.\n  But during the last few decades, we have accumulated a national debt \nof $4.4 trillion, nearly $18,000 for every man, woman, and child in \nthis country. In fact, every child that is born today owes $18,000. \nThat is not a birthright; that is a birth-wrong. Our per capita debt \nhas increased more than sevenfold in the last 18 years. I do not think \nit is coincidence that at the same time there has arisen a crisis of \nconfidence in the Government among many segments of our society.\n  We have now become the largest debtor nation in history, and a large \nportion of that debt is held by foreign interests. We have mortgaged \nour children's future in the very way Thomas Jefferson feared and \nwarned us about 200 years ago.\n  He said:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Since the beginning of our slide down the slippery slope of deficit \nspending 25 years ago, it has become more and more evident that the \nproblem is due in part to an inherent weakness in the way Congress goes \nabout its business. The deficit is a result of the fact that it has \nbecome harder and harder to raise taxes but all too easy to increase \nspending.\n  The voters made themselves perfectly clear on this matter last \nNovember. To them, the deficit is not a result of the Government taxing \ntoo little. It is the result of Government spending too much. That is a \nsimple concept instinctively grasped by our people but until now has \nseemed beyond the reach of Congress.\n  It is at this critical juncture that a balanced budget amendment \nwould inject the element of accountability into the process. It should \nbe just as hard for the Government to borrow as it is for the \nGovernment to raise taxes.\n  The balanced budget amendment would set up a tension in Congress when \nwe deliberate over borrowing, taxing, and spending. And we need that \ntension, Mr. President. Other less drastic attempts to accomplish this \nchange in attitude have failed. Gramm-Rudman was not allowed to \nfunction as its authors had planned. Too much was exempted from it. And \nevery time its mandatory sequester treatment came into play, Congress \nbacked down. The 1990 budget agreement did not hold water. We raised \ntaxes, but real budget cuts never followed.\n  Budget deficits are doing enormous harm. Aside from the selfishly \nshortsighted way in which we are treating future generations, the \nimpact of deficit spending already has begun to sap our economy. The \nGovernment is borrowing and spending money that would otherwise serve \nas capital needed for economic growth and job creation. Our standard of \nliving no longer continues to rise in this country.\n  Our parents used to think that it was a matter of course that their \nchildren would have a better standard of living than they did. That is \nno longer the case. We are crippling the productive engine of our \nsociety and cheating those who make it run. Wealth that should be \navailable as seed corn for the creation of new wealth and jobs is \ninstead being consumed.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment are now demanding that its \nsupporters first reveal exactly how they plan to balance the budget. I \nwould ask instead, when were the American people ever told precisely \nhow they would be driven into a $4.4 trillion debt?\n  Did we ask the American people every time we forced them into this \ndrastic debt? Was it explained to them that the Government was imposing \nsuch a burden on their children and grandchildren? How does every other \ngovernment entity in America except Congress manage to write a balanced \nbudget?\n  They determine what they have to spend, and then they set their \nspending priorities. That is how they do it. They set a balanced budget \nand then they say, OK, that is what we have to spend. \n[[Page S1752]] Here is how we are going to do it. They figure it out.\n  Every business, every household, every city, every county, and every \nState government in America does it. There is only one entity in this \ncountry that does not have a balanced budget and continues to function, \nand that has been the Congress of the United States.\n  Mr. President, this is the budget of Henderson, TX. It is a lot of \ncomputer pages. Henderson is a town of 11,000 people. They are very \nproud that they have a balanced budget. That is why they put this sign \non the front of their budget.\n  The balanced budget for Henderson, TX, is $8 million; one-quarter of \nthis budget is from unfunded Federal mandates. So 11,139 people in the \ncity of Henderson, TX, have to split $2 million of unfunded mandates to \npay for it--$2 million extra over 11,000 people.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that this Congress has made some progress \non unfunded mandates. But as we proceed to give relief to the people of \nHenderson, TX, and cities like it all across America, I hope we are \nalso going to learn a lesson from cities that know how to balance their \nbudget. The city council says to itself, we have $8 million in revenue, \nand we are going to spend no more than $8 million.\n  Many of the strongest voices being raised in opposition to this \nmeasure are the very ones, Mr. President, who are afraid that the \nbalanced budget will work. They are unwilling to make the hard choices \nit will force on those in Congress. I can understand their reluctance \neven if I do not sympathize with it. In fact, the harm we are causing \nwith continued deficit spending is precisely the kind of Government \nfolly which the Constitution ought to prevent. We ought to prevent it \nin the Constitution, and that is what we are trying to do today.\n  I would like to close my remarks with another warning from Thomas \nJefferson. He saw all too well the potential for tragedy if the young \nRepublic were to taste the forbidden fruit of borrowing against its \nfuture. He said:\n\n       There does not exist an engine so corruptive of the \n     Government and so demoralizing of the Nation as a public \n     debt. It will bring us more ruin at home than all the enemies \n     from abroad.\n\n  Mr. President, he could say those words today, and it would be even \nmore fitting.\n  Now, I do not think that Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding \nFathers could ever have dreamed of a $4.4 trillion debt, but I will say \nthis. Had they known that this was possible, I think they would have \ntaken steps to prevent it in the Constitution.\n  I think it is incumbent upon us to say to the future generations of \nour country we are going to take the steps that will assure that every \nchild born in this country will not be born with an $18,000 debt \nhanging over his or her head.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, who is leading the \ncharge for this balanced budget amendment. We must pass this \nconstitutional amendment so that Congress can no longer, by majority \nvote, encumber our children and future generations with what we want to \nspend today as a matter of convenience.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her excellent remarks and for her valiant efforts in trying \nto pass a balanced budget amendment. Without people like Senator \nHutchison, I do not think we would be as far along as we are.\n  I have to say, when she arrived in the Congress, it gave a lot of us \nhope that we might be able to get this far. Now we have to see that we \nget far enough to pass the balanced budget amendment by the requisite, \nat least 67, votes in the Senate. That is not easy to do, but we are \ngoing to be about doing it and going to do everything we can.\n  Thanks to our distinguished friend from Texas for the work she is \ndoing in trying to help bring this about.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, and, of course, our \nfriend and colleague, the President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator \nThurmond, for the excellent remarks they made earlier in the day.\n  When I think of Senator Thurmond, I think of 40 years here in the \nU.S. Senate, 38 of which have been spent trying to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment. If we do finally pass this amendment through the \nSenate in the exact form that the House sent it over, I think Senator \nThurmond will deserve a great deal of credit for all of his work \nthrough all of those years.\n  I also would like to praise Senator Craig for his excellent work. He \nis one of the leaders on this bill. He has been ever since he was the \nleader in the House. He does an awful lot of the coordination and the \nwork behind the scenes to see that we all get where we want to be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are, of course, at the outset of a \ndebate on a profound and important issue to the future of the United \nStates, a debate on the Constitution itself and on whether or not it \nshould be amended to require or to encourage balanced budgets and, if \nso, how.\n  I hope to have a number of occasions on which to speak on this \namendment, but in this first try, rather than to outline what is in it \nor even to deal with the important reasons for its passage which have \nalready been explained with considerable eloquence by previous speakers \nthis afternoon, I would like to share a few observations on the nature \nof the debate on which we are embarking.\n  First, we will be faced with a demand during the course of this \ndebate that its proponents outline precisely and specifically, perhaps \neven to the extent of a specific bill with various mandatory \nrequirements included in it how a balanced budget will be reached by \nthe year 2002. And during the course of that debate, what is likely to \nbe obscured will be the alternatives to this constitutional amendment.\n  It seems to me--and I stand to be corrected by my good friend from \nUtah if he has any addition to this group--that Members of the Senate \nwill be divided essentially into three groups during the course of this \ndebate.\n  First is that group represented by the Senator from Utah himself and \nthe other sponsors, which will include those Members who feel that it \nis vitally important for the future of this country that the budget of \nthe United States, in most years, absent emergencies, be balanced; that \na continuation of the fiscal policies of the past, not just the recent \npast but almost the entire past since the end of World War II, of \nincreasing budget deficits, of passing on a greater and greater debt to \nour children and grandchildren must be brought to an end and are \nunlikely to be brought to an end by any course of action less drastic \nthan certain constitutional requirements. I believe, and I am sure my \nfriend from Utah joins me in this belief, that a significant majority \nof the Members of this body hold to that belief.\n  The other two groups are less likely, it seems to me, to speak \ncandidly and directly to their fundamental philosophies, but I suspect \nthat there are some Members of this body who believe that it is \nimportant to reach a balanced budget but that we should try some method \nother than a constitutional amendment by which to attain that goal. I \ncan speak rather fervently with respect to that group because 10 years \nago that was the group to which I belonged. I voted against predecessor \nproposals of this nature on the basis that the Congress itself should \nact responsibly enough to balance the budget without the constraints of \na constitutional amendment. And in fact, I played some minor role in \nthe passage of the Gramm-Rudman Act in the mid 1980's, which was a \nstatutory attempt to reach the goal now sought by this constitutional \namendment. And in fact, Gramm-Rudman for 2 or 3 years was effective, at \nleast in leading to smaller deficits.\n   [[Page S1753]] But once the requirements of Gramm-Rudman required \nreal sacrifice, real spending cuts, Gramm-Rudman was effectively \nabandoned by the Congress and budget deficits once again increased. As \na consequence, it is my perspective, at least, that a statutory \napproach, a year-by-year approach simply will not result in our \nreaching a goal of a balanced budget.\n  I hope, however, that if there are Members of this body who stand for \na balanced budget but against this constitutional amendment, they will \nclearly and emphatically say this is their goal, and since they are \nasking for a particular, specific blueprint of how we should reach that \ngoal under the constitutional amendment, those Members should share \nwith us their viewpoint of when and how they believe we should balance \nthe budget without the constraints of this amendment.\n  To this point, Mr. President, while I have heard many pious \nstatements about the necessity for fiscal responsibility on the part of \nopponents to this amendment, not one, to the best of my ability to \njudge, either inside this body or outside this body, has told us how we \nreach that goal without this constraint.\n  The third group, and I believe firmly that this group of Members will \nembody the great bulk of those who will vote against the constitutional \namendment in any event and the great bulk of those who will set up the \nsmokescreen that we must set out exactly the road by which we are going \nto reach this constitutional amendment, Mr. President, I believe the \ngreat bulk of those Members do not believe a balanced budget either to \nbe a desirable goal for the United States of America or at least, if it \nis a goal, it is only a secondary or tertiary one that does not amount \nto much and is not nearly as important as the spending programs which \nthey advocate increasing or protecting from reductions.\n And, as far as I can tell, the debate, at least in this body among its \n100 Members, will divide all of us among those three groups and among \nno others.\n\n  I predict that the great majority--not all, the great majority of \nthose who want this blueprint want this blueprint not to guide us to a \nbalanced budget but to buttress their arguments that we never should \nbalance the budget under any circumstances, that the pain is simply too \ngreat and that for one reason or another, at least during our careers, \nwe can continue to put on the cuff $150 billion, $200 billion, $400 \nbillion a year.\n  We have in this liberal administration great pride expressed as \nrecently as last week in the State of the Union Address, over the \nreduction in budget deficits during the course of the last 2 or 3 \nyears. We are rarely told, and then only in footnotes or in the back \npages of long dusty dry documents, that current policies will result in \na turnaround of those budgeted deficit reductions and increases in the \ndeficit to $200, $250, $300, $350, $400 billion a year by and after the \nturn of the century.\n  So there really are no easy answers. You either believe that a \nbalanced budget is a socially desirable goal, a goal worth sacrificing \nfor, or you do not. If you do not, you ought to be willing to say, \nexpressly, that you do not, that it simply is not as important. That it \nis more important to carry on with present spending policies than it is \nto balance the budget.\n  I believe that this grouping of three even applies to those who \nbelieve in a balanced budget but believe that it should be attained not \nprimarily or exclusively by cutting spending but primarily or \nexclusively by increasing tax rates. It is certainly appropriate for a \nMember here to vote for this constitutional amendment on the basis that \nhe or she will increase taxes to reach those goals in the year 2002 as \nit is to hold the opposite point of view, that the goal should be \nreached by reductions in spending, if those Members are willing to \nstand up and say this is the way, if my ideas are in power, I will \nreach that goal.\n  In fact, I believe that to be the best argument, the overwhelming \nargument, against anyone attempting to provide a 7- or 8-year blueprint \ntoday on the way in which a balanced budget will be reached. This \nCongress can bind this Congress, that is the next 2 years. It cannot \nbind the Congress which will take office in 1997 or in 1999 or in the \nyear 2001. In fact, if we were to pass an express blueprint it would \nundoubtedly be changed by each of those Congresses. If those of a \nliberal persuasion who are today in the minority once again take over a \nmajority and operate under the constraints of this constitutional \namendment, they may very well decide to reach its goals by increasing \ntaxes on the American people over the objection of those of us who do \nnot believe that is the way to go. If so, let them say so. Let them \ngive us their blueprint for reaching the goals which are set by this \nconstitutional amendment itself.\n  It seems to me, therefore, that this is the argument. Does one \nbelieve, against all history, that a balanced budget is a desirable \ngoal, a vitally important goal, but that we can do it by engaging in \nbusiness as usual? Does one believe that it is not a goal at all? Does \none, as many will on the liberal side of this body, believe that \nbusiness as usual is just fine and we should go on in the future in \nexactly the way we have gone on in the past, spending more money than \nwe take in, passing new programs that are not paid for? Let them stand \nup eloquently and firmly for the status quo. But I do not believe the \nstatus quo, either with respect to the Constitution or promises that \nCongress will somehow automatically act differently in the future than \nit has in the past, are what the people of this country want. I think \nthey want us to change the very way in which we are doing business. I \nbelieve they want imposed on us constraints that are, by their very \nnature, imposed on them in their daily lives, on their families, on \nthem as individuals, and are imposed by the very fact we control the \nmoney supply on our local governments and on our State governments, \nwhich now must balance their budgets.\n  I am convinced that the vast majority of the American people want \nimposed on us those individual and local and State government \nconstraints which have been a part of their lives as long as any of \nthem or us have been around, and that the real debate here is between \nthe status quo and a different way of doing business. I believe that \nthose who are promoting this constitutional amendment are not satisfied \nwith the record of Congress for years, for decades, and want a new and \ndifferent way of doing business.\n  One point which I think is often overlooked is to a certain extent \neven the title balanced budget amendment is in part a misnomer. This \nconstitutional amendment, when it is in full force and effect, will not \nmandate a balanced budget in any given year or over a period of years. \nIt will, however, make unbalanced budgets much more difficult to pass \nin the future. It will require, to pass an unbalanced budget, that the \naffirmative votes of 60 percent of the Members of this body and of the \nHouse of Representatives must be secured. That is to say under most \ncircumstances--under all circumstances, for the better part of the last \ntwo decades--it will require a bipartisan majority to create an \nunbalanced budget. It will not be something which takes place as a \nresult of a narrow partisan party-line vote. It will require the \nthoughts and the assent of Members of both major political parties in \nthe country and, therefore, almost automatically will be accomplished \nin a more thoughtful and broadminded fashion when it is accomplished.\n  It will also, however, greatly constrain the ability of Members to \nbegin new, unfunded spending programs. And that is its goal. When there \nis a crisis, however, it will be possible by that 60 percent majority \nvote to make an exception and not to balance the budget. It is a \nflexible and not a rigid constitutional amendment.\n  My final thought in these opening remarks is that I firmly believe \nthat the men who wrote our Constitution in 1787 would have included a \nsupermajority requirement themselves if they had been able to foresee \nthe dynamics of politics in the late 20th century.\n  How many people asking for action by the Government who come into \nyour office come into that office asking for financial restraint, for \ngeneral responsibility? How many in comparison with those who come into \nyour office asking for a favor from the Federal Government, an \nappropriation, the protection of an existing program, an increase in an \nexisting program, or the creation of a new one?\n One to two? \n[[Page S1754]] Probably not that many. This is not to criticize those \nwho come to us asking us to support one of the thousands of programs \nfinanced by the Federal Government. In many cases, in almost all cases, \nthese are sincere, hardworking, and dedicated citizens to a certain end \nand the programs for which they ask, the program they support, has \ngenuine positive social ends. They may not be well administered, but \nthe goal which they seek is a good one. Therefore, it is easier for \nMembers to say yes than it is to say no, and infinitely easier when we \ncan put the costs on the cut, when we do not have to cut something \nelse, when we do not have to increase taxes, when we can just borrow \nfor that program.\n  This supermajority requirement will make that decision on our part \nsomewhat more difficult because we will be unable to say yes unless we \nare willing to vote for more taxes at the same time or find a better \nprogram which can be cut at the same time. And it will provide a \nbalance between the special interests, the specific interests of the \nindividuals who lobby us and the general interests in a responsible and \nfiscally sound Federal Government which is I believe exactly the \nbalance that the Founding Fathers wished when they created the \nConstitution in the first place without any ability to predict the way \nin which we communicate and deal with issues like this today.\n  So in the finest sense of the word this constitutional amendment is a \nconservative move. It desires to conserve what is best in our country \nand in its Government and its governmental programs. It will make us \nmore responsible. It will require us to weigh one desirable program \nagainst another in a far better and more evenhanded fashion than we \nwere able to do in the past.\n  As we go through this debate, Mr. President, I hope those who are \nwatching it across the country will remember that there are really only \nthree points of view being expressed here no matter how eloquent or how \nwell those views are given. One is a balanced budget is not a \nparticularly good idea. We do not need it. The status quo is just fine. \nThe way this country has been run in the past is just fine, and we just \nneed more of the same thing.\n  No. 2 is, yes, a balanced budget is a good idea but there are easier \nways to get to it, less painful ways to get to it than to do it through \nthe Constitution of the United States. Those people need to explain to \nus how it is they can do in the future what they have been unable or \nunwilling to do in the past.\n  The third is we need to do things differently. We need to make \nchanges in this country. We need to require the Congress of the United \nStates to act in a fiscally responsible fashion. Those who hold that \npoint of view will be supporting this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n            a balanced budget amendment to the constitution\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor and \nstrong supporter of the resolution calling for a constitutional \namendment mandating a balanced budget. It appears that in the next few \ndays, the Senate will get still another opportunity to demonstrate to \nthe American public that we are serious about deficit reduction and \neconomic stability. The 300 to 132 bipartisan vote in the House of \nRepresentatives on January 26--12 more than what was needed--gives this \nresolution momentum that we cannot ignore.\n  I think that the momentum is also given by the selection of this \nresolution to be labeled--No. 1. It shows that this is a top priority \nof this Congress. Additional momentum has been given to the \nconsideration of this resolution by the fact that the Judiciary \nCommittee has moved rapidly and in an unprecedented manner to bring \nthis resolution to the floor of the Senate. Additional momentum was \ngiven in that the staff worked diligently to report this bill with a \nwritten report in just a matter of a few short days.\n  I congratulate Chairman Hatch for his leadership in giving this \nmomentum to bring forward to the Senate this very important resolution.\n  When Congress passed the largest deficit-reduction package in history \nin August 1993, It was a clear signal that most Members have finally \ncome to terms with the reality that something must be done to bring our \nnational debt and yearly deficits under control. While this legislation \nwas an important first step in the long road toward a balanced budget, \nit was just that: a first step.\n  We know that reducing the deficit is important in the short term. But \nif we are going to ensure a stable economic future for our children and \ngrandchildren, these deficits must be completely eliminated in the long \nterm. That is precisely the goal of this resolution to add a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  I do not take amending the Constitution lightly. I wish that the U.S. \nCongress had the discipline as an institution to take the steps \nnecessary on our own to eliminate the deficit without having to resort \nto such drastic action. But as we all know, that fiscal discipline and \nwill power simply are not there. We tried it with the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings approach and we had to give in, at least some gave in regard \nto that. The bottom line is clear: Fiscal responsibility should and \nmust be dictated by the Constitution.\n  Congress has made attempts in the past to bring the budget under \ncontrol, only to see them compromised away when the momentum shifted to \nanother issue, or another crisis. We have the momentum on our side once \nagain. It is important that we seize that momentum, submit approval of \nthis important amendment to the States, and finally put into place a \nmechanism by which our economic health will no longer be subject to the \nshifting currents of the day. We will know, first and foremost, that \nour budget priorities must be formulated under the dictates of our \ncherished Constitution. This amendment will provide the teeth we need \nto balance the Federal budget.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have supported and advocated a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. It was the first piece of \nlegislation I introduced as a first-term Senator in 1979, Since then, \nthe first bill I have introduced at the beginning of each new \nCongress--including the 104th--has been the balanced budget amendment.\n  Passage of this legislation has come close before. During the 97th \nCongress, a measure was passed with 69 votes in the Senate, but failed \nto garner the two-thirds necessary in the House of Representatives. In \nthe 99th Congress, after extended debate, passage in the Senate failed \nby only one vote. Just 1 year ago, the Senate narrowly defeated this \nlegislation by a vote of 63 to 37, only 4 short of the 67 required for \npassage.\n  I believe that it would have passed at that time, if the House had \nnot previous to that voted not to pass the resolution.\n  Now, in the 104th Congress, we have seen a series of political and \nfiscal developments that make the chances of passage greater than at \nany other time. The overwhelming vote in the House on January 26 gave \nthe amendment even greater momentum. The ever-increasing concern to do \nsomething about the deficit is intense. Our national debt is on the \nmind of every person who thinks about America's future.\n  For much of our history, a balanced budget at the national level of \nGovernment was a part of our ``unwritten constitution.'' A balanced or \nsurplus budget was the norm for the first 100 years of the republic. In \nrecent decades, however, Americans have witnessed a continuing cycle of \ndeficits, taxes, and spending. And neither political party has a \nmonopoly on virtue here: these fiscal policies have been pursued with \nequal fervor by Republicans and Democrats.\n  I have used the Thomas Jefferson quote on budget deficits before \nduring debates on this amendment, but it is worth mentioning again. He \nwarned, ``The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a \nrepublican government.'' Over the course of time, we have lost sight of \nJefferson's warning.\n  Some argue that if we possessed and practiced stronger discipline as \na legislative body, then such an amendment would be unnecessary. As I \nsaid before, I do not dispute that sentiment, only its reality. The \nlast balanced budget we had was under President Lyndon Johnson. The \nlast 18 years or so indicate \n[[Page S1755]] that the problem goes much deeper than individual and \ncollective resolve. Rather, it is the institutional structure of \nGovernment that encourages short-term responses to problems instead of \na focus on the greater good and the future.\n  There is no doubt about what our responsibilities as national leaders \nare. There is also no question as to what the American people want and \ndeserve. There is a question as to whether the Congress will respond \naffirmatively by accepting this challenge. We have the momentum and the \nopportunity to finally stop mortgaging the future and saddling our \nchildren with unconscionable debts.\n  I look forward to the debate in the coming days. I hope we will find \nthe strength and determination to do what we know must be done in order \nto restore our economic health.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1736-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1755-S1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I have spoken critically of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting and the whole system of public \nbroadcasting with which it is associated on this floor on some \noccasions, but I would like to compliment CPB for something its board \ndid last week.\n  The board decided to begin to require that the CPB will receive a \npercentage of income from sales exceeding $25,000 of toys, books, \nclothing, and other products related to shows funded by the CPB. I hope \nthat this will begin immediately to substitute for taxpayers' payments \nto the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  Mr. President, I have been one who has advocated reinventing or \npossibly privatizing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. That \nmeans the corporation here in Washington, DC. Each State has its State \npublic broadcasting system and a lot of them do a great deal of good in \nterms of education, and in terms of providing unique programming.\n  Indeed, it is my opinion that public broadcasting in South Dakota \nwould be better off under a privatized or a reinvented system of public \nbroadcasting.\n  I also want to commend the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in \nthat the executives, I understand, are starting some meetings with at \nleast one regional Bell operating company. I hope they meet with \nseveral cable companies and others to see how they can interact with \nthe information superhighway and perhaps provide other income and \nenrich programming in public broadcasting in the United States.\n  Last Friday, I had a fascinating conversation with Glen Jones, of \nJones Intercable of Colorado. He is privately providing educational \nmaterials and educational programming across the United States and \naround the world. He wants to expand upon this and finds it is a very \nmarketable and useful thing to do for public service, as well as in \nterms of promoting his own company.\n  In addition, there are many privately run cable channels elsewhere \nwhich are making a great contribution in terms of quality educational \nprogramming. Nickelodeon is making a great contribution to children's \nprogramming and is even marketing children's programming in France. The \nLearning Channel, the History Channel, Arts and Entertainment, the \nDisney Channel, and many more, are providing good programming with \nwhich our public TV friends could interact and could achieve a great \ndeal of income in some cases.\n  Earlier, I observed on this floor that we could privatize the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting and other entities in public \nbroadcasting; that if a private company would take a percentage of the \nprogram rights that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Public \nBroadcasting Service or National Public Radio just give away, it would \nmore than replenish the $300 million a year that the Congress gives the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting. That has been verified by many \ncorporate leaders who have told me they would like to buy public \nbroadcasting entities or they would like to participate in partnerships \nfor public broadcasting. These private sector leaders assured me they \nwould accept conditions requiring preservation of a certain amount of \nrural service or small city service or children's programming.\n  I have compared the situation to a local telephone company which is a \nprivate company but which has public service requirements such as \nuniversal telephone service.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is very appropriate that we should be \nworking on reinventing and privatizing the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting and public broadcasting in general. The Vice President, \nafter all, asks that Government be reinvented and that we try to \nprivatize certain agencies.\n  But I would strongly disagree with those who say we are trying to \nkill Barney or we are trying to kill children's programming. That is \njust not true. Or that we are trying to kill individual States' public \nbroadcast programs. That is simply not true. What we are trying to do \nis to be inventive.\n  We are facing a budgetary crisis of profound proportions. Let's face \nit: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting most likely at least will \nreceive a cut. We are in a situation where I think they would be \ngrateful for ideas on how they could make more money. One of those is \ngetting a percentage of the program revenues. Presently we have a lot \nof people making a lot of money from public broadcasting while the \ntaxpayers don't share the wealth.\n  Also, Mr. President, the corporation has to look at its distribution \nof funds. I do not think my State of South Dakota gets a very good \ndeal, very frankly. Much is made of $1.7 million in Federal funds that \nis sent to South Dakota. But the State legislature, individual \ncontributors, and corporate grants provide an overwhelming majority of \nthe funding.\n  If we take a look at where some of the money goes, one station in New \nYork gets about $20 million from Federal taxpayers. That is not the \nState of New York, that is one station. That station has executives \nearning between $200,000 and $400,000 a year.\n  We have the so-called Children's Television Workshop, which has, as \nSenator Dole has pointed out on this floor, paid salaries of between \n$400,000 and $600,000 a year. Those are taxpayers funds.\n  ``Well,'' they say, ``we take that money out of what is \ncontributed.'' But it all comes out of the same pot.\n  Now, I am not against people getting rich. I am not against people in \nthe private sector getting high salaries, but these folks wrap \nthemselves in the cloak of public service. They wrap themselves in the \nclothes of one serving the public and then collect taxpayers' money. \nMeanwhile, our States that are told, ``You are so lucky to get $1.7 \nmillion, you are so lucky, you should be so grateful.''\n  If you really look into it, most of the money is going to a small \npublic broadcasting clique--an east coast and inside-the-beltway gang.\n  I think the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting acted \ncorrectly the other day when it voted to start getting a percentage of \nprofits from the programs and related products. They should have done \nit long ago. I do not think they would have done it if it were not for \nthe pressure from people such as myself on the Senate floor and \nelsewhere. The taxpayers should get some relief. I am going to make \nsure they do.\n  There was a 1981-to-1984 study about privatizing public broadcasting \nand getting revenue from more commercial advertising. Make no mistake \nabout it, there are ads today on public radio and television. Granted, \nthey are called by the code word, ``underwriting,'' but they are ads \njust the same. This study found that the viewers were not offended by \nhaving ads at the beginning and end of programming or even more \nextensive ads. This is one source of revenue.\n  There are the programming rights. That is another source of revenue. \nThere is the chance to interact with the information highway. That is \nstill another potential source of revenue. So, I think the public \nbroadcasting executives should be creative in going \n[[Page S1756]] out and finding new sources of revenue and new sources \nof opportunity and, also, new sources of material.\n  I have been troubled by the fact that I think taxpayers' money is \nbeing used to lobby for more taxpayers' money. There is a nationwide \ngrassroots program to contact your Congressman to be sure to continue \nfull funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This is being \ndone, in part, with Federal money, in my opinion. If you ask, they say, \nthese are our affiliates doing this and they are doing it with money \nthat is contributed in these beg-a-thons, money being contributed \nprivately. But the contributors are not told that. They are told this \nis listener-supported radio and TV. They are not told part of their \nmoney will be used to lobby for Federal money. They should be told, \n``This is a taxpayer-supported channel. We get some private \ncontributions but much of it is taxpayer supported, both State and \nFederal.'' There should be honesty in these beg-a-thons.\n  But, also, let us be very careful about this business of lobbying for \nmore Federal money with Federal money. Here we have a very \nsophisticated group concentrated in Boston, New York, and Washington, \nDC, that is doing so. They are not saying, ``Senator Pressler wants to \nkeep public radio and TV at the State level.'' They are saying, \n``Anybody who wants to change anything is trying to kill public radio \nand TV.''\n  I submit that public broadcasting will be stronger when it is \nreinvented and privatized. I submit that the entire public broadcasting \nsystem has become bureaucratic, inefficient, and wasteful. Taxpayers \naround the country would be amazed at how much money is being wasted.\n  The 20th Century Fund did a study in which they found that 75 cents \nof every $1 in public TV is spent on overhead. That has not been \nrebutted. So those who serve on the oversight committees--and I chair \nthe Commerce Committee, which has a duty to conduct oversight over the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting--it is our job to dig into things, \nto make suggestions, maybe to take some heat. But it is not the job of \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the other public \nbroadcasting entities to put false information out across the country. \nThey are wrong when they say that people who are required to make \nbudget cuts and suggest ways to reinvent the system are trying to kill \nlocal public broadcasting. That is not the case.\n  There was local public broadcasting before the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting and its glut of Federal funding ever came along. In fact, \nsome people feel we would have a stronger set of local public stations \nhad the national Corporation for Public Broadcasting never been created \nin 1967.\n  We should think about that. Here we have a very intelligent, \nsophisticated, lobbying campaign that has people scared that their \npublic broadcasting channels will be shut off if this group here in \nWashington, DC, does not get their Federal money. That is not true. \nThat is not true at all. In fact, my State may well be better off in a \nreinvented or privatized system of public broadcasting. That is true of \nmost States.\n  Again, I congratulate the CPB board for doing what they should have \ndone long ago, getting a percentage of the program and product profits. \nThat will provide them with a good deal of revenue. It might provide \nmore revenue than they have ever gotten from the Federal Government, \nand that would not bother me a bit. I hope they continue to make such \nsteps.\n  I hope public broadcasting executives have many meetings with the \ncompanies that are on the information superhighway, ranging from local \ntelephone companies to cable companies to long distance companies to \ncomputer companies, to see what interrelation there can be.\n  Finally, I would like to know what is public broadcasting's own plan \nto reinvent itself? So far it seems only to be to get more Federal \nmoney, to stay just as things are, not to make any changes, and of \ncourse to be the self-appointed arbiters of American culture. But I am \nasking them to roll up their sleeves, get out, listen to a few people, \nand not expect increases in Federal funding because it will not be \ncoming.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the chairman for allowing \nme to speak at this point.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1755-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1756-S1757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   REPORT RELATIVE TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO LIBYA--\n                    MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 5\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since my last \nreport of July 18, 1994, concerning the national emergency with respect \nto Libya that was declared in Executive Order No. 12543 of January 7, \n1986. This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c); section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c); \nand section 505(c) of the International Security and Development \nCooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).\n  1. On December 22, 1994, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Libya pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal \nextended the current comprehensive financial and trade embargo against \nLibya in effect since 1986. Under these sanctions, all trade with Libya \nis prohibited, and all assets owned or controlled by the Libyan \ngovernment in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. \npersons are blocked.\n  2. There has been one amendment to the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, \n31 C.F.R. Part 550 (the ``Regulations''), administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control (FAC) of the Department of the Treasury, since \nmy last report on July 18, 1994. The amendment (59 Fed. Reg. 51106, \nOctober 7, 1994) identified Arab Hellenic Bank (AHB), an Athens-based \nfinancial institution, 4 other entities, and 10 individuals as \nSpecially Designated Nationals (SDNs) of Libya. (In addition to the \nrecent SDN action against AHB, the Greek central bank has recently \nannounced that AHB's banking license has been revoked.) Included among \nthe individuals are three Italian shareholders in Oilinvest \n(Netherlands) B.V., who increased their positions in the Libyan \ngovernment-controlled firm shortly before United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution (UNSCR) 883 directed a freeze on certain Libyan \nassets owned or controlled by the Government or public authorities of \nLibya.\n  Pursuant to section 550.304(a) of the Regulations, FAC has determined \nthat these entities and individuals designated as SDNs are owned or \ncontrolled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on \nbehalf of, the Government of Libya, or are agencies, instrumentalities, \nor entities of that government. By virtue of this determination, all \nproperty and interests in property of these entities or persons that \nare in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. \npersons are blocked. Further, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging \nin transactions with these individuals or entities unless the \ntransactions are licensed by FAC. The designations were made in \nconsultation with the Department of State and announced by FAC in \nnotices issued on June 17 and July 22 and 25, 1994. A copy of the \namendment is attached to this report.\n  3. During the current 6-month period, FAC made numerous decisions \nwith respect to applications for licenses to engage in transactions \nunder the Regulations, issuing 136 licensing determinations--both \napprovals and denials. Consistent with FAC's ongoing scrutiny of \nbanking transactions, the largest category of license approvals (73) \nconcerned requests by non-Libyan persons or entities to unblock bank \naccounts initially blocked because of an apparent Government of Libya \ninterest. The largest category of denials (41) was for banking \ntransactions in which FAC found a Government of Libya interest. Three \nlicenses were issued authorizing intellectual property protection in \nLibya.\n  In addition, FAC issued eight determinations with respect to \napplications from attorneys to receive fees and reimbursement of \nexpenses for provision of legal services to the Government of Libya in \nconnection with wrongful \n[[Page S1757]] death civil actions arising from the Pan Am 103 bombing. \nCivil suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia and in the Southern District of New York. Representation of \nthe Government\n of Libya when named as a defendant in or otherwise made a party to \ndomestic U.S. legal proceedings is authorized by section 550.517(b)(2) \nof the Regulations under certain conditions.\n\n  4. During the current 6-month period, FAC continued to emphasize to \nthe international banking community in the United States the importance \nof identifying and blocking payments made by or on behalf of Libya. The \nFAC worked closely with the banks to implement new interdiction \nsoftware systems to identify such payments. As a result, during the \nreporting period, more than 210 transactions involving Libya, totaling \nmore than $14.8 million, were blocked. As of December 9, 1994, 13 of \nthese transactions had been licensed to be released, leaving a net \namount of more than $14.5 million blocked.\n  Since my last report, FAC collected 15 civil monetary penalties \ntotaling more than $76,000 for violations of the U.S. sanctions against \nLibya. Nine of the violations involved the failure of banks to block \nfunds transfers to Libyan-owned or -controlled banks. Two other \npenalties were received for corporate export violations. Four \nadditional penalties were paid by U.S. citizens engaging in Libyan \noilfield-related transactions while another 76 cases of similar \nviolations are in active penalty processing.\n  In October 1994, two U.S. businessmen, two U.S. corporations, and \nseveral foreign corporations were indicted by a Federal grand jury in \nConnecticut on three counts of violating the Regulations and IEEPA for \ntheir roles in the illegal exportation of U.S origin fuel pumps to \nLibya. Various enforcement actions carried over from previous reporting \nperiods have continued to be aggressively pursued. The FAC has \ncontinued its efforts under the Operation Roadblock initiative. This \nongoing program seeks to identify U.S. persons who travel to and/or \nwork in Libya in violation of U.S. law.\n  Several new investigations of potentially significant violations of \nthe Libyan sanctions have been initiated by FAC and cooperating U.S. \nlaw enforcement agencies, primarily the U.S. Customs Service. Many of \nthese cases are believed to involve complex conspiracies to circumvent \nthe various prohibitions of the Libyan sanctions, as well as the \nutilization of international diversionary shipping routes to and from \nLibya. The FAC has continued to work closely with the Departments of \nState and Justice to identify U.S. persons who enter into contracts or \nagreements with the Government of Libya, or other third-country \nparties, to lobby United States Government officials or to engage in \npublic relations work on behalf of the Government of Libya without FAC \nauthorization. In addition, during the period FAC hosted or attended \nseveral bilateral and multilateral meetings with foreign sanctions \nauthorities, as well as with private institutions, to consult on issues \nof mutual interest and to encourage strict adherence to the U.N.-\nmandated sanctions.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from July 7, 1994, through January 6, 1995, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the Libyan national emergency are estimated at \napproximately $1.4 million. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the Office of the General Counsel, and the U.S. Customs \nService), the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce.\n  6. The policies and actions of the Government of Libya continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States. In adopting UNSCR 883 in November \n1993, the Security Council determined that the continued failure of the \nGovernment of Libya to demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation \nof terrorism, and in particular its continued failure to respond fully \nand effectively to the requests and decisions of the Security Council \nin UNSCRs 731 and 748, concerning the bombing of the Pan Am 103 and UTA \n772 flights, constituted a threat to international peace and security. \nThe United States continues to believe that still stronger \ninternational measures than those mandated by UNSCR 883, possibly \nincluding a worldwide oil embargo, should be imposed if Libya continues \nto defy the will of the international community as expressed in UNSCR \n731. We remain determined to ensure that the perpetrators of the \nterrorist acts against Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 are brought to justice. \nThe families of the victims in the murderous Lockerbie bombing and \nother acts of Libyan terrorism deserve nothing less. I shall continue \nto exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions \nagainst Libya fully and effectively, so long as those measures are \nappropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress \non significant developments as required by law.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe payment to States of per diem for veterans receiving adult day \nhealth care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n                        state veterans home act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the State \nVeterans Home Act of 1995. The bill extends discretionary authority to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a per diem payment for \nadult day health care for veterans. The bill also authorizes the use of \nfunds from the Extended Care Facilities Grants Program, section 8131, \nto construct or renovate existing facilities to provide adult day care \nfor veterans.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is similar to S. 852 \nintroduced at the beginning of the 103d Congress. In the last Congress, \nS. 852 was reported to the Senate as section 205 of S. 1030--Veterans \nHealth Programs Improvement Act of 1993--and passed by the Senate on \nMay 25, 1994. Regrettably due to the legislative log-jam at the end of \nthe 103d Congress, it was not incorporated into the veterans health \nbenefits measure, H.R. 3313, that passed the House in the closing days \nof the 103d Congress.\n   [[Page S1759]] I am very pleased that the bill I am introducing \ntoday is cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Dorgan, Akaka, Jeffords, \nPell, and Graham.\n  This legislation received support in the 103d Congress from veterans \nand their families in North Dakota, and from all major national \nveterans organizations during a hearing by the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs on June 23, 1993. I am hoping the 104th Congress will \nact expeditiously to pass this important health care measure for \nveterans. I am enclosing a letter of support from the National \nAssociation of State Veterans Homes.\n  Currently, under section 1741, the Department of Veterans Affairs is \nrequired to pay a per diem to States for each veteran that is assisted \nthrough the State Home Facilities Program with hospital, nursing home, \nor domiciliary care. The per diem payment is $15.11 for domiciliary \ncare, and $35.37 for nursing home and hospital care. Under section \n8131, State home facilities, the Department of Veterans Affairs is also \nauthorized to provide matching grant assistance for the construction, \nexpansion, or remodeling of existing facilities for domiciliary, \nnursing home, or hospital care for veterans who are eligible to reside \nin State veterans facilities.\n  Under the legislation that I am introducing today, the State Veterans \nHome Program would be amended to authorize a per diem payment for \nveterans that are assisted by States who provide adult day care \nincluding health care as needed. States would also be authorized to \napply for matching grant assistance to provide facilities for adult day \ncare. In fiscal year 1995, Congress appropriated $47.3 million under \nthe State Home Facilities Program for the construction or expansion of \nState extended care facilities for veterans.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed the proposed legislation to amend the \nState Veterans Home Program relating to adult day care health care with \nState veterans officials in North Dakota and representatives of the \nNational Association of State Veterans Homes. The arguments in support \nof amending the State Veterans Home Program to authorize adult day \nhealth care are compelling.\n  The opportunity for adult day health care services for veterans \nduring the daytime hours in a community setting would enable many \nveterans to remain at home with their families in a supportive \nenvironment as an alternative to nursing home placement.\n  I ask my colleagues, how many people do each of us know who are in \nthis circumstance? If the family could get relief during the day for a \nveteran who is ill or who is starting to fail, and would have a chance \nto have a place to go during the day, the family could take care of \nthat individual at night, thereby preventing nursing home placement.\n  For a veteran who may be in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease \nor require limited supervision in a post-operative period, the \nopportunity for adult day health care would meet the requirements of a \ngrowing number of our veterans population, and at less cost than \nnursing and residential home care. Equally important, adult day health \ncare would provide respite for the primary care givers of veterans.\n  People have often said to me: Senator, if we just had a chance to \nhave a break, if we just had a chance to be able to go to work and have \nour loved one be able to be at home with us in the evening, we would be \nable to take care of him. We would be able to save a lot of money for \nthe Government. There is no sense putting all these people in nursing \nhomes. Our family would love to be able to take care of our grandfather \nor our father. We would love to have him at home but we work during the \nday, both spouses work during the day. The kids are at school. Nobody \nis home.\n  If we had a chance to have that veteran in a setting where he could \nbe cared for during the day we would take care of him at night and save \nlots of money--save money for the families, save money for the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, as the health care requirements of our veterans \npopulation change, and the demands on limited Department of Veterans \nAffairs resources increase, I believe it important that States have the \nflexibility to provide adult day health care services for veterans.\n  We have heard a lot in the last 24 hours about State flexibility. Why \nshould they not have flexibility with respect to a program like this? \nThey are asking for it. Why do we not give it to them?\n  The 71 State veterans homes across the country have a proven record \nof providing excellent domiciliary, nursing home, and hospital care. \nThey also have the expertise in geriatrics, and specialized health care \nthat is required to provide the adult day health care services.\n  I urge the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs to support these \namendments to the State Veterans Home Program, and to report \nlegislation to authorize adult day health care services for veterans as \nsoon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent Mr. President, that the full text of my bill \nalong with a letter in support of this initiative from the National \nAssociation of State Veterans Homes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building,Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: This letter is in response to your \n     recent inquiry regarding the National Association of State \n     Veterans Homes (NASVH) position on re-introduction of \n     proposed legislation to allow State Homes to develop an Adult \n     Day Health Program.\n       As noted in Mr. Jack Dack's previous letter dated April 26, \n     1993, a 1993 survey had 38 State Homes respond positively out \n     of 48 responses from 52 homes surveyed. We again recommend \n     that Section 1741 be amended to authorize State Homes Adult \n     Day Health Care. The section should be amended to provide for \n     a per diem payment for Adult Day Health Care and additional \n     construction grant monies to support expansion/remodeling to \n     permit States to provide Adult Day Health Care.\n       This letter is offered as a reaffirmation of the NASVH \n     commitment to providing this needed service to veterans \n     pursuant to the aforementioned changes in Title 38 United \n     States Code, Section 1741.\n       If you have any questions, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                             Clifford A. Kinney, II, MPA, NHA,\n\n                                               Chairperson, NASVH,\n     Legislative Committee.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         State Veterans Homes,\n\n                                 Marshalltown, IA, April 26, 1993.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad. This is to express the views of the \n     National Association of State Veterans Homes pertinent to \n     proposed legislation to improve (3) the State Home Program.\n       (A) Title 38 United States Code, Section 1741, authorizes \n     per diem to State Homes for domiciliary, nursing home care \n     and hospital care. We endorse legislation to provide \n     authority to the Secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     to provide a per diem payment for adult day health care and \n     construction grant support for expansion, remodeling or \n     alteration of existing buildings to permit provision of adult \n     day health care.\n       A survey conducted by the National Association of State \n     Veterans Homes in 1984 overwhelmingly supported an adult day \n     health \n     [[Page S1760]] care initiative if an appropriate \n     reimbursement system through the Veterans Administration \n     could be developed for State Homes. Of the 48 responses from \n     52 Homes surveyed, 38 responded positively.\n       It is recommended that Section 1741 be amended to include \n     authorization for State Home Adult Day Health Care.\n       Often times, family and loved ones are the primary \n     caregivers for adult persons. Trying to maintain adults in \n     the home can be very stressful and care can be difficult to \n     provide both physically and psychologically. Resources can be \n     extremely limited, especially in rural communities and \n     families may not be aware of what resources are available. \n     Adult ``day care'' has been one concept implemented to \n     address dependent adult care.\n       The seventy-one State Veterans Homes in forty-one states \n     being long-term care facilities employ clinicians with \n     expertise in geriatrics and staff with years of experience in \n     working with dependent, infirm, and/or handicapped \n     individuals. The Homes have the potential to offer adult day \n     health care in a safe,\n      structured environment with trained, caring staff. There \n     could be provisions for meals and nutritious snacks, \n     medication dispensing, exercise programming and the \n     offering of health assessment and patient/family teaching. \n     There could be planned activities and social interactions \n     for adult participation.\n       Such a program would be an ideal option for the elderly \n     veterans who are: in need of social stimulation to combat \n     depression; in need of supervision and/or personal care; \n     post-operative in need of supervision or medication; victims \n     of early Alzheimer's Disease.\n       Involvement in adult day health care would provide a peace \n     of mind and respite for the working and non-working \n     caregivers.\n       The provisions of these services during daytime hours in a \n     congregate setting would enable veterans to be maintained at \n     home in a supportive environment and be an alternative to a \n     nursing home placement. Participation in an Adult Day Health \n     Care Program could possibly prolong the ability of the \n     veteran to stay in his home thereby lowering the demands on \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs system.\n       Besides providing respite for the primary caregivers, \n     veterans could be screened and referred for medical and/or \n     community resources, including Department of Veteran's \n     Affairs medical care facilities. Pre-assessment for admission \n     could take place if the veteran desires to make application \n     for permanent living in the State Home. Other advantages to \n     the individuals and family members are networking with family \n     members and professionals, participation in support groups, \n     gaining knowledge about community resources and how to access \n     the system.\n       The National Association of State Veterans Homes supports \n     that provisions in United States Code 38, Section 1741, be \n     amended to authorize State Home Adult Day Health Care; per \n     diem payments to states for providing same; and to permit the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs to provide grants for \n     expansion, remodeling or alteration of existing buildings to \n     permit provision of such care.\n       We in the State Home Program do not know the level of \n     participation by the states at this time; however, it is \n     anticipated there would be activity initially by five to ten \n     Homes in this area. Since the Department of Veterans is \n     unable to approve requests for construction grants totaling \n     more\n      than the amount specifically appropriated by the Congress \n     for that fiscal year, any additional grant requests for \n     construction for adult day health care over the specified \n     funding allowed would probably require a waiting period. \n     This waiting period would allow an opportunity for the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs and State Home Program to \n     bring the increased need for additional construction funds \n     to the attention of the Veterans Affairs' Committees for \n     consideration.\n       The State Home Program has a proven track record of being \n     able to blend Federal, State and private resources to \n     maximize the resources available for providing care for the \n     veterans of this Nation. Because of this track record, it is \n     always wise to look for opportunities to expand the \n     relationship, so as to further enhance the efficient use of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs' resources in its \n     provision of care for veterans. The establishment of a per \n     diem for these services is an expansion of the already \n     successful State Home Program with the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs. With this per diem as a starting point, the State \n     Home Program in partnership with the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs has the potential to move towards an efficient, \n     effective means of providing this necessary service for its \n     constituents.\n       (B) Sharing: While the United States Congress has been \n     generous in providing for its veterans, and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs has done a commendable job within the \n     confines of the budgeted amounts in taking care of the \n     Nation's veterans, the resources to do so are becoming more \n     limited. We must continue to work closer together, share \n     ideas, stretch and share resources and assist one another if \n     we are going to fulfill our mutual obligation to provide the \n     necessary health care services for the Nation's veterans. \n     This sharing proposal is an initiative to formalize a closer-\n     working relationship between the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Centers in states where State Veterans Homes \n     presently exist. It will strengthen the long and successful \n     partnership between the Department of Veterans Affairs and \n     State Homes which has long been recognized as a vital \n     resource for the Department of Veterans Affairs in providing \n     care for the chronically ill, elderly veterans.\n       Since many State Homes are located within a radius of one \n     hundred miles of a Department of Veterans Affairs medical \n     facility, it is felt that sharing of services would result in \n     service, efficiency and economy in provision of care. The \n     ability to have Department of Veterans Affairs clinics, such \n     as Urology, Psychiatric Consultation, Physical Medicine/\n     Rehabilitation Consultation, etc., located within a State \n     Veterans Home, would enhance continuity of care for the \n     benefit of the veterans in State Homes. Chronically ill, \n     debilitated, infirm veterans would not have to experience \n     traveling to and from the medical centers for some clinics if \n     such a sharing was possible. Other areas of sharing could be \n     in non-clinical services such as laundry, Life/Safety, \n     Quality Assurance programming, housekeeping, etc.\n       It is felt that by permitting the Department of Veterans' \n     Affairs and the State Home Program to expand, their sharing \n     will result in greater efficiencies and enhance care for \n     veterans. The National Association of State Veterans Homes \n     supports enactment of the concept of sharing in this proposed \n     legislation and believes it to be a benefit to veterans, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs and the State Home Program.\n       On behalf of the National Association of State Veterans \n     Homes, thank you for the opportunity to support legislation \n     to improve the State Veterans Home Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jack J. Dack,\n                               Chairperson, Legislative Committee.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN:\n  S. 294. A bill to increase the availability and affordability of \nhealth care coverage for individuals and their families, to reduce \npaperwork and simplify the administration of health care claims, to \nincrease access to care in rural and underserved areas, to improve \nquality and protect consumers from health care fraud and abuse, to \npromote preventive care, to make long-term care more affordable, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  access to affordable health care act\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress opened, it did so \nwith a great deal of fanfare this month. Much of the discussion has \nbeen devoted to congressional reform, tax cuts, the balanced budget \namendment, unfunded mandates, and welfare reform, but on one issue our \ncolleagues have been notably silent.\n  I say that with one notable exception, my colleague from Illinois, \nwho has just spoken rather eloquently on the whole subject of health \ncare reform, which is what I would like to talk about this afternoon.\n  Health care reform was a dominant topic on everyone's mind during the \nlast Congress. As I mentioned just a moment ago, today it is barely a \nwhisper. I believe that this is a mistake. I think it is time for the \nSenate to put the issue back on the front burner of the public agenda.\n  Health care reform may not be a major clause in the House \nRepublican's Contract With America, but rising health care costs and \nexpanding gaps in coverage are still very much on the minds of the \nAmerican people. In fact, postelection polls conducted for the Health \nCare Leadership Council and by the Washington Post and ABC News show \nthat health care remains a top priority--as important even as cutting \ntaxes, passing a balanced budget amendment, or enacting welfare reform.\n  Abraham Lincoln once observed that ``with public sentiment nothing \ncan fail, and without it nothing can succeed.''\n  I think the American people wisely rejected the big-government \napproach advocated last year by the administration. More Government is \nclearly not the way to lower health care costs.\n  And when I say they rejected big government, this is a copy of the \nbill that in fact was being debated last year, some 1,443 pages long. \nThe public did not understand it. They felt also that we were moving \ntoward, if I can use that Tofflerian phrase, demasification of the \ncentralized health care system. The fact is, they rejected it.\n  The fact is that Government spending on health care, with all of its \nbureaucratic endeavors and controls, has risen much faster than private \nhealth care spending. In fact, between 1970 and 1991 Medicare and \nMedicaid grew 427 percent, more than double the amount of 165 percent \nin the private sector. So we have seen a real disparity in terms of \nGovernment sponsored and funded \n[[Page S1761]] programs versus that of the private sector.\n  But the public rejection of the Clinton health care plan does not \nmean that American people do not want health care reform.\n  As my colleague from California, Senator Diane Feinstein, observed, \nthe main reason the President's health care reform efforts collapsed \nwas that the ``Democrats listened to the 15 percent of the public who \nhad no coverage, while the Republicans listened to the 85 percent who \ndid.'' What some Democrats in Washington derided as merely incremental \nwas, to the American public, essential.\n  Susan Sontag wrote:\n\n       Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous \n     citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in \n     the kingdom of the well and the kingdom of the sick. Although \n     we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later \n     each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify \n     ourselves as citizens of that other place.\n\n  As such, the flaws in our health care system are ones that will--\nsooner or later--touch every American family.\n  The American people want health care reform, but they want something \nthey can understand and afford. They want a program that gives them \nsome reassurance against their growing sense of financial insecurity \nagainst potential illness--a program that gives them some protection \nshould they cross over into that kingdom of the sick.\n  When the American people say they want reform, they mean: ``If I lose \nmy job or get sick, I want to keep my health insurance and I do not \nwant it to cost so much.'' They want Congress to enact targeted reforms \nto contain health care costs and to ensure that they do not lose the \nhealth care coverage that they have.\n  Health care reform, I think, as my colleague from Illinois has \npointed out, is pretty familiar to most of us now. We have spent over 4 \nyears studying the problem, countless hours of staff researching the \nissue, debating the issue, drafting legislation, negotiating \ncompromise. We have something, I think, very valuable to show for that \neffort.\n  Despite the partisan and sometimes bitter debate in the last \nCongress, there is broad-based, bipartisan agreement on some key steps \nthat can and should be taken to contain health care costs and increase \naccess for millions of Americans. In fact, I believe that action could \nhave been taken on these changes 3 years ago if some had not insisted \nthat there be comprehensive reform, or no reform at all.\n  Today I am introducing legislation outlining a blueprint for reform \nthat is based on principles upon which I believe a bipartisan majority \nin Congress could agree. The plan takes significant strides toward the \ngoal of universal coverage by bringing millions more Americans into the \nsystem. While some might characterize these reforms as incremental, \nthey are by no means insignificant.\n  They would include insurance market reforms to make insurance \nportable and prohibit insurers from denying, canceling, or limiting \ncoverage or otherwise discriminating against individuals on the basis \nof their health status.\n  They would include refundable tax credits for low-income families and \nfull tax deductibility for the self-employed to make insurance coverage \nmore affordable.\n  They would include voluntary purchasing cooperatives to give \nindividuals and small businesses access to more affordable coverage; \nadministrative reforms to reduce costs and paperwork and make the \nsystem more efficient.\n  They would include malpractice reforms to reduce the costly practice \nof defensive medicine; expanded access to care in rural areas; more \naffordable long-term care; and, finally, stronger efforts to combat \nfraud and abuse, which currently rob our system of as much as $100 \nbillion every year.\n  Many of my colleagues have heard me take the floor time and time \nagain to complain about health care fraud in this country. In fact, \njust last week I introduced separate legislation dealing with health \ncare fraud, because we are losing $100 billion every year to health \ncare fraud. It amounts to $275 million a day, $11.5 million every \nsingle hour.\n  We could have taken action last year. We did not take action last \nyear. The said wait until health care reform comes. Health care reform \ndid not come. So by the time this legislation or some variation of this \nlegislation is finally adopted, we will lost another $100 billion to \nhealth care fraud and abuse.\n  Many of the principles involved in this legislation--and, by the way, \nMr. President, this contains about 200 typewritten pages--could have \nbeen adopted more than 4\\1/2\\ years ago when I first introduced it. In \nfact, it could have been adopted when Senator Lloyd Bentsen passed his \nversion of the bill back in 1992.\n  Although action on health care reform has been deferred in the past. \nIt simply cannot be deferred any longer.\n  The new Republican-controlled Congress has both the obligation and \nthe political opportunity to enact health care reform, but the window \nof opportunity will not be open long. We simply cannot afford to repeat \npast mistakes and allow the issue to become complicated or obfuscated \nby election-year politics.\n  I listened with great interest to my colleagues from Illinois outline \nsome of the letters he has received from constituents and others \npointing out it is not a Republican or Democratic issue, it is an \nAmerican problem.\n  Last month, one of my constituents, Leslie Mansfield, of Bar Harbor, \ntestified before the Maine Health Care Reform Commission about the\n importance of health care reform for her family. Since her son was \ndiagnosed with juvenile diabetes 6 years ago, the family has faced \nmounting insurance and medical bills. Even though the rest of the \nfamily is healthy, in 3 short years they have seen their insurance \npremiums jump from $190 to $600 a month, and they fear that they will \nsoon be either dropped by their insurer or priced out of the market \nentirely.\n\n  If the new Congress does not move quickly on health care reform, \nmillions of Americans like Leslie Mansfield and her family will be \nworse off, not better off.\n  Health care costs, which last year topped $1 trillion, will continue \nto rise, placing an increasing strain on families, employers, and \ngovernments alike, and pricing millions more Americans out of the \nmarket. Insurers and businesses will be able to continue to cut costs \nby avoiding customers at greater risk. People with preexisting medical \nconditions like heart disease and diabetes will face even steeper \npremiums or could lose their coverage entirely. And we will continue to \nlose an estimated $275 million a day--that is $11.5 million every \nhour--to health care fraud.\n  Health care reform does not have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. \nThat mistake was made both in 1992 and in 1994 and should not be \nrepeated. By building upon our areas of agreement, we can take major \nsteps to contain costs, expand choice and extend access to care to \nmillions more Americans.\n  We have come a long way to reach this point in the health care debate \nand we should move forward. While to do nothing may not be a breach of \nthe Contract With America, it most certainly would be a\n breach of trust with the American people.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the Access to \nAffordable Health Care Act and ask unanimous consent that a section-by-\nsection summary as well as the full text of the bill be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 30 seconds? I \nwant to commend the Senator for his statement.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SIMON. I, obviously, have not read the bill. But if we recognize \nthe problem and work together, we can do something for the American \npeople in this session of Congress. I commend him for his leadership.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his comments. Let me \nconclude with a few observations.\n  There has been so much partisanship discussed in the House and the \nSenate on various other issues. There was a great deal of partisanship \non the health care debate as well. I remember when Senator Dole asked \nthe committee to put together a task force headed up by John Chafee to \nmeet with our Democratic counterpart; we ran into a stonewall.\n  [[Page S1762]] It was not open to negotiation. There was no \ncompromise. It was all-or-nothing, comprehensive or nothing at all. As \na result, we had nothing at all. One of the members of the Democratic \ntask force came to me just a couple of days ago and said, ``You know, \nif we had done what you had suggested 2 years ago, it would have been a \ngreat step forward.'' We did not do it then. We ought to do it now.\n  Let Senators put aside the partisanship and reach across the aisle \nand do something the American people will support--Republican, \nDemocrat, independent, it does not matter. We need the relief. We need \nthe reform. We ought not to defer this any longer. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 294\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Non-discrimination based on health status\n\n       In general, a health plan may not deny, limit, or condition \n     the coverage under the plan (or vary the premium) for an \n     individual on the basis of their health status, medical \n     condition, claims experience, receipt of health care, medical \n     history, anticipated need for services, disability, or lack \n     of insurability.\n       The plan may limit or exclude benefits relating to a pre-\n     existing condition that was diagnosed or treated during the \n     3-month period prior to enrollment in that plan for up to 6 \n     months. However, if the individual had been in a period of \n     continuous coverage under another health plan prior to \n     enrollment, the exclusion period would be reduced by 1 month \n     for each month of continuous coverage.\n\n                    b. Guaranteed issue and renewal\n\n       Health plans offering coverage in the small group market \n     shall guarantee each individual purchaser and small employer \n     (and each employee of that small employer) access to the \n     plan. In addition, health plans must be renewed at the option \n     of the employer or individual if they remain eligible for \n     coverage under the plan. Plans may refuse to renew a policy \n     in the case of: nonpayment of premiums; fraud on the part of \n     the employer or individual related to the plan; or \n     misrepresentation by the employer or individual of material \n     facts relating to an application for coverage of a claim or \n     benefit.\n\n                         c. Rating limitations\n\n       The Secretary of HHS shall request that the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners develop specific \n     standards in the form of a model Act and model regulations to \n     implement rating stands for the small group market. Factors \n     that health plans may use to vary premium rates include age \n     (not to exceed a 3:1 ratio), family type and geography. \n     Health plans would be prohibited from using gender, health \n     status or health expenditures to vary rates. These factors \n     would be phased out within three years in order to minimize \n     market disruption and\n      maximize coverage rates. The standards developed would also \npermit health plans to provide premium discounts based on workplace \nhealth promotion activities.\n\n                   d. Encouragement of State efforts\n\n       None of the provisions of the bill shall be construed as \n     preempting State law unless that State law directly conflicts \n     with the bills' requirements. In addition, the following \n     state consumer protection laws shall not be considered to \n     directly conflict with any such requirement and are \n     specifically not preempted: laws that limit the exclusions or \n     limitations for preexisting medical conditions to periods \n     that are less than those provided in this title; laws that \n     limit variations in premium rates beyond the variations \n     permitted in this title; and laws that would expand the small \n     group market in excess of that provided for under this title. \n     In addition, nothing in this bill shall be construed as \n     prohibiting States from enacting health care reform measures \n     that exceed the measures established in the bill, including \n     reforms that expand access to health care services, control \n     health care costs, and enhance quality of care.\n\n\ntitle ii--grants to states for small group health insurance purchasing \n                              arrangements\n\n       Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     make grants to States for the establishment and operation of \n     small group health insurance purchasing arrangements to \n     increase access to more affordable coverage for small \n     businesses and individuals.\n\n\ntitle iii--tax incentives to encourage the purchase of health insurance\n\n       Insurance would be made more affordable for low and middle-\n     income individuals (individuals with incomes up to $23,000 \n     and families with incomes up to $33,000) by providing a \n     refundable tax credit to those without employer-provided \n     insurance. A credit of 60 percent would apply to premiums of \n     up to $1,200 a year for individuals and $2,400 for families. \n     Individuals with adjusted gross incomes of less than $18,000 \n     and families with adjusted gross incomes of less than $28,000 \n     would be eligible for the full credit. The credit would be \n     phased out for individuals with incomes between $18,000 and \n     $23,000 and families with incomes between $28,000 and \n     $33,000.\n       [[Page S1787]] Also makes the tax deduction for health \n     insurance costs for self-employed individuals permanent \n     (retroactive to 1994) and phases it up from the current 25% \n     level to 100% by 2000.\n title vi--incentives to increase the access of rural and underserved \n                          areas to health care\n\n       Provides a special tax credit and other incentives for \n     physicians and other primary care providers serving in rural \n     and other underserved areas. Increased funding is also \n     provided to expand the National Health Service Corps and Area \n     Health Education Centers, which will also help to increase \n     the number of health care professionals in medically \n     underserved areas. Increased grant funding would also be \n     available to expand the number of community health centers, \n     which provide comprehensive health services in rural and \n     inner-city neighborhoods to millions of Americans who need \n     care regardless of their ability to pay.\n\n\n                title v--quality and consumer protection\n\n       Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     award demonstration grants for the establishment and \n     operation of regional Quality Improvement Foundations.\n       Improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the health \n     care system by encouraging the development of a national \n     health information network to reduce administrative \n     complexity, paperwork, and costs; to provide information on \n     cost and quality; and to provide information tools that allow \n     improved fraud detection, outcomes research, and quality of \n     care.\n       Establishes a stronger, better coordinated federal effort \n     to combat fraud and abuse in our health care system. This \n     section expands criminal and civil penalties for health care \n     fraud to provide a stronger deterrent to the billing of \n     fraudulent claims and to deter fraudulent utilization of \n     health care services.\n\n\n                      title vi--malpractice reform\n\n       Encourages states to establish alternative dispute \n     resolution mechanisms like prelitigation screening panels, \n     which have had great success in a number of states in \n     reducing medical malpractice costs. Also allows health care \n     providers to use practice guidelines approved by the \n     Secretary of HHS as a rebuttable defense in medical liability \n     cases.\n\n\n           title vii--health promotion and disease prevention\n\n       Encourages participation in qualified health promotion and \n     prevention programs by clarifying that expenditures for these \n     programs are considered amounts paid for medical care for tax \n     purposes. Also establishes a new grant program for states to \n     provide assistance to small businesses in the establishment \n     and operation of worksite wellness programs for their \n     employees. And finally, expands the comprehensive school \n     health education programs administered by the Centers for \n     Disease Control.\n\n\n            title viii--access to affordable long-term care\n\n       Removes tax barriers and creates incentives for individuals \n     and their families to finance their future long-term care \n     needs. Long-term care policies that meet federal consumer \n     protection standards would receive favorable tax treatment. \n     Like health insurance, business expenditures on premiums \n     would be deductible as a business expense and employer-\n     provided long-term care insurance would be excluded from an \n     employee's taxable income. Also allows States to develop \n     programs under which individuals can keep more of their \n     assets and still qualify for Medicaid if they take steps to \n     finance their own long-term care needs. And finally, provides \n     various incentives, such as tax-free withdrawals from IRAs, \n     401(k) plans, and other qualified pension plans to promote \n     the purchase of private long-term care insurance.\n\n\n                title ix--assurance of budget neutrality\n\n       No amendment or provision made by the bill will take effect \n     until legislation is enacted which provides for budget \n     neutrality.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. \n        Gorton):\n  S. 295. A bill to permit labor management cooperative efforts that \nimprove America's economic competitiveness to continue to thrive, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               TEAMWORK FOR EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Jeffords, Gregg, and Gorton, the Teamwork for Employees And \nManagement [TEAM] Act, a bill to encourage worker-management \ncooperation.\n  Mr. President, when I served many years ago on the school board in \nMaize, KS, we frequently met on an informal basis with teachers to \ndiscuss problems the teachers faced in the classroom. The teachers had \nan important perspective to share, and we addressed their concerns. \nSometimes we agreed with them and implemented their recommendations, \nand sometimes we agreed to disagree. But the important thing was that \nwe felt free to exchange information.\n  School boards and teachers are governed by State law and not Federal \nlaw, so we did not face the problems on the school board that private \nsector workers and supervisors face today. We had the benefit of being \nable to work cooperatively with our teachers, and I continue to believe \nthat we improved the quality of education for our students and enhanced \nthe quality of work life for our teachers.\n  Mr. President, our current Federal labor laws do not allow this sort \nof cooperative effort, because our labor laws assume that labor and \nmanagement have an adversarial relationship. This may have been true 50 \nyears ago, but today, employers recognize that productivity and \nefficiency improve when workers operate in partnership with management, \nand that partnership occurs best in a cooperative rather than an \nadversarial environment. Yet our labor laws currently prohibit these \ncooperative efforts.\n  Mr. President, the TEAM Act responds to a National Labor Relations \nBoard [NLRB] decision in 1992 called Electromation that has had \nsignificant consequences for attempts to improve cooperation between \nworkers and employers. Specifically, the NLRB held that employer-\nemployee committees, where workers met with management to discuss \nattendance, compensation and no-smoking policies, violated the National \nLabor Relations Act's [NLRA] prohibition against ``employer-dominated'' \nlabor organizations.\n  The TEAM Act amends our Federal labor laws to permit these types of \nvoluntary programs to continue. The legislation allows employers and \nemployees to meet together to address issues of mutual interest, \nincluding issues related to quality, productivity, and efficiency, as \nlong as the committees or other joint programs do not engage in \ncollective bargaining.\n  I believe that our Federal labor laws should not stand in the way of \nwork place cooperative efforts, such as quality circles and employee \ninvolvement programs. Our workers like to have input on their working \nconditions and our international competitors use employee involvement \nto improve plant productivity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the TEAM Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teamwork for Employees And \n     Management Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the escalating demands of global competition have \n     compelled an increasing number of American employers to make \n     dramatic changes in workplace and employer-employee \n     relationships;\n       (2) these changes involve an enhanced role for the employee \n     in workplace decisionmaking, often referred to as ``employee \n     involvement'', which has taken many forms, including self-\n     managed work teams, quality-of-worklife, quality circles, and \n     joint labor-management committees;\n       (3) employee involvement structures, which operate \n     successfully in both unionized and non-unionized settings, \n     have been established by over 80 percent of the largest \n     employers of the United States and exist in an estimated \n     30,000 workplaces;\n       (4) in addition to enhancing the productivity and \n     competitiveness of American businesses, employee involvement \n     structures have had a positive impact on the lives of those \n     employees, better enabling them to reach their potential in \n     their working lives;\n       (5) recognizing that foreign competitors have successfully \n     utilized employee involvement techniques, Congress has \n     consistently joined business, labor and academic leaders in \n     encouraging and recognizing successful employee involvement \n     structures in the workplace through such incentives as the \n     Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award;\n       (6) employers who have instituted legitimate employee \n     involvement structures have not done so to interfere with the \n     collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the labor laws, as \n     was the case in the 1930s when employers established \n     deceptive sham ``company unions'' to avoid unionization; and\n       (7) employee involvement is currently threatened by \n     interpretations of the prohibition against employer-dominated \n     ``company unions''.\n        [[Page S1788]] (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this \n     Act to--\n       (1) protect legitimate employee involvement structures \n     against governmental interference;\n       (2) preserve existing protections against deceptive, \n     coercive employer practices; and\n       (3) permit legitimate employee involvement structures where \n     workers may discuss issues involving terms and conditions of \n     employment, to continue to evolve and proliferate.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 8(a)(2) OF THE NATIONAL LABOR \n                   RELATIONS ACT.\n\n       Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 158(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following: ``Provided further, That it shall not constitute \n     or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under this \n     paragraph for an employer to establish, assist, maintain or \n     participate in any organization or entity of any kind, in \n     which employees participate to address matters of mutual \n     interest (including issues of quality, productivity and \n     efficiency) and which does not have, claim or seek authority \n     to negotiate or enter into collective bargaining agreements \n     under this Act with the employer or to amend existing \n     collective bargaining agreements between the employer and any \n     labor organization;''.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONSTRUCTION CLAUSE LIMITING EFFECT OF ACT.\n\n       Nothing in the amendment made by section 3 shall be \n     construed as affecting employee rights and responsibilities \n     under the National Labor Relations Act other than those \n     contained in section 8(a)(2) of such Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Bradley, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Packwood, Mr. \n        Pell, Mr. Robb, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 296. A bill to amend section 1977A of the Revised Statutes to \nequalize the remedies available to all victims of intentional \nemployment discrimination, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                           equal remedies act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and 20 other \nSenators, it is an honor to reintroduce the Equal Remedies Act to \nrepeal the caps on the amount of damages available in employment \ndiscrimination cases brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1991 for the first time gave women, religious \nminorities, and the disabled the right to recover compensatory and \npunitive damages when they suffer intentional discrimination on the \njob--but only up to specified limits. Victims of discrimination on the \nbasis of race or national origin, by contrast, can recover such damages \nwithout such limits. No similar caps on damages exist in other civil \nrights laws, and they are not appropriate in this instance.\n  The Equal Remedies Act will end this double standard by removing the \ncaps on damages for victims of intentional discrimination on the basis \nof sex, religion, or disability.\n  The caps on damages deny an adequate remedy to the most severely \ninjured victims of discrimination. For example, if a woman proves that \nas a result of discrimination or sexual harassment she needs extensive \nmedical treatment exceeding the caps, she will be limited to receiving \nonly partial compensation for her injury.\n  In addition, the caps on punitive damages limit the extent to which \nemployers who intentionally discriminate--particularly the worst \nviolators--are punished for their discriminatory acts and deterred from \nengaging in such conduct in the future. The more offensive the conduct \nand the greater the damages inflicted, the more the employer benefits \nfrom the caps.\n  The caps on damages in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 were a compromise \nnecessitated by concern about passing a bill that President Bush would \nsign. The issue was only one of the important issues covered in that \npiece of legislation, which also reversed a series of Supreme Court \ndecisions that had made it far more difficult for working Americans to \nchallenge discrimination.\n  The bill as a whole represented a significant advance in the ongoing \nbattle to overcome discrimination in the workplace. In order to \nguarantee that the bill would become law, the unfortunate compromise on \ndamages was included. However, many of us made clear that we intended \nto work for enactment of separate legislation to remove the caps. By \nreintroducing the Equal Remedies Act today, we reaffirm our commitment. \nWe must end the double standard that relegates women, religious \nminorities, and the disabled to second-class remedies under the civil \nrights laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Remedies Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EQUALIZATION OF REMEDIES.\n\n       Section 1977A of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a), as \n     added by section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by striking paragraph (3), and\n       (B) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (3), and\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``section--'' and all \n     that follows through the period and inserting ``section, any \n     party may demand a jury trial.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 297. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe exclusion from gross income for veterans' benefits; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       veterans' tax fairness act\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am introducing today the \nproposed Veterans' Tax Fairness Act of 1995. I am enormously pleased \nthat a number of my colleagues, both members of the committee and \nothers, have joined me as original cosponsors of this important \nmeasure--Senators Tom Daschle, Bob Graham, Daniel Akaka, Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, Jim Jeffords, Pat Leahy, and Jeff Bingaman. This bill would \nclarify and reiterate the longstanding rule that veterans benefits are \nnot taxable--a rule that, until action taken in 1992 by the Internal \nRevenue Service, had never been questioned.\n  On February 27, 1992, the Internal Revenue Service, in a letter to \nthe general counsel of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nreinterpreted a 1986 law and reached a conclusion that could jeopardize \nthe historical tax-exempt status of many veterans benefits, including \nvarious benefits provided to service-disabled veterans, dependency and \nindemnity compensation for survivors, veterans and survivors pensions, \neducation benefits under the Montgomery GI bill, and veterans medical \ncare.\n  The IRS ruling addressed a narrow issue of whether veterans must pay \ntaxes when VA forgives a debt the veteran owes to the Federal \nGovernment after VA pays a guaranty on the Veteran's home loan. \nCongress liberalized the criteria for VA debt waivers in 1989. In the \nFebruary 1992 opinion, IRS interpreted a 1986 tax code provision as \nrequiring taxation of any debt waiver granted under the 1989 law that \nwould not have been granted under the old law. IRS concluded that any \nmodification or adjustment of a veterans benefit would make the benefit \ntaxable.\n  Mr. President, our committee strongly disagreed with the IRS \ninterpretation, for reasons stated in a May 13, 1992, letter from then-\nChairman Alan Cranston to then-Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. \nBrady.\n  Mr. President, although the IRS opinion attempts to address only the \nnarrow question of the taxability of VA debt waivers, its conclusions \ncould support IRS assessing taxes for many other veterans benefits that \nhave been modified or adjusted after September 9, 1986.\n  Since 1986, for example, Congress has expanded and increased \neducation benefits paid under the GI bill on rehabilitation benefits \nprovided to disabled veterans; adjusted the categories of eligibility \nfor VA medical care; overhauled the survivors Dependency and Indemnity \nCompensation [DIC] Program and made several adjustments in the rates of \nDIC; expanded various health care services; and increased other \nbenefits, such as housing and \n[[Page S1789]] automobile grants for certain veterans with every severe \nservice-connected disabilities. The IRS interpretation would exempt \nadjustment based on an inflation index, but fails to protect the many \nVA benefits that are adjusted without reference to an index. Under the \nFebruary 27, 1992 IRS opinion, any of these modifications or \nadjustments might have made the benefits involved taxable.\n  Section 5301 of title 38, United States Code, explicitly exempts \nveterans benefits and services from taxation. The provision of the tax \ncode interpreted by IRS concerns military benefits, and it seems clear \nto me that Congress did not intend to make veterans benefits taxable \nfor the first time in our Nation's history through enactment of a tax \ncode provision addressing military benefits. Veterans benefits, \nprovided to veterans and their survivors under laws administered by VA, \nalways have been distinct from military pay and benefits provided to \nactive-duty or retired servicemembers under laws administered by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  In fact, Mr. President, another tax code provision, section 136, \nexplicitly references the title 38 provision exempting veterans \nbenefits from taxation. I am not aware of any previous suggestion that \nthe tax code section that IRS has interpreted was intended to make \nveterans benefits taxable. If Congress had wanted to make such a \nradical change in the tax-exempt status of veterans benefits, it \ncertainly would have done so much more explicitly than through an \nambiguously worded provision that does not even mention veterans or the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that, before February 1992, in previous \nadministration had interpreted this tax code provision to require \ntaxation of veterans benefits. During the almost 7 years since the \nprovision took effect, IRS has not collected or attempted to collect \nany taxes based on the receipt of VA-administered benefits--even in \nconnection with VA debt waivers, which the IRS opinion had concluded \ncould be subject to taxation in certain circumstances.\n  In fact, every official IRS publication of which I am aware that \nmentions veterans benefits, including ``Publication 17--Your Income \nTaxes'' and a 1988 IRS private letter ruling, explicitly states that \nveterans benefits are not taxable. Many IRS publications even list all \navailable veterans benefits to indicate that each is nontaxable.\n  Mr. President, in 1992, the committee found a very receptive ally in \nthen-Senator Lloyd Bentsen, who chaired the Finance Committee. Senator \nBentsen successfully inserted a version of our clarifying legislation \ninto 1992's tax bill, H.R. 11. Unfortunately, President Bush vetoed \nH.R. 11.\n  Mr. President, during the last Congress, efforts were made, both by \nthe administration--where Senator Bentsen was then serving as Secretary \nof Treasury--which submitted proposed legislation substantively \nidentical to H.R. 11, and by me in the introduction of such legislation \nin S. 1083, to replicate the success we had with H.R. 11. \nUnfortunately, no action was taken on that legislation during the 103d \nCongress.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is substantively identical to \nH.R. 11, the legislation recommended by the administration last \nCongress, and to S. 1083, and I am hopeful that action will be taken on \nit in the first appropriate tax legislation.\n  I believe it is vitally important to reiterate and clarify by statute \nthe tax-exempt status of all veterans benefits and services, in order \nto preclude any future tinkering with these most fundamental benefits, \nparticularly in the current climate of anything goes in the name of \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that, since IRS previously has not \ncollected or attempted to collect taxes on veterans benefits, this \nlegislation will not affect Federal revenues.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I acknowledge and thank Senator Moynihan \nand the fine Finance Committee staff for the technical assistance \nprovided in connection with the development of this measure. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill and pledge to do all I can to see it \nenacted quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Tax Fairness Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF VETERANS' BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 134 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to certain military \n     benefits) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) General Rule.--Gross income shall not include--\n       ``(1) any qualified military benefit, and\n       ``(2) any allowance or benefit administered by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs which is received by a veteran \n     (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United States Code) \n     or a dependent or survivor of a veteran.''\n       (b) Technical Amendment.--Paragraph (3) of section 137(a) \n     of such Code is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) Benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, see section 5301 of title 38, United States \n     Code.''\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1984.\n

                               ______\n\n\n                DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS A HEALTH CARE ISSUE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the finest things that has \nhappened in the U.S. Senate since I've been here was the election of \nPaul Wellstone.\n  I was reminded of that the other day when I was catching up on my \nreading and read in the magazine Tikkun his article on domestic \nviolence as a health care issue.\n  It really goes beyond discussing it as a health care issue.\n  He talks about the necessity to have education and be sensitive and \nto protect all of our citizens better than we are now protecting them.\n  I ask to insert into the Record the Paul Wellstone article.\n  The article follows:\n\n                Domestic Violence as a Health-Care Issue\n\n                            (Paul Wellstone)\n\n       Domestic violence is a crime. Surely this statement is not \n     a matter of contention or debate anymore--or it certainly \n     should not be.\n       But it wasn't too long ago that we did have to make the \n     argument, because domestic violence was a secret, something \n     that happened behind closed doors, a ``family matter.'' \n     Police would be called; they would arrive; and they would \n     leave. And then they would be called again. And again.\n       Now, of course, it's different, because everyone knows that \n     domestic violence is a crime as pervasive--if not more so--\n     than murder, armed robbery, or drug dealing. The only \n     argument now involves what to do about this seemingly \n     intractable problem.\n       Domestic violence is a health-care issue. Now this is \n     something new. Once this perspective on the problem is \n     introduced, however, informed opinion-makers pause a moment, \n     think about it, and say, ``Oh, yes, of course it is.''\n       But what are the implications of approaching domestic \n     violence in this way?\n       Evidence indicates that domestic violence is the leading \n     cause of injury to women, more common than auto accidents, \n     muggings, and rapes by strangers combined. Indeed, it is the \n     most frequent cause for women to seek attention at hospital \n     emergency rooms. Not surprisingly, the health consequences of \n     domestic violence include bruises, broken bones, birth \n     defects, miscarriages, and emotional distress, as well as \n     long-term mental health problems.\n       Although domestic violence touches men as well as women, we \n     know that women and children are the primary victims. We know \n     that the very place in which a woman and her children should \n     feel the safest and most protected--their home--is all too \n     often the most violent, dangerous, and even deadly place. The \n     emotional and physical well-being of women and children is \n     compromised when they suffer or witness abuse. And the costs \n     are staggering.\n       As a member of Congress, steeped in the current health-care \n     debate, I can't and won't let this information simply be \n     stored away to be trotted out as factoids for rhetorical \n     purposes: Congress is on the threshold of actually doing \n     something to address the domestic violence health issue.\n       In the course of the national debate over health care, we \n     have been hearing the arguments for comprehensive reform. The \n     prevalence of domestic violence and the toll it takes on the \n     nation's heath are two of the reasons we need health-care \n     reform that includes universal coverage, and a good, \n     affordable package of benefits.\n       The victims of domestic violence are living, breathing, \n     suffering women and children. They, along with other \n     Americans who need care, give a soul to this debate that goes \n     beyond technical discussions of ``employer mandates,'' ``hard \n     and soft triggers,'' and all the other process jargon that so \n     easily takes center stage in a Washington debate.\n       Health-care reform--to meet the needs of victims of \n     domestic violence--needs to include universal coverage, \n     elimination of preexisting condition clauses, public-health \n     efforts to prevent domestic violence, and training for \n     health-care providers to identify, treat, and refer victims. \n     It should contain a benefits package that includes a visit to \n     a doctor who will routinely ask about abuse and violence in \n     the family just as she asks about a history of smoking or \n     heart disease.\n       Universal coverage would mean that a woman who stays in a \n     relationship because she is dependent on an intimate partner \n     for health coverage for herself and her children would know \n     that coverage was guaranteed even if she left the \n     relationship.\n       Leaving an abusive relationship is already terribly \n     difficult; many of the women involved worry about not being \n     able to support their children or themselves. Many are \n     ashamed to let relatives know of the abuse. And, when women \n     do leave abusive partners, they must worry that the rage \n     behind the abuse will become homicidal. A woman seeking to \n     leave an abusive relationship should not have to worry about \n     loss of health insurance for herself and her children--\n     especially when experience shows that victims of abuse are \n     heavy users of the health-care system.\n       When congressional discussion turns to ``universal \n     coverage'' as being only a goal, or meaning 95 percent (or \n     so) of the population, I will be reminding my colleagues \n     about these women and their children.\n       Along with universal coverage, we need to prohibit \n     insurance companies from denying coverage to people because \n     of preexisting conditions. Eliminating preexisting condition \n     clauses would protect women who are now denied coverage \n     because their medical records explicitly indicate they have \n     been battered, or because of repeated health problems that \n     have occurred as a result of domestic abuse and violence.\n       The federal government should be a leader in developing and \n     implementing innovative community-based strategies to provide \n     health promotion and disease prevention activities for the \n     prevention of violence by training providers and other \n     health-care professionals to identify victims of domestic \n     violence, to provide appropriate examination and treatment, \n     and to refer the victims to available community resources.\n       This should include the development and implementation of \n     training curricula that teach health-care providers to \n     identify and name the symptoms, the promotion and importance \n     of developing a plan of action should the abuser return, and \n     how to refer their patients to safe and effective resources. \n     Already we have taken some steps in this direction by \n     adopting my Violence Reduction Training Act, which is now \n     being implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention.\n       A comprehensive benefits package would include clinic \n     visits that gather a complete medical history and entail an \n     appropriate physical exam and risk assessment, including the \n     screening for victims of domestic violence, targeted health \n     advice and counseling, and the administration of age-\n     appropriate immunizations and tests.\n       This type of clinic visit would mean that a doctor would \n     ask about a history or incidents of violence as part of her \n     regular medical history interview. Doctors already ask about \n     their patients' medical history with cancer, smoking, diet, \n     or heart disease. Sadly, family violence is not something \n     about which doctors, or other health professionals, often \n     inquire.\n       Some of my congressional colleagues and my constituents \n     will continue to remind me that passing this type of health-\n     care reform is going to be expensive. Of course it is. But we \n     are already spending the money one way or the other. The \n     annual medical costs alone of reported domestic violence \n     injuries are astounding: A study conducted at Chicago's Rush \n     Medical Center found that the average charge for medical \n     services provided to abused women, children, and older people \n     is $1,633 per person per year. This would amount to a \n     national cost of $857.3 million. Many of these costs are \n     borne by emergency departments--the most expensive way to \n     provide these services.\n       As with the current discussion surrounding the criminal \n     nature of domestic violence, we are now at the point of \n     asking: given that domestic violence is a health issue, what \n     do we do?\n       One of the important things that we can do is to pass \n     comprehensive health-care reform that is universal, \n     comprehensive, and affordable. By passing comprehensive \n     reform, Congress will be taking an important step to prevent \n     and reduce the incidence of domestic violence.\n       Passing health-care reform will not be a panacea for the \n     victims of family violence. In the same way that police \n     cannot solve the crime of domestic violence, health-care \n     professionals are not going to solve this problem.\n       If we are to break this cycle of violence, we must \n     recognize that all of us in the community are stakeholders. \n     We all need to be involved: health-care providers, educators, \n     business people, clergy, law enforcement officers, advocates, \n     judges, media, and community residents.\n       [[Page S1791]] But there is another level in this debate. \n     Even if Congress enacts health-care reform and even if \n     communities start to deal with this escalating problem, as a \n     country we are still faced with a whole host of problems that \n     we are only beginning to comprehend. For instance, we now \n     have to ask about the responsibility of the healthcare \n     community to provide leadership for community collaboration. \n     And how should the role of health-care providers intersect \n     with others in the community?\n       Furthermore, the provider is now confronted with serious \n     ethical questions such as whether physicians should be \n     mandated to report information about abuse and if so, to \n     whom? Is the obligation to notify the law enforcement or \n     legal systems greater than the responsibility to respect the \n     victim's autonomy? If a victim asks that there be no action, \n     should a doctor or nurse or therapist honor the request? And \n     what are the responsibilities of health professionals with \n     regard to the perpetrators? What is the role of neighbors who \n     hear much too much through thin walls?\n       I don't have all the answers to these types of questions. \n     Indeed, since we have just opened the door to this \n     discussion, I'm not sure anyone does. But that, in part, is \n     the point. We have now initiated this debate, and we have \n     begun talking as a community--knowing full well that because \n     of this conversation we will begin solving one of the most \n     devastating social and medical problems facing every one of \n     us.\n       For the last two years, my wife Shelia and I have been \n     traveling throughout Minnesota, convening gatherings and \n     attending events where such issues are being discussed. The \n     conversations are having an impact. We are seeing community \n     action throughout the state, and we are seeing a tremendous \n     number of providers, judges, and police getting involved. My \n     own experience in Minnesota makes me believe that similar \n     efforts nationwide will also be successful.\n       We must begin this discussion with a sense of urgency--\n     peoples' lives and safety are at stake.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1790-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ON ECONOMIST ARTICLE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a few months ago, we passed the \ndubious milestone of having 1 million inmates serving time in prison. \nThat number is expected to soar further as Congress and the States \nrespond to the public's fear of crime by enacting longer prison terms \nfor drug offenders and other criminals.\n  Before we head full-steam down this prison-building path, I think we \nneed to consider carefully whether we are being smart about how we \npunish criminals. Last year, I asked my staff to survey prison wardens \naround the Nation for their views on our crime policies. The results \nwere surprising. Only 39 percent recommended building more prisons. But \n65 percent said we should use our existing prison space more \nefficiently, by imposing shorter sentences on nonviolent offenders, and \nlonger prison terms on violent ones.\n  A few States, such as Florida and Georgia, have begun to respond in \nthis way. They have begun to look at innovative ways to free up prison \nspace by sentencing nonviolent criminals to ``intermediate sanctions,'' \nsuch as home detention and work release. As a recent article in the \nEconomist noted, these programs are highly cost-efficient. In Florida, \nfor example, these alternative programs cost only $6.49 per day per \nfelon, compared with nearly $40 per day for prison.\n  And, the programs don't compromise public safety. As the Economist \nreported, ``A 6 year survey by the National Council on Crime and \nDelinquency shows that in Florida, people sentenced to such penalties \nare less likely to be arrested within 18 months of their release than \nsimilar offenders who had been sentenced to between 12 and 30 months in \njail.''\n  That is what I call being both tough on crime and smart. It is an \napproach Congress should consider before it spends billions more on \nanother incarceration binge. I ask that the full text of the Economist \narticle be reprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                  [From the Economist, Nov. 19, 1994]\n\n               Alternatives to Prison--Cheaper is Better\n\n       Richmond, Va.--Self-preservation requires American \n     politicans to be slap-'em-inside tough on crime these days. \n     The argument for toughness stands on uncertain ground: the \n     number of Americans in prison has more than doubled since \n     1982, now standing at over 1m, and yet notified violent crime \n     has risen by two-fifths, according to the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. Still, the voters want to lock the villains \n     up, and the politicans reckon they had better get on with it. \n     The next question is how much it will cost the taxpayer.\n       In Virginia, whose capital has the country's second-highest \n     homicide rate, the General Assembly recently met in \n     extraordinary session to lengthen prison terms for violent \n     criminals and--like 13 other states and the federal \n     government--to abolish discretionary parole for newly \n     convicted felons. That needs nearly 30 new prisons. Some say \n     this could cost $2 billion. The new Republican governor, \n     George Allen, says that the true cost is closer to $1 \n     billion, and that the state's prison population would anyway \n     have doubled, without the new measures, by 2005.\n       But the Democrats who control the legislature balked even \n     at that figure, and have given Mr. Allen only about $40m to \n     erect a handful of the work camps needed to accommodate the \n     queue of prisoners waiting for space in the local jails. Mr. \n     Allen, who has promised not to raise taxes, will have to go \n     back to the Assembly next year and try to find the rest of \n     the $370m that he describes as a down-payment for safer \n     streets. It costs $19,800 a year to keep an inmate behind \n     bars. It is doubtful whether the governor can raise what he \n     needs by cutting expenditure elsewhere and selling off \n     surplus state properties. Many state agencies are still \n     operating on recession budgets. The sale of state land and \n     equipment is expected to net a paltry $26m.\n       On the other side of the country, in Oregon, where parole \n     was abolished in 1989, a cheaper way of coping with over-full \n     prisons is being tried. Oregon's voters are not keen on \n     paying more, either: the advocates of tougher penalties for \n     crimes against property failed to get enough signatures to \n     put their proposal on the ballot last year, presumably \n     because it would have cost $300m a year. So the state \n     legislature, in providing more money for the corrections \n     department, said that most of it should go into alternatives \n     to prison for non-violent offenders. That would free some \n     existing prison space for more dangerous criminals.\n       This approach has already been tried in states with some of \n     the highest incarceration rates in the nation, among them \n     Florida and Georgia. So-called ``intermediate sanctions'' for \n     non-violent felons--for instance, house arrest or work \n     programmes--are cheap. In Florida, they cost only $6.49 per \n     day per felon, compared with prison's near-$40 a day. They \n     may also be working. A six-year study by the National Council \n     on Crime and Delinquency shows that in Florida people \n     sentenced to such penalties are less likely to be arrested \n     within 18 months of their release than similar offenders who \n     had been sentenced to between 12 and 30 months in jail.\n       Texas, though, stays old-fashioned about its prison \n     problem: it throws money at it. Twice this year, the Texas \n     legislature has taken $100m from other parts of the state \n     government to pay for more prisons.

Mr. President, there has been much talk recently \nabout rewriting last year's Federal crime bill. That talk has focused \non spending billions more for prison construction and longer sentences, \nwhile drastically reducing funds for prevention programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to think hard about whether these changes \nrepresent smart policy. Last month, I conducted a survey of 157 \nwardens, and I asked them to comment on our present crime policies. By \nlarge margins, the wardens warned that our overwhelming emphasis on \nbuilding prisons just isn't working. They urged a far more balanced \napproach to crime-fighting, that mixes punishment, prevention, and \ntreatment.\n  The Daily Southtown, in a recent editorial, called on Congress to \nlisten to the advice of these experts, rather than moving rapidly ahead \nwith policies that may be politically popular, but ultimately \nshortsighted. That is a message we would all do well to heed.\n  I ask that this editorial be reprinted following my remarks.\n  The editorial follows:\n                [From the Daily Southtown, Dec. 8, 1994]\n\n    Wardens' View on Crime: Mandatory Sentencing Won't Solve Problem\n\n       Is ``locking them up and throwing away the key'' the most \n     effective approach to reducing crime? Not if you listen to \n     the prison wardens across the country who are in charge of \n     the nation's inmates.\n       Some 157 prison wardens were surveyed by a U.S. Senate \n     subcommittee, and 85 percent of them said the politically \n     popular approach--mandatory, longer incarceration--didn't \n     work.\n       The survey was conducted at the request of Sen. Paul Simon \n     (D-Ill.). The survey showed that ``the idea we can solve our \n     crime problem by putting more people in prison just has not \n     worked,'' Simon said. The senator said most of the wardens \n     favored approaches \n     [[Page S1792]] that mixed prevention, treatment and \n     punishment. Sixty-five percent said they preferred increasing \n     sentences for violent criminals and cutting sentences for \n     non-violent inmates.\n       Some 92 percent favored placing non-violent drug offenders \n     in residential treatment programs, halfway houses, home \n     detention and boot camps rather than prisons. And contrary to \n     the rhetoric that proved so popular in the November election, \n     the wardens said they wanted programs in prison for drug \n     treatment, vocational training and educational programs.\n       Simon said he asked for the survey because he feared the \n     new Republican majority in Congress would rewrite the 1994 \n     crime bill to remove prevention and treatment programs and \n     replace them with more costly punishment approaches.\n       Our elected officials ought to give some serious thought to \n     the recommendations of the experts--the people who run our \n     prisons--rather than setting new policies based on what would \n     serve the politicians best in future elections.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1791-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, this April will mark the fourth anniversary \nof the untimely passing of our friend and colleague, John Heinz. And \nthose of us who were privileged to serve with this remarkable public \nservant continue to miss his friendship and his leadership.\n  Many of John's friends gathered last Thursday in Statuary Hall for \nthe presentation of the first Heinz Awards. These awards were \nestablished by Teresa Heinz and the Heinz Family Foundation, and will \nbe awarded to individuals who have made a difference in five issue \nareas where John was most active.\n  It was a very moving and inspiring ceremony, and it reminded us again \nthat, as John Heinz proved throughout his career, good people can do \ngreat things.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the very eloquent remarks \ndelivered at the ceremony by Teresa Heinz be printed in the Record, and \nthat they be followed by brief biographies of the six Heinz Award \nrecipients.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks of Teresa Heinz at the Heinz Awards, Statuary Hall, January 26, \n                                  1995\n\n       Thank you.\n       This is a deeply gratifying and poignant day. It is the \n     culmination of nearly four years of careful thought about how \n     to pay tribute to the memory and spirit of my late husband \n     John Heinz. And it is the culmination of four years of hard \n     work toward that goal. I know John would be greatly honored \n     that we are all here today in this hallowed hall, to \n     celebrate his memory in a place that meant so much to him. I \n     want to thank Speaker Gingrich and our sponsor, Congressman \n     Curt Weldon, for making this possible. And I especially want \n     thank all of you for being here.\n       If you have ever done it, you know that the making of a \n     tribute is a terribly difficult matter. That is especially \n     true when the goal is to honor someone as complex and multi-\n     faceted as my late husband. I realized early on that, for \n     John Heinz, no static monument or self-serving exercise in \n     sentimentality would do. He would have wanted no part of such \n     things. The only tribute befitting him would be one that \n     celebrated his spirit by honoring those who live and work as \n     he did.\n       To me, the value of remembering John Heinz is and always \n     will be in remembering what he stood for and how he stood for \n     it. His life said something important about how life can be \n     lived, and should be lived. I wanted to remember him in a way \n     that would inspire not just me, but the rest of us.\n       And so the Heinz Awards were born. They are intended to \n     recognize outstanding achievers in five areas in which John \n     was particularly active. But they are meant less as a reward \n     for the people we will honor here today, than as a reminder \n     for the rest of us--a reminder of what can happen when good \n     people, regardless of who they are or where they come from, \n     set out to make a difference.\n       There is a saying in the Heinz family that dates back to my \n     husband's great-grandfather, the founder of the Heinz \n     Company. Quite aside from his business acumen, H.J. Heinz was \n     an exceptional man who battled his food industry peers on \n     behalf of food purity laws, created the most progressive \n     workplace of his day, and fostered in his offspring an \n     abiding sense of social responsibility. And yet H.J. Heinz \n     dismissed the notion that he was truly exceptional. His aim, \n     he said humbly, was merely ``to do a common thing uncommonly \n     well.''\n       In much the same way, H.J. Heinz's great-grandson never saw \n     greatness in his great accomplishments. For John Heinz, \n     public service was a common thing, one that he wanted to do \n     uncommonly well. He was a dedicated achiever, but he was \n     distinguished mostly by intangible qualities--qualities of \n     mind and spirit: intellectual curiosity; a love of people; an \n     informed optimism; a willingness to take risks; a passion for \n     excellence; a belief that he could make the world a better \n     place; the stubborn determination to make it so. And, above \n     all, a contagious, effervescent joy in life.\n       These are the qualities celebrated by the Heinz Awards. \n     They are, in fact, in addition to excellence, the criteria. \n     In our first year, our nominators sent us some two hundred \n     nominations from across the country. And as we began culling \n     through these, we took excellence as a given. But then we \n     looked beyond achievement. We looked for vision, and \n     character and intent.\n       And finally, after our jurors and board of directors had \n     met, we had settled on six remarkable individuals. They are \n     an eclectic group. To the extent they share world views, that \n     is more by accident than design. Their underlying spirit was \n     what we asked our nominators and jurors to assess. And it is \n     that spirit, a spirit that I regard as uniquely American, \n     that we are here today to salute.\n       Many people in our society wish that they could make the \n     world a better place. Too few believe that they actually can. \n     And fewer still act on that belief.\n       Many people have dreams. Too few pursue those dreams. And, \n     tragically, fewer still persist until dream becomes reality.\n       We live in cynical times, and one aspect of that cynicism \n     is the corrosive notion that individuals are powerless to \n     make a difference. But history is still made by people, one \n     person at a time. Our first recipients of the Heinz Awards \n     illustrate just how much we can do when we apply ourselves \n     and care enough to try.\n       They are an antidote, if you will, not just to cynicism, \n     but to the culture of powerlessness so ascendant now in our \n     society. These six have believed in the power of one. They \n     have dreamed great dreams. And they have made that belief and \n     that dreaming the basis of their life's work, to the \n     betterment of us all.\n       Their stories, I hope, will remind Americans that we really \n     do have power as individuals, that good people still can \n     achieve great things. Our world has been improved by the six \n     individuals you are about to meet. But the secret of their \n     impact transcends their films, their books, their programs, \n     their treaties, and their microchips. These things \n     [[Page S1793]] were made great by the qualities of the people \n     who made them, by their joy, their love of people, their \n     optimism, their willingness to take risks, their passion for \n     excellence, their belief that they can improve the world, \n     their gritty determination. Their work, accomplished as it \n     is, has been the product of something internal--an \n     incandescence that burns brightly in the human spirit.\n       Our faith in luminous qualities of heart and mind made this \n     a great country. And if there is to be any future for this \n     thing we so blithely call the American spirit, we must \n     embrace those qualities again. Can it be done? Is it \n     important? As evidence and proof, I offer you six \n     extraordinary people.\n       Thank you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Bibliographies of the Six Heinz Award Winners\n                         paul and anne ehrlich\n\n       Paul and Anne Ehrlich receive the Heinz Award in the \n     Environment in recognition of their thoughtful study of \n     difficult environmental issues, their commitment to bringing \n     their findings to the attention of policy makers and the \n     public, and their willingness to suggest solutions.\n       Anne and Paul Ehrlich have been producing important \n     scientific research for over three decades. But they are \n     distinguished by their passionate determination to \n     communicate their findings to non-scientific audiences. They \n     have long seen it as their responsibility to alert humanity \n     to the dangers of ecological carelessness and arrogance. This \n     perspective, uncommon among scientists, has made them the \n     target of sometimes strident criticism, which they accept \n     with grace as the price of forthrightness.\n       They are distinguished as well by their willingness to \n     offer and seek solutions to the problems they identify. Their \n     prescriptions, sometimes misrepresented as draconian, are \n     rooted in the same Judeo-Christian principles that are the \n     source of the Ehrlich's profound ethic of stewardship. It \n     would be difficult to name any other couple who have made \n     such a long-standing and substantive contribution to \n     scientific and policy understanding of population, \n     environment, and resource issues.\n       As scientists, authors and educators, Paul and Anne Ehrlich \n     have for 30 years devoted themselves to enhancing public \n     understanding of a wide range of environmental issues, \n     including conservation biology, biodiversity and habitat \n     preservation.\n       The basis of the Ehrlichs work has always been their \n     science, and they have compiled an important body of \n     scientific research over the years. But it is for their \n     environmental advocacy, particularly in the area of \n     population, that the Ehrlichs are most well known to the \n     general public, and little wonder. Paul Ehrlich made a \n     memorable debut on the world scene with the publication of \n     his 1968 book, The Population Bomb, in which he warned that \n     the Earth's resources could not indefinitely support the \n     planet's growing population. In a 1990 sequel, The Population \n     Explosion, Anne and Paul Ehrlich provided an unflinching \n     update.\n       Setting forth challenging but prescient work was to become \n     a hallmark of the Ehrlich's careers. Several decades ago, the \n     Ehrlichs were the first to raise the alarm about a possible \n     resurgence of infectious diseases, another controversial \n     theory now taken seriously.\n       Paul Ehrlich, who is Bing Professor of Population Studies \n     in the Department of Biological Sciences at Stanford \n     University, and Anne Ehrlich, senior research associate in \n     biology and policy coordination at Stanford's Center for \n     Conservation Biology, which the couple founded, have never \n     suggested that population issues represent the whole of the \n     planet's problems. In fact they have been forceful advocates \n     for broadening the agenda of the environmental movement to \n     include such issues as biodiversity, poverty, consumption, \n     carrying capacity, energy supplies, agriculture and food, \n     global warming, nuclear weapons, international economics, \n     environmental ethics, and sustainable development.\n       The Ehrlichs have displayed rare leadership in seeking to \n     translate meaningful science into workable policy. Far from \n     being prophets of doom, they are spirited optimists, whose \n     unrivaled contributions have flowed from a belief that the \n     future is still ours to make.\n                            geoffrey canada\n\n       Geoffrey Canada receives the Heinz Award for the Human \n     Condition in recognition of his battle against what he calls \n     the ``monsters'' preying on the children of the depressed \n     inner-city. As President and CEO of the New York-based \n     Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, he not only has \n     created model programs, but sets an example for all adults \n     wanting to protect children from crime, drugs, lawlessness \n     and despair.\n       Geoffrey Canada knows life in the inner city at first hand. \n     It's where he grew up, and he remembers what it's like to be \n     a child there. ``I haven't forgotten about the monsters,'' he \n     says. ``I remember being small, vulnerable and scared.''\n       Geoffrey Canada was one of those rare and fortunate young \n     men and women who are able to rise above and move beyond the \n     inner city. Once they leave, they rarely return. But Canada \n     did return, motivated by a desire to save young people whose \n     lives might otherwise be snuffed out by bullets or smothered \n     by hopelessness. He decided to live in Harlem, the community \n     in which he works, in order to provide what, in his own \n     youth, he so wished for: a role model. He is optimistic in \n     seeking practical answers to what pessimists view as \n     intractable problems. The fact that he has no illusions is \n     the very thing that makes him so effective.\n       Geoffrey Canada grew up poor on welfare, in a household \n     headed by a single woman in the blighted tenements of New \n     York's South Bronx. Despite the many things he did not have, \n     he realized what he did have: a hard-working and loving \n     mother who gave him a strong set of values, a deep sense of \n     responsibility, a belief in the importance of education, and \n     an almost ardent commitment to make things better not only \n     for himself, but for those around him.\n       In 1963, having completed his graduate education, he joined \n     the staff of the New York-based Rheedlen Centers for Children \n     and Families. He was named its President/CEO in 1990. At \n     Rheedlen, he has been instrumental in creating or developing \n     such programs as Rheedlen's Beacon School, Community Pride, \n     the Harlem Freedom Schools, and Peacemakers.\n       The Beacon Schools program uses public school buildings to \n     provide inner-city families with safe shelters and \n     constructive activities 17 hours a day, 365 days a year. \n     There are now 37 Beacon Schools in New York. The program has \n     been replicated in Connecticut, Illinois, and California.\n       To combat the culture of violence in the inner-city, Canada \n     conceived of the Peacemakers Program. He was concerned by the \n     media's easy promotion of violence as a way of settling \n     disputes, and he set out to develop an alternative: a program \n     to teach children how to use communication to resolve \n     conflicts. His Peacemakers curriculum trains young people in \n     conflict resolution, mediation, and violence prevention and \n     reduction techniques. He is the author of the forthcoming \n     Fist Stick Knife Gun, a book on conflict resolution.\n       Geoffrey Canada believes that, if today's urban youth are \n     to be convinced that a disadvantaged background does not \n     demand despair or dictate defeat, they must have real role \n     models and real heroes. And they need them on the spot: \n     successful, educated men and women who continue to live \n     alongside them in their communities, shop at their stores, \n     play in their parks, and ride the buses and subways just as \n     they do. Geoffrey Canada's life teaches by example.\n                        ambassador james goodby\n\n       Ambassador James Goodby receives the Heinz Award for Public \n     Policy. Virtually unknown to his countrymen or to the world, \n     Ambassador Goodby is a quiet titan in the delicate, high \n     stakes arena of international nuclear weapons negotiations.\n       Both the esoteric and security-sensitive nature of his \n     specialty have required him to work almost entirely behind \n     the scenes. But for more than four decades, under nine \n     Presidents, James Goodby has made the world a safer place, \n     beginning with his leadership of the effort to achieve a \n     nuclear test ban treaty in the 1950s and 1960s. After \n     retiring from the foreign service in 1989, Ambassador Goodby \n     was called back into service in 1993 to serve as Chief U.S. \n     Negotiator for the Safe and Secure Dismantlement of Nuclear \n     Weapons. He negotiated over 30 agreements with several former \n     Soviet Republics to assist in the dismantling of nuclear \n     weapons, preventing weapons proliferation and converting \n     military facilities to civilian enterprises.\n       As Secretary of Defense William Perry has written, ``Jim's \n     life has been dedicated to serving the public and humanity. \n     He is an unselfish individual who is touched by the needs of \n     others and responds in a vigorous way to bring about \n     change.''\n       James Goodby came of age in the shadow of the atomic bomb. \n     The post-war years--the late 1940s and early 1950s--saw the \n     disintegration of wartime alliances and the escalation of \n     East-West tensions. Goodby graduated from Harvard in 1951 and \n     entered the foreign service in 1952. With the exception of \n     the two years he served as U.S. Ambassador to Finland (1980-\n     1981), most of his career has dealt with international peace \n     and security negotiations.\n       His reputation as a negotiator quickly spread through \n     foreign policy and government circles: he was strong and \n     dependable; he was smart; and he seemed to have the knack for \n     devising creative solutions to complicated questions. While \n     assigned to the U.S. Mission to NATO in the early 1970s, he \n     negotiated alliance positions on human rights and security \n     provisions for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe, many of which became part of the Helsinki Final Act. \n     After a stint as vice chairman of the U.S. delegation to the \n     Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), he became head of the \n     U.S. delegation to the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and \n     Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe in 1984. \n     In that position, he negotiated the framework that laid the \n     basis for negotiations on conventional force reductions in \n     Europe. Former Secretary of State George Shultz, who \n     describes Goodby as a ``thoroughly laudable person,'' has \n     written that ``Ambassador Goodby got the ball rolling very \n     effectively, standing up to the Soviets and rallying our \n     allies.''\n       Praise for his accomplishments makes James Goodby, now a \n     Distinguished Service Professor at Carnegie Mellon University \n     in Pittsburgh, Pa., uncomfortable. A native New Englander, he \n     modestly demurs: ``Where I come from, we don't feel \n     comfortable with \n     [[Page S1794]] such talk * * * I had a lot of people to help \n     me do it.''\n       It may surprise some that a single individual, bucking \n     modern media worship by purposely eschewing publicity, could \n     make such a difference to the fate of the world. But James \n     Goodby, compelled to a life of public service by a desire to \n     make the world a safer place, offers reassurance that there \n     still exist in America men and women with brilliant minds and \n     distinguished careers who need nothing more than the inner \n     satisfaction of a vision fulfilled and the knowledge that \n     they have truly made a difference.\n                            andrew s. grove\n\n       Andrew Grove receives the Heinz Award for Technology and \n     the Economy in recognition not just of his astounding \n     technological and business accomplishments, but also of his \n     determination and vision. In a story as old as America, those \n     traits transformed him from a young immigrant into a leading \n     figure in the birth of the information society.\n       His accomplishments range from the technical to the \n     commercial, from contributing to the development of the \n     microprocessor chip--perhaps the most important advancement \n     in the history of computing--to helping create the personal \n     computer industry. As more Americans start traveling down the \n     information highway, at speeds and prices to their liking, a \n     tip of their symbolic hats to Andy Grove would be in order.\n       More than an engineering genius, he is an enlightened \n     corporate executive and employer whose ability to nurture \n     talent is legendary. His peers as well as his employees call \n     him Andy, and that speaks volumes about the man's character, \n     about his approach to business and, most certainly, about his \n     approach to life.\n       A native of Hungary, Andrew Grove fled during the 1956 \n     Soviet invasion. When he arrived in New York, he was twenty \n     years old, had only a few dollars in his pocket, and knew \n     even fewer words of English.\n       The boy from Budapest has lived the quintessential American \n     success story. By working any job he could find, he put \n     himself through New York's City College, earning a BS. in \n     Chemical Engineering. He received his masters and Ph.D. from \n     the University of California at Berkeley.\n       Andrew Grove has played perhaps the pivotal role in the \n     development and popularization of the 20th century's most \n     remarkable innovation--the personal computer. The \n     technologies pioneered by Grove and his associates, first at \n     Fairchild Semiconductor and then at Intel, which he co-\n     founded in 1968, made the entire personal computing \n     revolution possible. The world has barely begun to scratch \n     the surface of the technological and economic benefits that \n     revolution can bring.\n       No stranger to controversy, Andrew Grove has shown an \n     ability to learn from experience. And, while others panicked \n     over problems or setbacks, he has always managed to maintain \n     his focus on what is important and what he does best: \n     developing even faster, more affordable and more powerful \n     technology.\n       Thanks in large measure to Andrew Grove's genius and \n     vision, millions of people now have instant and inexpensive \n     access to the kinds of information and entertainment about \n     which even the elites of previous generations could only \n     dream.\n                             henry hampton\n\n       Henry Hampton receives the Heinz Award in Arts and \n     Humanities for his creativity, his curiosity and his \n     seriousness of purpose, as manifested in the outstanding \n     contributions of Blackside, Inc., the independent film and \n     television company he founded in 1968.\n       From modest beginnings, Blackside has become one of the \n     successful independent production companies in the world. But \n     success hasn't changed Henry Hampton, who, remembering his \n     early struggles, regularly mentors young minority filmakers.\n       Among Blackside's productions are the landmark television \n     series Eyes on the Prize I and II. Other Blackside \n     documentaries have included The Great Depression, Malcolm X, \n     and the recently-broadcast America's War on Poverty.\n       Hampton's work and that of his producing team, has been \n     described as ``history as poetry''--but it is not the kind of \n     poetry that sugar-coats difficult and divisive issues. He \n     believes that Americans of all races must truly understand \n     their past before they can deal with the present, much less \n     master the future.\n       Henry Hampton grew up in St. Louis. After deciding against \n     a career in medicine, he went to work as an editor, and later \n     as director of information, for the Unitarian Universalist \n     Church. When a Unitarian minister was killed in Selma, \n     Alabama, the churchleaders, including Hampton, went to the \n     South to join Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s march.\n       During this first visit to the deep south, Hampton started \n     to think about capturing the struggle for civil rights on \n     film. He had no experience, but he set about learning. \n     Questioning the conventional approaches, he and his \n     colleagues slowly began devising a unique style for \n     Blackside's work. Finally he was ready to make exactly the \n     kinds of documentaries he envisioned.\n       Eyes on the Prize has received six Emmys, a Peabody, and an \n     Academy Award nomination. It has been broadcast around the \n     world, and is used as a teaching tool on as many as half of \n     four-year college campuses in the U.S.\n       Henry Hampton pushes his company to deal with what he calls \n     ``messy history''--the kind that doesn't supply the neat \n     conclusion the public so often wants. He believes that media \n     can help people use the perspective history offers as they \n     deal with contemporary problems.\n       Depsite the weighty issues with which his films deal, Henry \n     Hampton remains an optimistic man. He is undeterred by the \n     effects of both childhood polio and of a more-recent cancer. \n     His vision of a just and compassionate future for all \n     Americans fuels his spirit and permeates his work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/30/senate-section/article/S1792-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9:30 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
