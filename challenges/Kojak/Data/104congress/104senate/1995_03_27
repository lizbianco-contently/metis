Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about the \nself-employment health insurance tax credit that was passed last \nFriday. This was the right thing to do. This was something that we \nneeded to do and need to continue so that it will be retroactive for \nthis tax year.\n  But I want to make the point that we have not finished yet. Last \nFriday was simply a reinstatement of what we have had in the past. But \nwe need to go further. Last Friday's bill reinstates the 25-percent tax \ndeduction for premiums on health care insurance for 1994 and increases \nthe deduction to 30 percent for tax years beginning in 1995 and \nthereafter.\n  This is a very important issue, a very important item to Americans, \nand a very important item to health care. There are 12 million self-\nemployed business men and women across this country, 19,000 of whom \nreside in Wyoming. These business men and women can now proceed with \nthe filing of their 1994 tax returns knowing that a portion \n[[Page S4604]] of their health insurance can be deducted. April 15th is \ngrim enough, of course, with Uncle Sam digging deeper and deeper into \nthe pockets of the American people. At least Congress can make it a \ndeduction that is retroactive and finally make it permanent. That is \nthe least that can be done because self-employed business owners, \nowners who put their families and hard-earned savings on the line in \npursuit of the American dream, are treated unfairly and are treated \nwithout equity.\n  The Tax Code says people who strive to be their own boss are only \npermitted to deduct a small percentage of health insurance with after-\ntax dollars. However, if you are a large corporation, you are permitted \nto deduct 100 percent with before-tax dollars. After-tax dollars is a \ncritical item because it makes basic medical care twice as expensive as \nif it were provided by the employer. Taxes must be paid first on what a \nself-employed person makes, and then health insurance can be bought \nwith what is left over.\n  If last year's health care debate was really about expanding health \ncare coverage, then Congress should take the opportunity to promote tax \nfairness among businesses large and small whether it is one employee or \nseveral hundred. There are 2.8 million uninsured self-employed \nproprietors in this country who could quickly purchase coverage if it \nwas made affordable. Providing 100 percent health insurance tax \ndeduction is at issue. The result of that would be coverage for another \none-third of the population, not through Government takeover, not \nthrough price controls or employer mandates, but through a means of \nfairness in the Tax Code.\n  Last Friday's action on health care should not be the final action. \nThis body should continue to pursue changes in our national health care \ninfrastructure to supplement the self-employed health insurance tax \ncredit. Vital changes such as portability, prohibiting the use of \npreexisting conditions, and the pooling of small businesses must also \nbe included. The result will be the elimination of job lock and \nexorbitant premiums for Americans.\n  Malpractice liability reform and regulatory reform for health care \nproviders must be included as we move forward on the list of health \ncare costs that are ever increasing. This includes tax regulations as \nwell as future regulations because we should be footing the bill for \nthe unfunded mandates and will continue to do that. With the \nconstraints facing us, Congress needs to move forward with health care \nreform, not in the form that we talked about last year, but to do those \nincremental things that we can do to make health care more affordable \nand more acceptable to Americans throughout the country.\n  This is a move in the right direction to provide fairness and to \nprovide equity. Last Friday was the beginning.\n  I urge my colleagues to move forward with health care. It is not \ngoing to resolve everything, but there have been advances made in the \nprivate sector for the first time in 15 years and the cost to employers \nhas gone down some. On the other hand, of course, Medicare and Medicaid \ncontinue to go up at an unacceptable rate. We have to do something \nabout that.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased with the action of last Friday in \nthis body. I look forward to continued reform in health care. I remain \ncommitted to working for that reform.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No response from the audience.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under the previous order, there will now be 6 \nhours for general debate on the subject of S. 219.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Federal \nregulations. We are going to be on Senate bill S. 219. I want to \ncompliment Senator Roth and the Governmental Affairs Committee for \nreporting this bill out. I also want to compliment the House of \nRepresentatives for their move in trying to make some progress on \nreining in the cost of excessive regulations. Federal regulations are \nestimated to cost about $581 billion, by some sources. It is hard to \nfigure what that means, but per household, that is over $6,000--\nactually $6,100 per household for the cost of Federal regulations. That \nincreases the cost of everything we buy. Whether you are talking about \nyour automobile or your home or your electric bill or the price that \nyou pay for gasoline, regulations are involved in all these and have \ninflated the costs on every single thing that we buy.\n  Many of us feel these regulations have been excessive and they have \nnot been well thought out, or in some cases they are too expensive. I \nmight mention, I guess almost all are probably well intended, and I do \nnot fault anyone's intentions, whether it be the people who passed the \nlegislation authorizing the regulations or the regulators. They may be \nwell intended, but in many cases, the regulations have gone too far and \nthey are far too expensive.\n  So we have several measures that are working their way through this \nbody and through the Congress to try to limit excessive regulations.\n  The House passed a couple of measures. One was a measure called \nregulation moratorium. A similar bill was reported out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. That is the bill we have on the floor \nof the Senate today. I, along with my colleague and friend from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, will be offering an amendment in the form of a substitute \nto that bill. I will discuss that in a moment.\n  Also the Governmental Affairs Committee has reported out a \ncomprehensive bill dealing with regulation overhaul. I compliment them \nfor that effort. I think it is a giant step in the right direction. \nSenator Dole, myself, and others have introduced a very comprehensive \nbill. Likewise, I believe there is a markup scheduled in the Judiciary \nCommittee on that bill as well.\n  I compliment Senator Dole for his leadership because I think it makes \nsense. We should have regulations where the benefits exceed the costs. \nWe should make sure we use real science. That is the purpose of both \nSenator Roth's bill and Senator Dole's bill that we will be considering \non the floor my guess is sometime after the April recess.\n  But the bill we have before us many people support--the regulation \nmoratorium bill, S. 219. I am a sponsor of that bill. I believe we have \n36 sponsors. This is a bill that people have labeled a ``moratorium.'' \nI even have heard some people mislabel it, including the President, who \nsaid it was a ``moratorium on all regulations,'' good and bad \nregulations. I take issue with that because we had a lot of exceptions \nfor good regulations and we had a lot of exceptions for regulations \nwhich people felt were necessary to go forward with, those regulations \nthat dealt with imminent health and safety and regulations that dealt \nwith ordinary administrative practices. The committee added more \nexceptions. The Committee on Governmental Affairs limited it to \nsignificant regulations. So we reduced the scope substantially.\n  Why was that bill introduced? That bill was introduced because on \nNovember 14, the administration announced or published in the Federal \nRegister that they were working on 4,300 different regulations that \nwere in progress and that would be finalized in the year 1995 and \nbeyond. Many of us were concerned. That looked like an explosion of \nregulations. Many of those regulations had been held up during the \nprevious year. It happened to be an election year, and they were held \nup and published in the Federal Register on November 14.\n  So we wanted to stop those or at least we wanted to have a chance to \n[[Page S4605]] look at them. So this moratorium regulation was \nintroduced with a lot of sponsors. It eventually passed the House with \na lot of exceptions, came through the Senate, was marked up in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which added more exceptions and limited \nit to significant regulations. That was a moratorium.\n  The amendment that Senator Reid, myself, Senator Bond, and Senator \nHutchison are offering is a different approach. One, the moratorium \nthat passed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee is a temporary \nmoratorium. It expires when we pass comprehensive legislation, or it \nexpires at the end of the year. So it was only a temporary moratorium. \nThe legislation we are introducing today provides for 45-day \ncongressional review of regulations. During that time, Congress will be \nauthorized to review and potentially to reject regulations through a \nresolution of disapproval before they become final.\n  This alternative provides an opportunity to move forward on the \ncritical issue of regulatory reform in a bipartisan manner. I think \nthat is vitally important. This amendment will allow the authors of \nlegislation in Congress to review and to ensure that Federal agencies \nare properly carrying out congressional intent. All too often agencies \nissue regulations which go beyond their intended purpose.\n  For future significant rules, the alternative provides a 45-day \nperiod following publication of the final rule before that rule can \nbecome effective. Under the current law, most rules are already delayed \nby 30 days pending the filing of an appeal. This delay in the \neffectiveness would only apply to significant regulations which the \namendment defines as final rules that meet one of four criteria set by \nthe administration under Executive Order 12866. For all other future \nnonsignificant rules, the regulation of disapproval is in order, but \nthe final rule is not suspended during the 45-day period.\n  The alternative also provides an opportunity to review and reject \nsignificant rules which became final on or after November 20, 1994, and \nprior to the date of enactment. Such rules would not be suspended \nduring the review period. Final regulations addressing threats to \nimminent health and safety or other emergencies, criminal law \nenforcement or matters of national security, could be exempted by \nExecutive order from the postponement of the effective date provided \nfor in this bill. However, a joint resolution of disapproval will still \nbe eligible for fast-track consideration.\n  The expedited floor procedure has in it consideration of base closure \nlegislation as well as consideration of Federal Election Commission \nregulations. Congress will have 45 calendar days to review final rules \nand consider a resolution of disapproval.\n  All final rules that are published less than 60 days before Congress \nadjourns sine die or that are published during sine die adjournment \nshall be eligible for review and fast-track disapproval procedures for \n45 days beginning on the 15th day after a new Congress convenes. A \njoint resolution may be introduced by any Member of Congress, and the \nfast-track process for moving the joint resolution of disapproval to \nthe calendar is enabled under two conditions; First, if the authorizing \ncommittee reports out the resolution; or, second, if following the \nresolution's introduction the committee does not act, the majority \nleader of either House discharges the committee from further \nconsideration of the resolution and places the resolution of \ndisapproval directly on the calendar. The motion to proceed to \nconsideration of the resolution is privileged and is nondebatable.\n  I would like to note that last Thursday the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee reported out the comprehensive reform bill which \nincludes this 45-day review proposal. However, it did not contain a \nlook back to past regulations. Once the Senate has moved to proceed to \nthe resolution of disapproval, the debate on the resolution is limited \nto 10 hours equally divided with no motions other than a motion to \nfurther limit debate or amendments being in order. If the resolution \npasses one body, it is eligible for immediate consideration on the \nfloor of the other body.\n  The joint resolution, if passed by both Houses, would be subject to a \nPresidential veto and in turn a possible veto override. By providing \nthe mechanism to hold Federal agencies accountable before it is too \nlate, this alternative makes an important contribution to the critical \nregulatory reform effort. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, I would like to at this time mention and thank my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Reid, from Nevada for his support in \noffering and working with me to offer this alternative or substitute to \nthe regulation moratorium. I have had the pleasure of working with \nSenator Reid for many, many years now. We worked together on the \nmeasures that we called the Economic and Employment Impact Statement, a \nmeasure which is becoming law I guess as part of the unfunded mandate \nbill. He has been a real leader in trying to reform and limit the cost \nof excessive regulations. I compliment him for that successful effort \nin the past, and I look forward to a successful effort on this bill as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma and my \nfriend from Nevada for introducing this legislation, S. 219. Whenever \nit was announced that this bill was going to come to the floor at this \ntime, I was pretty happy about it because a couple of weeks ago I \nchaired a field hearing in Kalispel, MT, to look at the new OSHA rules \non the logging industry. I was as surprised as anybody.\n  We have been receiving a lot of mail in our office from northwest \nMontana on how these new regulations as suggested by OSHA were really \nout of bounds this time. After all, the State of Montana has in place \nregulations for safety in the workplace, especially in the logging \nindustry, and they are not strangers to the logging industry because it \nhas been a part of the Montana scene for many, many years. But to go to \nthat hearing and hear these loggers sit down and tell some of the \nhorror stories that happened to them under these new rules and \nregulations was really an eye opener for me.\n  We received comments not only from the State of Montana but folks \nfrom Idaho and folks from Oregon who flew over there to make that \nSaturday field hearing.\n  Randy Ingraham, just to give you an idea, who is a training \nconsultant for the Association of Oregon Loggers, was there and had the \nsame comment basically as the Montana loggers, that Oregon's OSHA \nforest activities code book is as effective as the Federal standards.\n  So what we have in this situation is regulations on top of \nregulations. If we really want to understand why Government is costing \nthe taxpayers so many dollars nowadays, it is because of the \nredundancy. All the States, too, have an OSHA-type office that enforces \nsafety rules in the workplace. States are familiar with the industries \nthat are located within those States.\n  Randy Ingraham's comments were very welcome. Don Rathman said OSHA \nneeds to listen more to the industry rather than to people who have a \nphilosophical idea on what the rules should be.\n  Julie Espanosa: Return the control to States.\n  Bill Copenhaver, from Seeley Lake, MT, said the same thing, that \nMontana standards basically are a little bit higher than those found in \nthe Federal rules but the States show a willingness to work with \nemployers and employees to make sure that the workplace is safe rather \nthan just coming out and saying this little item here, something is \nwrong with it, so I am going to fine you and if you want to change it, \nthat is fine. But next week we will fine you again if you do not. In \nother words, they are reluctant to work with employees for a safe \nworkplace.\n  Robert Cuddy, from Plains, MT; Dan Kanniburgh, from Marion, MT.\n  The list goes on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may put in the Record a \ncouple statements from folks who testified at that committee hearing as \nthey were given to me.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n       My name is Arley Adams, doing business as Adams Wood \n     Products.\n       [[Page S4606]] I'm a second generation logger in the timber \n     and saw mill industry. My son, Alan is the third generation \n     in the business and works with me.\n       We have a logging and sawmill operation that can be \n     operated by two or ten men, but with OSHA standards and \n     Workmans Compensation rates, there is no way we can hire one \n     man. You wonder why there is so much unemployment? Its called \n     cause and effect.\n       The rules and regulations that OSHA has at this time are so \n     far out of line that they will break every small operator.\n       Sure, our business is dangerous but so are a lot of other \n     industries and sports.\n       We are professionals in our business and we have an \n     excellent Safety Team in the Logging Association. We are well \n     aware of the dangers we are up against--we work with them \n     daily.\n       OSHA thinks that we are so incompetent that they must hold \n     our hands and impede us with so much gear that they ``OSHA'' \n     will be the cause of the accidents they are trying to \n     prevent.\n       When they break us all--they will have to feed us because \n     surely we can't be trusted with a dinner fork.\n       The entire situation OSHA is trying to impose upon us is a \n     ``Major Disaster.'' If California got Disaster Relief from \n     the earthquake, we should be eligible too!\n     Arley A. Adams.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    March 9, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Burns: As a working foreman for a logging \n     company in the state of Idaho, I work with safety problems on \n     a daily basis. We have about thirty-five (35) other workers \n     on the job.\n       We pride ourselves in being able to have OSHA, the State, \n     or anyone else come on our job and see that we make the \n     working conditions as safe as humanly possible.\n       We work closely with the people from the Idaho Logging \n     Safety Program and we know that most of the other contractors \n     in our area do also. We've put together safety programs, \n     weekly safety meetings, monthly safety meetings, and anything \n     else they've asked for.\n       Then all of a sudden here come these new OSHA rules telling \n     us that we can't use diesel to start fires anymore and that \n     we can't fuel any of our machines with the engines running. \n     Do you people realize that you are talking to adults not five \n     year old kids. How many injuries have there been in the State \n     of Idaho from people using diesel to start a fire or from \n     fueling a vehicle with the engine running?\n       These rules and some of the others I've read in the book 29 \n     CFR 1910 and 1928 really have no place in a logging standard.\n       Why don't you live with the Idaho Code. It as least let's \n     us use some common sense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Terry Streeter,\n     Foreman, Babbitt Logging, Inc.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Senator Burns, members of the committee: My name is Paul \n     Tisher. I live in Libby, Montana, My partner's name is Paul \n     Brown and we own and operate TBC Timber, a small family-owned \n     business. We've been in business for 15 years and have nine \n     employees other than ourselves. We are (also) working members \n     of our crew.\n       One of the new rules which concerns us most is under D. \n     General Requirements #5 called Environmental Conditions. It \n     read: All work shall terminate and each employee shall move \n     to a place of safety when environmental conditions, such as \n     but not limited to, electrical storms, high winds, heavy rain \n     or snow, extreme cold, dense fog, fires, mudslide and \n     darkness may endanger an employee in the performance of their \n     job. Senator, the interpretation of these conditions can mean \n     many things to different people. I can tell you, there have \n     been many times when our crew has had to sit out a storm, \n     whether it be wind, rain, or snow. But, the weather will be \n     what it will be, and we as stewards of this land will be out \n     there in the elements to support our families and sustain our \n     communities.\n       Another proposed rule that ties in with these environmental \n     conditions is under Tree Harvesting #2 Manual Felling Section \n     #3. It reads: Each tree shall be checked for accumulations of \n     snow and ice. Accumulation of snow and ice that may create a \n     hazard for an employee shall be removed before felling is \n     commenced in the area or the areas shall be avoided. I hope \n     that OSHA didn't intend for us to remove the snow and ice by \n     ourselves, especially knowing that this would create an even \n     greater hazard. That leaves us with the two things that \n     usually remove snow and ice from trees, and that is wind or \n     rain. Senator, this really becomes confusing at this point. \n     We can't work if there's too much snow or ice in the trees. \n     So we finally get a good hard rain or some chinook winds that \n     remove all the snow and ice, but we can't work under these \n     conditions either. Then as conditions turn colder it starts \n     to snow and we get more build up in the trees. This can go on \n     for six or seven months in Montana and leaves us wondering \n     how we're going to be able to work under this type of rule.\n       Who from OSHA can determine if conditions are too dangerous \n     to work in? What degree of wind, rain, snow, cold or fog will \n     constitute a total shutdown or the ensuing penalties if \n     operations are still working when they arrive. What \n     experience do they have in logging procedure and working with \n     outdoor elements that tell them one or more of these \n     conditions is too dangerous? We feel that the decisions on \n     Environmental Conditions should be left to the people who \n     make their living doing this and not by the Federal \n     Government.\n       Being members of the Montana Logging Association, we as a \n     crew have all had training in First Aid, CPR, Blood Borne \n     Pathogens, Material Safety Data, and Safe Operating \n     Procedures. This training is done annually and is a key to \n     recognizing unsafe or potentially unsafe conditions. Holding \n     ourselves to these standards has become the norm in this \n     profession we call logging.\n       Having said that, I would like to comment on a procedure \n     used by OSHA compliance officers during a jobsite visit. That \n     is the use of a video camera when questioning employers and \n     employees about the training they have had in reference to \n     what I just talked about. This, ``Camera In Your Face'' \n     session gives one the feeling that you've already done \n     something wrong or why would the want to get it on film in \n     the first place. I am sure that somewhere, in all of the many \n     hours of training we have had, someone will forget something, \n     but that doesn't mean all of a sudden we are in a hazardous \n     situation. With the camera rolling and knowing that the wrong \n     answer to a question can result in a training violation and \n     cost an employer up to $7000 per violation and also knowing \n     that you haven't done anything wrong and that you're not in a \n     hazardous situation nor have you created a hazardous \n     situation for a fellow worker, is frustrating and \n     intimidating to the point that the easiest of answers can be \n     forgotten.\n       Senator, logging always has been and always will be a \n     dangerous occupation. We do not take this lightly. It is very \n     clear to us that training for, and providing a safe work \n     place will not only send us all home safely every night but \n     it is also essential for a company to stay in business. If we \n     believe in and practice these things then why do we need the \n     Federal Government to enforce what is already being done. \n     Common sense has been around a lot longer than OSHA and it \n     will be on the job when OSHA isn't. Please Senator, lets not \n     put any more rules into place that would jeopardize the use \n     of good common sense.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I do not know what the cost is, but in the \nnew regulations they required boots for loggers that are not even being \nmade. And I can see this fellow yet, who was described as the OSHA \nrepresentative, up there to enforce these rules and regulations. You \ncan pick him out of a thousand people. There he was.\n  For instance, the employer is required to make sure that the \nemployee's vehicle, if he drives to on-site logging, is safe; in other \nwords, passes all the safety conditions of the State. The employer \nresponsible for an employee's own private automobile? Now, that is \noverstepping a little bit.\n  Also, I found out--and I am not a logger. I have been in the woods a \nlittle but not nearly that much. The renewable resource that I dealt \nwith was grass. You do not take a chain saw to that; you take a cow to \nit. But, anyway, you have to use a Humboldt cut. In other words, when \nyou take down a tree, you have to use the Humboldt cut. I had not heard \nof that. And neither, by the way, had the guy who wrote the rules. He \nsaid he just heard about it but he was not really familiar with what a \nHumboldt cut was. Basically, when you fell a tree, it is to prevent a \nkickback when the tree goes down. And that happens every now and again. \nIn a select cut, no matter how remote or how steep, that tree can only \nbe taken by mechanical means. Now, in some places you just do not get \nmechanical harvesters. What do you do? You let the tree just go, let it \nhang up and lose it? I do not think so.\n  But these are rules and regulations that have been imposed on an \nindustry which were written by an organization with basically very \nlittle common sense when it comes to logging.\n  I just want to put these statements in the Record because I made a \nsuggestion one time. After legislation is passed by this Congress, \nafter it goes to the President for his signature and he signs it into \nlaw, what happens? That law is given to a faceless and nameless \nbureaucrat to write the administrative rules. We have enough evidence \nthat most of those rules have nothing to do with the intent of the \nlegislation. So I suggested that before the final rules go into the \nFederal Register, maybe they should come back to the committee of \njurisdiction to make sure they do conform to the intent of the \nlegislation.\n  I mentioned that to a colleague of mine, and he said, ``Good Heavens, \nSenator, we never would get a law in place,'' at which I just grinned. \nI rested my case. Sometimes we should not have some of these laws \npassed. Maybe it should take a little longer. Maybe they should be \ndebated a little more.\n  [[Page S4607]] But I think we in this body, if we have been remiss in \nany part of our duty, it is in oversight and being involved in writing \nthe administrative rules. If every Senator in this body went home and \ntalked to the industry that is going to be affected, we would be \nacutely aware of the problems faced in private industry. And we wonder \nwhy they are struggling trying to make a living, especially our smaller \ncompanies, our small business people. Over 90 percent of the jobs in \nMontana are created by small business.\n  So I thank any friend from Oklahoma, who is the author of this bill. \nIt gives us 45 days to look at those rules. We should look at the \nrules. We should become actively involved in the rulemaking, especially \nif we are sponsors of a piece of legislation that has so much to do \nwith the workplace and the ability of a small businessman to make a \nliving at this time. Not only are they taxed to death; they are also \nruled and regulated to death. So we need to do what we are supposed to \ndo.\n  It was suggested after the elections last year that Government \nreinvent itself. I do not know what the message was last November 8, \nbut I will tell you this. You will get as many versions of that message \nas there are editorial writers or coffee klatches or Lions Clubs or \nRotary Clubs, wherever people sit down and visit about the political \narena. But I say they are saying to people involved in Government, it \nis time to sit down and reassess the real mission and the real role of \nGovernment. Why are we here and why is it costing the taxpayers so much \nmoney? And then we turn right around and force rules and regulations on \nthem that cost them more.\n  Everybody wants a safe workplace. That is not to say that we should \nnot have some rules and regulations. But I say that whenever you put it \nin the rules and regulations that your car has to be safe--and that is \njust a suggestion--once you write it into the rules, then an inspector \nwho wants to make a name for himself can say, ``Aha, that car is not \nsafe. I will fine you $100,'' instead of saying, ``We have some \nproblems here. Let us work with each other, let us iron them out. Let \nus make a safe workplace.'' In the logging industry especially, most of \nthe companies are small, where you have the man who owns the company, \nplus he has four or five of his friends--and I mean his friends, not \nhis employees--he works with in the woods.\n  They know each other and they must know each other in order to have a \nsafe environment in which to do business. They do not want to hurt each \nother, either. And they are all small.\n  But I am saying, when just a suggestion is made in the Federal \nRegister, it gives an inspector an idea that this is hard law and he \ncan fine for it. So we just need to be a little bit prudent about what \nwe put into rules and regulations.\n  Nobody is arguing here that we take safety out of the workplace. We \nare saying we should approach it in a manner in which we can have the \nemployee, the employer, and the Government entities, both State and \nFederal, work together to make that a safe workplace. I think this \npiece of legislation does it.\n  I congratulate my friend from Nevada, Senator Reid, and my friend \nfrom Oklahoma. I wish his Oklahoma State Cowboys a lot of luck come \nthis weekend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Montana for his support for our amendment, and also thank him for \nhis statement.\n  I also wish to compliment the Senator from Montana, because he did \nsomething that many of us have not been doing. He has held some \noversight hearings. He has had some of those people, many times we call \nthem faceless bureaucrats, but he has had them come into his State and \ntalk about some of the problems, whether it be in logging or forestry, \nand let them talk and actually meet those that they regulate.\n  I believe the Senator said--correct me if I am wrong. The OSHA \nofficial who was writing the regs had not actually been involved in the \nlogging industry but yet was writing rules and regulations dealing with \neverything from trucks to boots, and he has not actually met some of \nthe people whom he was regulating.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct.\n  I also want to congratulate that man, though. The Senator from \nOklahoma is correct. But the man that really wrote the regs did come to \nthe hearings in Kalispell, MT. He sat down and gave his testimony, but \nhe also stayed and listened to those loggers. He listened to them when \nwe took public comment. When it was all over, he sat down with them and \nthey started working some things out. I think we made headway, and that \nis fine and dandy.\n  But basically, we should not have to do this. Common sense tells us \nit would be a lot better and a lot cheaper for everybody if we did not \nget ourselves into that kind of situation.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague having the hearing. My guess \nis that meeting would not have transpired had it not been for the \nSenator from Montana and his insisting on that meeting.\n  The fact is that those regulations or proposed regulations will \nprobably be changed and improved dramatically because of the insistence \nof the Senator from Montana on having face-to-face meetings with people \nwho are making the regulations and making the rules to meet with people \nthat are directly impacted.\n  One of the real positive things which I hope will come out of this is \nthat Congress will become more active in oversight, just as the Senator \nfrom Montana proved that it can make a difference, certainly in his \nState.\n  Again, I compliment him for it, and I thank him again for his \nstatement.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tomorrow, pursuant to the order--the bill \nnot being before the Senate today--an amendment will be offered by the \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma and this Senator as a substitute to S. \n219. I believe, Mr. President, that the substitute is a good solution \nto the problem that we are all concerned about, and that is excessive \nbureaucratic regulation.\n  For example, Mr. President, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has \nestimated the cost of complying with regulations in the United States \non a yearly basis at over $500 billion. That is almost 10 percent of \nour gross domestic product. It has also been estimated that the time \nspent on paperwork is almost 7 billion hours.\n  Mr. President, I repeat that. Over $500 billion to comply with \nregulations and almost 7 billion man-hours to do that paperwork.\n  We all know, Mr. President, that regulations serve a valid purpose \nand an important purpose. In fact, because of the regulatory framework \nthat has been put in place for the last 50 or 60 years, we have \nworkplaces that are safer. Hard-working Americans are less likely to be \nseriously injured on the job. There has been a tremendous reduction in \nthe loss of limb or permanent disfigurement in the workplace as a \nresult of Government regulations that were promulgated after we passed \nlaws in this and the other body.\n  We have, Mr. President, an airline industry that has the greatest \nsafety record in the world; food that meets very safe requirements, but \nthey are very strict. We have a country where, just 20-odd years ago, \n80 percent of all rivers were polluted. Now, that is down to \napproximately 20 percent. The numbers have been reversed as a result of \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  The problem is that all too often Congress passes a law with good \nintentions and very sound policy only to have the agencies, the \ngovernmental agencies, turn these simple laws into very complex \nregulations that go beyond the intent of Congress and many times make \nno sense. Ultimately, we create an environment where small \nbusinessowners must hire legal departments--and I do not say \n``lawyers''; legal departments--To comply with labor and environmental \nlaws and other issues.\n  In some instances, the regulations are so complex that a small firm \nhas to hire a multitude of experts so they can \n[[Page S4608]] comply with the labor laws, the environmental laws, the \ntax laws. The reality has led Americans to become frustrated and \nskeptical of their Government as a result of overregulation.\n  In a survey conducted by the Times Mirror, they found that, since \n1987, the number of Americans who believe regulations affecting \nbusinesses do more harm than good has jumped from 55 to over 63 \npercent. It was not very good in 1987. It has only gotten worse, \nthough.\n  Why are we concerned?\n  Well, Mr. President, if we look at the new regulations that have been \npromulgated by Federal agencies--and this does not count State and \nlocal agencies; we are not going to have any impact on that.\n  But I have in my possession, and I show the Presiding Officer, \nregulations received since the 9th day of November 1994, that are \neconomically significant, and those that are not economically \nsignificant.\n  Remember, for us, those are terms of art. For the American public, \nthey are not. We are talking about those that are economically \nsignificant, to be over $100 million.\n  But look at them--page after page of these regulations. Those that \nare economically significant, 3 pages; those not economically \nsignificant, 12 pages of fine print.\n  Market promotion program regulations; Department of Defense selection \ncriteria for clothing and realigning military installations. It covers \neverything. Protest disputes and appeals.\n  I would like to read that in more detail.\n  Wool and mohair payment programs for shorn wool, wool and unshorn \nlambs, and mohair, even though, as you know, Mr. President, we repealed \nthe law, but we are still promulgating regulations in that regard.\n  Here is one that the Senator from California would, I am sure, \nappreciate, the junior Senator, I believe. Use of the term ``fresh'' on \nthe labeling of raw poultry products.\n  As you may recall, there has been a dispute that has arisen, as to: \nWhen you get a fresh turkey at Thanksgiving, is it really fresh? We \nhave regulations promulgated on that.\n  I am not going to go into more detail. We have 15 pages. And this is \nnot up to date. This is a couple of weeks old.\n  So I think the American public has something to be concerned about. \nThere really are too many regulations.\n  We have reason to believe that the American small business community \nreally is concerned, and with good reason, for thinking that \nregulations do more harm than good.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that if you look at some, I should say, \nunusual things that have gone on--we heard the Senator from Montana, \nand during this debate that will take place this week, we will hear all \nkinds of things that are going on--they really do not make a lot of \nsense. Of course, there are a lot of things that make sense.\n  We need regulations, and the Senator from Nevada wants to make sure \npeople understand, I am not against all regulations. I just want some \ncommonsense direction for those regulations.\n  There is an article out of Business Week from a month or so ago that \ntalks about some of the good regulations, about when you go to the \nairport and they have overbooked the airplane and you wanted to go \nacross the country; now there is a regulation that says they can give \nyou a free ticket if they bump you off the flight.\n  We have an example in the Clean Air Act where you can trade pollution \nrights, which is certainly very important, because we have had \noutlandish regulations.\n  A company, Amoco York County Refinery, was required to spend $31 \nmillion to reduce a small amount of benzene from its wastewater \ntreatment plant when it could have reduced five times as much benzene \nelsewhere in the refinery at a cost of only $6 million. Those are some \nof the things that literally drive small businesses crazy and drive \nthem out of business.\n  So there are good regulations and bad regulations, and this \nlegislation, Mr. President, is going to allow us to have more common \nsense in the way regulations are promulgated.\n  I am convinced, and I have spoken with the Senator from Oklahoma at \nsome length in this regard, that one of the things that will flow from \nthis regulatory scheme that is in our substitute is that there will be \nfewer regulations promulgated because they know there will be a legal \nsetup, a legal framework to review these regulations.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I have been long involved in trying to \ndo something about regulations. We have written op-ed pieces for \nnewspapers that have been published. We introduced legislation last \nyear that passed the Senate and was killed in conference that would \nhave put dollar limits on regulations.\n  Our approach this year with this substitute is an ongoing movement \nwhich we have tried to initiate to put common sense in the way \nregulations are promulgated. I repeat, I am convinced that our \nsubstitute will stop the issuance of many regulations.\n  I believe the way to eliminate many of these problems is to establish \na safety mechanism that will enable Congress to look at these \nregulations that are being promulgated and decide whether they achieve \nthe purpose they were supposed to achieve in a rational, economic, and \nless burdensome way. This substitute, which I have already indicated I \nhave cosponsored with Senator Nickles, goes a long way toward \naccomplishing this goal in a bipartisan fashion. I think this is \nimportant because I believe Americans want Congress to work together to \nmake their Government work for them and not against them.\n  This bill, in my opinion--our substitute--should alleviate the talk \nin this body about regulations. If this passes, I think we have a \nframework established to take care of the problem. There will be some \nwho think we need to go a lot further, but I do not. I think if we can \nget this in place, we will be in real good shape.\n  This bill has great potential, as I have indicated, for a bipartisan \nsolution to the problem of costly and unnecessary regulations. The \nmechanics of this bill have been explained extremely well by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, and I am going to touch on it briefly.\n  It provides a 45-day period for Congress to review new regulations. \nIf the rule has an economic impact over $100 million, it is deemed \nsignificant and the regulation will not go into effect during the 45-\nday review period. This 45-day review period will allow Congress to \nhold Federal agencies accountable before they become law and start \nimpacting the regulated community.\n  Mr. President, if the rule does not meet the $100 million threshold, \nthe regulation will go into effect but will still be subject to fast-\ntrack review. Even significant regulations may go into effect \nimmediately if the President, by Executive order, determines that the \nregulation is necessary for health, safety, or national security, or is \nnecessary for the enforcement of criminal laws. This is not subject to \njudicial review.\n  So that is the general outline. We know the 45-day review process \nwill begin when the rule is sent to Congress.\n  We have spent a great deal of time, the Senator from Oklahoma and \nmyself and our staffs, making sure that this legislation is \nconstitutional. The Presiding Officer has had a long history of working \non legal matters, having been attorney general, and this regulation, I \nam assured by all kinds of legal scholars, is constitutional.\n  In fact, the man that argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court \nin 1983, the Chadha case, a man by the name of Mike Davidson, said:\n\n       The key to Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha \n     was that Congress had excluded the President altogether from \n     its repeal of the Kenyan's stay of deportation. By sending \n     any ``resolution of disapproval'' to the President for a \n     final decision, Congress sidesteps the separation-of-power \n     questions raised by the Chadha case.\n\n  So we are covered legally in this matter. If, during the course of \nthe debate, we need to get into more legal argument, I will be happy to \ntalk to the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, or anyone \nelse concerned.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this is a significant step forward from \nthe underlying bill. I believe this substitute will allow an orderly \nprocess whereby we can review regulations that the \n[[Page S4609]] Federal branch of Government initiates. It will cause \nthem to be more careful since the Chadha decision, in my opinion. \nGovernment agencies have been reckless, recognizing that there is not \nanything we can do about it. When this substitute passes, we will be \nable to do something about it, and I think it will rein in what I \nbelieve are some of the runaway rules that are being promulgated.\n  Before closing, I would like to express my appreciation to the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nfor their hard work on this issue. I do not support the underlying \nlegislation. I believe that this substitute is a significant \nimprovement over what has come to us in the form of S. 219.\n  I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the senior \nSenator from Oklahoma for his work on this issue. He has been a \nstalwart ally over many years working on this issue. I believe that we \nhave now found a piece of legislation on which we can achieve a \nbipartisan passage in this body and, hopefully, when the matter goes \nbefore the conference, they will see the wisdom of adopting this very \nworkable procedure to rein in runaway Government bureaucracy.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague, \nSenator Reid from Nevada, for his statement. I hope my colleagues had a \nchance to listen to it because I think it is well reasoned and shows \nthere is bipartisan support for, I think, a commonsense idea, saying \nCongress should have an opportunity to review regulations and, if you \nare talking about really significant regulations, an expedited \nprocedure to reject those.\n  There are thousands of regulations. My guess is that we will reject a \nvery, very small percentage. But at least we will have the \ncongressional oversight and Congress will be hopefully more involved, \njust as the Senator from Montana was in dealing with an OSHA regulation \nin logging. Hopefully, more of our colleagues will become involved in \nmonitoring and reviewing and trying to limit excess regulations and \nmaybe in oversight find out the regulation is not acceptable. Maybe we \nwill find out that it is acceptable. The Senator from Nevada has helped \nmake that happen, and I am delighted to work with him in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to discuss a \npiece of legislation that simply makes no sense. I am speaking about S. \n219, the Regulatory Transition Act, or the regulatory moratorium, as it \nis more widely known. With all due respect to my colleagues who support \nthis legislation--it is a bad bill, poorly conceived, arbitrary in \nscope, and reckless in its purpose. We should not be wasting our time \non this legislation.\n\n\n                              1. overview\n\n  We all agree, I am sure, that the Federal regulatory process is in \nserious need of serious reform. Too many ill-considered and costly \nregulations are unfairly and unwisely weighing down our people, our \nbusinesses, and our State and local governments. Too often, Federal \nagencies are getting away with sloppy work that ends up costing jobs \nand economic growth across our great country. Yes, we need regulatory \nreform. But no, we do not need the regulatory moratorium.\n  The moratorium legislation has been described as providing a brief \ntime out for agencies to pause and reflect on their regulations. It is, \nhowever, much more than that. It basically stops work on all \nsignificant regulations and related policy statements and guidance for \nas much as 19 months. The moratorium period is retroactive from \nNovember 9, 1994, through December 31, 1995, with an additional 5-month \ndelay; that is, until the end of May 1996 for statutory or judicial \ndeadlines for agency action.\n  This moratorium is unprecedented, and just plain wrong. It would stop \ngood and bad regulations, alike. It's the old story of the thoughtless, \nstupid parent throwing out the baby with the bath water. I hope my \nremarks today will help my colleagues appreciate the heavy, heavy price \nthat would be paid by the American people for this bill--death, \ninjuries, disease, accidents, lost wages, lost investment, lost \nopportunities. A heavy price, indeed, for a freeze that fixes nothing.\n  Again, at what price. Just before coming to the floor, I met with \nNancy Donley who every day relives the loss of her child to an E. coli \ninfection caused by tainted hamburger. USDA's reform of its meat \ninspection regulations would be stopped by the moratorium. I don't \nthink there is one supporter of the moratorium who would dare look Mrs. \nDonley in the eye and say that we should stop the very rules that can \nsave other families from the horrible tragedy she, and hundreds of \nother parents like her, have suffered.\n  The moratorium is wrong, just plain wrong.\n  Before I discuss the bill in detail, let me make one point very \nclear. Tomorrow, when the bill is formally taken up, I understand that \nits proponents will offer a substitute amendment. They will seek to \nreplace the moratorium provisions with a proposal for a congressional \nveto of regulations. I want to be sure that my colleagues understand \nwhat is going on here.\n  First, the plan for the substitute amendment shows that the \nproponents of the moratorium have finally realized how bad the \nmoratorium really is. While they apparently cannot admit to its \nstupidity, they also cannot bring themselves to fight for it. So, they \nwant to hide behind something new, something different, something that \nwill not be ridiculed--and with the understanding that if the Senate \npassed it, there would be a conference with the House, in which the \nHouse-passed moratorium would be negotiated.\n Since conference reports are unamendable, this is a strategy for \nbringing to the Senate a moratorium that cannot be fixed. It is a \nblatant attempt to get through the back-door what the Republicans are \nnow too ashamed to bring through the front-door--where it would be \nsubject to sunshine and amendment.\n\n  As for the planned substitute, it is a legislative veto for rules. \nVersions of this proposal are found in current regulatory reform bills.\n  In fact, the Committee on Governmental Affairs, on which I serve, \njust last Thursday, March 23, voted unanimously--15 to zero, all the \nRepublicans and all the Democrats--in favor of a legislative veto as an \nessential element in our comprehensive bipartisan regulatory reform \nbill. Let me add that for this larger accomplishment, the entire Senate \nowes a great deal of thanks to our committee chairman, Senator Roth of \nDelaware. He has shown real leadership in fashioning a tough, very \ntough, bipartisan regulatory reform bill. This is the real reform bill \nthat we should be discussing, not the moratorium.\n  Now, the legislative veto proposal, itself, is not a new idea. It is, \nI think, safe to say that it owes more to one of our colleagues, than \nto anyone else now in the Senate. The legislative veto is truly the \nbrainchild of my good friend and colleague from Michigan, Carl Levin. \nSenator Levin has, since he came to the Senate 17 years ago, repeatedly \nproposed and argued for the legislative veto. Each and every version \nbeing considered in this Congress amounts to yet another revision of \nthe Levin proposal of 1979.\n  I support the legislative veto. It will mean a significant increase \nin our work--we must all realize this fact--but it keeps accountability \nwhere it belongs--here, in Congress. Also, as a part of a comprehensive \nreform of the regulatory process, the legislative veto can play an \nimportant role in providing review and accountability. At the same \ntime, it avoids endless litigation and extensive judicial review, which \nis a major problem, indeed a fatal flaw, in other regulatory reform \nproposals.\n  So, again, I support the legislative veto. But I do not support it as \na moratorium substitute--not at all. First, we should not deal with the \nlegislative veto as a stand-alone bill, because, as I said, it is in, \nand should be considered in the context of, the regulatory reform bills \nnow moving toward the floor. Second, and even more importantly, it \nwould be very dangerous for us to vote for the legislative veto as a \nsubstitute for S. 219. As I already said--the House has enacted a \nmoratorium proposal.\n  If we pass S. 219, whatever its contents, it will be conferenced with \nthe House-passed moratorium bill. We \n[[Page S4610]] should not allow this result. We must not allow support \nfor the legislative veto to divert us from the profound dangers of the \nunderlying moratorium proposal.\n  To avoid this result, and whatever happens with any substitute, the \nentire Senate should go on record opposing any conference report that \nmight contain any moratorium.\n\n\n         2. The Legislative Record of the Regulatory Moratorium\n\n  Let me now review the moratorium proposal and what we discovered in \nconsidering this bill in the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The proposal originated in the House as H.R. 450. I ask unanimous \nconsent to insert into the Record copies of two articles from the \nWashington Post, ``Forging an Alliance for Deregulation,'' dated March \n12, 1995, and ``Truth Is Victim in Rules Debate,'' dated March 19, \n1995, as well as a Post op-ed, by Jessica Matthews, dated March 5, \n1995.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 12, 1995]\n\n   Forging an Alliance for Deregulation--Representative DeLay Makes \n                Companies Full Partners in the Movement\n\n               (By Michael Weisskopf and David Maraniss)\n\n       The day before the Republicans formally took control of \n     Congress, Rep. Tom DeLay strolled to a meeting in the rear \n     conference room of his spacious new leadership suite on the \n     first floor of the Capitol. The dapper Texas Congressman, \n     soon to be sworn in as House majority whip, saw before him a \n     group of lobbyists representing some of the biggest companies \n     in America, assembled on mismatched chairs amid packing \n     boxes, a huge, unplugged copying machine and constantly \n     ringing telephones.\n       He could not wait to start on what he considered the \n     central mission of his political career: the demise of the \n     modern era of government regulation.\n       Since his arrival in Washington a decade earlier, DeLay, a \n     former exterminator who had made a living killing fire ants \n     and termites on Houston's wealthy west side, had been seeking \n     to eradicate federal safety and environmental rules that he \n     felt placed excessive burdens on American businesses.\n       During his rise to power in Congress, he had befriended \n     many industry lobbyists who shared his fervor. Some of them \n     were gathered in his office that January morning at the dawn \n     of the Republican\n      revolution, energized by a sense that their time was finally \n     at hand.\n       The session inaugurated an unambiguous collaboration of \n     political and commercial interests, certainly not uncommon in \n     Washington but remarkable this time for the ease and \n     eagerness with which these allies combined. Republicans have \n     championed their legislative agenda as an answer to popular \n     dissatisfaction with Congress and the federal government. But \n     the agenda also represents a triumph for business interests, \n     who after years of playing a primarily defensive role in \n     Democratic-controlled Congresses now find themselves a full \n     partner of the Republican leadership in shaping congressional \n     priorities.\n       The campaign launched in DeLay's office that day was quick \n     and successful. It resulted last month in a lopsided vote by \n     the House for what once seemed improbable: a 13-month halt to \n     the sorts of government directives that Democrats has viewed \n     as vital to ensuring a safe and clean society but that many \n     businesses often considered oppressive and counterproductive. \n     A similar bill is under consideration in the Senate, where \n     its chances of approval are not as certain.\n       Although several provisions of the ``Contract With \n     America'' adopted by Republican House candidates last fall \n     take specific aim at rolling back federal regulations, the \n     moratorium was not part of that. In fact, as outline that day \n     in DeLay's office by Gordon Gooch, an oversized, folksy \n     lobbyist for energy and petrochemical interests who served as \n     the congressman's initial legislative ghost writer, the first \n     draft of the bill called for a limited, 100-day moratorium on \n     rulemaking while the House pushed through the more \n     comprehensive antiregulatory plank in the Contract.\n       But his fellow lobbyists in the inner circle argued that \n     was too timid, according to participants in the meeting. Over \n     the next few days, several drafts were exchanged by the \n     corporate agents. Each new version sharpened and expanded the \n     moratorium bill, often with the interests of clients in \n     mind--one provision favoring California motor fleets, another \n     protecting industrial consumers of natural gas, and a third \n     keeping alive Union Carbide Corp.'s hopes for altering a \n     Labor Department requirement.\n       As the measure progressed, the roles of legislator and \n     lobbyist blurred. DeLay and his assistants guided industry \n     supporters in an ad hoc group whose name, Project Relief, \n     sounded more like a Third World humanitarian aid effort than \n     a corporate alliance with a half-million-dollar \n     communications budget. On key amendments, the coalition \n     provided the draftsman. And once the bill and the debate \n     moved to the House floor, lobbyists hovered nearby, tapping \n     out talking points on a laptop computer for delivery to \n     Republican floor leaders.\n       Many of Project Relief's 350 industry members had spent the \n     past few decades angling for a place of power in Democratic \n     governing circles and had made lavish contributions to \n     Democratic campaigns, often as much out of pragmatism as \n     ideology. But now they were in the position of being courted \n     and consulted by newly empowered Republicans dedicated to \n     cutting government regulation and eager to share the job.\n       No congressman has been more openly solicitous in that \n     respect than DeLay, the 47-year-old congressional veteran \n     regarded by many lawmakers and lobbyists as the sharpest \n     political dealer among the ruling House triad that includes \n     fellow Texan Richard K. Armey, the majority leader, and \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.\n       DeLay described his partnership with Project Relief as a \n     model for effective Republican lawmaking, a fair fight \n     against Democratic alliances with labor unions and \n     environmentalists. ``Our supporters are no different than \n     theirs,'' DeLay said of the Democrats. ``But somehow they \n     have this Christ-like attitude what they are doing [is] \n     protecting the world when they're tearing it apart.'' Turning \n     to business lobbyists to draft legislation makes sense, \n     according to DeLay, because ``they have the expertise.''\n       But the alliance with business and industry demonstrated in \n     the push for a moratorium is not without peril for \n     Republicans, many GOP strategists acknowledge. The more the \n     new Republican leaders follow business prescriptions for \n     limited government in the months ahead, the greater the risk \n     that they will appear to be serving the corporate elite and \n     lose the populist appeal that they carried with them into \n     power in last November's elections.\n       William Kristol, a key Republican analyst whose frequent \n     strategy memos, help shape the conservative agenda, said the \n     way congressional leaders deal with that apparent conflict \n     could determine their prospects for consolidating \n     congressional power. ``If they legislate for special \n     interests,'' he said, ``it's going to be hard to show the \n     Republican Party has fundamentally changed the way business \n     is done in Washington.''\n\n\n                            the exterminator\n\n       After graduating from the University of Houston with a \n     biology degree in 1970, Tom DeLay, the son of an oil drilling \n     contractor, found himself managing a pesticide formula \n     company. Four years later he was the owner of Albo Pest \n     Control, a little outfit whose name he hated but kept anyway \n     because a marketing study noted it reminded consumers of a \n     well-known brand of dog food.\n       By his account, DeLay transformed Albo into ``the \n     Cadillac'' of Houston exterminators, serving only the finest \n     homes. But his frustrations with government rules increased \n     in tandem with his financial success. He disparaged federal \n     worker safety rules, including one that required his termite \n     men to wear hard hats when they tunneled under houses. And \n     the Environmental Protection Agency's pesticide regulations, \n     he said, ``drove me crazy.'' The agency had banned Mirex, a \n     chemical effective in killing fire ants but at first \n     considered a dangerous carcinogen by federal bureaucrats. By \n     the time they changed their assessment a few years later, it \n     was too late: Mirex makers had gone out of business.\n       The cost and complexity of regulations, DeLay said, got in \n     the way of profits and drove him into politics. ``I found out \n     government was a cost of doing business,'' he said, ``and I \n     better get involved in it.''\n       He arrived in the Texas legislature in 1978 with a nickname \n     that defined his mission: ``Mr. DeReg.'' Seven years later he \n     moved his crusade to Washington as the congressman from \n     Houston's conservative southwest suburbs. He sought to \n     publicize his cause by handing out Red Tape Awards for what \n     he considered the most frivolous regulations.\n       But it was a lonely, quixotic enterprise, hardly noticed in \n     the Democrat-dominated House, where systematic regulation of \n     industry was seen as necessary to keep the business community \n     from putting profit over the public interest and to guarantee \n     a safe, clean and fair society. The greater public good, \n     Democratic leaders and their allies in labor and \n     environmental groups argued, had been well served by \n     government regulation. Countless highway deaths had been \n     prevented by mandatory safety procedures in cars. Bald eagles \n     were flying because of the ban on DDT. Rivers were saved by \n     federal mandates on sewerage.\n       DeLay nonetheless was gaining notice in the world of \n     commerce. Businessmen would complain about the cost of \n     regulation, which the government says amounts to $430 billion \n     a year passed along to consumers. They would cite what they \n     thought were silly rules, such as the naming of dishwashing \n     liquid on a list of hazardous materials in the workplace. \n     They pushed for regulatory relief, and they saw DeLay as \n     their point man.\n       The two-way benefits of that relationship were most evident \n     last year when DeLay ran for Republican whip. He knew the \n     best way to build up chits was to raise campaign funds for \n     other candidates. The large number of open congressional \n     seats and collection of strong Republican challengers offered \n     him an unusual opportunity. He turned to his network of \n     business friends and lobbyists. ``I sometimes overly \n     prevailed on'' these allies, DeLay said.\n       [[Page S4611]] In the 1994 elections, he was the second-\n     leading fund-riser for House Republican candidates, behind \n     only Gingrich. In adding up contributions he had solicited \n     for others, DeLay said, he lost count at about $2 million. \n     His persuasive powers were evident in the case of the \n     National-American Wholesale Grocers Association PAC, which \n     already had contributed $120,000 to candidates by the time \n     DeLay addressed the group last September. After listening to \n     his speech on what could be accomplished by a pro-business \n     Congress, they contributed, another $80,000 to Republicans \n     and consulted DeLay, among others, on its distribution.\n       The chief lobbyist for the grocers, Bruce Gates, would be \n     recruited later by DeLay to chair his antiregulatory Project \n     Relief. Several other business lobbyists played crucial roles \n     in DeLay's 1994 fund-raising and also followed Gates's path \n     into the antiregulatory effort. Among the most active were \n     David Rehr of the National Beer Wholesalers Association, Dan \n     Mattoon of BellSouth Corporation, Robert Rusbuldt of \n     Independent Insurance Agents of America and Elaine Graham of \n     the National Restaurant Association.\n       At the center of the campaign network was Mildred Webber, a \n     political consultant who had been hired by DeLay to run his \n     race for whip. She stayed in regular contact with both the \n     lobbyists and more than 80 GOP congressional challengers, \n     drafting talking points for the neophyte candidates and \n     calling the lobbyist bank when they needed money. \n     Contributions came in from various business PACs, which \n     Webber bundled together with a good-luck note from DeLay.\n       ``We'd rustle up checks for the guy and make sure Tom got \n     the credit,'' said Rehr, the beer lobbyist. ``So when new \n     members voted for majority whip, they'd say, `I wouldn't be \n     here if it wasn't for Tom DeLay.'''\n       For his part, DeLay hosted fundraisers in the districts and \n     brought challengers to Washington for introduction to the PAC \n     community. One event was thrown for David M. McIntosh, an \n     Indiana candidate who ran the regulation-cutting Council on \n     Competitiveness in the Bush administration under fellow \n     Hoosier Dan Quayle. McIntosh won and was named chairman of \n     the House regulatory affairs subcommittee. He hired Webber as \n     staff director.\n       It was with the lopsided support of such Republican \n     freshmen as McIntosh that DeLay swamped two rivals and became \n     the majority whip of the 104th Congress. Before the vote, he \n     had received final commitments from 52 of the 73 newcomers.\n\n\n                               the freeze\n\n       The idea for Project Relief first surfaced before the \n     November elections that brought Republicans to power in the \n     House for the first time in 40 years. Several weeks after the \n     election, it had grown into one of the most diverse business \n     groups ever formed for specific legislative action. Leaders \n     of the project, at their first post-election meeting, \n     discussed the\n      need for an immediate move to place a moratorium on federal \n     rules. More than 4,000 regulations were due to come out in \n     the coming months, before the Republican House could deal \n     with comprehensive antiregulatory legislation.\n       DeLay agreed with the business lobbyists that a regulatory \n     ``timeout'' was needed. He wrote a letter to the Clinton \n     administration Dec. 12 asking for a 100-day freeze on federal \n     rule-making. The request was rejected two days later by a \n     mid-level official who described the moratorium concept as a \n     ``blunderbuss.'' DeLay then turned to Gooch to write \n     legislation that would do what the administration would not.\n       At the Jan. 3 meeting in DeLay's office, Paul C. Smith, \n     lobbyist for some of the nation's largest motor fleets, \n     criticized Gooch's draft because it excluded court-imposed \n     regulations. He volunteered to do the next draft and came \n     back with a version that addressed the concerns of his \n     clients. Under court order, the EPA was about to impose an \n     air pollution plan in California that might require some of \n     Smith's clients--United Parcel Service and auto leasing \n     companies--to run vehicles on ultraclean fuels, requiring the \n     replacement of their fleets.\n       Smith removed the threat with a stroke of his pen, \n     extending the moratorium to cover court deadlines. He also \n     helped Webber add wording in a later amendment that extended \n     the moratorium from eight to 13 months.\n       Peter Molinaro, a mustachioed lobbyist for Union Carbide, \n     had a different concern: He wanted to make sure the \n     moratorium would not affect new federal rules if their \n     intention was to soften or streamline other federal rules. \n     The Labor Department, for example, was reviewing a proposal \n     to narrow a rule that employers keep records of off-duty \n     injuries to workers. Union Carbide, Molinaro noted in an \n     interview, had been fined $50,000 for violating that rule and \n     was eager for it to be changed.\n       For his part, Gooch wanted to make sure that the routing, \n     day-to-day workings of regulatory agencies would not be \n     interrupted by a moratorium. His petrochemical clients rely \n     on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to make sure \n     natural gas and oil, used in their production processes, flow \n     consistently and at reasonable rates.\n       Gooch said he had ``no specific mission'' other than \n     helping DeLay. ``I'm not claiming to be a Boy Scout,'' he \n     added. ``No question I thought what I was doing was in the \n     best interests of my clients.''\n                              the war room\n\n       On the first day of February, 50 Project Relief lobbyists \n     met in a House committee room to map out their vote-getting \n     strategy for the moratorium bill. Their keynote speaker was \n     DeLay, who laid out his basic objective: making it a veto-\n     proof bill by lining up a sufficient number of Democratic \n     cosponsors. They went to work on it then and there.\n       Kim McKernan of the National Federation of Independent \n     Business read down a list of 72 House Democrats who had just \n     voted for the GOP balanced budget amendment, rating the \n     likelihood of their joining the antiregulatory effort. The \n     Democrats were placed in Tier One for gettable and Tier Two \n     for questionable.\n       Every Democrat, according to participants, was assigned to \n     a Project Relief lobbyist, often one who had an angle to \n     play.\n       The nonprescrition drug industry chose legislators with \n     Johnson & Johnson plants in their districts, such as Ralph M. \n     Hall of Texas and Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey. David \n     Thompson, a construction industry official whose firm is \n     based in Greenville, S.C., targeted South Carolina \n     congressman John M. Spratt Jr.\n       Federal Express, with its Memphis hub, took Tennessee's \n     John S. Tanner. Southwestern Bell Corp., a past campaign \n     contributor to Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas, agreed to \n     contact her. Retail farm suppliers picked rural lawmakers, \n     including Charles W. Stenholm of Texas.\n       As the moratorium bill reached the House floor, the \n     business coalition proved equally potent. Twenty major \n     corporate groups advised lawmakers on the eve of debate Feb. \n     23 that this was a key vote, one that would be considered in \n     future campaign contributions.\n       McIntosh, who served as DeLay's deputy for deregulation, \n     assembled a war room in a small office just off the House \n     floor to respond to challenges from Democratic opponents. His \n     rapid response team included Smith, the motor fleet lobbyist, \n     to answer environmental questions; James H. Burnley IV, an \n     airline lobbyist who had served as transportation secretary \n     in the Reagan administration, to advise on transportation \n     rules; and UPS lobbyist Dorothy Strunk, a former director of \n     the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, to tackle \n     workplace issues. Project Relief chairman Gates and lobbyists \n     for small business and trucking companies also participated.\n       When Republicans leaders were caught off guard by a \n     Democratic amendment or alerted to a last-minute problem by \n     one of their allies, Smith would bang out response on his \n     laptop computer and hand the disk to a McIntosh aide who had \n     them printed and delivered to the House floor.\n       The final vote for the moratorium was 276 to 146, with 51 \n     Democrats joining DeLay's side. Still 14 votes short of the \n     two-thirds needed to override a veto, the support exceeded \n     the original hopes of Project Relief leaders.\n       One week later, DeLay appeared before a gathering of a few \n     hundred lobbyists, lawmakers and reporters in the Caucus Room \n     of the Cannon House Office Building to celebrate the House's \n     success in voting to freeze government regulations and, in a \n     pair of companion bills, curtail them. He stood next to a \n     five-foot replica of the Statue of Liberty, wrapped from neck \n     to toe in bright red tape, pulled out a pair of scissors, and \n     jubilantly snipped away.\n       Standing next to him, brandishing scissors of his own, was \n     the chairman of Project Relief.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 19, 1995]\n\nTruth Is Victim in Rules Debate--Facts Don't Burden Some Hill Tales of \n                            Regulatory Abuse\n\n                           (By Tom Kenworthy)\n\n       As Congress wages war on the federal regulatory system, \n     anecdotal evidence of nonsensical rules and innocent victims \n     has been a powerful weapon in the push to enact measures that \n     will temporarily halt rule-making, protect property owners \n     and ensure new regulations are worth the cost.\n       Many of these purported examples, however, have the ring of \n     truth, but not the substance.\n       Consider the ``regulatory overkill'' cited by Rep. Michael \n     Bilirakis (R-Fla.) during floor debate last month. ``The \n     Drinking Water Act currently limits arsenic levels in \n     drinking water to no more than two to three parts per \n     billion,'' said Bilirakis. ``However, a regular portion of \n     shrimp typically served in a restaurant contains around 30 \n     parts per billion.''\n       Arsenic, a known human carcinogen, has been subject to \n     regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1976. \n     The drinking water standard is now not two or three parts per \n     billion, but 50 parts per billion. And according to EPA \n     officials, the arsenic found in water and the arsenic found \n     in shrimp and other seafood are chemically quite different. \n     The type of arsenic found in seafood is organic; in water, \n     arsenic is predominantly inorganic, and far more toxic.\n       Bilirakis, a former judge, declined a request for an \n     interview, but his press spokesman explained that Bilirakis \n     relied on his colleague, Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), whose \n     use of the shrimp example during a congressional hearing last \n     year was reported in The Washington Post.\n       While rhetorical exaggerations or sloppy staff work are not \n     new phenomena in congressional debates, the determination of \n     [[Page S4612]] House Speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and other \n     Republican leaders to push through their ``Contract With \n     America'' agenda in 100 days or less has meant that complex \n     and far-ranging legislation has been debated and passed in an \n     unusually short period. And nothing in the contract deals \n     with an area as complicated as regulatory reform or generates \n     as much apocryphal rhetoric on both sides.\n       Veteran Democrats, who in some cases helped write the \n     regulations now under attack, warned their colleagues during \n     the debate of the consequences of moving so quickly. Rep. \n     John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) said of the regulatory moratorium: \n     ``The unknown and unintended consequences caused by the \n     hurried consideration of this legislation will emerge for \n     members in embarrassing and unwanted ways in weeks and months \n     ahead.''\n       And Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), lamented the making of \n     ``policy on the basis of false or misleading anecdotal \n     information.'' Proponents, said Markey, ``claim that the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission had a regulation requiring \n     all buckets have a hole in the bottom of them so water can \n     flow through and avoid the danger of someone falling face \n     down into the bucket and drowning. . . . Now, that would be \n     ridiculous regulation, if it existed. But the truth is that \n     there has never been such a rule.''\n       Nothing slowed down the determination of House Republicans \n     to change the regulatory system, and the debate now moves to \n     the Senate, where the legislation is expected to emerge from \n     committees in more moderate form.\n       During the two weeks the bills were considered in the \n     House, the rhetoric on both sides was heated and the \n     examples, even the hypothetical ones, not always precise.\n       Suppose scientists develop a vaccine for the AIDS virus but \n     tests show it causes one case of cancer for every million \n     patients, Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) told reporters as the \n     House took up the risk assessment bill. Because of that one \n     cancer case, a provision of federal law called the Delaney \n     Clause would require the Food and Drug Administration to keep \n     the life-saving vaccine off the market, he said in a \n     triumphant demonstration of the rigidity of federal \n     regulation.\n       It sounded like a compelling argument--except for one not \n     so small detail. The Delaney Clause has nothing to do with \n     drug approvals. It is, as Walker conceded later when asked \n     about it, a section of federal law that deals with \n     carcinogens that could show up in processed food, primarily \n     pesticide residues.\n       Even opponents of the House GOP's anti-regulatory agenda \n     such as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol \n     M. Browner concede that there are examples of government \n     heavy-handedness in enforcing laws on health and the \n     environment.\n       ``Unfortunately,'' Browner added, ``much of the debate has \n     been conducted in sound bites. Changes of this magnitude \n     should be based on a vigorous debate with all of the facts on \n     the table. What we saw was instance after instance of stories \n     that don't even come close to resembling reality or the truth \n     of the matter.''\n       The property rights bill--which gives landowners the right \n     to claim compensation from the government if a portion of \n     their property loses 20 percent or more of its value because \n     of rules governing wetlands, endangered species and other \n     environmental restrictions--was also fertile ground for \n     embellished anecdotes.\n       During the House debate, Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin (D-\n     La.), a leading advocate of the property rights legislation, \n     told a moving story of what he called government \n     ``arrogance'' in enforcing wetlands regulations. The tale \n     involved the families of John Chaconas and Roger Gautreau in \n     Ascension Parish, La., whom he characterized as victims of \n     flawed wetlands laws and overzealous bureaucrats from the \n     Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection \n     Agency.\n       The Gautreaus, said Tauzin, built a home after getting \n     approval from the Corps to dig a pond and use the fill as a \n     foundation. Then they built another home on part of their \n     property and sold it to the Chaconas family. According to \n     Tauzin, the Corps then swept in, told the Gautreaus the dirt \n     road that provides access to the two houses was on a wetland \n     and could not be used, and told the Chaconas family they \n     might have to forfeit their house.\n       John Chaconas, however, is refusing to play the part of \n     victim assigned to him by Tauzin. In testimony prepared last \n     week for delivery to a House task force on wetlands, Chaconas \n     said he strongly supports wetlands regulation. He said he was \n     victimized not by the government but by the Gautreaus, and \n     that now his family ``is being played as pawns by politicians \n     to justify their opposition to current wetlands law.''\n       In his prepared testimony, Chaconas tried to correct \n     Tauzin's rendition of the story. Gautreau, said Chaconas, had \n     failed to get a permit to dredge and fill wetlands despite \n     being advised to do so by the Soil Conservation Service, and \n     his actions had caused drainage problems for neighbors. \n     Chaconas is now suing Gautreau and others over the real \n     estate transaction.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5, 1995]\n\n                          Horror in the House\n\n                          (By Jessica Mathews)\n\n       Every one of the most frequently cited horror stories used \n     to justify the regulatory ``reform'' passed by the House last \n     week is a fabrication. That tells a lot about the intent and \n     the wisdom of the legislation.\n       You've almost surely heard about how states thousands of \n     miles from Hawaii are forced to test their water for a \n     pesticide used only on pineapples. (Truth: The pesticide was \n     used on 40 crops before being banned as a probable \n     carcinogen. It's been found in 16 of the 25 states that have \n     tested for it, often at unsafe levels.)\n       Anchorage, so it is said, had to add fish wastes to its \n     water so it could then remove them, thereby cleaning its \n     sewage by the required 30 percent. (Truth: No one had to add \n     fish wastes to the water--that's how they've been routinely \n     disposed of. The 30 percent standard is the price of being \n     exempted from secondary sewage treatment. Anchorage's \n     complaint is about having to meet the most basic primary \n     treatment standard.)\n       There is also the OSHA leaky bucket story, the rodent \n     habitat that caused homes to burn in a wildfire and the baby \n     teeth as hazardous wastes story. All sound too nutty to be \n     true, and they are. The facts have been distributed--and \n     ignored--all over Capitol Hill, but by now the stories are \n     gospel.\n       As you might suspect from the quality of the rationale, the \n     new legislation is not an honest attempt at regulatory \n     reform. Like the balanced budget amendment, it is in part an \n     admission of failure. Out of frustration at its inability to \n     correct those laws and regulations that are flawed, Congress \n     has grabbed at a measure to indiscriminately weaken all \n     regulations, good and bad.\n       Far more perniciously, the bill is also a blackdoor attempt \n     to undo 35 years of environmental progress, a step for which \n     there is so little public support that it would never be \n     attempted frontally. Do not be misled. The measure \n     effectively repeals the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act \n     and every other statute that makes health, safety or \n     environmental protection the guiding standard. If it becomes \n     law, cost-effectiveness and ``flexibility'' (left undefined \n     for the courts to figure out) will replace those standards.\n       What cost-effectiveness and flexibility appear to mean, in \n     the opinion of former Republican senator Robert Stafford, is \n     that providing asthma drugs to children who go to school near \n     a paper mill could be the preferred choice over pollution \n     controls on the mill. Former interior secretary James Watt's \n     hat and suntan lotion solution to ozone depletion also leaps \n     to mind.\n       The bill tries to pin down the Gulliver of government \n     regulation in the worst possible way--with analyses, \n     paperwork and endless opportunities for delay in the courts. \n     It requires 22 separate analyses before a regulatory action. \n     It opens 60 new bases for judicial challenge. EPA things the \n     agency would need nearly 1,000 additional employees to \n     fulfill its requirements.\n       Cost-benefit analysis is made a rigid, one-size-fits-all \n     solution to every regulatory choice. While it is a modestly \n     useful aid to decision-making, cost-benefit analysis cannot \n     bear this burden. It does not reduce one whit the scientific \n     and economic uncertainties that bedevil regulatory disputes, \n     nor sidestep the need for value judgments. All its does is to \n     put the guesswork into a formal analytical framework.\n       At the end, however, an assumption is an assumption no \n     matter how sophisticated the mathematical trappings. The \n     answers cost-benefit analysis provides can never be better \n     than guesses about the future costs of new technology (nearly \n     always exaggerated) or imponderables like the worth of 20 \n     lost IQ points or the dollar value of wilderness. Frequently, \n     the answers are far worse than what judgment can provide \n     because any factor to which a number cannot be attached must \n     be dropped from consideration, even it happens to be the most \n     important. Precisely because cost-benefit analysis seems to \n     provide an objective, definitive answer, yet is so highly \n     dependent on assumptions, it is ideally suited to ideological \n     manipulation.\n       This latest bit of the ``Contract With America'' is not \n     regulatory reform at all but a parody of reform. It takes the \n     worst aspects of the present system--paperwork, delay, \n     bureaucratic heavy-handedness--and makes them worse. It \n     lessens regulators' opportunities to use common sense and \n     makes them personable liable to huge fines for such crimes as \n     ``misallocating resources.'' It turns normal conflict-of-\n     interest provisions inside out. Its intent is to throw sand \n     in the government's crankcase, not to improve the quality of \n     its actions.\n       Under normal circumstances the measure would stand little \n     chance of becoming law. Its assault on three decades of \n     bipartisan environmental achievement, in particular, is not \n     what Americans want. But genius and the trap of Gingrich's \n     100-day deadline is that not only is there no time for \n     legislators to understand what they're doing, neither the \n     media nor the public can keep up. Major bills fly out of \n     committee and onto the floor in a day or two and before \n     anyone has taken a close look at one, another has taken its \n     place. The House bill has a close match in the Senate \n     sponsored by Majority Leader Robert Dole. And while the \n     administration has made noises about a veto, so far the \n     silence from the bully pulpit has been deafening.\n       Plenty of laws and regulations need reform. There's only \n     one way to achieve it--the old-fashioned way, one law at a \n     time, individually, on the merits.\n\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. These articles show how the moratorium sprung from the \nminds of people intent not on a better or smarter Government, but a \ndumber Government--slow, inefficient, less likely to act on behalf the \npublic interest.\n  A review of the progress of the House bill confirms my view of this \nbill. House sponsors moved the starting date around several times so \nthat some rules could go forward and others would be caught. And \ndespite the broad sweep of the moratorium, special exemptions were soon \nadded.\n  The exemptions ranged from a promise in committee by the chief \nsponsor to protect watermelon marketing orders--according to the \nNational Journal's Congress Daily, February 2, 1995, page 5--to floor \namendments exempting a variety of FCC matters, China sanctions, customs \nmodernization, airline safety, and other issues.\n  In the Senate, the record is quite similar to that of the House. On \nFebruary 7, 1995, the Governmental Affairs Committee held the first of \nfive regulatory reform hearings. On the seventh, we heard testimony \nfrom the majority leader and a number of other Senators, including the \nprimary sponsor of the moratorium, Senator Nickles. As our committee's \nmajority report says:\n\n       Senator Nickles stated that the purpose of the temporary \n     moratorium is to give Congress enough time to pass \n     legislation to comprehensively change the regulatory process.\n\n  With due respect to my colleague from Oklahoma, since that hearing we \nhave devoted several weeks to the moratorium and now are on the floor \nto debate it--this is all time that has taken away from regulatory \nreform, I am sorry to say, not added to it.\n  On February 22, 1995, the committee devoted an entire hearing to the \nmoratorium. This hearing reinforced my conviction that the moratorium \nis a bad idea. Mr. Rainer Mueller, a businessman from California, \ndescribed his personal tragedy of the death of his 13-year-old son to \nE. coli infection and the impact of the moratorium on USDA regulations. \nWitnesses from the Department of Transportation and the Food and Drug \nAdministration described specific health and safety rules that would be \nstopped by the moratorium. Examples of such rules from other agencies \nprovided a clear picture of the potential destructive impact of the \nmoratorium on important government actions on behalf of public health \nand safety.\n  While other witnesses told of regulations that certainly should be \nreviewed, if not rescinded, the thought of stopping all rules, \nincluding the meat inspection rules, in an effort to get at those bad \nrules, was simply not convincing. And ironically, one witness pointed \nout that the revised moratorium proposal before the committee would \nonly stop significant rules, the very rules that already undergo the \nmost rigorous regulatory analysis under Presidential Executive order.\n  Finally, Sally Katzen, Administrator of OMB's Office of Information \nand Regulatory Affairs [OIRA] told of the President's current order to \nagencies to review existing rules and eliminate or revise outdated or \nconflicting rules. This review will be completed in about ten weeks. it \nseems to me that we should get this information before even thinking \nabout stopping regulations.\n  When asked about requirements for regulations, Ms. Katzen also \nconfirmed something that the former Republican EPA general counsel, \nDonald Elliot, told the committee on February 15, 1995. As much as 80 \npercent of all rules are mandated by Congress. This is a very important \nfact. It shows that if anything, we in Congress are the problem, not \nthe agencies. We pass strict laws that agencies must implement section \nby section, letter by letter.\n  It is simply the worst kind of legislative schizophrenia for Congress \nto pass laws and require agencies to implement them, and then turn \naround and tell them to stop doing what we just asked them to do in the \nfirst place--and with a few exceptions, without even regard to human \nhealth and safety.\n  Again, I can only say that an effort targeted at bad rules makes \nsense, but to shoot down all rules, good and bad alike, just makes no \nsense at all.\n  On March 7 and 9, 1995, the committee met to mark up the moratorium \nbill. Debate among the committee members about the scope of the bill \nand its exemptions and exceptions highlighted one of the biggest \nproblems with the moratorium; that is, the way in which it would stop \nimportant regulations, such as those that protect the American people \nfrom serious health and safety risks.\n  While purporting to be a moratorium on all significant regulations, \nthe bill's sponsors recognized that this broad sweep is not a good idea \nand accepted several amendments to exempt specific rules. But, they \nalso rejected others. To look at what was accepted and what was \nrejected shows the arbitrary nature of the bill.\n  The committee accepted the following exemptions:\n  First, an exemption for rules to ``ensure the safety and soundness of \na Farm Credit System institution or to protect the Farm Credit \nInsurance Fund.''\n  Second, an exemption for rules on ``commercial, recreational, or \nsubsistence * * * hunting, fishing, or camping.'' Among other things, \nthis would allow the annual revision of duck hunting regulations to go \nforward. These rules are very important to the economic health of many \nregions in our country. Just ask Senator Pryor from Arkansas, or \nSenator Wellstone from Minnesota--their States would be significantly \nhurt by even a delay in the hunting season.\n  Third, an exemption for rules on overflights on national parks.\n  Fourth, an exemption for any rule to enforce ``statutory rights that \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, age, \nnational origin, or handicapped or disability status.''\n  Fifth, an exemption for aircraft safety, including rules ``to improve \nairworthiness of aircraft engines.''\n  Sixth, an exemption for ``safety and training standards for commuter \nairlines.''\n  Seventh, an exemption for EPA rules to ``protect the public from \nexposure to lead from house paint, soil or drinking water.''\n  Eighth, an exemption for rules on ``highway safety warning devices'' \nat railroad crossings.\n  Ninth, an exemption for negotiated rulemakings under the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act Amendments of 1994.\n  Tenth, an exemption for rules to ``provide compensation to Persian \nGulf War Veterans for disability from undiagnosed illnesses, as \nprovided by the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act.''\n  Even with that wide range of exemptions, the committee's majority \nrejected the following exemptions:\n  First, an exemption for USDA rules to ``reduce pathogens in meat and \npoultry.''\n  Second, an exemption for EPA rules to ``control of microbial and \ndisinfection byproduct risks in drinking water supplies.''\n  Third, an exemption for rules to ensure safe and proper disposal of \nradioactive waste, as well as any action regarding decontamination and \ndecommissioning of NRC-licensed sites.\n  Fourth, an exemption for health and safety rules, where the agency \n``has concluded to the extent permitted by law that the benefits \njustify the costs.''\n  Fifth, an exemption for any rule that ``enforces constitutional \nrights of individuals.''\n  Sixth, an exemption for rules required by statutory or judicial \ndeadlines.\n  Seventh, an exemption for rules that are the ``consensual product of \nregulatory negotiation pursuant to the Regulatory Negotiation Act.''\n  These amendments were rejected, and they were rejected on a straight \nparty-line vote. To show how arbitrary these votes were, let me just \ncompare one or two of the amendments that were accepted with amendments \nthat were rejected.\n  The committee accepted an amendment to exempt from the moratorium EPA \nrules to ``protect the public from exposure to lead from house paint, \nsoil or drinking water,'' but rejected an amendment to exempt EPA rules \nto ``control of microbial and disinfection supplies.'' Why lead and not \nwater--don't my Republican friends recall that Cryptosporidium in \ndrinking water killed over 100 people in Milwaukee, WI, and made \n400,000 people sick?\n  The committee accepted an amendment to exempt rules that would \nclarify responsibilities among railroad \n[[Page S4614]] companies, State and local governments ``regarding \nhighway safety warning devices'' at railroad crossings, but rejected an \namendment to permit the reform of USDA meat inspection rules that will \nhelp reduce the 500 annual deaths and 20,000 annual instances of \ndisease, not to mention the millions of dollars in costs, caused by \nfood-borne illness.\n  Or perhaps, we should compare railroad crossing safety with \nradioactive waste cleanup. Again, the majority of the committee \naccepted the railroad crossing exemption--offered by a Republican \nmember of the committee--but rejected on a party-line vote my amendment \nto exempt rules to ensure rules on safe disposal of radioactive waste. \nI hope to come back to this issue later, but I cannot understand how my \ncolleagues could so easily dismiss standards for disposing of \nplutonium-contaminated waste--radioactive waste that must be kept \nsafely from humans for at least 10,000 years.\n  The majority of the committee also rejected several important \namendments offered by Senator Levin that would actually have helped the \nproposal make more sense. Retroactivity, an extra moratorium for \ndeadlines, onerous reporting requirements, ill-defined definitions--\nthese were provisions that just made no sense, as Senator Levin \ncorrectly pointed out. But these were rejected, as well. As usual, my \ngood friend from Michigan saw through the rhetoric, could appreciate \nthe details, not to mention the broad policy issues, and accurately \npointed out the internal flaws of the moratorium process--but to no \navail. The marching orders were given, and the votes made.\n  I am simply at a loss to understand how my esteemed colleagues across \nthe aisle can explain these votes. What in the world will you tell the \nAmerican people? Here you are, saying that you want to reform the \nregulatory process, that you want to stop bad regulations, that you \nwant rules to pass cost/benefit tests, and that you want agencies to be \ngoverned by scientific risk assessments.\n  But when it comes time to vote, then the special interests come to \ncall, and you listen. And who pays the price? Rainer Mueller and Nancy \nDonley can tell you the price they paid. Which of your constituents do \nyou want to share in Mr. Mueller's or Ms. Donley's pain? I am sorry, \nbut with all due respect, I do not want to have that pain, that injury, \nthat sickness, that suffering, that death on my conscience. The sorrow \nfor me, however, is that as a Member of this body, if we pass a \nmoratorium bill, we will all share in the blame. We will bring the \nSenate down yet again in the eyes of our people. No wonder they have \nlost respect for Washington.\n  As I asked at the markup, ``Are we saying that we'll protect the \nrights of duck hunters, but not the right our children to eat safe \nfood?'' This makes no sense.\n  Do my Republican colleagues really understand what burden they are \ntaking on when they support the moratorium. I only hope they can admit \nto having second thoughts, and think better of their too-hasty \nendorsement of a bill that would make government more arbitrary, more \nsenseless, more unwielding, more blind, more insensitive, more of what \nAmericans do not want from their Government.\n  Finally, with regard to committee action on the moratorium, let me \npoint out that the majority in the committee voted to expand the \nmoratorium to cover: first, wetlands, determinations; and second, any \naction that ``withdraws or restricts recreational, subsistence, or \ncommercial use'' of public land.\n  I have a lot of sympathy with those who are fed up with the way the \nwetlands program is run. I think it should be closely scrutinized and \nreformed in a number of ways. I do not think, however, that a \nregulatory moratorium is the way to accomplish that reform.\n  Regarding the second expansion, that is, the inclusion in the \nmoratorium of any action that ``withdraws or restricts recreational, \nsubsistence, or commercial use'' of public land, I am, again, at a \nloss. Do the supporters of the moratorium really mean to stop virtually \nall government action in our national parks, forest, refuges, and \nmonuments?\n  This provision would mean, as we wrote in our minority views on the \ncommittee report:\n\n       That National Park Service employees would not be able to \n     carry out basic management responsibilities in our national \n     parks. The Park Service would not be able to prevent hot rods \n     from racing in national parks, restrict access to fragile \n     archaeological sites, or close dangerous passes on snow-\n     covered peaks. As the National Parks and Conservation \n     Association has said, ``This prohibition against rulemaking \n     effectively eliminates the abilities of the Bureau of Land \n     Management, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service and the Forest Service to manage federal lands for \n     resource protection.''\n\n  While the moratorium's supporters reject these questions and \ncriticisms with the statement that the bill permits the President to \nexempt rules he thinks are really important, I take our legislative \nresponsibility seriously. I am confronted by a bill that makes no sense \non its own and makes no sense in the context of regulatory reform. So, \nI cannot support it. It is as simple as that.\n  So that my colleagues can truly appreciate the damage that would be \ndone by this legislation, I ask unanimous consent to include in the \nRecord a summary of the amendments considered by the committee in its \nmarkup on March 7 and 9; letters regarding the moratorium's impact on \nthe American people; a copy of our minority views to the committee \nreport on the moratorium bill; and a list of rules that would be \nstopped by the moratorium.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Governmental Affairs Committee Markup of S. 219\n\n       Accepted:\n       (1) Roth Substitute for S. 219 (voice vote, 3/7): Limits \n     moratorium to ``significant regulatory action taken during \n     the moratorium period'' (no longer action ``made effective'' \n     during the moratorium); extends moratorium period to ``time \n     beginning November 9, 1994, and ending on December 31, 1995, \n     unless an Act of Congress provides for an earlier termination \n     date for such a period.'' limits judicial review language to \n     ``No determination under this Act shall be subject to \n     adjudicative review before an administrative tribunal of \n     court of law.''\n       (2) Cochran amendment to exempt ``any action taken to \n     ensure the safety and soundness of a Farm Credit System \n     institution or to protect the Farm Credit Insurance Fund.'' \n     (voice vote, 3/7).\n       (3) Pryor amendment to exempt ``any agency action that \n     establishes, modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a \n     regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or \n     subsistence activity relating to hunting, fishing, or \n     camping, if a Federal law prohibits such activity in the \n     absence of agency action.''

We believe the \n     federal government has an important role in protecting the \n     public interest and in improving quality of life. We believe \n     that undermining federal safeguards will cause serious harm \n     to people and the environment. These Congressional \n     initiatives also jeopardize services provided by public \n     charities and religious and governmental entities valued by \n     our society . . . Accordingly, we oppose any actions that \n     might be taken by the Congress to undermine sensible \n     safeguards.''\n       The health and safety of people and the planet has always \n     been an important concern for our Church. I urge you not to \n     let the popular cry of cutting red tape lead to the sacrifice \n     of the health and wholeness of our children and God's \n     Creation. Vote no on S. 219.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                      Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett,\n     General Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   The League of Women Voters,\n\n                                                   March 16, 1995.\n     To: Members of the U.S. Senate.\n     From: Becky Cain, President.\n     Re: Anti-Regulatory Legislation.\n       The League of Women Voters is deeply distresed over current \n     anti-regulatory legislation designed to seriously undermine \n     the regulatory process as it applies to health, safety and \n     environmental protections. We urge you to oppose such \n     legislation.\n       We believe that extreme anti-regulatory measures would \n     subvert the federal government's authority and ability to \n     protect the health and well-being of the American people. For \n     many years, we have watched the progress as the lives of \n     citizens have been improved through the projections provided \n     by federal regulations. By requiring risk/benefit analysis \n     and additional layers of review, the proposed legislation \n     will not streamline regulatory procedures, but will \n     complicate and add years and costs to the regulatory process.\n       The League of Women Voters has long supported efforts to \n     assure that government provides opportunities for citizen \n     participation in government decision making, promotes the \n     conservation and wise management of natural resources in the \n     public interest and protects the well-being of our citizens--\n     particularly children. We believe that the underlying premise \n     that regulations should be based solely on the basis of their \n     cost to the private and public sectors is fundamentally \n     wrong. It is essential that the benefits to the American \n     people, such as health and safety, be an integral and \n     paramount part of the regulatory process.\n       The League is equally concerned about the ``takings'' \n     provisions of anti-regulatory proposals. Again, legislation \n     is couched in pro-citizen terms, but would result in a more \n     burdensome regulatory process. The ``takings'' proposals \n     being considered by Congress would require the government to \n     compensate property owners when a government regulation may \n     reduce value by even a small amount. The affected regulations \n     include those that protect the environment, provide for food \n     safety, and protect individual citizens. ``Takings'' \n     legislation could cost federal, state and local governments \n     billions of dollars, while costing citizens their health and \n     safety.\n       The League of Women Voters urges you to consider \n     thoughtfully and carefully the current anti-regulatory moves \n     on Capitol Hill. While there may be individual regulatory \n     processes that need some streamlining, extremist proposals \n     are not the solution. It is critical that we not lose sight \n     of the purpose of these regulations, which is to provide a \n     cleaner environment and a brighter future for our children. \n     We urge you to vote against extreme anti-regulatory \n     legislation brought before the Senate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Center for Science\n\n\n                                       in the Public Interest,\n\n                                                   March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our more than 800,000 members \n     nationwide, the Center for Science in the Public Interest \n     (CSPI) urges you to oppose S. 219, the Regulatory Transition \n     Act. CSPI is a non-profit consumer advocacy organization that \n     focuses on matters relating to nutrition and health.\n       We urge you to oppose S. 219 because the bill will prevent \n     government agencies from issuing new regulations that will: \n     Modernize our nation's meat safety inspection system and \n     reduce thousands of deaths now caused by contaminated food; \n     set new nutritional standards for school lunches and improve \n     the dietary habits of our nation's children; establish safety \n     standards for the labeling and packaging of iron supplements, \n     which have caused fatal poisoning in children.\n       These are just a few of the many essential measures that \n     government agencies should be allowed to take in order to \n     safeguard our health and safety. Efforts to impose a \n     moratorium on new government regulations could cost thousands \n     of American lives. A moratorium means that government \n     agencies responsible for protecting consumer health will be \n     stopped in their tracks and prevented from doing their jobs.\n       Accordingly, we urge you to oppose S. 219.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Bruce Silverglade,\n     Director of Legal Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                                   March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: Consumers Union urges you to vote NO on S. \n     219, the Regulatory Transition Act of 1995, when it comes to \n     a vote on the Senate floor next week. S. 219 is a bad idea \n     for consumers and for the public health and safety.\n       S. 219, with few exceptions, would paralyze until the end \n     of this year most agency activities to develop health and \n     safety--as well as other important--regulations.\n       Among the pending rulemakings that the bill would halt is \n     one by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to deal with deadly \n     bacteria in our meat and poultry supply. You are well aware \n     of the recent, tragic deaths and serious illnesses that have \n     resulted from e. coli bacteria in meat. The Department should \n     be congratulated and encouraged to, not delayed from, dealing \n     with this serious public health problem--and others like it.\n       Also pending is an Environmental Protection Agency \n     rulemaking to deal with cryptosporidium in public water \n     supplies. This is the bacterium that recently caused one-\n     hundred deaths and four-hundred thousand illnesses when it \n     contaminated Milwaukee's water supply. This proposed testing \n     standard, too, as well as other pending EPA public health \n     rules, would be frozen in mid-process by S. 219.\n       [[Page S4616]] Surely, consumers should be able to eat from \n     the commercial food supply and drink from public water \n     supplies without risking their lives or their health. But S. \n     219 will stand in the way of moving closer quickly to this \n     goal.\n       A ``NO'' vote on S. 219 will be a ``yes'' vote for public \n     health and safety. And for common sense. Please vote ``NO''.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark Silbergeld,\n     Codirector.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    Citizens for Sensible Safeguards\n\n\n            coalition opposes regulatory moratorium (s. 219)\n\n       Citizens for Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more than \n     200 organizations representing working men and women and \n     those concerned about environmental, educational, civil \n     rights, disability, health, social services, low income, and \n     consumer issues, strongly opposes a regulatory moratorium \n     (enclosed is a Citizens for Sensible Safeguards Statement of \n     Principles and a listing of members). We strongly urge \n     members of the Senate to vote against S. 219, The Regulatory \n     Transition Act of 1995.\n       We are opposed to this bill because it would jeopardize the \n     health and safety of all Americans. Proponents of the bill \n     point out that there is an exemption for regulatory \n     activities that present an ``imminent threat to health or \n     safety or other emergency'' or for enforcement of criminal \n     laws. However, the bill does not define an ``imminent threat \n     to health or safety''. Would a regulation that has been in \n     progress for a year be considered an ``imminent'' threat?\n       The proposed bill places a higher premium on protecting \n     rules for duck hunters than for our children. There is a \n     specific exemption from the moratorium for rules dealing with \n     duck hunting, but when Committee amendments were offered \n     dealing with protections for children, Republicans defeated \n     them. We think that is inappropriate.\n       The coalition also feels that the moratorium raises serious \n     Constitutional concerns. In one fell swoop, the bill suspends \n     the power of the executive branch to implement laws and of \n     the courts to enforce regulatory adjudication. This bill has \n     enormous repercussions for the separation of powers \n     established under the Constitution and will seriously limit \n     the ability of the President to faithfully execute the laws \n     of the land.\n       There are many unintended consequences of the bill. For \n     example, an amendment offered by Sen. Stevens (R-AK) adds to \n     the definition of ``significant'' any agency action that in \n     any way ``restricts recreational, subsistence, or commercial \n     use of any land under the control of a Federal agency.'' He \n     stated that he doesn't want commercial activity on public \n     lands to suffer because of the moratorium. However, this \n     would block virtually all pro-environmental agency actions on \n     public lands, including national parks, and would only serve \n     to hurt the environment, permitting as it does new agency \n     rules to accommodate ``forest health'' logging.\n       Overall, the coalition believes that a regulatory \n     moratorium is a flawed idea. No number of exemptions from the \n     moratorium will be enough to fix the bill.\n       Discussions are occurring at the present time concerning \n     the substitution of alternative bills such as legislation \n     allowing a Congressional veto of regulations. Under such a \n     plan, the Congress would have 45 days to review final \n     ``major'' rules and then be able to pass a Joint Resolution \n     to disapprove of any such rules. The President could veto the \n     resolution and then the Congress would have authority to \n     override the veto. Such a bill would have a chilling impact \n     on the agency regulatory process and permit powerful special \n     interests to shape regulations by threatening Congressional \n     action. Accordingly, the Coalition opposes such a substitute \n     to S. 219.\n                    Citizens for Sensible Safeguards\n\n\n                        Statement of Principles\n\n       Public protections, such as those dealing with food safety, \n     safe drinking water, worker health and safety, equal \n     educational opportunity, civil rights, motor vehicle safety, \n     toxic pollution, the well-being of children, and health care, \n     are under attack through Congressional initiatives to reduce \n     or eliminate federal laws and regulations. The following \n     organizations believe the federal government has an important \n     role in protecting the public interest and in improving \n     quality of life. We believe that undermining federal \n     safeguards will cause serious harm to citizens. These \n     Congressional initiatives also jeopardizes services provided \n     by public charities and religious and governmental entities \n     valued by our society.\n       Buried in the Contract with America's rhetoric about \n     shrinking government and rolling back red tape is a plan to \n     undo laws, and safeguards that citizens have struggled long \n     and hard to champion. We strongly support improving laws and \n     safeguards that protect citizens while recognizing the need \n     to reduce unnecessary and red tape. The zeal to minimize \n     regulatory burdens, however, must be balanced with the need \n     to ensure protections for all Americans. Accordingly, we \n     oppose actions taken by Congress to undermine sensible \n     safeguards.\n       We urge President Clinton and Congress not to let the \n     popular cry of cutting red tape--something we all believe \n     in--become a guise for dismantling federal safeguards that \n     should be preserved.\n\n\n                          coalition structure\n\n       Citizens for Sensible Safeguards has three standing \n     committees: National Strategy Committee, chaired by American \n     Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, \n     National Education Association, and OMB Watch; Grassroots \n     Strategy Committee, chaired by OMB Watch, Sierra Club Legal \n     Defense Fund, and United Cerebral Palsy Associations; and \n     Media/Message Committee, chaired by American Oceans Campaign \n     and Service Employees International Union.\n       A Steering Committee overseas coalition activities.

This legislation will \n     impose a moratorium on all federal regulatory actions \n     [[Page S4617]] from November 9, 1994 until December 31, 1995. \n     Any regulatory action affecting the environment, public \n     health or safety, or impacting the economy by $100 million or \n     more in any calendar year would be halted.\n       I am writing to urge you to oppose S. 219, the Regulatory \n     Moratorium bill. This legislative bludgeon, adopted by the \n     House in February, would halt major federal environmental \n     programs, such as regulations implementing the Clean Air Act, \n     or establishing new guidelines for mineral development on \n     public lands.\n       The Regulatory Moratorium is a crude instrument being used \n     to address concerns about specific federal regulatory \n     programs, however, health and safety programs, food and drug \n     programs, the environment, housing and all other branches of \n     government will be affected.\n       The devastating impact of a regulatory moratorium on the \n     government is further compounded by an amendment introduced \n     by Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK), and adopted by the Senate \n     Government Affairs Committee last week. The Stevens Amendment \n     would stop the federal government from taking any action to \n     restrict ``recreational, subsistence or commercial use of the \n     public lands.'' The effect of the Stevens Amendment on \n     federal programs is staggering.\n       Land use planning efforts to balance resource uses and \n     values on the National Parks, Refuges, National Forests and \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands would be stopped.\n       Most permitting activities of the federal land management \n     agencies would be held up.\n       The federal government's ability to respond to fire, flood \n     and other threats would be thwarted.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 National Wildlife\n\n\n                                           Refuge Association,\n\n                                                   March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The National Wildlife Refuge Association \n     opposes the Stevens amendment to S. 219, the pending \n     regulatory moratorium legislation. This amendment, if \n     enacted, will ensure that incompatible uses on refuges \n     continue unchecked resulting in the needless loss and \n     harassment of wildlife and, in some cases, that refuge \n     visitor safety is compromised. Following are examples of \n     scenarios that can be expected System-wide if the Stevens \n     amendment is enacted:\n       Red Rock Lakes NWR (MT): For approximately two weeks in the \n     autumn migratory bird and big game hunting seasons overlap on \n     the Refuge. A popular site for big game hunting is a large \n     clearing that lies between a lake and an access road where \n     elk frequently browse without the benefit of cover. Under \n     current regulations hunters are permitted to shoot at big \n     game in the clearing once out of their vehicles and off the \n     road. Naturally, not all shots connect with their targets \n     and, in the case of more powerful rifles, can conceivably \n     reach the lake. But during the time of season overlap, duck \n     hunters can be found along the edge of the lake. Because of \n     the potential safety hazards, the refuge manager intends to \n     alter hunting patterns during the overlap. The Stevens \n     amendment will make it impossible for the refuge manager to \n     rectify this dangerous situation.\n       Chincoteague NWR (VA), E.B. Forsythe NWR (NJ): While beach-\n     oriented recreational activities are permitted approximately \n     nine months of the year on these two refuges, the areas must \n     be closed from May through August while piping plovers nest \n     along the beach. Under the Stevens amendment, seasonal \n     closures would be prohibited and recreational activities \n     would be permitted that could seriously impact plover nesting \n     activities.\n       Crystal River NWR (FL): In wintertime, Crystal River draws \n     nearly a quarter of the known manatee population because of a \n     warm spring that flows into the cooled waters. During this \n     time, the FWS closes the refuge to boating and jet-skiing in \n     an effort to help the manatees avoid being struck by boat and \n     jetski hulls, and cut by hazardous propellers. The Stevens \n     amendment would prohibit this seasonal closing, thereby \n     exposing the concentrated numbers of manatees to increased \n     hazards.\n       The National Wildlife Refuge System is the only public land \n     system dedicated primarily to the conservation of wildlife. \n     In addition it also provides significant opportunities for \n     recreation including hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing, \n     hiking and other wildlife-dependent activities. By enacting \n     legislation that permits incompatible commercial and \n     recreational activities to continue on our Nation's Wildlife \n     Refuges, the Congress is not only jeopardizing our valuable \n     wildlife resources but also the recreational opportunities \n     that depend on them.

If enacted, S. 219 will undermine and negate many \n     important safeguards and protections for Americans, and lead \n     to confusion and uncertainty among state and local \n     governments and employers attempting to comply with federal \n     laws.\n       Among the hundreds of regulatory actions that could be \n     negated this bill are:\n       Department of Labor final regulations to implement the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act, scheduled to take effect on \n     April 16.\n       Department of Education guidance to states and school \n     districts on implementation of the Gun-Free Schools Act;\n       Regulations currently being developed by the Education \n     Department that are necessary to implement the provisions of \n     the reauthorized Elementary Secondary Education Act;\n       Education Department regulations and guidance on the new \n     college student Direct Loan program, which will save the \n     federal government billions of dollars;\n       Proposed OSHA standards to protect workers from harmful \n     indoor air pollutants;\n       Expected FCC regulations to implement the Children's \n     Television Act; and\n       Consumer Product Safety Commission protections against \n     choking hazards from toys.\n       This bill would drastically curtail the ability of the \n     federal government to ensure that workers have safe \n     workplaces; that Americans have safe food, drinking water, \n     and clean air; and that children are protected from a broad \n     range of hazards. NEA again urges that you vote against final \n     passage of S. 219.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Mary Elizabeth Teasly,\n     Interim Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    Physicians for\n\n\n                                        Social Responsibility,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: A proposed freeze on federal regulations (S. \n     219) and risk assessment legislation (S. 343) would \n     effectively paralyze our national ability to protect the \n     public health. So concludes one of America's leading \n     pediatric and environmental medicine experts, Philip J. \n     Landrigan, M.D., who testified on the severe public health \n     impact of comparable legislation in the House. This \n     legislation would sabotage America's ability to contain \n     deadly, emerging threats such as cryptosporidium in drinking \n     water and particulate air pollution. Public health impacts \n     are critical in evaluating the merits of freezing federal \n     regulations or requiring costly, cumbersome new risk \n     assessments, far in excess of those already used by \n     government agencies. Listed below are just a few reasons why \n     S. 219 and 343 would undermine public health in America and \n     should be rejected:\n       A freeze and endless studies would grind public health \n     agencies to a halt ``[E]normously cumbersome and \n     extraordinarily bureaucratic requirements imposed on the \n     regulatory process in the name of government simplification \n     will seriously hinder'' the prevention of disease. (House \n     Commerce Subcommittee testimony of Philip Landrigan, M.D., 2/\n     2/95, p. 1, para. 3) The goal is to save lives, not to engage \n     in unending study. (Landrigan testimony p. 7, para. 1)\n       A costly new layer of bureaucracy would harm public health \n     A ``dreadful and tragic misuse of legislative power [would] \n     enshrine the false science of quantitative risk assessment as \n     the law of the land,'' creating ``a grossly obese and \n     unnecessary bureaucracy'' that would ``set the stage for \n     disease, disability and untimely death'' in America. (p. 7, \n     para. 2)\n       Less gridlock saves kids; More gridlock hurts workers \n     Removing lead from gasoline is one of the most successful \n     federal efforts ever to protect children's health, saving \n     money and improving Americans' lives. But with a moratorium \n     and the detailed regulatory analysis Congress is considering, \n     we would still have lead in gasoline--and more childhood lead \n     poisoning--today. Meanwhile, additional risk assessment \n     required for an OSHA benzene standard wasted seven years and \n     may have caused nearly 500 workers to die needlessly from \n     leukemia. ``The human consequence of this insistence upon \n     quantitative tidiness has been grim.'' (p. 5, para. 6)\n       Public health regulations save workers' lives and American \n     jobs Contrary to massive job loss claims, public health \n     regulations not only protect workers, but can also help save \n     American jobs by stimulating efficient, less dangerous \n     production (Testimony Addendum p. 2).\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               Joseph M. Schwartz,\n     Associate Director for Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                 and Conservation Association,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: During debate on the regulatory moratorium \n     legislation, S. 219, the Committee on Governmental Affairs \n     adopted an amendment offered by Senator Stevens to prevent \n     any regulations or rules that ``withdraw or restrict \n     recreational, subsistence, or commercial use of any federal \n     land under the control of a Federal agency.'' This \n     prohibition against rulemaking effectively eliminates the \n     abilities of the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park \n     Service (NPS), the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest \n     Service to manage federal lands for resource protection. We \n     encourage you to support efforts to eliminate this provision \n     from the bill when it is considered on the Senate floor.\n       The National Parks and Conservation Association (NPCA) is \n     concerned about the bill's likely impacts on management of \n     the \n     [[Page S4618]] National Park System. The NPS is not perceived \n     as a regulatory agency; yet, the NPS depends upon regulations \n     to protect the resources of our national parks. The \n     moratorium would be retroactive to November 9, 1994. Since \n     that time the NPS has issued a number of significant rules, \n     which include: recreational fishing rules for the Everglades \n     National Park that are consistent with state fishing \n     regulations, closure of high visitation areas to hunting at \n     Pictured Rocks National Seashore, protection for \n     archeological resources in all cultural and historical parks, \n     authority to eliminate most solid waste sites within park \n     boundaries, altering approved off-road vehicle areas at Cape \n     Cod National Seashore in order to protect the endangered \n     piping plover, implementing a pre-registration period for \n     mountain climbing in Denali National Park.\n       NPCA does not believe any of these regulations are \n     overburdensome, nor are they stifling the productivity of the \n     country. These examples demonstrate why the Stevens amendment \n     to S. 219 overreaches.\n       In addition to the efforts listed above, the NPS is working \n     on regulations that will: require greater environmental \n     compliance at oil and gas development sites within the parks; \n     limit flights over parks where noise and safety have become a \n     concern; limit fishing activities in parks where stocks are \n     becoming depleted; and put in place more stringent limits on \n     solicitation within the boundaries of national park units. \n     These are efforts to improve visitor services, ensure safety, \n     and, most importantly, protect our national heritage.\n                                                                    ____\n\nImpacts of the Regulatory Moratorium Required by the Stevens Amendment \n                               to S. 219\n\n\n                         national park service\n\n       Below are the NPS actions, notices, regulations or rules \n     that would not be implemented because of the Stevens \n     Amendment.

The moratorium \n     also suspends court order deadlines to carry out significant \n     regulatory actions.\n       The regulatory moratorium is a blunt instrument that has \n     little to do with regulatory reforms and, in fact, the \n     moratorium is a threat to public protections and must be \n     opposed. Every poll, including those of exiting voters last \n     November, shows an electorate that wants stronger federal \n     protections for our environment and our health and safety. \n     The moratorium would directly undermine that objective.\n       The proposed bill will have unintended consequences and \n     proposals to exempt certain activities is not a solution to \n     making the bill workable. Thus, the concept of a moratorium \n     is fundamentally flawed.\n       The proposed bill also raises serious constitutional \n     concerns by prohibiting the executive branch from \n     implementing the laws of the land and prohibiting the courts \n     from enforcing regulatory adjudications. In selected cases, \n     Congress would let the executive branch implement laws but \n     not without going through a series of bureaucratic hoops. \n     This bill has enormous repercussions for the separation of \n     powers under the Constitution and will seriously limit the \n     ability of the President to faithfully execute the laws of \n     the land.\n       The moratorium is a means for gutting federal laws and \n     protections. By passing this bill, Congress could undo the \n     implementation of many laws. Conservative Republicans are \n     using the moratorium as a vehicle to stop federal protections \n     until such time as they can pass other laws to dismantle \n     these protections. They have listed laws that they want to \n     rewrite such as the Endangered Species Act, Clean Air and \n     Water Acts, Occupational Safety and Health Act, Truth in \n     Lending Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act.\n       The effect of this legislation would be to essentially shut \n     government down. This was not the intent of the voters in \n     November. The public wants to streamline government and to \n     make it work more efficiently. But the public also wants \n     improved protections and safeguards. It does not want to \n     throw the baby out with the bath water--which will be the \n     results of a regulatory moratorium.\n       The moratorium has enormous consequences yet there has been \n     virtually no debate on the proposed bill. The public has a \n     right to know about what Congress is planning and a right to \n     publicly debate these plans. Let's not resort to backhanded \n     approaches, such as the regulatory moratorium, to achieve \n     outcomes that may be inconsistent with popular sentiment.\n       We urge you to vote against S. 219, the Regulatory \n     Transition Act of 1995.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Gary D. Bass,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Religious Action Center\n\n\n                                            of Reform Judaism,\n\n                                                 March 16, 1996.  \n       Dear Senator: On behalf of The Commission on Social Action \n     of Reform Judaism and the Central Conference of American \n     Rabbis, I urge you to oppose S. 219, The Regulatory \n     Moratorium. If passed, this bill will jeopardize the \n     protection of our food and drinking water, worker health and \n     safety, civil rights, motor vehicle safety, and the well \n     being of our children.\n       This bill and others like it are part of a systematic \n     attack against government regulation. Although stemming from \n     legitimate concerns about bureaucracy and regulatory \n     entanglements, they respond to these concerns with a cure \n     that is worse than the illness. These anti-regulatory \n     measures go far beyond an attempt to make government more \n     responsive and efficient--they threaten the ability of \n     government to fulfill its primary mission: protection of the \n     common good.\n       This moratorium is extremely far reaching, severely \n     constraining the regulatory abilities of the FDA, EPA, FAA, \n     USDA, DoE, FEC, INS, FCC, and the Transportation, Labor, \n     Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development \n     Departments. In addition, rather than eliminating \n     bureaucracy, this bill will create a new form of delay. For \n     these reasons, a coalition of over 200 national public \n     interest groups has asked the Senate to rethink S. 219 \n     carefully and preserve public health and safety protections.\n       The last election showed great public concern over the size \n     and efficacy of the government. However, this should not be \n     seen as a desire to weaken environmental health and safety \n     standards. The latest Times-Mirror poll says that 82% of the \n     public wants such standards to become stricter. Congress must \n     not jeopardize our health and safety in a hasty attempt to \n     address the problems of the federal government. S. 219 will \n     have just this effect.\n       The ``Regulatory Moratorium'' begins the process of \n     dismantling the federal government. The moratorium will \n     prevent federal agencies from taking actions necessary to \n     protect the public. S. 219 would suspend all final \n     regulations approved by any government agency since November \n     9, 1994 and prohibit any work on new regulations until \n     December 31, 1995.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  National Safe Kids Campaign,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to you, on behalf of the \n     National Safe Kids Campaign, to express our serious concerns \n     regarding S. 219, the Regulatory Transition Act of 1995. We \n     believe this bill jeopardizes regulations that will protect \n     our children from preventable injuries--the number one killer \n     of children ages 14 and under.\n       Each year, unintentional injuries kill nearly 7,200 \n     children and leave 50,000 disabled. Not only is there a \n     staggering emotional toll to childhood injury, but there is a \n     monetary toll as well--unintentional injuries cost society \n     $13.8 billion annually.\n       Fortunately, prevention saves lives and money. One dollar \n     spent on a bike helmet saves society $30; one dollar spent on \n     a child \n     [[Page S4619]] safety seat saves society $32; one dollar \n     invested in a poison control center saves society almost $8; \n     one dollar spent on a smoke detector saves society between \n     $44 and $70. However, prevention fails when safety products \n     are defective.\n       A fundamental component of successful injury prevention is \n     the sensible regulation of certain consumer products which \n     pose a danger to children. However, S. 219 would undermine \n     the progress being made towards the safe and sensible \n     regulation of products which could harm children.\n       Specifically, the President is given too much discretion \n     under Section 5(2)(A) to determine whether a regulatory \n     action should be exempted because there is an ``imminent \n     threat to human health or safety.'' The intent of this \n     provision is vague and will result in an additional, \n     unnecessary bureaucratic layer. This provision flies in the \n     face of the intent of the bill--to streamline the regulatory \n     process. Indeed, Section 5(2)(A) could easily delay or stop \n     important regulatory activity that could save children's \n     lives.\n       S. 219 could result in needless injuries and deaths to \n     children. Responsible regulations such as the children's \n     safety regulations currently under consideration save lives \n     and dollars. These activities and others like them should \n     move forward. Prevention-related regulations which save lives \n     and dollars include:\n       Requirements for child-resistant packaging for certain \n     household products and medications.\n       There were 1.2 million reported poison exposures among \n     children ages 12 and under in 1992. The primary source of \n     poisonings were cosmetics, personal care items and cleaning \n     products. Final rules are currently being developed for \n     packaging standards for several household products and \n     prescription drugs.\n       Safety standards for bicycle helmets to ensure that all \n     helmets sold meet certain accepted effectiveness criteria. \n     Each year, approximately 300 children ages 14 and under are \n     killed in bicycle-related incidents--often as a result of \n     head trauma. Currently, helmets may be sold which do not \n     provide adequate protection against head trauma. At the \n     express direction of Congress, a standard for bicycle helmets \n     drawing from existing voluntary standards is currently being \n     developed.\n       Performance standards for baby walkers. In 1993 alone, \n     25,000 children required emergency room treatment due to the \n     use of baby walkers. The Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     (CPSC) is currently working on a Notice of Proposed Rule \n     making to develop design or performance requirements for baby \n     walkers.\n       Toy labeling and choking reporting regulations. In 1992, \n     there were 142,700 toy-related injuries to children ages 14 \n     and under. The Child Safety Protection Act of 1994 required \n     the Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue rules banning \n     certain small toys, establishing standards for toy labels \n     identifying choking hazards, and requiring the reporting of \n     choking incidents related to toys. The CPSC approved the \n     final rules in February, 1995.\n       Flammability Standard for Upholstered Furniture. Each year, \n     approximately 1,000 children ages 14 and under die in \n     residential fires. More than 60 percent of these children are \n     ages 4 and under. Playing with matches and lighters is the \n     leading cause of fire deaths and injuries in young children. \n     A substantial proportion of fires are associated with the \n     flame ignition of upholstered furniture. A proposed \n     flammability standard currently is being developed by the \n     CPSC.\n       The National SAFE KIDS Campaign is the first and only \n     nationwide campaign solely dedicated to the prevention of \n     unintentional childhood injuries. The Campaign with its more \n     than 170 State and Local Coalitions, through community-based \n     programs that provide education, promote environmental and \n     product modifications, and support appropriate public policy. \n     On behalf of the Campaign, our Chair, Dr. C. Everett Koop, \n     M.D., and the children whose lives are saved daily through \n     sensible regulations, I ask that you oppose the regulatory \n     moratorium proposed in S. 219.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Heather Paul, Ph.D.,\n                                             Executive Director.  \n                                             The Humane Society of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of The Humane Society of the United \n     States (HSUS), the largest animal protection organization in \n     the country with over 2.3 million members and constituents, I \n     am writing to urge you to oppose S. 219, the Regulatory \n     Transition Act of 1995. This bill will irreparably harm \n     efforts to protect the public and the environment on which we \n     depend, including endangered species, our public lands, and \n     animal protection efforts generally. The public at large will \n     also be harmed, through paralysis of government oversight of \n     food safety, safe drinking water, worker health and safety, \n     civil rights, and other critical areas.\n       The HSUS is gravely concerned about the breadth and scope \n     of attacks against environmental and animal protection \n     regulations in general. Federal regulations have provided \n     effective protection for endangered wildlife and wild lands, \n     nourishing the American spirit while supporting a strong \n     economy and a healthy environment. Without these protections \n     American would not be able to enjoy the wonders of national \n     parks or the mysteries of wild animals such as bison and bald \n     eagles.\n       S. 219 would jeopardize some of the most critical wildlife \n     and animal protection laws. Regulations under the Wild Bird \n     Conservation Act and the newly reauthorized Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act would be stopped, leaving large numbers of \n     wild populations vulnerable to continued depletion. Decisions \n     on listing endangered species, already backlogged from years \n     of inaction, would be delayed, further limiting the options \n     for finding creative and economically viable paths toward \n     preventing extinctions.\n       The American people did not vote last November to eliminate \n     the environmental and animal protection legislation they have \n     worked so hard to put in place. Neither did they vote to \n     create an endless tangle of litigation and rule-making to be \n     funded at taxpayer expense. I urge you, then, to vote no on \n     S. 219.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         John W. Grady, Ph.D.,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Wildlife and Habitat Protection.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Women's Legal Defense Fund,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator, The Women's Legal Defense Fund urges you to \n     oppose S. 219 and S. 343. These so-called ``regulatory \n     reform'' bills would gut the enforcement of some of our most \n     important environmental, consumer, civil rights, and health \n     and safety protections.\n       S. 219, the regulatory moratorium, would retroactively \n     freeze all regulations issued since November 9, 1994. This \n     bill could stop or delay the enforcement of existing rules \n     affecting:\n       Mammogram quality--The moratorium would suspend regulations \n     designed to ensure minimum quality standards for breast \n     cancer screening. These regulations could mean the difference \n     between life and death for countless women; holding them up \n     in the name of reform plays games with women's lives.\n       The Family and Medical Leave Act--The Department of Labor's \n     final rule implementing the FMLA would be suspended under the \n     proposed moratorium. The final rules clarify many \n     uncertainties in the law's application: employers and \n     employees should not be deprived of this guidance just as \n     they are learning their rights and responsibilities under \n     this new law.\n       Child support--Rules to improve paternity establishment \n     would be suspended. At a time when Congress is working to \n     strengthen child support enforcement, delaying the \n     implementation of these rules would be counterproductive.\n       S. 343 threatens to dismantle the federal government's \n     ability to protect us, our children, and our environment by \n     bringing the rulemaking process to a grinding halt. Agencies \n     would be required to perform time-consuming risk assessment \n     and cost-benefit analyses, not only on proposed new \n     regulations, but also on any existing ``major'' regulation \n     that is challenged. And costs of implementation would be the \n     paramount concern, not the health and safety of American \n     workers and their children.\n       If enacted, S. 219 and S. 343 would have a truly \n     devastating effect on women and their families. Please vote \n     against these draconian measures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Judith L. Lichtman,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate is expected to take up \n     the proposed regulatory moratorium bill (S. 219). The UAW \n     strongly opposes this proposal that threatens to weaken or \n     eliminate hundreds of safeguards that now protect families \n     and children in their homes, workplaces and communities. We \n     urge you to vote against S. 219 when it comes to the Senate \n     floor.\n       This legislation would have far-reaching consequences for \n     the way the federal government carries out its \n     responsibilities to safeguard public health, the environment \n     and workplace safety. The moratorium bill would stop the \n     issuance of most new federal regulations, retroactive to \n     November 9, 1994. This moratorium would remain in place \n     through the end of 1995, or until Congress approves a \n     comprehensive overhaul of federal safeguards. The bill would \n     effect regulations that are expected to have an annual impact \n     on the economy of $100 million or more. This is an arbitrary \n     threshold that makes no distinction between good or bad \n     regulations.\n       A number of key amendments that would have improved S. 219 \n     were rejected by narrow margins in the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee. The UAW was disappointed that an attempt \n     to exempt worker safety and health protections from the \n     moratorium was defeated on a tie vote. In addition, other \n     amendments to exempt food safety programs, toxic waste \n     disposal and safe drinking water protections were defeated as \n     well. Although powerful timber and grazing industries and \n     other special interests were able to obtain exemptions from \n     the regulatory moratorium, few exemptions were provided for \n     regulations that deal with safeguards for ordinary citizens. \n     Thus, the net effect of S.219 would be to stop regulations \n     that deal with \n     [[Page S4620]] workplace health and safety, such as the \n     proposed ergonomics standard, worker protections like the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act, and public health measures such \n     as regulations dealing with food poisoning.\n       For these reasons, the UAW is strongly opposed to S. 219. \n     In our judgment, this measure would undermine the ability of \n     the federal government to play a positive role in \n     safeguarding the health and safety of our children, our \n     families, our workplaces, and our communities. We urge you to \n     vote against S. 219 when the Senate takes up the legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: Sometime in the next week, you will be asked \n     to vote against public health and safety. The Senate may vote \n     on S. 219, the Regulatory Transition Act, a regulatory \n     moratorium which slams the door on government efforts to \n     protect American people. The Senate may also consider a bill \n     to give Congress a veto power over regulations, a provision \n     which will inappropriately bring enforcement of laws back \n     into the political arena.\n       On behalf of Public Citizen and its members, I urge you to \n     oppose these attacks on public health and safety.\n       The regulatory moratorium is a crude, poorly understood, \n     meat-axe approach to an extremely complicated issue. The \n     moratorium will disrupt thousands of pending programs, \n     including efforts to upgrade archaic meat inspection systems. \n     American children are already dying from E. Coli \n     contamination of their food--contamination which could be \n     prevented. American children will continue to die as a result \n     of further delay on these types of safeguards.\n       The regulatory moratorium would override statutory mandates \n     which Americans support, without the scrutiny of public \n     debate. Polls show that Americans want stronger federal \n     protection for public health and safety. If Congress wants to \n     repeal the Clean Air Act, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or \n     the Occupational Safety and Health Act, they should debate \n     the substance of those statutes, rather than attack the \n     regulatory system on which these protections are built.\n       The regulatory moratorium would be costly to taxpayers and \n     to business. Taxpayer money would be wasted while federal \n     agencies charged with implementing laws passed by Congress \n     are stopped in their tracks. Delays in regulations effecting \n     planning cycles will add to business costs.\n       Special business interests have been able to win exemptions \n     for regulations that will help line their pocket books. But \n     the American public has not been able to get a special \n     exemption for government safeguards that will protect our \n     very lives.\n                            Natural Resources Defense Council,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, a national membership organization dedicated to the \n     protection of public health and the environment, I urge you \n     to vote No on the regulatory moratorium (S. 219) and \n     regulatory reform bills now pending before the Senate. These \n     bills would place polluters before the public and undermine \n     25 years of bipartisan environmental success.\n       Regulatory Moratorium. S. 219 would block new rules aimed \n     at protecting the public and streamlining government. For \n     example, the bill would bar the regulation of \n     cryptosporidium, the parasite that contaminated Milwaukee's \n     drinking water, sickening 400,000 and killing more than 100 \n     people. A moratorium on new rules is the wrong tool to \n     identify and fix defects in existing rules.\n       Nor is the solution a proposal now being considered as an \n     alternative to a regulatory moratorium--a 45-day delay in \n     issuing rules pending Congressional review. Every rule will \n     have its special interests pounding the pavement on Capitol \n     Hill to stop it, diverting limited Congressional resources \n     from more pressing matters.\n       I also urge you to oppose efforts to expand any moratorium \n     to actions other than rulemakings. Amendments like that \n     offered by Senator Stevens in the Government Affairs \n     Committee preventing any action that ``restricts \n     recreational, subsistence, or commercial use of any land \n     under the control of a Federal agency'' will bring to a halt \n     efforts to preserve our public lands for future generations. \n     Restricting actions to enforce existing limitations on the \n     use of public lands will penalize law-abiding citizens who \n     have been good stewards of our federal lands.\n                                     American Oceans Campaign,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1995.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: American Oceans Campaign is a national, non-\n     partisan organization working to protect our world's oceans \n     and marine environment. We strongly urge you to Vote No on S. \n     219, the Regulatory Transition Act of 1995.\n       This bill will have devastating effects on our nation's \n     fisheries, coastal programs, and rules to ensure public \n     health and safety, such as protections in the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act and Clean Water Act. Even negotiated rules agreed \n     to by all parties to address disinfection by-products and \n     cryptosporidium in drinking water would be halted. Such \n     safeguards are critical to protecting the public from known \n     carcinogens and dangerous pathogens in drinking water \n     supplies across the country.\n       American Oceans Campaign strongly opposes S. 219. Uniform \n     federal protections and safeguards are necessary to ensure \n     public health and conserve our precious natural resources. \n     Government reform is essential, but public and environmental \n     protections should not be eviscerated in the process. S. 219 \n     uses a sledgehammer where a surgeon's scalpel is needed. Any \n     revisions should be made on a case by case basis, not in an \n     ad hoc fashion. We are available to assist you in this \n     endeavor, as we support common sense initiatives like ending \n     subsidies to polluters and encouraging pollution prevention \n     programs.\n       In poll after poll, American voters overwhelmingly support \n     strengthening federal standards for environmental and public \n     health protection. As public servants, it is incumbent on \n     Congress to craft the most responsible policy for the nation. \n     S. 219 is not responsible legislation. We urge you to resist \n     any temptation to pass this or any bill which threatens \n     protections for the American people and the air we breathe, \n     water we drink, and land on which we live.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ted Danson,\n                                                        President.\n            Campaign for Safe and Affordable Drinking Water\n\n\n                   two good reasons to oppose s. 219\n\n       1. Urgently needed protections to control the deadly bug \n     cryptospordium and cancer-causing chlorine by-products would \n     be stopped.\n       The Safe Drinking Water Act [SDWA], last amended in 1986, \n     does not include regulations on cryptospordium, the protozoa \n     from animal wastes that caused 400,000 people to become ill \n     and over 100 to die in Milwaukee in 1993. Cryptospordium, \n     giardia and other bacteria contribute largely to the nearly \n     one million people that the Centers for Disease Control \n     estimate are made ill from their drinking water each year. A \n     recent report documented 116 water-borne disease outbreaks in \n     the U.S. 1986-1994. Due to chronic under-reporting, this is \n     just the tip of the iceberg.\n       Many people are at higher risk to serious illness or even \n     death from cryptospordium and giardia, including infants and \n     children, pregnant women, people with AIDS and the elderly.\n       The SDWA also fails to adequately control dangerous by-\n     products of chlorine and similar disinfectants. These \n     disinfection by-products (DBPs) are found in the drinking \n     water of over 100 million people. A recent study by doctors \n     from Harvard and Wisconsin found that DBPs may be responsible \n     for 10,700 or more rectal and bladder cancers per year. \n     Doctors from the Public Health Service found that certain \n     birth defects are significantly associated with DBPs. EPA has \n     found that DBPs can also cause liver and kidney damage.\n       2. S. 219 hijacks the political process\n       Responding to the new scientific and public health data \n     documenting these real and immediate public health threats, \n     the EPA convened a ``negotiating team'' to develop \n     reasonable, cost-effective solutions. Representative from all \n     sides of the debate on providing safe drinking water were \n     included in this negotiation process--public water systems, \n     state and local health agencies, consumer groups, state and \n     local governments and environmental organizations.\n       This team agreed to develop modest controls of DBPs and \n     microbial contaminants, to gather more information and \n     research and to continue negotiations after gathering this \n     information. The drafting of the rules controlling \n     cryptospordium and DBPs was a ground-breaking effort to \n     include all parties in the decision making process.\n       This carefully constructed agreement, balancing public \n     health risks and costs, would be thrown out the window by S. \n     219. In a rush to score political points, S. 219 would delay \n     these urgently needed standards, leaving the public exposed \n     to health threats which have already caused tremendous pain \n     and suffering.\n                           American Public Health Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The American Public Health Association \n     representing over 50,000 health professionals and community \n     health leaders along with its 52 state affiliated \n     organizations opposes S. 219, Regulatory Transition Act. The \n     bill would create a moratorium on the development or \n     implementation of any new federal regulation until the end of \n     1995.\n       APHA believes that this legislation and other cost benefit \n     and risk assessment proposals (as currently drafted) present \n     a threat to human health and safety. Important contributions \n     have been made over the past few decades to the nation's \n     public health and its environment by the enactment of \n     reasonable and scientifically based legislation. This bill \n     will halt substantial progress on a number of important \n     initiatives on tobacco, food safety and workplace hazards.\n       We urge you and your colleagues in the Senate to oppose \n     this legislation and other attempts to limit the ability of \n     federal agencies to safe lives and prevent injuries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Fernando M. Trevino, PhD, MPH,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                               Center for Marine Conservation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The Center for Marine Conservation and its \n     125,000 members urge you to oppose S. 219 when it reaches the \n     Senate \n     [[Page S4621]] floor. The bill imposes a moratorium on the \n     development and implementation of all federal regulations \n     from November 9, 1994 through December 31, 1995, even \n     regulations mandated by court order. The moratorium falls \n     particularly hard on the environment:\n       1. The commercial fishing industry would be severely \n     affected if you halt regulations allocating allowable \n     harvests and bycatch limits in the New England and Alaskan \n     groundfish fisheries, and limiting access to certain other \n     federal fisheries.\n       2. Regulations authorizing the nonlethal deterrence of \n     marine mammals would be blocked, exposing fishermen to \n     prosecution under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n       3. Regulations establishing a plan to manage the Florida \n     Keys Marine Sanctuary designated by Congress in 1992 would be \n     blocked, delaying the protection of the Keys fragile marine \n     resources so essential to the local economy.\n       4. All listings and critical habitat designations under the \n     Endangered Species Act--regardless how imminent the \n     extinctions--would be halted and certain species with \n     listings pending, like Pacific salmon and steelhead trout, \n     could become extinct.\n       The moratorium would stop roughly 900 regulations, many of \n     them meritorious and important actions ordered by Congress. \n     Examples include pending regulations to foster competition in \n     the electric power industry, regulations to provide for \n     safety in nuclear facilities, and renewable energy \n     incentives. This blunderbuss approach to government policy-\n     making should not be condoned. Even regulations that protect \n     the public against ``imminent threat to human health or \n     safety or other emergency'' would be delayed while they \n     undergo prolonged review within the OMB.\n       To prevent unintended results, such as the cancelling of \n     the duck hunting season, the House adopted a series of \n     exceptions. Exceptions for good regulations turns government \n     on its head; it is the bad regulations that need to be \n     addressed. If certain regulations impose undue burdens, as \n     some do, they should be carefully judged on their individual \n     merits. Carving out exceptions to the moratorium on an ad hoc \n     basis can never replace a thoughtful legislative process, \n     with full opportunity for public debate and legislative \n     hearings.\n       We urge you to reject this dangerous and ill-conceived \n     proposal, and oppose S. 219 when it is considered on the \n     Senate floor.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Roger E. McManus,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Audubon Society,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to express the opposition of the \n     National Audubon Society to S. 219, the ``Regulatory \n     Transition Act of 1995.'' The regulatory moratorium embodied \n     in S. 219 would have serious unintended consequences that \n     would harm public health and the environment by delaying \n     important rules and creating chaos and confusion in the \n     regulatory process.\n       Because of our long-standing interest in the protection of \n     public lands, the National Audubon Society opposes the \n     Stevens Amendment to S. 219. This proposal would prohibit the \n     federal government from taking almost any regulatory action \n     that restricts ``recreational, subsistence or commercial \n     uses'' on public lands. Such regulations would qualify as \n     ``significant,'' according to this amendment, and thus would \n     be frozen under the moratorium. If this legislation passes, \n     federal agencies would be unable to manage an enormous \n     variety of mining activities, logging, off-rode vehicle use, \n     development of oil, gas and geothermal leases, and other uses \n     of public lands, all of which may cause serious harm to the \n     nation's natural resources.\n       Finally, Audubon also opposes any attempts to substitute an \n     ``alternative'' moratorium for S. 219, including a potential \n     proposal to institute a 45-day period in which Congress may \n     disapprove new regulations. Such a bill would allow special \n     interests who oppose a regulation an opportunity to defeat \n     the rule while it is being reviewed.\n       On behalf of the 550,000 members of the National Audubon \n     Society, I urge you to oppose S. 219, the regulatory \n     moratorium bill, in the interest of protecting our public \n     lands, the environment and public health and safety.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Elizabeth Raisbeck,\n\n                                         Senior Vice President for\n     Regional and Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Association of State\n\n\n                             and Territorial Health Officials,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Association of State and \n     Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), which represents the \n     public health departments in each state and U.S. territory, I \n     am writing to express our serious concerns with S.219, the \n     proposed regulatory moratorium to be considered by the Senate \n     within the next few days.\n       ASTHO applauds many senators' earnest efforts to streamline \n     the federal bureaucracy. State agencies are very familiar \n     with the burdens necessitated by collaboration with the \n     federal government. However, state health officers have \n     serious concerns with the substance of S. 219.\n       The bill makes absolutely no distinction between overly \n     burdensome regulations and those which are necessary to \n     improve the public's health. In fact, members of the \n     Government Affairs Committee acknowledged that certain \n     regulations deserved exemptions from the moratorium. Among \n     the public health-oriented regulations to be affected by the \n     moratorium are the following:\n       Food safety: federal safeguards against food poisoning \n     requiring increased sanitation in food processing.\n       Safe mammograms: uniform quality standards for mammograms \n     enforced by an inspection and certification program.\n       Child labor: strengthening provisions so that a job may not \n     interfere with a child's schooling, health or well-being.\n       Drunk driving prevention: Establishes criteria for grants \n     to support states that impose stricter drunk driving rules \n     for underage drinkers.\n       Safe drinking water: a final rule to require drinking water \n     supplies to be tested for cryptosporidium, a life-threatening \n     parasite which sickened 400,000 people in the Milwaukee area \n     recently.\n       Although the moratorium exempts regulations that would pose \n     an ``imminent health or safety danger'', this exception is \n     meaningless without a clear definition that includes ongoing \n     public health concerns, regardless of ``immanence.'' (Revised \n     language in section 5 might read: an exemption is granted to \n     a regulatory action if it is necessary because of ``the \n     reasonable expectation of endangerment of the public's \n     health'' or safety or other emergency . . .)\n       We urge you to contact your state health department before \n     voting on this bill. In their unique role as the entity \n     statutorily responsible for the health of the population, \n     they can give you an accurate perception of how the \n     moratorium will affect your state's public health efforts.\n       ASTHO's position is that this regulatory reform effort \n     requires more scrutiny before passage. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n       Sincerely,\n                                             Christopher Atchison,\n         Director, Iowa Department of Public Health and President, \n           Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Mar. 16, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Defenders of Wildlife's over \n     100,000 members, I am writing to urge that you oppose S. 219, \n     the Regulatory Transition Act of 1995.\n       As you know, this legislation would impose a fourteen-month \n     moratorium on federal regulations and virtually all actions \n     taken to restrict commercial, recreational and subsistence \n     uses on public lands. S. 219 is a blunt instrument that would \n     stop implementation of a broad range of new rules needed to \n     protect public health, the environment and wildlife. The bill \n     would also open our national parks, forests and refuges to \n     commercial exploitation and recreational excesses that could \n     have long-lasting impacts for wildlife and their habitats.\n       The Stevens amendment, added to S. 219 during consideration \n     by the Governmental Affairs Committee, would have especially \n     serious consequences for wildlife. Under this provision, \n     federal agencies would be prohibited from taking virtually \n     any action to restrict ``recreational, subsistence, or \n     commercial'' activities on the public lands. This provision \n     would have broad national impacts including:\n       Hindering federal land managers from taking quick action to \n     protect the public from fires, floods and other disasters \n     through the imposition of road closures and other access \n     restrictions (before making each closure order, a \n     Presidential exemption would be required);\n       Precluding the National Park Service from regulating \n     activities that might impair visitor enjoyment or harm \n     wildlife such as altering approved off-road vehicle areas at \n     Massachusetts' Cape Cod National Seashore to protect the \n     endangered piping plover;\n       Precluding the Fish and Wildlife Service from regulating \n     recreational activities on national wildlife refuges (an \n     action which could force refuge managers not to allow an \n     activity at all) such as regulating boating and jet-skiing to \n     protect endangered manatees at Florida's Crystal River \n     National Wildlife Refuge;\n       Precluding the Forest Service from balancing resource \n     values and uses as mandated under the National Forest \n     Management Act such as in the agency's efforts to maintain \n     viable wildlife populations in Alaska's Tongass National \n     Forest, the nation's largest national forest, through the \n     establishment of habitat conservation areas.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                      United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO/CLC,\n                                    Washington DC, March 15, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate may soon consider S. 219, The \n     Regulatory Moratorium Bill.\n       While the Committee approved several limited modifications \n     to the moratorium (i.e., any regulation dealing with ``an \n     imminent threat to human health and safety or other \n     emergency''), this legislation itself is an imminent threat \n     to the health, safety, and well-being of millions of \n     Americans who depend upon their Federal government to protect \n     the quality of the food they eat, the water they drink, the \n     medicines they take, and the health and safety of the places \n     where they work.\n       What possible purpose can such a moratorium accomplish? Is \n     there some special value to arbitrarily stopping Federal \n     agencies from issuing regulations for 9\\1/2\\ months? Or \n     [[Page S4622]] is this legislation the first step in \n     undermining the organic laws which protect Americans from \n     risks which they cannot control themselves?\n       It has become increasingly apparent in recent weeks with \n     the passage of legislation on so-called unfunded mandates, \n     paperwork reduction, regulatory reform, and private property \n     rights that the real agenda of many in Congress is not to \n     make government more efficient or effective, but inoperative. \n     It would simply stop government from regulating at all \n     wherever and whenever possible. The regulatory moratorium is \n     only the latest legislative vehicle for accomplishing this \n     political objective.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n          Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Service Employees \n     International Union's 1.1 million members, I urge you to \n     oppose S. 219--the Regulatory Moratorium. This legislative \n     proposal will not, as its proponents claim, ``reform \n     government,'' Instead, S. 219 will bring much of government \n     to a grinding halt and prevent important safeguards and \n     protections from being instituted.\n       SEIU is particularly concerned about the impact this \n     moratorium will have on our members' safety and health in \n     their workplaces. In the service and public sectors, where \n     our members work, the rates of injuries and illnesses are \n     continuing to increase with no adequate safeguards. For \n     instance, in our nation's nursing homes, the rate of worker \n     injuries now exceeds that for construction workers, having \n     doubled in the last ten years. Back injuries and other \n     crippling ergonomic injuries are the fastest growing type of \n     injury among American workers.\n       S. 219 is designed to stop immediately the progress OSHA \n     has made for worker health and safety by issuing long awaited \n     and needed standards. For example, OSHA recently issue \n     standards to protect healthcare workers from exposure to \n     blood diseases, including HIV and hepatitis B infections. \n     With the re-emergence of tuberculosis, healthcare workers and \n     patients are now at increased risk of infection. Many workers \n     and patients are contracting and dying from diseases that are \n     resistant to current antibiotics. Workers need OSHA to issue \n     standards to ensure that they are protected from these and \n     other workplace hazards and diseases. Legislating moratoria \n     on all regulations will stymie OSHA's work to address this as \n     well as other growing health epidemics.\n       SEIU believes the federal government must play a role in \n     protecting workers and their families. While we recognize the \n     need to reduce time delays and streamline lengthy processes, \n     priority. Accordingly, I urge you to oppose S. 219.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  John J. Sweeney,\n                                          International President.\n                             Minority Views\n\n\n              1. Overview: Regulatory Reform, Not a Freeze\n\n       The regulatory moratorium established by S. 219 would \n     suspend all significant proposed and final regulations, \n     policy statements, guidance and guidelines issued or to be \n     issued from November 9, 1994, through December 31, 1995--and \n     all statutory and judicial deadlines for such actions from \n     November 9, 1994, through May 1996. While comprehensive \n     regulatory reforms is clearly needed for the Federal \n     government, this legislation is not an appropriate or \n     necessary way to achieving such reform as its proponents \n     claim.\n       S. 219 as reported by our Committee is dangerous; it does \n     not distinguish between good and bad regulations. It suspends \n     regulations designed to protect public health and safety but \n     exempts regulations solely because they may ease \n     administrative requirements. It is arbitrary and reckless. \n     Based seemingly on whim, it exempts some regulations but not \n     others even though the regulations may be comparable.\n       There are indeed overly burdensome rules and regulations. \n     As the majority points out, the cumulative costs of Federal \n     regulations have risen over the past twenty years. (The \n     majority states, however, that the cost of regulations is \n     ``conservatively estimated'' at $560 billion for 1992. That \n     estimate is highly questionable and is certainly not \n     ``conservative''. A GAO review of that estimate submitted to \n     the Committee on March 8, 1995, suggests serious problems in \n     the methods used in that particular study.) Congress must be \n     sensitive to this fact. We must ensure that the laws we pass \n     meet public needs effectively and efficiently. The mounting \n     costs of regulations require that we closely examine both the \n     regulatory process and the laws that result in regulations. \n     But, we must not ignore the significant improvements that \n     regulations can bring to the daily lives of Americans. For \n     example, since the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration came into being in 1970, the workplace \n     fatality rate has dropped by over 50 percent. The Food and \n     Drug Administration has made our food and medicines safer. \n     Thanks to the work of the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     our country now enjoys cleaner air and water.\n       Clearly the work of government is not finished. The \n     government still has a vital role to play in protecting \n     public health and safety, ensuring equal opportunities in \n     education, employment and housing, promoting a healthy \n     economy, and protecting the environment. With diminishing \n     resources, the question becomes how we can provide these \n     services in a cost-effective way. The Congress and the \n     Executive Branch must work together to continue to improve \n     the way the government does business, and in fact several \n     initiatives are already underway--from government \n     streamlining and reengineering to regulatory reform.\n       Much more is at stake, however, than merely improving \n     government processes. The regulatory moratorium legislation \n     implies that Federal agencies have simply run amok by issuing \n     too many regulations and that process controls will fix \n     everything. This is just not true. As stated in one of the \n     hearings before the Committee, perhaps 80 percent of all \n     agency rules are required by law. Agencies regulate because \n     the law requires them to do so. Thurs, while the majority \n     accurately describes the increase in regulations over the \n     last twenty years, it ignores the twenty years of legislation \n     (most signed by Republican Presidents) that led to this \n     increase in rules. While nameless ``regulations'' may be a \n     convenient whipping boy, it ignores the reality of the harder \n     task of tackling individual substantive law. This is a major \n     reason that, while the majority report suggests that there is \n     universal support for a moratorium,\n      the proposal is, to the contrary, actually quite \n     controversial. More than 200 groups have opposed the \n     moratorium, including the American Heart and Lung \n     Associations, the Child Welfare League of America, the \n     Consumer Federation of America, the Epilepsy Foundation of \n     America, the Leadership Council on Civil Rights, the \n     League of Women Voters in the U.S., and the National \n     Council of Senior Citizens.\n       Finally, whatever the interests of its proponents, the \n     moratorium legislation is truly unnecessary. The President \n     has required all Federal agencies to review their regulations \n     and to report back by June 1 on those which should be \n     eliminated or changed. This report will provide the \n     information we need to reform regulations and programs \n     smartly, avoiding arbitrary and potentially grave, unintended \n     consequences. In addition, there are various regulatory \n     reform initiatives underway in this and other committees to \n     strengthen our regulatory system--risk assessment, cost-\n     benefit analysis, review of existing rules, centralized \n     regulatory review, and more. A moratorium does nothing toward \n     real regulatory reform.\n\n\n                         2. the flaws of s. 219\n\n       While proponents of the moratorium state that its purpose \n     is to improve efficiency and effectiveness and allow for \n     ``Congress to rationalize the regulatory reform process,'' \n     the moratorium is ironically an inefficient, ineffective, and \n     irrational approach. The moratorium will create delays in \n     good regulations, waste money, and create great uncertainty \n     for citizens, businesses, and others. The report speaks of \n     the regulatory process being ``ossified, unresponsive, and \n     inefficient.'' The moratorium will only add to that. For \n     example:\n       While the moratorium purports to be a neutral ``time-out'' \n     for all significant regulatory actions, the targeted rules \n     and the variety and number of exceptions are evidence that \n     the legislation is really an example in political ``ticket \n     fixing.''\n       During the Committee mark-up numerous exceptions to the \n     moratorium were accepted. Members offered twenty-two \n     amendments to S. 219. Many were to exempt specific health and \n     safety rules from the moratorium; others were to exempt broad \n     categories of regulations; two were put forth that would \n     expand the scope of the moratorium. Thirteen amendments were \n     accepted, eight rejected, and one tabled. There appeared to \n     be very little logic in what was rejected or accepted. \n     Although meat and water safety amendments were defeated, \n     others, such as exemptions related to commuter air safety, \n     railroad crossing safety, duck hunting, and lead poisoning \n     prevention, were passed. We fully supported all amendments \n     that would limit the moratorium. The inconsistency, however, \n     of the majority only heightens our concerns about the \n     legislation.\n       The bill's exemption of rules that address any ``imminent \n     threat to health and safety'' is unclear and the majority \n     report's interpretation leaves unanswered many questions \n     about what would and would not be covered. The bill would \n     permit the President, upon written request by an agency head, \n     to exempt a significant regulatory action from the moratorium \n     upon a finding that the regulatory action ``is necessary \n     because of an imminent threat to human health or safety or \n     other emergency'' (sec. 5(a)(2)(A)). For certain amendments \n     in the mark-up, the majority argued that specific exemptions \n     were unnecessary because of the broad exemption authority \n     given to the President under section 5 of the legislation. \n     The majority could not, however, provide a consistent \n     interpretation of ``imminent'' or how it would be applied.\n       For example, an amendment to exempt regulatory actions to\n        reduce pathogens in meat poultry was rejected. This \n     amendment would address rules to update inspection \n     techniques for meat and poultry and would provide a \n     safeguard against E. Coli and other contamination. Mr. \n     Rainer Mueller, whose son died from E. Coli-contaminated \n     hamburger, testified before the Committee on February 22, \n     and poignantly described the personal tragedy and ultimate \n     price paid for \n     [[Page S4623]] unsafe food. In January, the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture released a proposed Hazardous Analysis \n     Critical Control Point regulation to improve meat and poultry \n     inspection. This rule would mandate rigorous sanitation \n     requirements and scientific testing for bacteria in meat and \n     poultry processing. While the minority argued that E. Coli \n     was indeed a serious health threat, it would probably not be \n     considered ``imminent,'' and therefore it should be \n     specifically included as an exemption in the bill. Chairman \n     Roth stated, ``S. 219 depends on the use of common-sense \n     judgment by the President. `Imminent' is not intended to pose \n     on insurmountable obstacle. . . . We are actually empowering \n     the President to take appropriate action in such situations. \n     . . .''\n       Senator Glenn also proposed an amendment to exempt actions \n     by EPA to control microbial and disinfection byproduct risks, \n     such as cryptosporidium, in drinking water supplies. \n     Cryptosporidium killed over 100 people in Milwaukee, \n     Wisconsin, and made 400,000 sick. Again, this amendment was \n     rejected, with the bill's proponents citing the Presidential \n     discretion to exempt rules that deal with imminent health and \n     safety problems.\n       At the very end of the markup, however, the Committee \n     reversed this thinking by accepting an amendment to exempt \n     rules relating to lead poisoning prevention. Senator Roth \n     stated, ``I do think it fails within the exemptions [of \n     ``imminent threat''], but we are willing to accept the \n     amendment.'' This broad amendment would exclude from the \n     moratorium any action by the EPA that would protect the \n     public from exposure to lead from house paint, soil or \n     drinking water. Included in the regulations that would be \n     affected by the moratorium would be requirements that home \n     buyers and renters be informed if there are known lead \n     hazards prior to making purchases or rental decisions, and \n     that all lead abatement workers are certified to professional \n     standards of practice.\n       The majority report attempts to resolve the uncertainties \n     left from the mark-up by stating that USDA's meat inspection \n     rules should be exempted ``so long as there are no \n     accompanying extraneous requirements or arbitrary rules''. We \n     are at a loss to understand the meaning of that condition. \n     The report also states that ``this Committee does not intend \n     this exemption area to apply to OSHA's regulations \n     prescribing ergonomic protection standards,'' but that the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms rule on alcoholic \n     beverage container recall information ``could be excluded \n     from the moratorium under this provision.'' The minority is \n     simply at a loss to understand the majority's logic, or the \n     legislative record on which to base such findings.\n       The Committee's treatment of these regulations and the \n     ``imminent threat'' exemption leaves a completely \n     inconsistent record. And despite the majority's suggestion, \n     ``imminent'' will not cover most important health and safety \n     rules. The statutory language refers to ``imminent threat to \n     human health or safety or other emergency '' (emphasis \n     added). Moreover, the definition of ``imminent'' is ``likely \n     to occur at any moment, impending; threateningly or \n     menacingly near or at hand.'' Most health and safety rules, \n     while designed to addressed pressing problems, simply can not \n     be described as emergency rules in any common understanding \n     of the term.\n       What deserves to be exempted ``just in case'' and what does \n     not? There was much discussion on the intent of the \n     moratorium, and what some of the unintended consequences \n     might be. Clearly\n      the Committee decided that rules related to public health \n     (e.g., meat and poultry inspections, drinking water \n     safety) did not need to be specifically exempted ``just in \n     case'' they were not exempted under other provisions in \n     the bill. Others, including some that had potential to be \n     exempted through other language in the bill, were \n     nonetheless included as specific amendments. For example, \n     the Committee accepted an amendment to exempt any \n     regulatory action to provide compensation to Persian Gulf \n     War Veterans for disability from undiagnosed illnesses. \n     While some on the majority argued that the rule to allow \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide such \n     compensation would be already included under exemptions \n     for ``benefits'' or for ``military affairs,'' the \n     Committee decided to vote in favor of this amendment \n     ``just in case.''\n       The Committee also accepted an amendment that would exempt \n     agency action that ``establishes, modifies, opens, closes, or \n     conducts a regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, \n     or subsistence activity relating to hunting, fishing, or \n     camping.'' This amendment would ensure that duck-hunting \n     season would not be affected by the moratorium. Senator \n     Cochran stated, ``The point of the moratorium was never to \n     interfere with this kind of regulation. . . . [T]he word gets \n     all over the country that this legislation is going to have \n     this unintended consequence. So the point of the amendment is \n     to make certain that nobody can misunderstand this.''\n       In addition, the Committee decided to accept an amendment \n     that would exempt from the moratorium any clarification by \n     the Department of Transportation of existing responsibilities \n     regarding highway safety warning devices. The intent of this \n     amendment is to clarify state and local authority for \n     determining whether a railroad crossing device is necessary \n     and the installation of such a device. The Committee also \n     accepted amendments related aircraft safety, commuter plane \n     safety, and aircraft flights over national parks.\n       As stated earlier, other health and safety amendments were \n     rejected, even though it is not at all clear that they will \n     fall under the exemption for ``imminent'' health and safety \n     threats. For example, an amendment to exempt rules relating \n     to safe disposal of nuclear waste and to decontamination and \n     decomissioning standards for NRC-licensed facilities was not \n     accepted. The Chairman argued that this would qualify as an \n     ``imminent threat'' and would therefore not be needed. \n     However, it is difficult to argue that some waste, which has \n     been sitting in temporary storage for decades, now presents \n     an ``imminent'' hazard, or that standards for decontaminating \n     or decommissioning NRC-licensed sites, which have been under \n     development for some time, now fall under an ``imminent'' \n     exemption.\n       The Committee accepted as amendment to exempt any actions \n     to establish or enforce rights that prohibit discrimination \n     on the basis of race, religion, sex, age, national origin, or \n     handicapped or disability status. Directly after accepting \n     this amendment, the Committee voted to table an amendment \n     that would have exempted any actions to enforce the \n     constitutional rights of individuals, on the grounds that \n     there was ``a certain amount of ambiguity.'' These amendments \n     are similar to ones included by the Committee in the unfunded \n     mandates legislation. As Senator Levin stated, ``This is a \n     lot less ambiguous than [other amendments adopted by the \n     Committee]. These are constitutional rights, and \n     constitutional rights have been clearly defined. . . . If we \n     are going to protect statutory rights to non-discrimination, \n     . . . surely we ought to give the same protection to \n     constitutional rights that are being implemented or enforced \n     by law. . . . We should not put constitutional rights on a \n     lower level than the statutory rights.''\n       The Committee accepted an amendment to exempt any rules\n        under the Indian Self-Determination Act which had been the \n     product of regulatory negotiation. Yet, when Senator Levin \n     proposed an amendment to exclude all consensual \n     rulemakings, the amendment was rejected.\n       In addition to the indiscriminate acceptance and rejection \n     of amendments in Committee on specific rules, the majority \n     report lists rules that are meant to be covered by the \n     moratorium. In not one instance did the Committee in any of \n     its deliberations make any finding on the merits of any of \n     these rules. There may well be good arguments for stopping \n     some or all of these rules, but that is not the point. The \n     majority is creating exemptions from specific agency \n     decisions with no legislative record.\n       The juxtaposition in the majority report of these so-called \n     ``bad rules'' with what appear to be special interest ``good \n     rules'' shows how inequitable and unfair this process is. \n     There is no legislative record in the Committee to support \n     the findings, let alone discussion, of the ``good'' \n     regulations referred to in the Committee report. Consider the \n     following striking examples of rules that the majority report \n     stated should not be included in the moratorium and for which \n     the Committee has absolutely no record:\n       ``final regulations governing the alteration of producer \n     recall information on containers of distilled spirits, wine \n     and beer under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act of 1935 \n     (27 U.S.C. 105e)'';\n       ``final regulations governing trade practices under the \n     Federal Alcohol Administration Act of 1935 (26 U.S.C. 201 et \n     seq.)'' relating to ``alcohol promotional practices'';\n       ``the final rules issued by the United States Department of \n     Agriculture (and published in the Federal Register on Dec. 6, \n     1994) on meat derived from advanced separation machinery''; \n     and\n       Department of Transportation ``HM-181 standards . . . for \n     open-head fibre drums used for the transportation of \n     liquids.''\n       The retroactivity of the moratorium stops regulations that \n     have already been issued and creates unnecessary confusion. \n     The bill applies both prospectively and retroactively. It \n     would apply to all significant regulatory actions that \n     occurred as of November 9, 1994. Retroactively stopping rules \n     is extremely unfair to businesses and individuals who have \n     complied with the regulatory process, playing by the rules, \n     and counting on the finality of the regulations already in \n     effect. Many businesses have already spent money to comply \n     with regulations, or made investments based upon regulations \n     that have been issued. Retroactively suspending final rules \n     could give a competitive advantage to businesses that chose \n     to ignore regulations issued since November. Similarly, it is \n     unfair to companies that made investments to comply with \n     those regulations. Regulatory reform should be prospective \n     not retroactive; to do otherwise is wasteful and confusing.\n       Moreover, the stated purpose of the moratorium is to stop \n     regulatory actions that may benefit from future regulatory \n     reform legislation. However no regulatory reform bill that \n     the Senate is now considering would apply retroactively. So \n     rules that are final since November 9, 1994, would not be \n     covered by the regulatory analysis requirements proposed \n     under any pending reform legislation. Thus, subjecting such \n     rules to a moratorium accomplishes nothing, except to suspend \n     the effectiveness of the rule for the period of the \n     moratorium.\n       Reporting and decision requirements will completely bog \n     down\n      the President. The \n     [[Page S4624]] structure that the bill uses is cumbersome and \n     one that encourages extensive lobbying throughout the life of \n     the moratorium. In order to exempt a rule, the agency head \n     must make a determination in writing that a rule meets one of \n     the exceptions and then present that determination to the \n     President who must then review it and make a determination \n     whether or not to support the agency head's recommendation. \n     If the President agrees, he must file a notice in the Federal \n     Register, stating that a rule has been exempted from the \n     moratorium (or, it appears, whether a rule previously \n     exempted is no longer exempt). The requirement of monthly \n     reports means that the agency heads and the President will be \n     routinely lobbied by persons affected by covered rulemakings \n     as to whether or not a rulemaking should be in or exempt from \n     the moratorium. It is a nightmarish process except from the \n     perspective of a lobbyist.\n       The five-month extension for deadlines is arbitrary, \n     unnecessary, and merely draws out this problematic \n     legislation. The Committee bill includes in the moratorium \n     all deadlines that have been imposed either by a court or \n     statute with respect to a significant regulatory action. \n     Senator Levin offered an amendment to strike this section of \n     the bill so that statutory and judicial deadlines would not \n     be affected by the moratorium. Deadlines are dates that have \n     been set previously by statute--passed by both houses of \n     Congress and the President--to require that a regulatory \n     action be taken by a date certain. Congress did not set those \n     deadlines unwittingly; we set them because we were concerned \n     enough about the particular situation to place the timing for \n     action into law. The Consumer Product Safety Commission rule \n     on choking hazards of toys for small children is one such \n     example. Congress passed a law in 1994 requiring the CPSC to \n     act by July 1, 1994, on rules implementing toy labeling \n     provisions for choking hazards. Similarly, we have courts \n     which have set deadlines based on extensive legal records and \n     proceedings. As with the issue of retroactivity, inclusion of \n     deadlines in the moratorium is useless, because many of these \n     deadlines involve rules that are already final and have \n     already become effective. Regulatory reform legislation will \n     not likely affect these rules.\n       Moreover, the Committee bill establishes a new and longer \n     time period for the moratorium as it applies to deadlines. \n     The moratorium for significant regulatory actions is from \n     November 9, 1994, to December 31, 1995, but for statutory or \n     judicial deadlines, the moratorium extends for five months \n     beyond December 31st, to May 31, 1996. The majority states \n     that the purpose for the extended deadline is to avoid all \n     the deadlines coming into effect at the same time the \n     moratorium is lifted from the rulemakings. We do not see the \n     logic in this argument nor do we know of one request from an \n     agency that such an extended moratorium be provided for \n     deadlines.\n       Many of the terms and definitions are unclear and will \n     likely compound the problems of unintended consequences. For \n     example, the bill's definition of ``significant regulatory \n     action'' includes any ``statement of agency policy, guidance, \n     guidelines.'' There was no discussion by the majority of what \n     this would actually cover. Thus, when the Committee accepted \n     an amendment to include in the ``significant'' definition any \n     action that ``withdraws or restricts recreational, \n     subsistence, or commercial use'' of public land, the majority \n     was unable to explain what would or would not be included.\n       The Stevens amendment has wide-reaching, detrimental \n     effects for public lands. Meriting separate discussion is the \n     amendment by Senator Stevens that the Committee adopted \n     concerning Federal agency actions on Federal lands. The \n     Stevens amendment added to the definition of ``significant \n     regulatory action'' (and thus to coverage of the moratorium) \n     any agency action which ``withdraws or restricts \n     recreational, subsistence, or commercial use of any\n      land under the control of a Federal agency. . . .''\n       The Committee had an extensive discussion about the \n     amendment in an attempt to fully understand its scope. While \n     there was considerable uncertainty during the mark-up as to \n     the actual effect of the amendment, subsequent review has \n     demonstrated that the scope of the amendment is sweeping and \n     would stop not only regulatory actions but virtually all \n     enforcement of regulations on Federal lands. That means that \n     National Park Service employees would not be able to carry \n     out basic management responsibilities in our national parks. \n     The Park Service would not be able to prevent hot rods from \n     racing in national parks, restrict access to fragile \n     archaeological sites, or close dangerous passes on snow-\n     covered peaks. As the National Parks and Conservation \n     Association has said, ``This prohibition against rulemaking \n     effectively eliminates the abilities of the Bureau of Land \n     Management, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service and the Forest Service to manage federal lands for \n     resource protection.'' According to the Wilderness Society, \n     ``This sweeping amendment would undermine fundamental \n     protections for our national parks, national wildlife \n     refuges, national forests, and all other public lands.'' The \n     same strong point has been made by other conservation and \n     environmental groups. The Committee's adoption of the Stevens \n     Amendment demonstrates the lack of understanding the \n     Committee had with respect to the full consequences of its \n     actions on this bill.\n                             3. conclusion\n\n       The Committee hearing on February 22, 1995, and the mark-up \n     on March 7 and 9, 1995, highlighted many problems with the \n     moratorium proposal. The majority report only compounds these \n     issues. In the views above we have again discussed many of \n     these issues. Unfortunately, the outlined problems involve \n     only those examples that we know of now. We believe there \n     could well be many other important rules that would be \n     inadvertently or otherwise inappropriately be stopped. The \n     public will be the victims of such arbitrary congressional \n     action. The moratorium is a bad idea.\n       There are most probably many rules that should be examined \n     and even rescinded. We would support any reasonable effort to \n     target specific regulatory problem areas--again, that is what \n     the President is currently doing. We cannot, however, support \n     an arbitrary, across-the-board freeze. We should fix the \n     regulatory process, we should not freeze it and the benefits \n     that flow from it.\n     John Glenn.\n     Sam Nunn.\n     Carl Levin.\n     David Pryor.\n     Joseph I.

Let me say on the issue of what rules might be covered by \nthe moratorium: The reported Senate bill covers significant rules and \nrelated statements or actions, as well as any wetlands determinations, \nand any actions--not just rules--that affect the use of public land. \nThe list of rules that I am submitting for the Record only covers the \ncategory of ``significant'' rules--those having an annual impact on the \neconomy of over $100 million, or are otherwise determined to be of \nmajor importance. This is list has 58 entries.\n  I have no idea how many wetlands determinations there might be during \nthe moratorium. I also doubt that anyone could come up with a reliable \nlist of all the actions that might be taken by any Federal agency \nrelating to public lands--no trail closing, maybe no closing picnic \nareas at night, or restricting the number of people who can climb up \nthe Statue of Liberty. I do not know.\n  But this is not all. In addition to the Senate bill, we must remember \nthat the House-passed bill covers all rules, significant or \ninsignificant. This could total over 4,000 a year, if you include every \nlittle rule. I saw one list, just of important agency rules that might \nbe covered by the House bill, and it had over 147 entries.\n  The thought of simply stopping government decisions, to show that we \nare serious about regulatory reform, if just about the dumbest thing \nCongress could do. Let us reform the regulatory process, not freeze it. \nLet us show the American people that we are doing our job, not that we \nare out to lunch.\n\n\n                       3. Real Regulatory Reform\n\n  In addition to understanding the moratorium, it is also very \nimportant to understand the status of regulatory reform. Again, \naccording to the Governmental Affairs Committee's majority report, the \nsupporters of the moratorium have said that ``the purpose of the \ntemporary moratorium is to give Congress enough time to pass \nlegislation to comprehensively change the regulatory process.''\n  In addition to our committee's hearing on the moratorium, Chairman \nRoth held regulatory reform hearings on February 8, 15, and March 8. \nThe result was the committee's markup last Thursday, March 23, 1995, in \nwhich we considered, amended, and voted favorably on a bill--15 to 0. \nEvery member of the committee, Democrat and Republican, voted to report \nout a real tough, regulatory reform bill.\n  We should be back working on the committee report right now, but here \nwe are--debating the moratorium--wasting time on damage control, when \nwe could be working on real reform.\n  We in the Governmental Affairs Committee are, of course, not alone in \nthe regulatory reform effort. The majority leader's bill--S. 343--will \nprobably be marked up this week by the Judiciary Committee. They, too, \nhave had several hearings.\n  The Energy Committee is also ready to mark up a bill that will, I \nbelieve, provide Government-wide reform.\n  When one consider the ongoing agency review of current rules, with a \nreport due to the President by June 1, and these regulatory reform \nbills that should all be ready to come to the floor within a matter of \na few weeks, there simply is no need for the moratorium--even if one \ncould ever explain how and why it was needed in the first place.\n  Let us get on with the business of governing and of real reform. Let \nus leave the ill-conceived moratorium where it belongs--in the museum \nof stupid ideas.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if anyone could disagree with the \nSenator from Nevada when he talks about the intrusion of rules and \nregulations on our society. I agree with him on that.\n  We have all had many people come up to us at public events back in \nour States and talk about how they are being impacted by rules and \nregulations, that they think are nonsensical and really defy any \nrationality. I have agreed with them.\n  But that is not the issue here. We all favor regulatory reform. We \npassed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, by unanimous vote of \nthat committee--Democrat and Republican--last week, a regulatory reform \nbill, which has within it a legislative veto provision. There are some \ndifferences between that and this proposal today. But as I have already \nsaid, my basic problem goes even more deeply than just the differences \nbetween these two bills. The House-passed moratorium bill throws out \nthe baby with bath water. It throws out the good rules with the bad, \nand needlessly.\n  The Senator from Nevada was talking of the alternative, about how \nmany of these rules should come back to us, instead. Do you know why we \nhave so many regulations that are nonsensical now? We had testimony \nthat 80 percent of the rules and regulations--80 percent of the rules \nand regulations--are written because we specifically required them to \nbe written in legislation. We required them to write them. If there are \nexcesses, should they come back for review? Yes, and I do not quarrel \nwith that. I support a legislative veto. There is no problem with that. \nBut I do not think a moratorium that just throws out the good with the \nbad makes any sense at all. And I can tell you again what things will \nbe affected by this.\n  We had testimony in committee by Rainer Mueller, and we had a press \nconference this morning with Nancy Donley, both of whom had lost \nchildren to E. coli bacteria. The USDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nhas new rules that have been proposed that make new inspections for \nmeat that would prevent that happening. Here are people who have \nactually lost children, and we are talking about putting in a \nmoratorium that would stop a rule that might save other families from \nhaving to go through that same kind of tragedy.\n  We are talking about final rules on airline safety. There is probably \nnot a person in this Chamber who has not flown on an airline. We have \nnew rules that are being promulgated to take care of things such as \nairline crew assignments; standardization of aircraft rules; we have \nair worthiness of aircraft engines. These are things that involve the \nsafety of the American public. We are talking about saying we can put a \nmoratorium on things like that just because we want to throw a broad \nnet, but we are going to catch all these things.\n  We have had some bad rules and regulations--I am the first one to say \nthat here--and we ought to correct those. But to say at the same time \nthat we are going to throw out these things that are safety and health \nmatters for the people of this country to get the few bad regulations, \nI just do not think makes any sense.\n  Why do I bring it up when the Senator from Nevada is discussing a 45-\nday hold over? Because I know the original sponsors of this legislation \nwant the same bill the House passed, which is far more draconian and \nthrows out most everything. That is what they passed over in the House.\n  We debated this bill in committee and had many amendments, some were \naccepted, many were rejected. The bill was then reported out of \ncommittee. Now we have see the fallback position, that rather than \nbringing up that straight moratorium here on the floor, we will have a \n45-day review, almost a 45-day moratorium. But this 45-day idea is what \nwould go to conference with the House on the far more draconian bill \nthat they already have passed over there.\n  What happens when you get to conference with the House? I do not \nknow. But I know the tendency will be, since the original intent of the \nsponsors here in the Senate was to do what the House has already done, \nprobably to want to compromise in the direction of the House. That is \nwhat concerns me very, very much.\n  The bill as proposed here is one that would affect all rules, as I \nunderstand it. It is retroactive to November 9. As I also understand \nit, any Member can call up a rule for review.\n  Now, the Governmental Affairs Committee has passed out a regulatory \nreform bill, a comprehensive regulatory reform bill that covers this \nidea of a legislative veto in that legislation. But what we do with \nthat legislative veto is we make it apply to major rules and make it \nprospective so it does not go back and undo things that business, \nindustry, and communities already are planning for. In that legislation \nwe provided that it would take a petition \n[[Page S4626]] by 30 Members to bring a rule back up for consideration.\n  Now, I thought that was probably a little high. I thought we did not \nneed 30. I am sure we could debate that on the Senate floor when that \nlegislation comes out. Whether we need 10 Members on a petition or some \nother number, we do need a number of Senators that say, ``Yes, this is \nbad, so we should reconsider that rule or that regulation, and bring \nthat back up here on the floor.''\n  We cannot have it where just one Member can call something up and \nsay, ``This affects my State and I disagree,'' although it might be \nsomething that is agreeable for all the rest of the whole United \nStates. I do not think we want to waste our time on things like that.\n  Much has been made out of the fact that the President could exempt \nimminent health and safety matters. In committee, I challenged this \ntime after time after time to please have the sponsors define \n``imminent.'' They could not do that. ``Imminent\" means something, \naccording to Webster's dictionary, that will happen right away--now. It \nis impending, right now. That would not cover such things as aircraft \nsafety or airworthiness of airline engines. These are design things. \nThey are new criteria. Nothing is imminent--even though it improves \nsafety of the aircraft involved or the crew training involved. We do \nnot expect the airplane to go down within hours or not complete the \nflight. But the overall safety of airlines is of major significance. \nWhy should things like that ever be held up for a moratorium? Why \nshould we have to debate about what is or is not ``imminent?\"\n  This is just one problem with the moratorium. And now our attention \nis turned to the 45-day legislative veto. But what we really should be \ndoing, instead of piecemealing this effort, is to deal with the whole \nregulatory reform problem.\n  Again, that is the legislation that we voted out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee just last week. Final reports on that will be written \nand then we would be able to bring that up on the floor and debate the \nwhole regulatory reform process, including a legislative veto.\n  The danger of this one being brought up separately is that it will go \nover and be conferenced with the House, as I understand what is being \nproposed here. That means we are up against the House with their \ncomplete moratorium, going clear back to shortly after the election \nlast fall. That is far more draconian. And it lasts a year. It lasts \nuntil the ends of this year.\n  If our conferees on the bill would give in to some of the House \nprovisions, it means we really are placing Americans, a far greater \nnumber of Americans, at risk for this year. That is, if that is what \nwas agreed to.\n  I repeat, I do not disagree with the legislative veto. We are the \nones that caused much of the problem. Why should we not go back on \nmajor rules and reconsider those where we believe people over in the \nagencies really have gone too far, where they have not sufficiently \nreflected the will of the Congress.\n  I do not see why we cannot bring up the Regulatory Reform Act of \nwhich a legislative veto is a part, not just pick this out separately \nso that it can now go to conference with the House. That is the danger \nin this, as I see it.\n  Mr. President, so far there have been only about 127 examples that \nhave come out of the different agencies, 127 examples that we were able \nto get on the short basis of items that would be held up, that I felt, \nand many other Members on our committee and the administration felt, \nwere things that should not have a moratorium applied to them.\n  But is that a complete list? No. We do not even know at this point \nwhat other E. coli situations or cryptosporidium situations may exist \nout there across this country, because we have not yet had a complete \nreview of all the rules and regulations. That is ongoing right now.\n  President Clinton issued a directive to all the departments and \nagencies and said, ``Scan all the rules and regulations, go through \nthem all, see which ones are overbearing and too intrusive, which ones \nshould be taken out, which ones should be modified, and give me a \ncomplete list of all those, a complete review of all rules and \nregulations across Government.'' Now that is in the process. It is in \nthe process now. It is not a 2- or 3-year study. It is not something \nthat goes on into the future. We get it by June 1.\n  June 1, it turns out, is only 30 working days from now. If you look \nat the calendar and count out the Easter break and what we planned \nthere, June 1 is just 30 working days from right now. I counted it up \nthis morning on the calendar myself, just to see what time we would \nhave on this.\n  The administration has guaranteed us repeatedly, the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, Sally Katzen, has guaranteed us we \nare going to have that list by the 1st of June. Why go ahead and do a \npartial job of looking into rules and regulations when we have a \ncomplete list that is going to be available for us on the 1st of June? \nDo you know how many significant rules, those that have a $100 million \nimpact or above, are made every year in this country? Between 800 and \n900; that was the testimony we had in committee. So when we have come \nup just with 127 rules that would be particularly affected by \nmoratorium legislation, we are just nibbling around the edges. They are \ngoing through, not only those 800 to 900 over the last year or so, but \nthe 800 to 900 per year that passed back for a long time. There are \ngoing to be several thousands of these rules that will be reviewed. We \nwill get recommendations. Then we can take action on these things.\n  We can take action on some we separate out, some we may not agree \nwith the administration about. I may disagree with them on a lot of \nthem and be willing to go back and repass those things, or if necessary \nsend them back to committee here to be reconsidered, if that is what is \nnecessary. I am that dedicated to getting to real, honest-to-goodness \nregulatory reform. We need that. I support it. I worked on it the last \n3 years in the Governmental Affairs Committee when I was still \nchairman, and I am still working on it now.\n  Our new committee chairman, Senator Roth, has picked this up and he \nis pushing regulatory reform, to his everlasting credit. I complimented \nhim the other day in public and will do so here on the floor again \ntoday. He really has been a champion in pushing regulatory reform. And \nwhat we voted out last week is an excellent bill. It is a tough \nregulatory bill. It is not draconian; it is very realistic. That is \nwhat we should be doing, considering regulatory reform on that basis, \nand not just picking out a little moratorium portion of this or a \nlegislative veto portion of that for consideration separately. We have \nat hand a bill through which we can really make major regulatory \nreform, which is what we are all after.\n  As I started my comments, we have all heard over and over again the \nunhappiness of our people back home, of business and industry and farms \nand just individuals, impacted in their daily lives by rules and \nregulations that should never be out there.\n  I heard somebody berating the Clinton administration on this a couple \nof days ago. That is not the problem. The rules and regulations have \nbeen building up for the last 10 years or more. You can see a huge \nincrease in regulations--really a bipartisan increase--thinking about \nthe laws that led to those rules. So I look forward to having \nbipartisan solutions to this problem, also. I think we do it by taking \na broad approach to regulatory reform, of which legislative review is \none part of that legislation, and if the 45-day legislative veto would \napply prospectively, I would support that.\n  I know my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, who \nhas worked very hard on regulatory reform on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, probably is as expert in this area as anyone we have in the \nSenate--I know he favors that, and I do, too. I see nothing wrong with \nthat.\n  I do not like it going back. I do not like it retroactive.\n  I hope, Mr. President, we could get together, perhaps, and work this \nout so we get leadership to bring up the regulatory reform package, the \ntotal bill of which something like this is a part, and bring it up at a \nvery early date. If we can do that, then we will have done a great \nservice for this country. We will have gone a long ways toward telling \npeople that, yes, we know the regulatory impact has been too heavy. We \nare doing something about it.\n  [[Page S4627]] But at the same time, we should not be saying that we \nare going to throw out important health and safety rules. And why would \neven think of doing that? Not even because we disagree with all those \nrules and regulations, but because we are just saying everything should \ngo out, even the good--this makes no sense.\n  That is what I disagree with on a moratorium, and what I disagree \nwith strongly on the approach the House took. If we want to see who is \nat fault with regulations into the future, then, as I said earlier, we \nlook in the mirror. Let's stop this. Let's be a part of fixing the \nprocess. Let's not make it worse.\n  Mr. President, I think we are on limited time--parliamentary inquiry; \nare we on limited time this morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is limited.\n  Mr. GLENN. How is time divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three hours was accorded to each side for \ntoday.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington \nPost editorial dated March 26, 1995, entitled ``Good Move on \nRegulation,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 26, 1995]\n\n                        Good Move on Regulation\n\n       The United States has become an overregulated society. It \n     is not just the volume or even the cost of regulation that is \n     the problem, but the haphazard pattern--a lack of proportion. \n     The government too often seems to be battling major and minor \n     risks, widespread and narrow, real and negligible, with equal \n     zeal. The underlying statutes are not a coherent body of law \n     but a kind of archeological pile, each layer a reflection of \n     the headlines and political impulses of its day. The \n     excessive regulations discredit the essential. Too little \n     attention is paid to the cost of the whole and the relation \n     of cost to benefit.\n       The election results last November at least in some degree \n     reflected resentment and impatience about this--and rightly \n     so. The Republican-led Congress so understood and set about \n     to fix this system, which unlike some things the government \n     tries to fix, clearly is ``broke.'' The trick is to make sure \n     the fix will itself be the right one, and one that will not \n     end up killing good regulation along with bad.\n       The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last week \n     unanimously reported out a bipartisan regulatory reform bill \n     the likely effect of which would be to improve the process \n     rather than mangle it. It's a vast improvement over the \n     merely anti-regulatory legislation too hastily passed several \n     weeks ago by the House, as well as various rival bills in the \n     Senate, including a proposal by majority leader Bob Dole. ``A \n     restoration of common sense,'' Sen. William Cohen, a member \n     of the governmental affairs committee, called the bill, and \n     he is right.\n       The House voted both to impose a clumsy retroactive freeze \n     on federal regulatory activity and to standardize and weaken \n     in a single stroke the carefully worked out, separate \n     regulatory standards in a broad array of health and safety \n     and environmental legislation. The Senate committee bill \n     would do neither of those things. Rather, it would require \n     cost-benefit and other studies of all new major regulations \n     and the regulatory process generally. Some of these are \n     already done by executive order, others not.\n       With the studies as part of the basis for judgment, all \n     major new regulations would then be submitted to Congress. \n     The two houses together would have a set period in which to \n     disapprove them; a resolution of disapproval would have to be \n     signed and could be vetoed by the president. Some advocacy \n     groups complain that this would politicize and harm the \n     regulatory process. We think that, to the contrary, it would \n     serve to legitimize and strengthen regulations once issued by \n     putting them on a sounder political footing. Congress, under \n     the present dispensation, can have it both ways. It passes \n     broad regulatory statutes with laudable goals--clean air, \n     clean water, pure food and drugs--and then denounces as \n     heavy-handed and too costly the resulting regulations. Given \n     a legislative veto, it would have to take responsibility for \n     the fruits of its own handiwork. If some regulations were \n     then struck down before they could take effect, it would \n     finally be up to the voters to decide whether that was good \n     or bad.\n       The bill would also require agencies to do cost-benefit \n     analyses and risk assessments of existing major regulations \n     over a number of years; to do comparative risk analyses in \n     order to make sure that within their purviews they were \n     attacking the greatest risks first; and to take part in the \n     compilation of a ``regulatory accounting'' every two years, \n     setting forth the benefits and compliance costs of \n     regulations government-wide. The idea is to give Congress and \n     the executive branch alike a better basis than they have now \n     on which to make regulatory policy.\n       The measure wouldn't solve all regulatory excess. But it \n     would put the regulatory process on a steadier and more \n     rational footing, and expose regulatory decisions to the \n     political process early on and in a healthy way. It's a good \n     framework, and we hope Mr. Dole and the Senate stick to \n     something like it.\n                     Privilege Of The Floor--S. 219\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent also that during \nthe consideration of S. 219, Jenny Craig of my staff be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield me a few minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator such time as he desires.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure there is no \nmisunderstanding about the substitute. We do not intend to throw the \nbaby out with the bath water, but I think what we have is a reasonable \nframework to review all regulations promulgated by Federal agencies. \nThis is not a blanket. We can pick and choose those that we feel are \nappropriately reviewable. It saves those regulations, which will be the \nvast majority of them, and those which are bad we can take a look at.\n  I repeat, one of the reasons I like this approach so much is it will \nhave regulators be more cautious in the regulations that they \npromulgate. We know, following the Chadha decision, that regulators \nhave said they do not care what we think of the regulations they \npromulgate; there is nothing we can do about it. This substitute will \nno longer allow bureaucrats to say that to Congress. If they are in \nvery tight with their President, and we review those regulations and \nturn them down and the President wants to veto them, then it is up to \nus as a legislative body to see if we can get a two-thirds vote to \noverride the veto. I would rather not have it that way, but that is \nwhat we have to have in order to work within the confines of the Chadha \ndecision.\n  We have here a substitute that is on all fours--totally and \nirrevocably constitutional. I was necessarily off the floor for a \nminute, but I did understand that my friend from Ohio, the senior \nSenator from Ohio, indicated that E. coli, the disease that swept this \ncountry that was so difficult--if this were, in effect, the substitute, \nthey could not issue such a regulation to deal with that disease. That \nis not true. We specifically have an exemption in our substitute that \nwould allow matters of public health and safety to go forward.\n  There is also an argument that has been propounded that this \nlegislation, the substitute, is a broad net that will kill a large \nnumber of regulations just to get at a few bad ones.\n  I hope that is not the case. But I hope, in reverse order, if there \nare a large number of bad regulations, that they will not be proposed.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this Senator does not like the underlying \nlegislation. That is why I am so much in support of the substitute. I \nbelieve the substitute is good legislation. I believe it is something \nthat will make this body proud. I believe it is something that the \nAmerican public wants. The American public does not want us to stop all \nregulations. There are some good regulations. I went over some of them. \nWe know the Food and Drug Administration does some good work, and they \nhave gotten better in recent years.\n  So I want the substitute passed. I want it passed by an overwhelming \nmajority so that when we go to conference with the House, we will have \na strong position within which to negotiate. Mr. President, I hope that \nthis legislation, this substitute, that has been offered by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and myself, will be supported by a large bipartisan vote. \nThis legislation is among the best that I think I have ever worked on. \nIt answers a significant problem that big business faces, that small \nbusiness faces, and the American public generally feels; that is, too \nmuch regulation.\n  Interestingly, as I have indicated, all business is not opposed to \nregulation. We know there is a basis for regulation. And, in fact, I \nserved as the chairman of the toxic subcommittee for 4 years, and would \nhave this year but for the fact that the Republicans took control of \nthe Senate. We did, I think, some very good work there. We dealt with \nall kinds of toxic substances. But \n[[Page S4628]] one of the groups I worked with that was continually \nbefore my subcommittee was the Chemical Manufacturers Association as we \ndealt with things they deal with.\n  There is an interesting article in the Atlanta Journal of January 11 \nthat talks about the Chemical Manufacturers Association. I was \nsurprised to read this. The Chemical Manufacturers Association, which \nhas more than 180 members, including large companies like Dow, Du Pont, \nand Monsanto, said:\n\n       We are not necessarily in favor of revolutionizing how we \n     approach regulations because some of them, according to \n     Chemical Manufacturers, are good.\n\n  The article says:\n\n       The association supports regulatory reform but it also \n     sounds downright worried that some of the extremist, anti-\n     environmental rhetoric now coming out of Congress will lead \n     to deregulation schemes that will get out of control and go \n     too far.\n\n  That is a quote from an official of the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation.\n  Says Fred Webber, president of the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation, from the same article:\n\n       Reform, let me say this very clearly, is not the same as \n     repeal. The current system of . . . regulations has \n     accomplished a great deal over the past quarter of a century. \n     We do not want to undo that success, and we do not want to \n     tolerate any retreat from our commitment of protecting the \n     people and the environment.\n\n  I could not say it any better. That is also how I feel. What we are \ncharged to do in this body is to make what we have better. That is what \nthis substitute does. It does not repeal all regulations. It does not \nsay we are not going to have any more regulations. It is not a blanket \nmoratorium. What it says is that in the future, bureaucrat, be careful \nwhat you do because we are watching, and we have a regulatory veto \nscheme that meets the constitutional requirements of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nwill understand what is going on here. We want to pass a bipartisan \nbill. The Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Nevada are \nsponsoring a substitute amendment that we believe should have unanimous \nsupport, if not heavy support. It is a commonsense way to approach \nregulatory reform. It is not regulatory repeal. I hope that my friends \non this side of the aisle will join in this venture to improve the way \nregulations are handled in this country.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nReid from Nevada, for his comments, and I would like to respond briefly \nto some of the statements that were made by my friend and colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator Glenn.\n  I think the thrust of what I heard in his comments was that he was \nafraid, if we pass this and go to conference, that we might have that \nterrible House bill. Let me just state it is my intention, if we are \nsuccessful in passing this bill--and I expect that we will be \nsuccessful in passing this bill--to do everything I can do to get the \nHouse to concur with the Senate position. I think the Senate bill, I \ntell my friend from Ohio--I was a sponsor of both--that this substitute \nis preferable to the moratorium legislation reported by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I think substitute is a better \napproach. Let me tell my friend and colleague from Ohio that, one, the \nsubstitute is permanent. The House bill and the Senate bill, the one \nthat was reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, are \ntemporary moratoriums. Those will expire as soon as we pass a \ncomprehensive regulatory reform bill. That may be a couple of months.\n  So the temporary moratorium bill has received a lot of attention and \na lot of partisan bickering, and there may be a very short period of \ntime that it would be in effect, even if it did pass and even if it \nsurvived a Presidential veto, both of which are in doubt somewhat. The \nPresident indicated he would veto it. The House did not have quite the \nvotes to override the veto. I do not think we would have the votes to \noverride the veto in the Senate. I do not mind sending the bill to the \nPresident and letting him veto it. However, that is not my intention. I \nwould like to pass significant regulatory relief regulation this year \nand have the President sign it.\n  I think the substitute that Senator Reid and I are proposing will do \nthat. I think the President will sign it. I see no reason why he will \nnot sign it. I am interested in passing the bill that Senator Reid and \nI are offering, the 45-day congressional review substitute which will \nbe permanent law. So, whereas the temporary moratorium may succeed, if \nit were successful, in delaying some regulations for a few months, that \ntime period would soon be gone and you would have nothing. This would \nbe permanent law. This would be a significant response. This would give \nreal energy, I think, for Members of Congress to review the regulators \nand to hold them accountable.\n  So I tell my friend and colleague from Ohio that, if I should be \nappointed a conferee, I would work very energetically to see that the \nSenate's position would prevail. I am very familiar with both pieces of \nlegislation. I have heard my colleague from Ohio mention the underlying \nbill, the one reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nhe also referred to the House bill as a terrible bill and one that \nwould throw out all regulations and cut out all of these rules and \nregulations whether they are good or bad. I disagree with that \ninterpretation.\n  Looking at the bill as reported, S. 219, it has all kinds exemptions. \nOne of the reasons I am not as excited about S. 219 as reported is \nbecause we have so many exemptions. I question how effective it would \nbe. There are many regulations that will be covered by these \nexemptions. We have exemptions for imminent threat to human health and \nsafety and other emergencies. I have heard E. coli mentioned. I have \nheard problems about drinking water. I have heard of air traffic \nproblems or flight safety.\n  I think that the President, under the bill reported out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and also by the House, could exempt all \nof the rules mentioned previously by my colleague from Ohio. However, \nagain, I am not here to debate S. 219 as reported. I am offering a \nsubstitute to it. But I think it is important to show for the record \nthat a lot of the scare tactics used against the House-passed bill and \nthe Senate bill that passed the Governmental Affairs Committee are not \nas egregious, not as outlandish, and not as heartless as some people \nwould indicate.\n  S. 219 as reported out of committee also has exemptions for a \nregulation which has as its purpose the enforcement of criminal law or \na regulation that has as its principal effect fostering economic \ngrowth, repealing, narrowing, streamlining the regulation and \nadministrative process or otherwise reducing regulatory burdens. I have \nheard some people, including the President of the United States, say \nthe moratorium bill would throw out all regulations, good ones and bad \nones. As I have stated, there are clearly exceptions for good \nregulations.\n  We also have an exception for routine administrative actions and \nregulations related to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or \ncontracts. I mention that one because the President of the United \nStates said that if this moratorium bill is adopted, we will not be \nable to bury people in Arlington National Cemetery or that we would not \nbe able to have duck hunting, both of which are routine administrative \nactions.\n  I just mention that. I am not here to defend this bill. I look at all \nthese eight exemptions. The committee added a couple of others. My \npoint being there are lots of exemptions. The President would probably \nexempt a great number of regulations under these. In addition, he would \nprobably veto the moratorium legislation. So my thought is why not do \nsomething that we can pass? Why not do something that the President can \nsign? Why not do something that would not be temporary? Why not do \nsomething that would have, I believe, a long-lasting impact in reducing \nthe impact of expensive, unnecessary regulations?\n  There are thousands of potential regulations. How many would Congress \nmove on? On how many would Congress pass a resolution of disapproval? \nProbably only a few. But at least it would make Congress responsible.\n  I wonder how many Members of Congress have said, well, we passed the \nlaw--for example the Americans With \n[[Page S4629]] Disabilities Act or the Clean Air Act or maybe it was \nsome other very well-intentioned bill--and then a Member of Congress is \nflabbergasted to find out, that a city in your State is no longer in \ncompliance with the Clean Air Act, and therefore the city is not able \nto accept a new plant or new factory because of clean air constraints. \nThe member would say I did not know. Where did this happen? The Member \nwould be told it happened as a result of the Clean Air Act. How did \nthat happen? It happened as a result of regulations that were just \nissued and, therefore, the city in your State is in nonattainment. \nWell, it came from regulations implementing the clean air bill. On and \non, people kind of washing their hands.\n  Well, the legislation was well-intended, it had good intentions, but \nnow the regulations have become so cumbersome, so expensive, so \nCongress is kind of washing its hands. The regulators say, no, Congress \nsaid so. And now they are implementing hundreds and maybe thousands of \npages of regulations. My point is that Congress should be more \naccountable. Congress should hold the regulators accountable. So of all \nthe thousands of regulations that are in process, we are saying \nCongress should have a 45-day expedited procedure where we can stop \nthem if we think they are egregious or if we disagree with their \nintent.\n  I am pleased that the more comprehensive bill that Senator Glenn \nalluded to that passed the Governmental Affairs Committee, that will \nlikely be taken up on the Senate floor sometime in May, did call for \ncongressional review. But I might mention, as I understand the \nlegislation approved by the Governmental Affairs Committee, the 45-day \nreview provision applies only to significant regulations. Why should we \nlimit this Congress to only review significant regulations? If we want \nto repeal a regulation--and under our bill it takes a majority of both \nHouses to pass it--we should have that opportunity.\n  Again, of the thousands of regulations, my guess is we will only do a \nfew, but at least we will have the opportunity to hold bureaucrats \naccountable whether it is a small regulation or large regulation.\n  I think the proposal that we have, the substitute that we have is a \ncommonsense approach. It is not outlandish. I will just again repeat to \nmy friend and colleague, my intentions would be to try to convince our \ncolleagues in the House that this approach achieves the same objective \nthey are trying to achieve in the House on limiting unwarranted \nregulation and it is something we can pass and it is something we \nshould pass and hopefully get the House to recede to the Senate when we \ngo to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma brings up the key phrase that we debated \nlong and hard in the Governmental Affairs Committee. Let me read from \nour minority report of that bill: The bill's exemption of rules that \naddresses any ``imminent threat to health and safety'' is unclear and \nthe majority report's interpretation leaves unanswered many questions \nabout what would and would not be covered. The bill would permit the \nPresident, upon written request by an agency head, to exempt a \nsignificant regulatory action from the moratorium upon a finding that \nthe regulatory action ``is necessary because of an imminent threat to \nhuman health or safety or other emergency.''\n  That is the same language that is in the proposal by my distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma that we are considering here.\n  For certain amendments in the markup, the majority argued that \nspecific exemptions were unnecessary because of the broad exemption \nauthority given to the President under section 5 of the legislation. \nThe majority could not, however, provide a consistent interpretation of \n``imminent'' or how it would be applied.\n  Now, let me tell you what we did. In committee, I repeatedly asked \nfor a definition of ``imminent.'' I even got the definition out of \nWebster's, which said ``impending, immediate,'' and so on. It would not \ncover such things as airline safety, even though we know those rules \nand regulations should not be held up; there are no reasons why they \nshould be held up.\n  But of more immediate importance this morning is this. I would ask my \ndistinguished colleague from Oklahoma to listen to what I proposed in \ncommittee. I proposed in committee the E. coli prevention standards \nthat he referred to, that we make an exemption for them; E. coli is a \nthreat. We know that. We have had deaths from it. The amendment was \nvoted down.\n  I brought up an amendment on cryptosporidium. It killed 100 people up \nin Wisconsin, and 400,000 fell ill. Once again, it was voted down as \nnot being something that should be exempted. They were against it. Now, \nwith that being the situation, I do not know what can be classified as \nimminent health and safety threats. While people have died, I'm not \nsure it would qualify as an ``imminent threat'' and therefore covered \nunder that exemption.\n  So that is the reason I do not understand quite what we are doing. I \nappreciate the statement by my colleague from Oklahoma that he wants to \nconvince the House that their bill is bad and that this one would be \nbetter. I certainly take him at his word on that.\n  Why not consider this then? Consider the proposal today out from \nunder the umbrella of what the House has done so that we will not have \nthe moratorium as a conferenceable item. Why not have the legislative \nveto as a separate bill? Why not go to the underlying bill here, S. \n219, and not have an amendment? Instead, we could strike the moratorium \nand consider just the legislative veto amendment by itself, not as \nsomething that will go to conference with the House.\n  I do not know whether my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma would \nbe willing to do that or not, but I have pointed out that the Nickles-\nReid substitute, I felt, was perhaps an attempt to avoid Senate debate \nof the amendment on the underlying regulatory moratorium. If the \nobjective is to go to conference with the House, which has passed a \ndraconian--and I would repeat that word, which my distinguished \ncolleague repeated himself a moment ago quoting me--regulatory \nmoratorium bill, the result of the conference, when it comes back to \nus, would be unamendable.\n  Now, maybe I am wrong about this as being their strategy. Perhaps I \nam too suspicious. Maybe that is not the purpose of the substitute. \nMaybe the sponsors really just intended to use S. 219 as a convenient \nvehicle for the content of their amendment.\n  If that is the purpose, they need only to wait until a comprehensive \nregulatory reform bill, such as S. 343 or S. 291, comes to the floor, \nas they will, since both bills have been reported out by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and both contain provisions for \nlegislative veto of major regulations.\n  I do not know why we cannot wait until S. 343 or S. 291 comes to the \nfloor. Maybe they just want their amendment to be considered now for \nother reasons. I think there would be an easy way to test whether the \npurpose of this amendment is to get it to a moratorium on regulations \nin a conference with the House or whether they just want their \namendment considered as a stand-alone proposal. The test is whether \nthere will be an objection to consider the substitute as a stand-alone \nbill.\n  If I made a unanimous consent request to consider the amendment as a \nstand-alone bill, I do not know what the response would be on the other \nside. But that would take away any opportunity as to what the intent of \nthis legislation is.\n  I will not proceed with it at this point, but if I asked for \nunanimous consent--I am not asking for it formally now--but if I ask \nunanimous consent that the Nickles-Reid substitute amendment to S. 219 \nbe sent to the desk as a stand-alone bill and that it be given \nimmediate consideration, and that S. 219 be put aside indefinitely or \nuntil the Senate takes up and disposes of either S. 343 or S. 291, or \nother similar bills on comprehensive regulatory reform, would the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma object to that? If he would, I ask \nwhy.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I apologize. I was in another conference.\n  But if the thrust of the Senator's question was would I object to \nhaving a unanimous consent request that we \n[[Page S4630]] have this as a freestanding bill instead of S. 219----\n  Mr. GLENN. The reason I asked is because the Senator says he wants to \ngo to conference with the House and does not plan, of course, to give \nin to the moratorium in the House, even though he proposed the same \nthing originally. Then, if the intent is just to get the legislative \nveto, which we have already voted out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in the regulatory reform bills, why not set S. 219 aside? We \nwould let this amendment proceed as a freestanding bill, if it is \nintended just for the 45-day legislative veto, and not take this to \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. NICKLES. As the Senator knows, it takes two Houses to pass \nanything. The House already passed one bill. If we pass this free \nstanding, then they would have to consider another piece of legislation \nentirely. They went through a lot of pain to get where they are today. \nI think that would create a lot of hard feelings over there. I do not \nwant to do that.\n  I have told my friend and colleague--the Senator said I was against \nthe House bill--I did not say that. I would like to correct my \ncolleague. I would like to correct him on a little bit of the \ninterpretation of the House bill.\n  But my point is, I favor this approach. I think this is a better \napproach. I think the moratorium, as the Senator has alluded to, made a \nlot of sense when we were in January. Now, we are at the end of March.\n  I would like to have something passed. I believe if we pass this \ntomorrow, hopefully we can convince the House to pass it--basically \nrecede to the Senate--and we may have a bill on the President's desk \nvery soon; this week, possibly. I would like to see that happen.\n  I am afraid if we did the freestanding approach that the Senator \nalluded to, we may end up with nothing. And I think that would be a \nmistake.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator will yield, we are talking about not having \naction in the House. The House would have to consider this, too, and so \nthey would have to go back and reconsider this substitute to the \nmoratorium.\n  Why not consider this as a freestanding bill, rather than as \nsomething to be conferenced between the House moratorium bill that was \npassed and this bill? Why not consider this separately, if this is a \ngood idea on its own?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me finish replying, but I will be happy to yield. \nThe Senator from Ohio has the floor.\n  The House has already passed the legislation. If we pass entirely new \nfreestanding legislation, then it has not even made the first hurdle. \nWe are ready to go to conference very soon. If we pass this in the \nSenate tomorrow, as I hope and expect that we will, the House could \nrecede. Both sides have to appoint conferees. If we could convince our \ncolleagues in the House that this is a better approach, given the fact \nthat the year has already moved along and so on--and I might tell my \nfriend and colleague, originally we were talking about a 100-day \nmoratorium back in November. So time has been moving. This is more \npermanent, more significant.\n  If we can convince our House colleagues of that, we could possibly \nhave a bill on the President's desk in a short period of time.\n  Mr. GLENN. The House is going to have to take action one way or the \nother. Why not take action on this?\n  You are saying you hope to convince the House to come to your \npersuasion on the substitute to the moratorium. Why not pass the \nlegislative veto separately and send it over to the House? They would \ntake action on it, and it would get to the President's desk in the same \nlength of time. The way you are talking about it, there is going to \nhave to be a conference with the House on this bill, with the chance \nthat we may wind up with most of what is in the House bill now. We do \nnot know how strongly they may feel about this. I would feel much \nbetter about this if we had this as a freestanding bill. And if the \nintent of the sponsors is as they say it is, then I do not see why you \nwould object to this procedure.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Ohio allow the Senator from Nevada to \nrespond to the question?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. We have the underlying bill that is now before the Senate. \nTomorrow, it has been the decision of the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from Nevada to offer a substitute. Of course, if the substitute \npasses, the vehicle that will be before the Senate will be our \nsubstitute.\n  I say to my friend from Ohio, it is pretty standard procedure around \nhere to say, ``Why don't you drop your amendment? You can bring it up \nas a freestanding bill.''\n  Well, we know why we do not want to do that. Because momentum would \nbe lost for our legislation.\n  It seems to me quite clear if our substitute passes, there will be a \nsignificant opportunity. If in fact--and I mentioned this in my earlier \nstatement--if, in fact, the Senate, in a strong bipartisan fashion, \npasses this substitute, it will give the Senate conferees real \ndirection on how to deal with the House. I support the substitute. I do \nnot support the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. Let me just ask one question, then I will yield, because I \nhave held the floor long enough already and I know the Senator wants to \nspeak.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I just wanted you to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GLENN. Go ahead.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it not true, in fact, that we would pass this more \nquickly if it were done as a freestanding bill, as was just adopted by \nthe House, because you could then avoid the conference?\n  Mr. GLENN. Absolutely. I think that would be exactly the case.\n  I come back to my previous point, and I did not get an answer to \nthat. I would like to, here on the Senate floor, finally and at last \nhear a definition of imminent threat to health and safety or other \nemergency.\n  Now, I know Webster's definition. But the definition of imminent \nthreat did not explicitly include in committee E. coli or \ncryptosporidium.\n  I would like, here on the Senate floor, before I have to decide how I \nam going to vote on this bill, to have a firm definition of imminent \nthreat to health and safety or other emergencies.\n  In committee, they said, ``Well, we leave this up to the President.'' \nThat is not good enough; we are critical around here all the time of \nwhat the President interprets or does not interpret out of legislation.\n  What is a clear-cut definition of imminent threat to health and \nsafety?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Would the Senator like a response?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would just tell my colleague, in looking at the bill \non page 9, its says ``the President finds in writing.'' The Presidents \nmakes that determination.\n  I might also tell my colleague that we did not have it subject to \njudicial review. So if the President finds, if the President determines \nthat E. coli, or anything else, is an imminent threat to health and \nsafety or other emergency, it would be exempted. We give that kind of \ndiscretion. I happen to think that is a very broad provision, where we \nwould give that to the President and not try to limit it, not try to \nmicromanage it.\n  As the Senator knows, he alluded to the fact, there are thousands of \nregulations. To go through and try to enumerate which ones would \nqualify and which ones would not, we would be looking at a bill that \nwould be very difficult. We were not trying to do that.\n  Just as when the original legislation was drafted, we did not say \nduck hunting would be exempted because we did have a provision that \nsaid routine administrative action would be taken. And, as an author of \nthis, we did not feel that it was necessary to go through and define \n4,000 exemptions. That was not our intent.\n  But the approach that Senator Reid and I are now taking, I think is a \ngood one, because we do not have to get into that debate.\n  One of the reasons I think the bill that was reported out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is not worth very much is because almost \nall regulations could be exempted. There are 4,300 regulations that are \nin process. The Governmental Affairs Committee says this bill only \napplies to significant regulations. That is about 900 out of the 4,500. \nThen all of the exemptions, apply that to those 900; Many more of the \n900 would be exempted under the exemptions outlined in the bill.\n  [[Page S4631]] So this bill only lasts for a few months and probably \nonly applies to a few hundred regulations. The House bill is somewhat \nbroader, but we end up with almost nothing, because I think the \nPresident could determine it as a threat to public health and safety or \na routine regulation or a regulation fostering economic growth.\n He could drive a very broad path through these exemptions.\n\n  So I am saying that the approach of Senator Reid and myself is to let \nthe President go forward on the routine regulatory framework and, \nCongress, you can review those regulations, and, if we get a majority \nvote in both Houses of Congress for disapproval, we can try to stop \nthem. If the President still disagrees with us, he has the veto, and we \nwill have to override the veto. That is not an easy challenge.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, giving the President broad authority is one \nthing and giving him broad interpretive authority over what is imminent \nand what is not is another matter entirely.\n  When the committees of Congress and when we on the floor refuse to \ndefine ``imminent,'' and we say that is up to the President and his \npeople and we give him broad authority in that area, when the President \ndepends on his people to give him advice on what is imminent or what is \nnot, they go back to what was intended in the legislation in the \nCongress.\n  What they have to go on right now is a vote in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee that said that standards to protect the public from \nE. coli or cryptosporidium should not be exempted. It is not clear to \nme whether they would be exempted under the ``imminent threat'' \nexemption or not. I voted to exclude them from the moratorium just to \nmake sure. I do not think we have a good definition of ``imminent.''\n  I know my friend from Michigan wants to make some remarks, and I will \nnot belabor this any further. If we do not adequately define imminent \nthreat to health or safety or other emergency, we leave it up to the \nPresident and then we will criticize him in specific cases if his \njudgment is not what we agree with. We should have a better definition \nof this term. We were unable to get it in committee. We were unable to \nget it on the floor, too, as far as I see it. The legislative history \nright now would show that standards to protect against E. coli and \ncryptosporidium are not clearly and explicitly exempted from the \nmoratorium.\n  I reserve the remainder of time. I ask how much time we have left on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 2 hours 50 seconds--\njust slightly over 2 hours.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator from Michigan will give me a couple \nminutes, I am not here to debate the underlying bill. But on the \ncommittee report, page 14, ``Section 5. Emergency exceptions; \nexclusions'':\n\n       It is the committee's understanding that the President has \n     ample authority to except from the moratorium the \n     promulgation of rules and regulations that are necessary to \n     make food safe from E. coli bacteria, so long as there are no \n     accompanying extraneous requirements or arbitrary rules. \n     Several witnesses so testified at this committee's hearing.\n\n  I can read on, but I think the committee report will show the \ncommittee does think the President has that authority and would be able \nto make that determination.\n  Mr. President, the point I make now and, hopefully, my colleagues \nwill comprehend is that under the proposal of Senator Reid and myself, \nregulatory agencies can make their regs, they can promulgate their \nrules and regulations. Senator Reid and I are saying they have that \nauthority, they can do so, and except for the big ones, they all go \ninto effect as planned, except that we have the opportunity to have \nexpedited procedures to rescind them or to repeal them. On the large \nones, the ones that have significant impact, they would be postponed, \nthere would be a moratorium of their effective date for 45 days to give \nCongress a chance to review those.\n  That, I think, is a proper check and balance on the regulators. So if \nthe administration came out with regulations dealing with E. coli, if \nnobody pushed resolutions of disapproval, they would go into effect. If \nthe administration has regulations dealing with air traffic safety or \nsomething, they would go into effect unless both Houses passed a \nresolution of disapproval. So it puts the burden on Congress to select \nwhich ones are wrong.\n  My colleague from Ohio makes a good point in saying under the \nprevious legislation, under the legislation that was reported out of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, all discretion was given to the \nPresident; the President makes the determinations, the President \ndetermines the exemptions.\n  I think he had ample opportunity under the legislation, as passed out \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee, to exempt lots of regulations, \nmaybe all regulations. He could say there is a positive health impact \nor threat to danger, or threat to health and safety or that they had a \npositive economic impact.\n  So he could exempt anything, I think, under the bill that passed out \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee. That was all given to the \nPresident. The President had sole authority to make the determination \non the exceptions. That was the bill that was reported out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  We are saying, no, Congress has a responsibility, Congress should be \nmaking some determinations. Congress can let these rules go into effect \nif we desire. Under Senator Reid's approach and mine, Congress would \ntake the initiative, and if we did not like the rule or regulation, we \nhave an expedited procedure to review it and possibly repeal it. So it \nputs some of the burden back on Congress instead of, under the bill as \nreported out of committee, all that burden was on the executive branch.\n  I think it is a good approach, and I hope my colleagues will concur.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Ohio if he can yield \nme 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield whatever time is needed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill that we will be taking up \ntomorrow, S. 219, the regulatory moratorium bill, is really Government \nat its worst. It is arbitrary, it is extreme, it is unfair, it is a \nreckless piece of legislation.\n  As Senator Glenn has already described, S. 219 would stop or suspend \nall regulatory action taken between November 9, 1994, and December 31, \n1995. In other words, it is also retroactive. It not only stops \nregulations from being issued this year through December 31, it goes \nback, picks an arbitrary date and suspends all regulatory actions taken \nfrom November 9 to the present, even those that are final and \neffective; even those that people, industries, and businesses have \ncounted on, have changed their method of operation in order to \naccommodate, even those which industry and businesses have pleaded with \nus to put into effect. And there are such regulations, and I will get \ninto some of those in a moment.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee amended S. 219 in reporting it to \nthe floor by applying it to significant regulatory actions, which are \nabout 800 to 900 in any one year. But the committee did not alter the \nretroactive feature of this bill.\n  I want to go back and look at how this thing started in the House.\n  According to an article that appeared in the Washington Post on March \n12, lobbyists gamed the system in the House as the bill was being \ndrafted in order to keep the rules out that they wanted to take effect \nand keep the rules in that they wanted to stop.\n  First, they started with an effective date of November 9, arguing \nthat the day after the election had significance for pending \nregulations, but then they changed the date from November 9 to November \n20. This is in the House.\n  Why did they do that? Why was it November 20 instead of November 19 \nor November 18 or November 21? Because one Member of the House whose \nsupport they wanted had a rule that he cared about, that he wanted to \ngo into effect. It was a marketing order for borrowing. He had been \nwaiting for that marketing order. He did not want \n[[Page S4632]] that one caught up in the moratorium. That one took \neffect November 19. So he said, ``Well, make it November 20 and now you \nhave my support.'' So they picked the first day after that particular \nrule took effect. Forget the fact that the moratorium blocks all other \nmarketing orders, like cherries or sugar or flowers or anything else.\n  The principle involved in this decision was not that marketing orders \nshould be exempt because they are central to the promotion and sale of \nkey commodities; the principle that was operating in this case was the \nprinciple of political expedience, picking the date based on the desire \nto protect the rule for one particular Member.\n  Well, I have marketing orders that I am interested in, too. We have a \ncherry marketing order that will affect cherry production. We are \nnumber one in the entire market for cherries in the country. That one \nprobably will not take effect--if it does--until later this year. Well, \nis my marketing order less important than that Representative's \nmarketing order? Is one more significant than the other? Are we going \nto say, well, we will exempt this and that, and pluck this from the sky \nand pull this one from the ground, and we will exempt particular rules \nfrom this moratorium where a Member has a particular interest, out of \nthousands that are pending? Is that the way we are going to legislate? \nThat is the way this bill was done in the House--cover barley, and then \nwe will get another vote for a moratorium. It is arbitrary in the way \nit was done, both in the House and here.\n  There were a lot of other exemptions that were considered. Lobbyists \nfrom many sides bid for exemption. But the House rejected every \nexemption concerning rules to protect public health and safety and \naccepted numerous amendments to protect specific business-related \nitems.\n  For instance, the House exempted from the moratorium a rule that was \npublished on December 2 relative to the conditional release of textile \nimports; a rule that related to customs modernization; a rule that \nrelated to the transfer of spectrum by the Federal Communications \nCommission, and so forth. If you can catch the interest of a Member, \nyou can get your rule exempted from the moratorium. I do not have any \nproblem with exempting from the moratorium any of those rules. I am all \nin favor of that, because I do not think the moratorium makes sense. It \nis not as though I do not think we ought to exempt textiles or we \nshould not exempt spectrum. I think we should have a rational way of \nlegislating, which is to state a principle, not just willy-nilly pick \nitems out of the blue which may have particular appeal to a particular \nMember.\n  One of the reasons this moratorium did not make sense is because it \nwould catch up rules such as those enumerated. But it is going to catch \nup a lot of other rules which make sense, as well. It is not just a \ntextile rule that it catches up. Well, that was exempt. It catches up a \nrule that finally gives us some sanity in the area of bottled water.\n  The water bottlers have been waiting for a decade for this rule; they \nwant the rule. They have been asking for a rule to label bottled water \nso that the public knows what it is getting. It says ``spring water'' \nor ``artesian water'' or ``seltzer water,'' ``well water,'' or whatever \nit is. The bottling industry wants rules so the public is not misled. \nThey want rules in order to restrict the amount of particular chemicals \nthat can be in bottled water. They have been waiting for this rule. \nThey wrote us in strong opposition to this moratorium, because it \ncatches up rules that they have been waiting for.\n  Now, the textile folks are exempted, and it is fine with me. But how \nabout the water bottlers; they are not exempted? What is the rationale \nfor this? What is the reason behind that? Where is the fairness behind \nthat?\n  Now, as the House bill came over to the Senate, this is the way it \nlooked. It applies to all regulatory actions, big and small. It does \nnot even permit agencies to receive comments from the public on pending \nrulemaking. This is the House bill, I emphasize. This is the one we are \ngoing to face in conference. All regulatory actions are stopped in the \nHouse bill, not just final regs. Agencies are not able to receive \ncomment, issue guidance, nothing; stop it, everything. I do not know \nwhat we expect the folks at the agencies to do this year. Nonetheless, \neverything stops in its tracks. They cannot receive comments from the \npublic--a grinding halt. It applies retroactively. It indiscriminately \nexempts some rules and not others. It does not exempt any rule \npertaining to public health and safety, except it has an imminent \nthreat stamp.\n  Well, as the Senator from Ohio says, the definition of ``imminent'' \nis not there. So we have to try to figure out now whether or not the \nPresident is going to exempt a rule that the Product Safety Commission \nis going to promulgate on bike helmets. Is that an imminent threat? \nThey are looking at a rule which will require that items which are sold \nas bike helmets to protect the heads of bicyclists from injury, in \nfact, be structurally strong enough so that they will be able to \nperform that function. That is the Product Safety Commission that is \ndoing that.\n  The industry wants it; they want these regs. But is that an imminent \nthreat? Is the President just supposed to pick some kind of decision \nout of the air? Does that depend upon what the prediction is as to how \nmany people will die within what period of time? Is that imminent? Is \nit one person a year? If it averages one per month, is that imminent or \nnot? If it averages 10 per month, is that imminent or not imminent?\n  Choking toys. The Product Safety Commission, I think, has already \nissued regulations on toys which are a threat to children under 4 years \nold, which they can choke on. Now, is it imminent or is it not \nimminent? We do not know. But none of these are exempted. The bike \nhelmets are not exempted. The E. coli bacteria is not exempted. The \nchoking toy is not exempted. But we have exemptions for all kinds of \nother things that are more business-related exemptions, such as sale of \nspectrum by the FCC, or the textile regulation; those are specifically \nexempted in the House bill. But nothing relating to public health and \nsafety is exempted. Instead, there is an imminent threat requirement \nthat the President has to apply.\n  There is one other thing the House bill does. Again, I emphasize this \nis what we are going to face in conference. The Senate bill makes some \nchanges--the underlying Senate bill. But the House bill extends \nstatutory and judicial deadlines. In other words, where there is a rule \nwhich is required by law, be it judicial or statutory, to come into \neffect as of a particular date, in that case, the bill says, well, we \nwant it to be longer by 5 months. The moratorium for December 31 is not \ngood enough if the deadline for a rule has been set by a statute or by \na court. There, for some reason--totally inexplicable to me--the \ndeadline is extended 5 months beyond December 31. Mind you, if Congress \nset a statutory deadline for a rule to come into effect, and that one \nis moratoriumed until December 31, that becomes May 31. I do not know \nthat logic. They tried to change that one in committee in the Senate \nversion without any success. We never got an explanation as to the \nlogic of that one. You would think if we set a deadline for a rule to \ncome into effect, we would treat ourselves as well, at least when there \nis no such deadline for a regulation coming into effect. But we do not. \nThis moratorium, I believe, is a diversion from the real job of \ndrafting tough regulatory reform legislation.\n  We hope that we could just set this moratorium idea aside and get on \nwith the real work of regulatory reform, the real work that the \ncommittees of this Congress are doing, which the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee did by unanimous vote in adopting the Roth regulatory reform \napproach. Another committee of this Senate is doing work on regulatory \nreform. That is the serious work. Timely item review, cost benefit \nanalysis,\n looking at each regulation, to weigh whether or not its benefits \noutweigh the costs.\n\n  In our bill, having a legislative veto provision--which I think is a \nvery important and significant approach, one that I have supported \nsince I got here. As a matter of fact, one which I supported before I \ngot here.\n  When the moratorium bill that the committee took up, S. 219, came \nbefore the committee for markup, it was a \n[[Page S4633]] doozy of a markup. There were 22 amendments at our \nmarkup. I want to go through this markup briefly just to show how \narbitrary this bill before the Congress is.\n  Senator Cochran offered an amendment to exempt any action taken to \nensure the safety and soundness of a farm credit system institution, or \nto protect the farm credit insurance fund. That amendment was accepted.\n  Senator Pryor offered an amendment to exempt any agency action that \nestablishes, modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a regulatory program \nfor a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity relating to \nhunting, fishing, or camping, if a Federal law prohibits such activity \nin the absence of agency action. That amendment was designed to exempt \na regulation that permits duck hunting season to open. That was \naccepted.\n  Senator Akaka offered an amendment to exempt the promulgation of any \nrule or regulation relating to aircraft overflights on national parks \nby the Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary of the Interior \npursuant to the procedures specified in the advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking, published on March 17, 1994. That amendment was accepted.\n  Senator Glenn offered an amendment to exempt ``any regulatory action \nto improve air safety including such an action to improve airworthiness \nof aircraft engines.'' That amendment was accepted. Senator Glenn \noffered another amendment to exempt any regulatory action that would \nupgrade safety and training standards for commuter airlines to those of \nmajor airlines. That amendment was accepted.\n  Senator Thompson offered an amendment to exempt any clarification of \nexisting responsibilities regarding highway safety warning devises \nwhich was intended to cover railroad crossings. That amendment was \naccepted.\n  Senator Glenn offered an amendment to exempt any regulatory action to \nbring compensation to Persian Gulf war veterans for disabilities for \nundiagnosed illnesses as provided by the Persian Gulf Veterans Benefits \nAct. That amendment was accepted.\n  Senator Glenn offered an amendment to exempt regulatory action by the \nEPA to protect the public from exposure from lead in house paints, \nsoil, or drinking water. That amendment was accepted.\n  Now, each of those amounts was offered in an effort to exempt \nparticular rules from coverage of the moratorium. I support each one of \nthose amendments. They are fine. The problem is not that there is a \nproblem with the amendments that were adopted. The problem is \namendments which nobody offers to cover important regulation which have \nas much claim to be exempted from this moratorium as the ones that we \nexempted. Certain Senators, familiar with certain rules, offer an \nexemption from the moratorium. It gets adopted. That is fine. What \nabout the ones where we are not familiar, acting on a matter of weeks \nupon thousands and thousands of regulations that get caught up in the \nnet? They are caught up in a moratorium. How many rules are there that \nare just as important as the ones that we exempt that are still going \nto be subject to the moratorium, and with similar or even more serious \nconsequences than these rules? There are hundreds of these rules, \npotentially, since we have been told there is perhaps 800 to 900 \nsignificant regulatory actions in any one year.\n  All these amendments identified about eight, eight that some Senators \nare familiar with. How many others? We do not have the vaguest idea. \nSome of them that we do know about we tried to offer amendments on. \nThese are some of the ones that failed. See if there is any coherence \nto this.\n  Senator Glenn offered an amendment to exempt any regulatory action to \nreduce pathogens in meat and poultry taken by the Food Safety and \nInspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That one was \ndefeated. We accepted the exemption for lead paint. That one was \nadopted. But when it came to a rule to protect against tainted meat, \nthat exemption from the moratorium was rejected.\n  Now, maybe somebody can come up with a logic here as to why we should \nproceed without a moratorium to a rule on lead paint, but we should not \nproceed without a moratorium to a rule which protects citizens from \ntainted meat.\n  I think we ought to proceed with both unless on a one-by-one basis \nCongress, pursuant to a legislative veto, feels that a regulation is \nnot consistent with the law that drives it or is not worth the cost.\n  That is the alternative approach to this moratorium. That is the \ncoherent approach. That is the approach where we will be forced to \nrationally look at any regulation, one by one, not lumping them all \ntogether in one bushel basket and stopping the whole bushel, except for \none or two or three, up to eight, which people have picked out of the \nbushel, but where we deal rationally with regulations one on one.\n  Then Senator Glenn offered an amendment to exempt any regulatory \naction by the EPA that relates to control of microbe risks in drinking \nwater supplies. That is the one that addresses the concern about \ncryptosporidium in public drinking water. That was rejected.\n  Is the lead paint threat more imminent than the cryptosporidium \nthreat? That is the decision of this committee, and, therefore, one is \ngoing to be subject to a moratorium and the other one is exempt. It \nbeats me what the logic is. I do not see it.\n  I offered an amendment to exempt any significant regulatory action \nthe principal purpose of which is to protect or improve human health or \nsafety and for which a cost-benefit analysis has been completed and the \nhead of the agency taking such action has concluded, to the extent \npermitted by law, that the benefits justify the cost. That one was \nrejected on a 7 to 7 vote.\n  There is so much inconsistency in this bill that it is really the \ntotally wrong way for Congress to legislate. One rule is exempted just \nin case it might get caught by the moratorium, but a similar rule is \nnot exempted because, well, it appears that it would not be caught by \nthe moratorium. There is no rhyme or reason to why the committee \nspecifically exempts air safety regulations and lead paint regulations, \nbut refuses to specifically exempt meat safety and cryptosporidium \nregulations. There is no rhyme nor reason to that.\n  Surely we want to protect ourselves from dangerous situations in the \nair, from lead paint, from dangerous meat, and from cryptosporidium. We \nwant to protect ourselves from all. Where is the logic?\n  Now, I offered an amendment which the committee accepted. Here is the \nway this amendment read: ``We will exempt from the moratorium, \nregulations that establish or enforce statutory rights that prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, age, national \norigin or handicap or disability status.'' That one was accepted. Those \nare exempt from the moratorium.\n  But then I offered an amendment rejected by the committee--I cannot \nfigure the logic it--to exempt any significant regulatory action which \nenforces constitutional rights of an individual. That one we did not \nexempt. Statutory rights that prohibit discrimination are exempt, but \nregulations to enforce constitutional rights are not exempt from the \nmoratorium.\n  The committee accepted an amendment by Senator McCain to exempt \nactions that ``limit it to matters relating to negotiated rulemaking \ncarried out between Indian tribal governments and at agency under the \n`Indian Self-Determination Act Amendments of 1994'.'' Fair enough; no \nproblem with that exemption.\n  But how about an amendment to exempt any regulation issued pursuant \nto the consensual product of regulatory negotiation--not just the ones \nrelating to Indian tribal governments but any product of regulatory \nnegotiation; not just that product?\n  So it went, and so we have just a hodgepodge of exemptions that defy \nconsistency or rationality.\n  We also add items of coverage to the moratorium. Senator Grassley \noffered an amendment that the committee adopted which added the \ninteragency memorandum of agreement concerning wetlands determinations \nto the moratorium. Mind you, this is just a interagency memorandum. \nThis is not a regulation or rule, this is just a memorandum between \nagencies. That one is added to the moratorium on regulations. So that \none is suspended during the moratorium period.\n  [[Page S4634]] Senator Stevens offered an amendment to extend the \nmoratorium to include any action that ``* * * restricts commercial use \nof land under the control of a Federal agency''--any action, not just a \nregulation or rule, any action restricting the ``commercial use of land \nunder the control of a Federal agency.''\n  We are still trying to figure out the ramifications of that \namendment. Already the results are pretty stunning.\n  Under the Stevens amendment, the Federal agencies in charge of \nprotecting Federal lands would presumably not be able to carry out \nenforcement proceedings against individual actions that could despoil \nthe land or endanger human life. For instance, the National Park \nService could presumably not close a dangerous pass in a national park \nbecause of drifting snow; it could not stop hikers using certain paths \nin a park that may be dangerous because of bears or high water.\n  The Department of the Interior has reviewed this amendment. Here is \nwhat it predicts if this amendment ever became law:\n\n       The Bureau of Land Management would not have authority to \n     enforce existing permits or plans of operations for mineral \n     leases; the Bureau of Reclamation would not be able to \n     regulate boating, swimming and fishing on Federal land near \n     dams and reservoirs; the Fish and Wildlife Service would not \n     be able to regulate a variety of recreational activities on \n     wildlife refuges; the National Park Service would not be able \n     to regulate activities that might impair visitor enjoyment or \n     protect the parks; the Department of Defense could not obtain \n     additional public lands for military purposes without \n     qualifying for Presidential exemption.\n\n  It goes on and on. Those are the impacts of the amendment just \nadopted in committee, which is added to a moratorium on regulation.\n  I just cannot believe that the members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee ever intended that the Government be so limited in its \nability to protect its people and its natural resources, but that is \nwhat we did in reporting this bill to the full Senate.\n  As I said, this bill also has a rather strange provision added in \ncommittee concerning statutory and judicial deadlines. That provision \nadds an additional 5 months to the length of a moratorium where \ndeadlines have been established by either statute or a court case with \nrespect to a regulation.\n  The first question is why would we want to include deadlines in the \nmoratorium bill in the first place--particularly statutory deadlines \nwhere we, in Congress, have stated explicitly the date by which we want \na rule issued? But, second, why should regulations with statutory or \njudicially imposed deadlines be singled out for an additional 5-months \nmoratorium?\n  When I asked the question the answer that I got was that it would be \ntoo much for the agencies to handle all of the proposed and final \nregulations coming into effect at the same time when the moratorium \nends, as well as the deadlines. But that does not make any sense. The \nlifting of a moratorium on proposed and final regulations does not \nforce the agencies to take any scheduled action with respect to those \nregulations, and to the extent that the agencies do take action they \nwill have the entire period of the moratorium to prepare for taking \nthose actions. Moreover, when I asked whether any agency had asked for \nthis kind of consideration, so to speak, the answer was ``no.''\n  But the report of the committee is just as telling. The report \ncontains a litany of various selected rules that are referenced for \npurposes of determining whether or not they are covered by the \nmoratorium. The committee members did not consider these rules \nindividually. Most of them--maybe all of them--were not even mentioned \nin the committee markup or in documents circulated to committee \nmembers. Yet they appear in the report as though the committee acted \nintentionally and knowingly on them.\n  Here is one--this is from the committee report.\n\n       The Department of Transportation is currently considering \n     whether alternative standards to the existing HM-181 \n     standards are appropriate for open-head fibre drums used for \n     the transportation of liquids. If the Department of \n     Transportation determines that such alternative standards are \n     appropriate, that decision could result in eliminating an \n     unnecessary regulatory burden on the fibre-drum industry.\n\n  What is wrong with that? Nothing. That is great. I am all for \nexempting them from the moratorium. I do not want any unnecessary \nregulatory burden on the fibre-drum industry more than I want it on any \nindustry. But here is a typical exception from the moratorium. It \nsuddenly appears in the committee report. We never discussed this. It \nis just helter-skelter, willy-nilly. Can you get a Senator to put a \nlittle reference in there to exempting some regulation from a \nmoratorium?\n  Here is another one. Similarly, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms is about to issue final regulations governing trade practices \nunder the Federal Alcohol Administration Act that could simplify \nalcohol promotional practices. If so, these regulations could be \nexcluded from the moratorium under this provision. Terrific, I am all \nfor it.\n  What about the hundreds of others that should be excluded from the \nmoratorium that are not named in here? What is the origin of naming one \nor two regulations, unless we want to go through these things in some \nrational way and name hundreds of regulations that ought to be exempted \nthat will reduce burdens on industry?\n  How about that bottled water regulation that the bottled water \nindustry has been waiting for, for a decade, one decade? Let me read \nthe letter from the Water Bottlers Association.\n  ``On behalf of the Bottled Water Association I am providing, at your \nrequest, information. * * * Et cetera, et cetera.\n\n       In addition to this final rule, I will describe two \n     additional amendments to the bottled water standard of \n     quality which, according to FDA, will be published this \n     spring. IBWA strongly supports the finalization of these \n     public health standards as well.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The December 1, 1994 final rule, which was identified at \n     your committee hearing last Wednesday, significantly adds to \n     the number of standard of quality levels that must be met by \n     a bottled water product and as a result, will be a \n     significant benefit to American consumers. Briefly, it \n     establishes or modifies allowable levels in bottled water for \n     9 inorganic chemicals (IOCs) and 26 synthetic organic \n     chemicals (SOCs) including 11 synthetic volatile organic \n     chemicals (VOCs), 14 pesticides, and polychlorinated \n     biphenyls (PCBs). The final rule presently becomes effective \n     on May 1, 1995. Once effective, this final rule provides even \n     greater assurance to American consumers that the bottled \n     water they drink is the safest in the world. IBWA strongly \n     supported FDA's efforts to finalize these quality levels and \n     has consistently worked with FDA to develop and implement \n     these rules. While IBWA members already voluntarily test for \n     these substances, as part of a voluntary annual inspection \n     program which is a condition of membership, making this final \n     rule effective will ensure that the entire bottled water \n     supply sold in the United States, from both domestic and \n     foreign firms, conform to these valuable public health and \n     safety standards.\n\n  This is their conclusion. I think it will resonate with every Member \nof the Senate.\n\n       The three standard of quality rules described herein have a \n     material impact on the safety of all bottled water sold in \n     this country. The standard of identity rules ensure that \n     consumers are not mislead and legitimate bottled water \n     producers not injured due to false or misleading names given \n     to specific types of bottled water. IBWA and its members have \n     devoted enormous time, technical resources, and money for \n     over a decade to develop these federal standards. It would be \n     a major setback to the bottled water industry and consumers \n     to have these federal rules, so close to finalization, \n     arbitrarily frozen. IBWA strongly supports the efforts of you \n     and others to ensure that this highly damaging possibility \n     does not become a reality.\n\n  Presumably maybe we could have exempted bottled water standards. Or \nmaybe somebody can argue that there is an imminent health hazard that \nthese address. It is pretty hard to argue. These have been in the works \nfor a decade. What is so arbitrary about this bill, what is so unfair, \nis that it singles out some, picks them out of the blue, some pending \nregulations and says we will exempt these. We will exempt the textile \nregulations from this moratorium but these other 800, well, who knows \nabout them? Let me emphasize. I am familiar with that textile \nregulation. I want to exempt it from the moratorium, too. But what \nabout the other hundreds that have an equal claim to be exempt from the \nmoratorium?\n  What about mammograms? On this floor on a bipartisan basis we had a \nlaw passed that required high-quality standards for mammograms and that \n\n[[Page S4635]] they be uniform. We had speeches from Members all over \nthis floor saying how important it was that mammograms in this country \nmeet certain high-quality standards. We lose thousands of women \nunnecessarily to breast cancer because we do not have high-quality \nmammograms in this country. And we all sit around here and stood around \nhere and made speeches as to how critically necessary it was that we \nget these standards in place. Where are they? Caught in a moratorium. \nOr are they caught? Is it imminent? Is it is legally imminent? Is there \nless of a claim for an exemption from a moratorium for a mammogram \nregulation than it is for the duck hunting season? I have to share with \nSenator Glenn the same strong feeling. We do not want to mess up the \nduck hunting season. So we should exempt them. I have no problem with \ndoing that. But what about mammograms? Is there less of a claim? I do \nnot think so.\n  This bill has been turned into a vehicle for special interest \npleading. That is what is so fundamentally disturbing about this \nmoratorium. Who gets in and who gets out depends on whether you can get \na Member's ear or attention and time to get a particular request in. In \nsome cases it is a request to be excluded from the moratorium. In \nothers it is a request to be covered by the moratorium. What about \nthose who do not have the lobbyists or the representatives to \nadequately argue their case? What about them?\n  This represents arbitrary Government at its worst. What is ironic is \nthat it is part of an effort to reduce the intrusion of arbitrary \nGovernment, an effort that I share.\n  There is going to be a substitute offered, the principle of which is \nan important principle and it is a principle that I very strongly \nsupport. The principle is that we as a Congress should be forced to \nlook at the product of our laws and not just write general laws. We as \na Congress should be forced to look at regulations that come out of \nthese laws we write, not simply vote on the law and then move on to the \nnext problem and think we have solved the first one. Because the \nregulations that are spawned by our laws can frequently create as many \nproblems as they can cure.\n  I came to this Senate believing in legislative veto. And I think the \nfirst legislative veto in the 1980's was one that I cosponsored for \nSenator Boren, a so-called Levin-Boren legislative veto on the Federal \nTrade Commission. We passed it. We would have liked to have had a \ngeneric one, by the way, but the Supreme Court intervened and created \nsome problems in the way it was done.\n  So I am all for legislative veto. I think it ought to be done the \nright way. I have some suggested changes in the one that is going to be \noffered as a substitute. But make no mistake about it. We are going to \nface this moratorium again in conference even if we substitute a \nlegislative veto for this across-the-board regulatory moratorium. That \ndoes not unhappily put an end to this arbitrary and reckless approach \nto Government. We are going to face it again in conference.\n  It is important that this Senate go on record, not only as favoring \nthe alternative, which is a legislative veto that will be offered, a \ntotally different approach, one that looks at regulations one at a time \nthat forces us in the legislative body to do our work instead of \ncapturing all of the regulatory process in the executive branch in a \nnet, willy-nilly. It is a very different approach. I hope we adopt \nsomething like the one that is going to be offered by Senator Nickles \nand Senator Reid. But it is also important in adopting that substitute \nthat we put to rest, that we end, the threat of a moratorium which we \nare still going to face in conference, which I believe is one of the \nmost arbitrary pieces of legislation that I have seen in my 16 years in \nthe Senate.\n  I want to commend Senator Glenn for the effort that he has led \nagainst this moratorium. Hopefully tomorrow we will take step one in \nputting this thing to rest. But he is very right in alerting us to the \nfact that this is just step one. If we do in fact adopt this \nalternative approach that we not proceed along with this broad across-\nthe-board regulatory moratorium but instead move to a legislative veto \napproach, that it is just phase one in this effort. Phase two will be \nin a conference where the folks who support the moratorium have already \nindicated publicly that they are going to try to get that moratorium \nenacted.\n  Mr. President, again with thanks to Senator Glenn for leading the \neffort to defeat this moratorium and to get an alternative approach \nutilizing the legislative veto or regulatory reform, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that David \nDavis, a Fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges during the \nconsideration of S. 219.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to follow through on some of the \nremarks of the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, if I might. Did we \nreserve the remainder of our time on this side so we do not have it \ncharged against us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I listened with care to comments of the \nSenator from Michigan. I think he raised some legitimate points \nregarding both the House bill and also the Senate bill, S. 219, which \ncame from the committee.\n  At the conclusion of his remarks, he got to the point that I would \nlike to speak to; that is, the Nickles-Reid substitute which he \nindicated would most assuredly answer many of the questions that he had \nraised, that it constituted the concept of legislative veto that would \nenable the House and Senate to examine these regulations each one by \nthemselves to determine whether they could conform to the intent of the \nlegislative branch which pass the laws in the first place. I think that \nis the bottom line here. That is the question.\n  We should be able to rely upon the majority of the House and Senate \nto understand what we intended when we passed a law, and whether the \nregulations being issued by the regulatory agencies conform to our \noriginal intent. I suspect in most of those cases we will find that we \nagree with the regulations being proposed. But in those cases where we \ndo not, we will have the opportunity to say so, and during the debate \nindicate why we think they perhaps do not conform to our original \nintent and, therefore, how the agencies can rewrite the regulations.\n  Most of the consequences of the House bill, or Senate bill, S. 219, \nthat the Senator spoke of are answered, it seems to me, by the Nickles-\nReid substitute. You have concerns expressed I think with either a \nmoratorium or a lookback except that during the lookback to November 9, \n1994, the regulations remain in effect. And so there should be no real \nconcern because those regulations remain extant and they are only \nstopped if the House and Senate decide that they need to be changed. \nAnd the 45-day moratorium with the exceptions for emergencies and for \npublic health and safety reasons that require an immediate \nimplementation of a regulation is not really much of a delay \nconsidering the fact that many regulations, most regulations are \ndelayed 30 days from implementation anyway. It seems to me the \nopportunity to look at these regulations and determine whether they \nconform to congressional intent is good and that we give up very little \nbecause the regulations already in effect remain in effect until we \nlook at them and those regulations which are not emergencies are only \ndelayed for a period of 45 days.\n  The concern that many of us have is twofold: The cost of regulations \nto our families, to our businesses and to society in general and also \nthe burden of regulations today cry out for solution.\n  There are two charts here which I would like to briefly use to \ndemonstrate that point. The pages of the Federal Register is some rough \nmeasure of the burden of these regulations, and we are almost up now to \n67,000 pages in the Federal Register. You can see from the year 1976 \nthat regulations went all the way up to 73,000 pages during the 1978 \nand 1979 period, down to a low during 1986 of about 44,000 pages in the \nFederal Register; last year, almost \n[[Page S4636]] 65,000, and as I said now almost 67,000 pages in the \nFederal Register as of this date.\n  And by the way, that is pretty fine print so we are not talking about \nregulations just of one or two to a page. This demonstrates in at least \nsome gross way the size of the burden that we are imposing on people.\n  I defy anybody to understand what is in all of these regulations. We \nspend billions of dollars trying to comply with the law. We all \nremember as school kids we learned the phrase ``ignorance of the law is \nno excuse,'' but in fact Americans, all of us, are ignorant of the law. \nWe cannot possibly know what is in all of these regulations and comply \nwith them, and we hire people to help us with that, spending billions \nof dollars in the process.\n  That gets to the second chart, Mr. President. The cost of Government \nper household 2 years ago, 1993, for the Federal regulatory burden was \n$6,000 compared to the Federal tax burden of $12,000. As a matter of \nfact, depending upon which study you look at, the cost by the end of \n1993 of complying with Federal regulations overall, counting businesses \nas well, was just about equal to the Federal tax burden.\n  So if you include businesses as well as families in this, what you \nfind is that we are paying as much to comply with regulations as we are \nmoney to the Federal Treasury. In rough dollar terms, about $1 trillion \nwe pay into the Federal Treasury, about $1.3 trillion, as I recall. And \nthe cost of complying with regulations is somewhere in that rough area, \nof roughly $1 trillion a year.\n  It is hard for any of us to comprehend what $1 trillion is, but for \nthe average household we can understand $6,000 a year to comply with \nFederal regulations. We know that it is hard to know what is in them \nall. We know that it is expensive and burdensome. We know that they are \nnot all necessary.\n  That is what our effort is all about, to have the Congress have at \nleast the opportunity to look at them before they go into effect, to \nsay, yes, that is needed, that is what we intended, let it go. Or, wait \na minute, this goes far beyond what the Congress intended when we \npassed this law. This is not the kind of burden that we intended to \nimpose upon society, upon our families, upon small businesses, for \nexample. Or for some other reason to say, time out, hold this \nregulation up; this is not an appropriate extension of the law.\n  Mr. President, I just want to conclude with this story. When I first \nwent to law school, I remembered thinking about the difference between \nadministrative law and statutory law. I had never had occasion to think \nabout that distinction before. The legislative branch passes laws, the \nexecutive branch signs those laws and then implements them. That is \nwhat I had learned in high school and in college.\n  However, I came to appreciate a distinction, that when you get to the \nway it really works in the real world with the Federal Government, you \nhave the legislative branch passing laws that are usually not very many \npages. Now, we like to talk about all these big laws and most of them \nare not that big. And then we tend to forget about it. This is what we \nintend to happen or to prevent from happening. It is then the job of \nthe executive branch of Government to translate that into all of the \nrules and regulations by which the law is implemented.\n  A funny thing happens. The regulators end up taking far more space in \nthe Federal Register writing many, many times the number of words to \nexplain precisely what it is that Congress meant. And Congress does not \ngo back and look at that until constituents come to us and say, ``Do \nyou realize what you did when you passed this law? Do you realize what \nthis regulator is making me do?'' Frequently we say, ``Well, now, that \nis not what we intended.'' But we never get around to changing the \nregulations. We literally have to go back and amend the law.\n  Well, this allows us a more efficient procedure, a shortcut, if you \nwill, an opportunity before the fact, before the regulations hurt \npeople to say, time out, Mr. Regulator friend of ours here in the \nexecutive branch, you are going beyond what we intended when we passed \nthe law. So scale it back in this regard and then that will be what we \nintended and that is what our constituents then can live with.\n  I believe that this is long overdue. I have constituents back home \nwho have pleaded with me to please try to do something to solve this \nproblem. And I think that in the Nickles-Reid amendment we have really \ncome to a good balance. We have found a way to look at old regulations \nand to consider new regulations and a way to ensure that they conform \nwith congressional intent without preventing the executive branch \nthrough proper administration to deal with emergencies, to deal with \npublic safety and the like. I think it is a good balance, and I think \nit is important for us to adopt this kind of approach. I am looking \nforward to the next day or two of debate hoping that we can get the \nNickles-Reid substitute passed, go to conference with the House version \nof their bill, and quickly get a bill signed and sent to the President \nfor his signature.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Nickles-Reid \namendment. My friend and colleague from Arizona has done an excellent \njob of pointing out some of the burdens of regulation. I will not \nreiterate those, but I will make them a part of my full statement in \nthe Record.\n  He has talked about the annual costs and economic terms of \nregulations. This is a study--I understand done in 1992--by Thomas D. \nHopkins on the regulatory policy in Canada and the United States. He is \ntalking about billions of dollars, in 1991 dollars, and shows back in \n1977 they were running slightly under $550 billion, but at that time we \nprojected that the 1995 burden would be about $600 billion annually.\n  Now, as chairman of the Small Business Committee, I suppose the one \nthing that I hear most from small businesses in my State and in the \nother States I have visited is that you are killing us with all these \nregulations. We are in business to make money, to hire people, to \nprovide a product or a service. How are we going to keep up with the \nminute details, the tremendous volume of directions that you are giving \nto us. How are we supposed to run our business and still read all this \nstuff?\n  Now, before me, I have two stacks of regulations the Clinton \nadministration has put forward since the election. I would have stacked \nthem one on top of the other for more dramatic impact, but I am sure I \nwould have been in violation of some regulation of OSHA because they \ncould be very dangerous if you stacked up all of this material and put \nit where it could fall over on somebody. Unfortunately, it is the \nbusiness person, the individual, the farmer, the retail store owner who \nis supposed to know everything that is in here.\n  Oh, by the way, just received today, March 27, 1995. You think you \nhave problems getting to sleep tonight. This is what you need to read \ntoday as the regulatory burden that the Government is proposing to put \non you today.\n  This is today's reading. The admonition that the problems of today \nare sufficient, do not worry about tomorrow; well, the Bible did not \nunderstand that the Federal Register could make the burdens of today as \nsignificant as this.\n  But this is what the small business person is supposed to know and \nsupposed to follow.\n  The Clinton administration has proposed 4,300 regulatory actions and \nhas some 2,000 final rules planned. This is going to enable this \nadministration to surpass the dubious record of the Carter \nadministration in the issuance of new regulations.\n  Another way of looking at the volume of regulations is how many \nbureaucrats does it take to write the regulations? In 1970, we had \n28,000 people in the Federal bureaucracy telling us how to run our \nlives and what kind of regulations we have to obey. By today, glory be, \nthat number has risen to 127,842 people trying to tell the small \nbusiness person in my hometown, your hometown, or anyplace in this \ncountry how they live their lives and what they ought to do.\n  Now, let me make clear as we begin this debate, we are not saying all \nregulations are bad. And I do not believe any of the proponents of this \nlegislation or this amendment are going to say that. People still rely, \nas they \n[[Page S4637]] must, as they should, on the Government to provide basic \nfunctions to ensure that we have clean water to drink, ensure safe and \neffective medicines to take, and safe food to eat. I want to be able to \nrely on that. But the people I talk to, the people I am hearing, want \nGovernment brought under control. They are tired of looking at \nGovernment and seeing how it runs and thinking to themselves, ``You \ncould never run a business that way.''\n  The question I suggest, Mr. President, is how to get the best results \nfrom the regulations we must have? How do we use our finite resources \nbest? If we waste time and effort and energy on complicated or unwise \nor overly prescribed regulations, we cannot put those resources and \nthat time into being productive. It results in loss of jobs and a lower \nstandard of living.\n  We ought to take a look at these regulations and ask some important \nquestions. And that is what this 45-day period under the Nickles-Reid \namendment would permit us to do. It would enable us to say: Would this \nregulation actually improve things or would it endanger lives? Could \nthe same amount of spending be applied better in another way? Is this \nregulation the best way to allocate the resources in our globally \ncompetitive economy?\n  Let me just take two examples that might be under the heading of risk \nassessment.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, under the EPA's \nhazardous waste disposal ban, $4.2 billion would have to be spent \nbefore one single premature death is prevented. Again according to OMB, \nunder EPA's formaldehyde occupational exposure limit, $119 billion to \nprevent one premature death. That is not to say that it is not a \nlaudable goal to prevent deaths that would result from exposure to \nhazardous substances. The question we must ask is whether this is the \nbest way to allocate these billions of dollars in resources? If \nresources were used a different way, could we not, in fact, save more \nlives and prevent more illness?\n  The money spent complying with regulations might be better spent. If \nsociety could take the resources spent to comply with the formaldehyde \noccupational exposure limit, $119 billion, and spent it on developing \nnew lifesaving drug therapies, then 331 new drugs could be developed \nand brought to market. If the $92 billion that it will take to avoid \none death under the atrazine/alachlor drinking water standard were used \nfor cancer research, we could quadruple the research budget at the \nNational Cancer Institute for the next 12 years. If we took the $168.2 \nmillion that it is estimated to cost to avoid just one death under the \nbenzene nesahp standard, we could put 3,064 more police officers on the \nstreet.\n  Let me give you just a couple of examples, Mr. President, of some of \nthe things that we have heard about before. I think our colleagues have \nheard about how dangerous it is to rescue a colleague, a fellow worker, \nwho is in danger of death in a collapsed trench. Senator Kempthorne has \ntalked about it.\n  My one of my favorite columnist Dave Barry, wrote in ``Wit's End'' \nabout this story in Idaho. He said:\n       But before we do anything, let's salute the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) office in Idaho for \n     its prompt action regarding. . .\n       Improperly attired rescue personnel: Here's what happened, \n     according to an article in the Idaho Statesman.\n       On May 11, two employees of DeBest Inc., a plumbing \n     company, were working at a construction site in Garden City, \n     Idaho, when they heard a backhoe operator yell for help. They \n     ran over, and found that the wall of a trench--which was not \n     dug by DeBest--had collapsed on a worker, pinning him under \n     dirt and covering his head.\n       ``We could hear muffled screams,'' said one of the DeBest \n     employees.\n       So the men jumped into the trench and dug the victim out, \n     quite possibly saving his life.\n       What do you think OSHA did about this? Do you think it gave \n     the rescuers a medal? If so, I can see why you are a mere \n     lowlife taxpayer, as opposed to an OSHA executive. What OSHA \n     did--I am not making this up--was fine DeBest Inc. $7,875. \n     Yes. OSHA said that the two men should not have gone into the \n     trench without (1) putting on approved hard hats, and (2) \n     taking steps to ensure that other trench walls did not \n     collapse, and water did not seep in. Of course this might \n     have resulted in some discomfort for the suffocating victim \n     (``Hang in there! We should have the OSHA trench-seepage-\n     prevention guidelines here within hours!''). But that is the \n     price you pay for occupational health and safety.\n       Unfortunately, after DeBest Inc. complained to Idaho Sen. \n     Dirk Kempthorne, OSHA backed off on the fines. Nevertheless \n     this incident should serve as a warning to would-be rescuers \n     out there to comply with all federal regulations, including \n     those that are not yet in existence, before attempting to \n     rescue people. Especially if these people are in, say, a \n     burning OSHA office.\n  But let me tell you what OSHA came up with. They did repeal the fine. \nThey pushed it through in the first place, and then they pulled it \nback. And now OSHA has decided to provide for that.\n  So if you are thinking about a rescue situation, and here you are, \nthis is any worker, this is any small contractor on a hazardous site, \nyou have to know this before you try to rescue somebody.\n  This is from the Federal Register of Tuesday, December 27, 1994, \nvolume 58, page 66,613--that will tell you something. And I quote:\n       (f) No citation may be issued to an employer because of a \n     rescue activity undertaken by an employee of that employer \n     with respect to an individual in imminent danger unless:\n       (1)(i) Such employee is designated or assigned by the \n     employer to have responsibility to perform or assist in \n     rescue operations, and\n       (ii) the employer fails to provide protection of the safety \n     and health of such employee, including failing to provide \n     appropriate training and rescue equipment, or\n       (2)(i) such employee is directed by the employer to perform \n     rescue activities in the course of carrying out the \n     employee's job duties, and\n       (ii) the employer fails to provide protection of the safety \n     and health of such employee, including failing to provide \n     appropriate training and rescue equipment; or\n       (3)(i) such employee is employed in a workplace that \n     requires the employee to carry out duties that are directly \n     related to a workplace operation where the likelihood of \n     life-threatening accidents is foreseeable, such as a \n     workplace operation where employees are located in confined \n     spaces or trenches, handle hazardous waste, respond to \n     emergency situations, perform excavations, or perform \n     construction over water; and\n       (ii) such employee has not been designated or assigned to \n     perform or assist in rescue operations and voluntarily elects \n     to rescue such an individual; and\n       (iii) the employer has failed to instruct employees not \n     designated or assigned to perform or assist in rescue \n     operations of the arrangements for rescue, not to attempt \n     rescue, and of the hazards of attempting rescue without \n     adequate training or equipment.\n       (4) For purposes of this policy, the term ``imminent \n     danger'' means the existence of any condition or practice \n     that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious \n     physical harm before such condition or practice ban be \n     abated.\n  And I close the quote there.\n  Is that not refreshing to know what the good Samaritan must know \nbefore he or she rescues somebody's life?\n  Mr. President, I think that is the kind of thing that, if it came up \nhere for a 45-day look, we could say, ``I don't think so.''\n  I do not think we really need to go into all that detail. I do not \nthink we really need to have everybody in America read this in case \nthey would become a good Samaritan and rescue somebody in serious, \nserious condition.\n  These are the kind of things that are driving small businesses, \nindividuals in all walks of life nuts in this country today.\n  Another example: The head of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration testified before Congress the horror stories were not \ntrue. He testified OSHA does not require material safety sheets for the \nnormal use of consumer products, and workers must be informed of risks \nonly when they are regularly exposed to high levels of substances that \nactually pose health risks.\n  This is a copy of a citation issued last July to a specialty food \nshop in Evanston, IL, for a serious violation and a proposed $2,500 \nfine. What is the violation? The company did not have a written hazard \ncommunication program. The primary chemicals used are used in the \nkitchen and bathroom areas. The chemicals used that were so dangerous \nwere not limited to but included automatic dishwashing detergent and \nbleach. And for failure to have a hazardous notification--this is a \nserious violation and ``the employer did not develop, implement and/or \nmaintain at the workplace a written hazard communication which \ndescribes how the criteria will be met.''\n  As I said, the primary chemicals used were automatic dishwashing \ndetergent and bleach. My goodness, I used automatic dishwashing \ndetergent this \n[[Page S4638]] morning. I did not have a hazard notification. Am I in \nimminent danger? I do not think so.\n  But, Mr. President, businesses across the country, small companies, \nare in imminent danger of being hit with a $2,500 fine if they do not \nhave that kind of written hazardous communication warning them about \ndishwashers and bleaches and automatic detergent.\n  I think these problems are what the bill, as amended by the Nickles-\nReid amendment, intends to fix. Under this bill, Congress is held \naccountable, as it should be, for delegating responsibility to \nimplement regulations. This measure would give Congress 45 days to \nreview significant regulations and to pass a joint resolution of \ndisapproval to block the implementation. The 45-day layover adds to the \nchecks and balances between the legislative branch and the executive \nbranch by bringing back to Congress major regulations so that we can \nsee if they really do what we meant and, second, if we meant what we \nsaid, and, third, are they unnecessarily restrictive or proscriptive?\n  Too long we in Congress have taken the credit for solving problems. \nWe have somebody come in and talk about regulations and we say, ``Oh, \nwell, I'll get after somebody and we won't have to have you comply with \nthat particular provision.'' But rather than try to come in after, \nwould it not make sense for us to take a good hard look up front? That \nis what Congress needs to do.\n  Frankly, I think that a 45-day period before Congress will have a \nvery salutary effect because I just believe that many people in the \nexecutive agencies are getting the message: We are going to start \ntaking a look at what you write, and if you do not want it to be \noverturned, let us make it simple. Do not write it so complicated that \npeople cannot understand it.\n  I have a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development notice to \nrenters on lead-paint poisoning. These are all single-spaced sheets. \nThere are four sheets. You tell me somebody who may be getting \nassistance in housing is going to be able to read all that and \nunderstand it? I tell you, I have gone through it and I have gotten \nlost and I have had some training, supposedly, in reading regulations.\n  I do not think that we are serving our people well when we put \nburdens of tremendous regulations on them, kill a lot of trees to boot \nand wind up with systems that often do not make any sense.\n  I believe one of the messages that the people of America gave us in \nNovember 1994 was: Enough is enough, get off our back. Stop weighing us \ndown with these kinds of overly restrictive, proscriptive regulations.\n  Regulations to protect health and safety, simple ones that people can \nunderstand, that is fine. We anticipate those when we pass legislation \ncalling for regulations. It is time that we in Congress got back into \nthe process and made sure that we stop some of this idiocy before it is \nplaced on the backs of an already overburdened economy, dragged down by \nmore than $600 billion worth of regulatory burden each year.\n  For small businesses, the burden is disproportionately high. No one \ncan say how many new small businesses were never started, or new \nproducts that never get developed, or how many jobs are destroyed \nbecause of the burden of regulations out of control.\n  One group that thrives on the confusion and fear of regulators is \nregulatory consultants. All across this country consultants profit from \nhelping businesses, especially small businesses, navigate the \nregulatory maze and figure out how to comply. A new and complex \nregulation is a boon to these consultants. In the environmental sector, \nthe consulting market was estimated at $9 billion on 1993 by Farkas, \nBerkowicz & Co., a Washington-based consulting firm. These firms also \nconduct mock OSHA inspections and make inquiries to OSHA for their \nclients. Businesses do not want to call OSHA themselves because they \nare fearful it would trigger an inspection and fines. These are \nbusinesses who want to comply and are trying hard to comply, but are \ntoo afraid to call the agency themselves.\n  Congress has been unaccountable for the burdens it creates. Most of \nthe regulatory burden results from the ways laws are written here in \nCongress. Let me quote from the special report on regulatory overkill \npublished by the Kansas City Business Journal:\n\n       The Congress passes laws in a very sloppy manner. They \n     don't spell things out in great detail the way they should, \n     because that requires hard work and technical expertise, and \n     those are two things that are in short supply in Congress.\n\n  Congress' reliance on agency bureaucrats to flesh out lawmakers' \nintentions gives unelected officials vast discretionary powers, but \n``oftentimes regulators are confused about what Congress wants and then \nCongress loses control over what regulators do. The regulators \nprescribe very unworkable solutions, and Congress says that's not what \nwe had in mind, but by then, we're all stuck with the regulations.''\n\n       Lost jobs, businesses that can't grow, products that can't \n     be developed, a loss of research and development. All of \n     these are fundamental dangers that affect not just business, \n     but ultimately every citizen in this country if the system is \n     allowed to continue unchecked.\n  That problem, Mr. President, is what this bill seeks to fix. Under \nthis bill, Congress is held accountable for the regulations that result \nfrom the laws it passes. The Nickles-Reid substitute will give Congress \n45 days to review significant regulations and a chance to pass a joint \nresolution of disapproval to block implementation.\n  The Nickles substitute brings accountability to Congress and the \nFederal agencies.\n  The 45-day layover adds to the checks and balances between the \nlegislative branch and the executive branch by returning major \nregulations to Congress to see if they match congressional intent.\n  For too long Congress has taken the credit for solving the crisis of \nthe hour--but when the check comes due, Congress has ignored the costs \nto States, cities, business, and individuals--no more.\n  This makes Congress accountable for its laws--many of our \nenvironmental laws do not allow the agency to take costs into \nconsideration. Example: RCRA requires EPA to issue rules for land \ndisposal of hazardous wastes that establish treatment standards using \nthe best demonstrated available technology without regard for cost or \nrisk.\n  This makes Federal agencies accountable for their rules--too often \nEPA ignores the discression it has. Example: The Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990 required major sources of hazardous air pollutants \nto engage in enhanced monitoring. EPA has taken these two words into a \nhuge new regulatory program. EPA estimates the proposed rule would \ncover 30,000 sources at 10,000 facilities at a cost of over $1 billion. \nThis is not for emissions reductions, it's just for monitoring.\n  This forces us to confront antiquated laws--sometimes the facts of \nthe situation changes, so today the law means something quite different \nthan when it was passed. Example: When the Delaney clause was adopted \nin 1958, we were measuring contaminants in parts per million, today \nwe're measuring in parts per billion or parts per quadrillion. The \nadvance in technology has converted the Delaney clause from a \nreasonable rule to a ridiculous one.\n  A vote for the Nickles amendment is a vote for accountability in \nCongress and the agencies.\n  Who can disagree with that? If a majority in Congress believe a \nregulation should not be put in place to implement a law passed by \nCongress, then proper oversight action should be taken. Congress might \nweigh the consequences of the laws it passes and must ensure that \nregulatory agencies do not overstep the boundaries set by Congress. \nCongress delegates a great deal of decisionmaking authority to the \nregulators and if the regulators abuse that power, Congress should have \nthe power to act quickly and decisively.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the Nickles-Reid amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nDorgan is not ready yet, so I am going to go forward.\n  First, I want to thank my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond. I am \n\n[[Page S4639]] privileged to serve with Senator Bond as cochair of the \nregulatory reform task force that is trying to put some common sense \ninto the regulations of our country, trying to bring them under \ncontrol.\n  Senator Bond and I are having a good time, actually. He has given \nsome of the examples that we have found from ordinary citizens and \nsmall business people who are fed up to here with the overregulation of \nour country, and I applaud him for his efforts. I appreciate the fact \nthat he has just read all of the regulations that are stacked on his \ndesk. I am sure it was great bedtime reading.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nickles regulatory review \nsubstitute bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. Senator \nBond and I and Senator Nickles have been working for months, really, \ntrying to see what we could do to give the business people and the \nindividuals in our country some relief. In fact, Congress passes laws \nand they delegate the implementation to the regulators. But if the \nregulators do not do what is envisioned by the Congress, it is our \nresponsibility to step in and to say, ``No, this is not really what we \nintended. In fact, Congress intended for you to go in this direction.''\n  This bill will inject some democracy into what has been an \nincreasingly arbitrary regulatory process. Americans have the right to \nexpect that their Government will work for them, not against them. \nInstead, Americans have had to fight their Government to drive their \ncars, graze cattle on their ranches, build a porch on their homes, or \noperate their small businesses in a reasonable, commonsense manner.\n  This legislation would provide lawmakers with a tool for ensuring \nthat Federal agencies are, in fact, carrying out Congress' regulatory \nintent properly and within the confines of what Congress intended and \nno more.\n  Agencies have gotten into the habit of issuing regulations which go \nso far beyond the intended purpose we hardly recognize them anymore. \nThis bill is simply an extension of the system of checks and balances \nwhich has served our country so well for more than two centuries.\n  In November, the message came loud and clear from the voters of \nAmerica: ``We're tired of bigger Government; we are tired of business \nas usual in Washington, DC, and we are tired of the arrogance that we \nsee in our Federal Government.''\n  Nothing demonstrates that arrogance more than the volumes of one-\nsize-fits-all regulations which pour out of this city and impact on the \ndaily lives of American people. The voters went to the polls because \nthey felt harassed by the Government that issues these regulations \nwithout considering the impact on small business.\n  The egregious stories about the enforcement of some of these \nregulations have become legendary, and the people are asking us to call \na timeout, and that is what we are doing today.\n  Common law has always relied on a reasonable-person approach. The \nstandard behind our laws should be what would a reasonable person do in \nthese circumstances?\n But many of our Federal regulations have been designed to dictate the \nway in which a person, reasonable or otherwise, must act in every \nsingle situation, something that is impossible to do. In short, we must \nmake reasonable persons not an oxymoron in this country. We have \nliterally taken the common sense out of the equation and completely \nfailed to allow for the application of common sense. It is for that \nreason that this debate is dominated by example of Government \nregulators out of control.\n\n  When you have the city of Big Spring, TX, being forced to spend $6 \nmillion to redesign its reservoir project, to protect the Concho snake, \nwhich they are told is endangered, only to find out that the Concho \nsnake is not really endangered after all, but after they have spent the \n$6 million, you find the unreasonable man coming to the forefront.\n  When you have a plumbing company in Dayton, TX, cited for not posting \nemergency phone numbers at a construction site, and the construction \nsite is three acres of empty field, and OSHA actually shut the site \ndown for 3 days until the company constructed a freestanding wall in \norder to meet the OSHA requirement to post emergency phone numbers on \nthat wall. Or when the Beldon Roof Co. in San Antonio, TX, is cited for \nnot providing disposable drinking cups to their workers, despite the \nfact that the company went to the additional expense of providing high-\nenergy drinks free to their employees in glass containers, which the \nemployees in turn used for drinking water. In this case, you have a \ncompany going the extra mile and being cited because they did not meet \na lesser standard.\n  What about when the EPA bans the smell of fresh bread from the air \nand forces bakeries, like Mrs. Baird's, to spend $5 million for a \ncatalytic converter to take that smell out of the air? Or the case of \nMrs. Clay Espy, a rancher from Fort Davis, TX. She allowed a student \nfrom Texas A to do research on plants on her ranch. He discovered a \nplant which he thought to be endangered and reported his findings. The \nDepartment of the Interior subsequently told Mrs. Espy that she could \nno longer graze her cattle on the ranch on which her family had grazed \ncattle for over 100 years because her cattle might eat this particular \nweed. It took a lawsuit and an expenditure of over $10,000 before the \nDepartment reversed its ruling and declared that the weed was in fact \nnot endangered.\n  And then there is Rick's High-Tech Auto Motive Service in Katy, TX; \nthey have eight employees. Ten months ago, he spent $30,000 purchasing \na console analyzer and an additional $3,500 in training. But new EPA \nregulations came out for inspection and maintenance which pulled the \nrug out from under him, and he will now have to fire at least two \nemployees.\n  And Howard Goldberg in El Paso, TX, owns Supreme Cleaners. Two years \nago, he bought all new equipment. When the State implementation program \nmandated that he install recovery dryers, it cost him an additional \n$19,000 and rendered his new equipment totally useless and also \nunsalable. He is a dry cleaner. He is a small business person.\n  These numerous horror stories which have come forward since we began \nour efforts for regulatory reform provide evidence of a Government out \nof control. It demonstrates the need to introduce common sense and \nreasonableness into the system where these qualities are sorely \nlacking.\n  That is why one of the messages sent by the American people in 1992, \nand again in 1994, was: We have had enough. Fix this.\n  The question is: Have the people in Washington heard the message? \nWill it take this time? I am not sure, because I am not sure some \npeople in Washington yet realize the frustration level of people in \nAmerica. With this bill, we are sending a message to America: Signal \nreceived.\n  It is going to be difficult, but we are going to reverse this \ndisastrous trend. Our goal must be to put the Federal Government's \nfinancial house in order, decrease the size of the Federal Government, \nreturn Federal programs to the States, reauthorize the 10th amendment \nof the Constitution of this country, which said that the Federal \nGovernment will have limited powers and everything else will be left to \nthe States and to the people.\n  The Federal Government was supposed to be a strong, but small, \nefficient Government, with very limited powers, and I think we have \ngone in the other direction.\n  What are the stakes here? Mr. President, if we are going to be able \nto compete in the new global economy, we must change the regulatory \nenvironment and the litigation environment so our businesses can \ncompete.\n  To put this in perspective, for business, the cost of complying with \ncurrent Federal regulations is $430 billion a year. The overall cost to \nthe economy of regulatory compliance, if you put the mandates on State \nand local governments, is $900 billion. Now, to put that in \nperspective, our income tax brings in approximately $700 billion. So \nwhen you are writing out your taxes in the next few weeks, look at the \nstealth tax that is on top of the bill that you are paying, and that is \ngoing to be double--double--what you are writing the check for, and \nthat is the real Federal encroachment on your life.\n  We need to let people manage their own lives and their own money \ninstead of having Washington do it, I think we \n[[Page S4640]] are perfectly capable of giving it to the American \npeople.\n  We need to turn the regulatory engines around. The Nickles substitute \nis an important first step on the road to regulatory reform in this \nprocess.\n  I have been working on this legislation with Senator Nickles and \nSenator Bond for years. I hope my colleagues will side with the \nAmerican people, who have called on us to get the bureaucracy under \ncontrol and vote in favor of a bill that will begin to tell the \nAmerican people that we got the message in November 1994, and we are \ngoing to do something about it.\n  Mr. President, that is the mission. That is what we must do. We must \nshow the people of this country that things are changing in Washington, \nDC, that they are getting the message inside the beltway and relief is \non the way. That is what this bill will do. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the previous \ntwo speakers, and I have also listened today to Senator Glenn from Ohio \nwho has spoken on this subject, as well as the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, and others.\n  This subject is regulations. I suspect it is safe to say that not \nmany people like regulations. It is also safe to say that the fewer \nregulations probably the better, for most parts of our country. \nHowever, there are certain specific areas I think most people would say \nwe want to make sure the regulations are there and work. For example, \nthere are important regulations relating to air safety. I have flown \nsome in my life. I have not flown nearly as much as the Senator from \nOhio who has his own plane and has orbited the Earth, as a matter of \nfact. He understands when you take off with a bearing and leave the \nground there are certain regulations about at what height you can stay.\n  If a plane is flying east, it can fly at a certain altitude. If it is \nflying west, it can fly at another altitude. It may or may not be \ncumbersome, but it is comfortable when flying east to understand the \nperson flying west is not flying at your same altitude.\n  That is a regulation, and one that is perfectly reasonable, of \ncourse. There are a lot of regulations in our country that have grown \nof public need.\n  I was reading the other day about the early 1900's--1904, 1905, \n1906--when there were scandals in this country about the quality of \nmeat, and some stories about some meatpacking plants. The plants were \ninfested with rats. In order to get rid of the rats in the meat factory \nplant, they put out bread laced with poison. So the rats would eat the \nbread laced with poison, and the poison would kill them. The dead rats \ncame out of the same shoots as the meat, and of course the public \nscandal was that that injured the people of this country, and citizens \nfinally wanted to know what they were eating. Were they eating beef, or \npork, or chicken, or rat, or poison, or poisoned bread, for that \nmatter?\n  From that grew a series of increasingly tough standards with respect \nto meatpacking in this country. Finally, when people began to purchase \nmeat from the grocery store shelves, they understood that this was \ninspected. It was produced under certain conditions that required \nsafety and cleanliness. And people had some confidence in that product.\n  Those series of regulations now over nearly 80 or 90 years were born \nnot of someone's interest in interfering, but were born of the interest \nin public health and safety. That is true of a lot of regulations.\n  It is also true, as previous speakers have alleged, that regulations \noften become oppressive, and regulations that flow from well-intended \nlaw become regulations that do not make any common sense when issued, \nand are not able to easily be complied with by mom and pop businesses \non the Main Streets of our country.\n  In many cases, regulations have caused substantial anger and \nsubstantial anxiety. I think that unreasonable and excessive regulation \nhas caused a lot of people to go very sour on the subject of Government \nitself.\n  I do not disagree at all that if we miss the message in the last \nelection, we missed something important. The message in the last \nelection is that American people want some change. Among the important \nchanges that this Congress will offer shall be changes with respect to \nFederal regulations.\n  There is a right way to do that and a wrong way to do that. Some \nwould say that we should just throw everything out. They contend that \nall regulations are essentially bad and we must get rid of them.\n  That is not, in my judgment, a thoughtful way to do it. In my \njudgment that is a very thoughtless way to approach it. A thoughtful \nway to do this is to decide that we need to make sure when decisions \nare made by the U.S. Congress on the subject of clean air or clean \nwater or poultry inspection or dozens of other things that the American \npeople feel are important to their lives, that the rules and \nregulations that flow from that are rules and regulations that make \ncommon sense and that stick with the intent of the legislation itself.\n  Now we have a couple of proposals floating around, some of which I \nthink make a great deal of sense, and some of which make no sense at \nall.\n  I know Senator Glenn and Senator Levin have talked about the bill \nthat we dealt with in the Governmental Affairs Committee recently on \nthe subject of the regulatory moratorium. The proposal was, ``Gee, we \nhad this message in the last election. Regulations are essentially bad. \nSo let's have a moratorium and prevent any regulation from moving at \nthis point, until a date certain. Just throw a blanket over all of them \nand decide we will shut this down completely.''\n  Well, I did not support that. I do not think it made any sense. When \nthe moratorium bill was marked up in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, we raised a number of examples and offered amendments. It \nbecame clear to me that those who proposed the moratorium had no notion \nat all about what the consequences would be. Some of the consequences \nwould be just as inflammatory and detrimental as the consequences of \nsaying there is no problem here at all, and let the current \ncircumstance stand.\n  For example, we raised questions about many rules that are now in the \npipeline that really need to be issued. A regulation that deals with \nstandards on mammography. Should that not be issued? Sure, it probably \nshould be issued.\n  A rule that deals with improving inspection techniques for meat and \npoultry to prevent the loss of lives because of E. coli and other food \ncontaminates. We received testimony from a father who lost a son to E. \ncoli infected meat. He obviously believes very strongly we ought not \ninterrupt the process of making sure that regulations needed to improve \nthat area continue to move.\n  We should not have a moratorium on regulations that deal with that \nsort of thing. The moratorium bill would prevent timely issuance of \nrules needed to control the microbial and disinfection byproduct risks, \nsuch as cryptosporidium in our drinking water. The cryptosporidium \nissue came from recent outbreak in Milwaukee, WI, in which over 100 \npeople died and hundreds of thousands of people became ill.\n  Those are the kind of things that get prevented when we establish a \nmoratorium. We would interrupt very laudatory regulatory goals that we \nought not interrupt such as those dealing with nuclear waste, with work \nsafety, with seafood inspection, and a whole series of other things.\n  Let me give another example. If we say we will have no regulations at \nthis point, at all, I raise the question where there are some good \nregulations we want.\n  There is a regulation, for example, about to be issued allowing a \nlarger harvest of shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico because the previous \nregulated harvest can now be increased. There are more shrimp out \nthere. So by regulation, they will allow that to increase.\n  [[Page S4641]] I say to the proponents of the moratorium bill, would \nyou not want that to be able to proceed? Why should we have those folks \nout there making their living on shrimp be prevented from harvesting a \ngreater number of shrimp that now is deemed appropriate? We should not \nhave a moratorium on a regulation like that. That is a helpful \nregulation.\n  So, those are the kind of things when we propose a moratorium that I \nthink render the proposal of a moratorium pretty much a thoughtless \nproposal. That does not make much sense. It is sort of like saying we \ncannot differentiate, or we cannot distinguish, or we do not have the \ntime for judgment.\n  So, we will shut everything down. Shut down, then, the good with the \nbad. And we shut down a whole range of things that, I think, can in a \ndetrimental way affect people's daily lives.\n  That is why the moratorium bill I think is not being brought to the \nfloor. We raised a lot of these questions about it. We offered \namendments, almost none of which were accepted. And, interestingly \nenough, after it was passed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nover our objections the decision has been made, I think, that this \nmoratorium bill is probably not now a good idea.\n  Well, it is nice to see that that judgment was made. Now we can go on \nto some other things. We have since written another bill in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which deals with comprehensive reform of \nthe regulatory process which I did support, which Senator Roth, the \nchairman of that committee, and the ranking minority member, Senator \nGlenn supported. It makes eminent good sense.\n  It says Congress and Federal agencies must change the way we do \nbusiness on regulations. When we pass a law, and we decide we want to \ndo something that represents something good for this country, such as \nthe Clean Air Act, we want to make sure that the regulations that come \nfrom that are regulations that meet a common sense standard and are \nregulations that can conform to cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment made prior to the issuance of the regulation.\n  We will also have proposals on the floor of the Senate that provide \nfor a legislative veto so that significant regulations that are \nproposed by agencies would have to provide a time window by which the \nCongress review those regulations and decide to veto those regulations \nif the Congress said, ``This is not what we meant at all. This goes far \nafield from what this Congress intended,'' and we can veto those \nregulations.\n  Both of those approaches make good sense to me and are the right way \nto deal with the regulatory reform issue. Regulatory reform is not \nbeing debated as to whether we should have regulatory reform. The \ndebate is how. Those who bring the issue of the moratorium to the floor \nor through the committees, I think, have understood their remedy for \nhow to reform the regulations is an inappropriate remedy. This is why \nwe see them stalling on that and deciding they will not bring it.\n  The ``how'' that is appropriate, I think, are the two approaches on \ncost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, and the legislative veto \nthat are incorporated in the recently passed Governmental Affairs \nCommittee bill. I think this is a rare instance, and I would like to \nsee more instances, where Republicans and Democrats will join hands and \nagree that this makes good public policy. This makes good sense.\n  That is that we have here on the issue of regulations. This is not a \ncase of who can bring the biggest stack of regulations to the Chamber. \nI suppose as we debate these things we will have a wheelbarrow carting \nout all the regulations. Sign me up for saying some of them are dumb. \nSome of them make no sense. Sign me up for saying at least when I am \nflying at 5,500 feet, I want to know the guy flying in my direction is \nat 6,500 feet, because the regulation separates each plane by 1,000 \nfeet.\n  There are a lot of good regulations that are necessary for health and \nsafety for good living in our country. I certainly want to support \nthose at the same time as we try and streamline this whole area.\n  I was thinking as I was waiting to speak today, we have learned a \nlot. That also is what has caused Members to develop different \nstandards in our lives.\n  When I was a young boy, my father ran a gasoline station, and the \ngasoline station, like all gasoline stations in our country, would \naccept automobiles to do oil changes and lube jobs and so on. You would \nbring a car in and put it up on a hoist and drain the crankcase of oil, \nand we would put it in this big barrel. I lived in a town of 300 \npeople, with dirt streets. When barrel got full at my dad's station, \nour station and the other station in town, because there were two--that \nis called competition in a small town--both stations did a public \nservice with their used oil. When it was time and the barrel was full, \nmy dad would have me go get the little co-op tractor, hook it up to \nthis tank and they had a pipe across the back with some holes in the \npipe that you could unleash and then I would drive up and down Main \nStreet and drip that used car oil on Main Street of our hometown. So \ndid the other gas station, for that matter. So both of us were \nperforming a public service and everybody thought it was great because \nthat was blacktop, at least in our small town at that point. You would \ndrop used oil on Main Street to keep the dust down on Main Street. Of \ncourse now, if I were doing that, I suppose I would be sent to \nLeavenworth or somewhere. It really is a very serious felony offense.\n  Why? Because what we learned over the years is you destroy or you \ninjure your drinking water. This seeps into groundwater and you cause \nall kinds of human health problems.\n  So what we have done over the years is we have learned a lot about \nwater and air and safety. We have done a lot of very good things with \nrespect to regulations.\n  I was around one day in my father's station when a fellow named Pete, \nwho was kind of a handy guy, was working on a combine and Pete cut off \nall his fingers. I just happened to be there. There were no chain \nguards or anything on combines at that point. He was fixing a chain and \nthe chain around the sprocket--there were no safety features, no \nguards--he was trying to monkey with the chain, the thing engaged and \ncut off all his fingers. The nearest hospital was 50 miles away and my \nfather asked me to pick up all the fingers that were there. There was \nnot microsurgery then, I should say, but we took him and his fingers 50 \nmiles to a hospital. They could not reattach his fingers because we did \nnot know about microsurgery back then.\n  The fact is today he probably would not have cut off his fingers in \nthat combine because now they have chain guards and safety devices. All \nof that, yes, might be a nuisance for some people, but it is also \nsomething that saves fingers and hands and accidents. So we have made a \nlot of progress in a lot of these areas.\n  I again want to say I think the question about regulatory reform is \nappropriately asked, not whether we have regulatory reform, because all \nof us in this Chamber believe that we need to reform our regulatory \nsystem; the question is how?\n  The answer for me is that a moratorium is a relatively thoughtless \napproach and one in which we simply say, ``Let us not be thinking about \nthe specifics, let us sort of throw a blanket over all of it and not \nworry about what the consequences of it might be. Let us decide we \ncannot issue standards on mammographies, mammogram machines. Let us \ndecide we cannot issue standards on the regulation of computer \nairlines. Let us decide we cannot do all of these things because we \nhave decided a moratorium is the right approach.''\n  A moratorium is not the right approach. The right approach is for us \nto do what we have done already in a risk assessment bill and for us \nalso to decide that we can, even as we look at regulatory reform, do \nsome things that I think will get the agencies to understand that risk \nassessment must relate to regulation, to the consequences of the \nregulation for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/27/senate-section/article/S4604-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4641-S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I see the minority leader is here. If he \nwill indulge me for about 2 more minutes, I \n[[Page S4642]] would like to make one additional point on another \nsubject today because I think it is important. I wanted to make it last \nweek but I did not. I was not able to. I want to make it today.\n  Last week it was announced that the January trade deficit, the \nmerchandise trade deficit, in our country was $16.3 billion, the worst \nin our history.\n  The reason I mention that is we have seen great angst on the floor of \nthe Senate and the House about the Federal budget deficit, and it is an \nenormously important problem for our country, which we must address. \nBut it is almost a conspiracy of silence with respect to the trade \ndeficit. We are suffering the worst trade deficit in human history in \nthis country. The merchandise trade deficit is terrible and it is \ngrowing, higher than it has ever been. It relates to jobs moving from \nour country overseas.\n  I want to show my colleagues just two charts. The January trade \ndeficit shows our trade problems with China and Japan and Mexico have \nall grown. There is not one major trading partner with which this \ncountry does business where we now have a positive trade balance--not \none. Japan is well over $65 billion a year. We have a trade deficit \nwith Japan of $65 billion a year. With China, we now have a trade \ndeficit of nearly $30 billion a year. You can see what has happened. It \nhas grown exponentially. This is an outrage. This means the loss of \nAmerican jobs and American opportunity.\n  You can see what is happening with Mexico. This chart simply reflects \nthe January balance. Multiply it by 12. We start with a surplus, 1992; \n1993 a small surplus, 1994 a minuscule surplus. Now in January of this \nyear we have the first deficit. If you multiply that deficit by 12, you \nwill find out what some of us who opposed NAFTA have said for a long, \nlong while. We are going to be stuck with a big trade deficit with \nMexico.\n  The fact is the devaluation of the peso has meant American goods are \nmuch, much more expensive in Mexico and Mexican goods are much, much \ncheaper here in the United States.\n  I might also observe that the trade deficit with Japan--and I do not \nhave a chart on that at this point--the trade deficit with Japan has \nincreased at the very time the dollar has fallen against the yen to \nsome of its lowest levels ever.\n  This trade strategy is not working. It is a bipartisan failure. This \ncountry needs a new Bretton Woods Conference that takes trade out of \nforeign policy and decides to stand up for the interests of this \ncountry. Not protectionist, not building walls, but to decide that this \ntrade strategy hurts America and one-way trade rules that allow our \ncountry to be a sponge for everything everyone makes and allow their \ncountries to keep American goods out is a trade strategy that we must \nstop.\n  It is time for us to decide, nearly 50 years after the end of the \nSecond World War, that our trade policy ought not be a foreign policy. \nOur trade policy ought to be to stick up for the economic interests of \nAmericans: producers, workers, entrepreneurs, risktakers. They deserve \nthis country to stick up for their interests and demand fair trade--not \npreferential trade, fair trade. Fair trade from Japan, fair trade from \nChina, fair trade from Mexico, fair trade from all of our trading \npartners. Anything less than that, in my judgment, is failing this \ncountry.\n  As I said, I think there is almost a conspiracy of silence about the \nworst trade deficit in human history. I do not understand why. Our \nTrade Ambassador, Mickey Kantor, is the best we have had since I have \nbeen in Washington, DC. He has taken on Japan and taken on China. But, \nstill the problem gets worse with both China and Japan. I hope one of \nthese days we can find others who feel as I do that that trade strategy \nis hurting this country and there is a better way and a new day to set \nthis country right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/27/senate-section/article/S4641-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4642-S4655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REGULATORY TRANSITION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me commend the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota for his comments on both issues. I will talk more about trade on \nanother day, but certainly what the Senator said about the wisdom of \nthe moratorium could not be better said. I appreciate his leadership \nand that of the distinguished ranking member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, who is on the floor now and who has already \ndiscussed this matter at some length.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say, it is accurate to say that \nthe moratorium is dead. There is no moratorium. It is over. There will \nnot be a moratorium in spite of whatever decisions or promises the \nHouse may have made. The clear recognition in the Senate is that the \nmoratorium is worse medicine than the disease itself, that the cure in \nthis case is too broad, too problematic, and far too imprudent for us \nto support. So the moratorium is over. It is dead. I am very pleased \nthat legislation is now pending to replace this moratorium that will be \ndebated tomorrow.\n  Let me say, if it reappears, then I am confident that Members, at \nleast on this side of the aisle in this Chamber, will again kill it. \nEveryone recognizes we must deal with problematic regulations. Everyone \nrecognizes that this is not a partisan issue, that indeed we have to \nconfront the proliferation of regulation and recognize that there are \nsome which simply do not make sense.\n  Bringing balance and common sense to the regulatory process is \nsomething Democrats have argued for a long time. With bipartisan \nsupport, the Governmental Affairs Committee approved just last week a \nbetter and more meaningful way to address regulatory problems. As I \nunderstand it, the Judiciary Committee and the Energy Committee are \nmeeting this week to do the same thing. So by the end of the week, \nthree committees of the Senate will have done what we should do: \nDevelop a framework to analyze and address many of the problems that \nhave proliferated as a result of irresponsible regulation.\n  In my view, that is what we should do. That is the subject of the \nPresident's review that will be made available to us before the end of \nJune, and I am very pleased that the White House as well as the \nCongress is working on this in a very comprehensive way.\n  Comprehensive reform is what is necessary, not the shortsighted, \nsimplistic approach recommended by some of our Republican colleagues, \nespecially on the House side.\n  So the moratorium is dead. And I think that this week we can come up \nwith a meaningful way to achieve regulatory reform. Hopefully, this \nwill be the first in a two-step process, one that provides us with an \nopportunity to deal with regulations in a meaningful way.\n  Frankly, we could have accomplished comprehensive reform in one step. \nWe could have done it at a later date, once we have had a more thorough \ndebate. That would have been my preference. But certainly, this can \nwork. I think there is broad base of support for examining alternatives \nto the moratorium and we will begin that process tomorrow.\n  I think the Reid-Nickles legislation can give us an opportunity to \nreview regulation in a selective and meaningful way. It can at least \nbegin to address some of the problems that many of us have articulated \nwith regard to reform for some time.\n  Again, the way to accomplish regulation reform is not through a \nsweeping moratorium that halts the progress of the good along with the \nbad. We should always be wary of temporary ``one-size-fits-all'' \nsolutions that do not address the underlying source of the problem. It \nis an approach that will have unintended negative consequences. It is \nour responsibility here in the Congress to distinguish between the \nrules that are good and necessary and those that must be fixed or \nscrapped altogether. Clearly, the authors of the moratorium do not seem \nto feel such a need and would stop even those rules that would have \nbroad-based support. That is what I would like to address this \nafternoon.\n  I would like to cite a few examples of the kinds of rules that a \nmoratorium would have stopped, had it passed. Fortunately, because the \nmoratorium, as I said is dead, we do not have to worry about it. But \nhad a moratorium been passed, these types of rules would have been \ndetrimentally affected. I want to address those briefly this afternoon.\n  [[Page S4643]] First of all, our meat and poultry inspection process, \nas everyone understands, is outdated and unable to satisfactorily \ndetect bacterial contamination. The results, as we have seen, can be \nlethal.\n  In the last Congress, I was chairman of the Agriculture Nutrition \nSubcommittee and Research, Conservation, Forestry, and General \nLegislation. We conducted four hearings to explore the issue of meat \nand poultry inspection in this country.\n  At every one of these hearings, there was a clear consensus that we \nmust modernize our meat and poultry inspection system. During the \nhearing we uncovered a number of troubling facts. For example, it has \nbeen estimated that major bacterial pathogens are responsible for up to \n5 million illnesses and 4,000 deaths annually. Foodborne illness attack \npersons at a greater risk such as children and the elderly. In the \nPacific Northwest four children died after eating contaminated meat, \nwhile hundreds became ill.\n  That tragic event prompted everyone involved in this issue to seek a \nmore sensitive and responsible alternatives to the current meat and \npoultry inspection system--one that would prevent such a tragedy from \nevery happening again. In fact, the American meat industry even \npetitioned USDA to propose a new rule.\n  The current meat and poultry inspection system is based upon sight \nand smell and cannot detect the presence of some deadly human \npathogens. To correct this problem, the Department of Agriculture on \nFebruary 3 proposed a regulation to improve the inspection of meat and \npoultry.\n  This rule is the product of several years' worth of debate with the \nscientific community and food industries. As we all know, the \nmoratorium would substantially delay this rule. In the meantime, how \nmany more outbreaks will occur? How many more children will become ill \nand perhaps die?\n  Americans enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply in the \nworld. But it can and should be improved. Adopting a science-based meat \nand poultry inspection process is an important step. The ill-conceived \nand politically motivated moratorium must not be used to delay \nimplementation of this long-overdue regulation.\n  The same can be true of seafood inspection.\n  Mr. President, on January 28, the Food and Drug Administration \nproposed a rule to improve the inspection of seafood. This is a \nsensible thing to do, given the desire on the part of most of us to \nhave the safest food supply possible, but the moratorium would block \nit. Apparently, either those who push this regulatory moratorium are \nunwilling to support the changes necessary to have a safer food supply, \nor the moratorium will have the unintended consequence of stopping yet \nanother reasonable and necessary rule. I find neither case acceptable.\n  The rule, which is based on the same principles used to overhaul the \nmeat and poultry inspections, is designed to better ensure the safe \nprocessing and importing of fish and fish products.\n  The rule will benefit both the seafood industry and consumers. The \nindustry will benefit, as consumers will have greater confidence in \nseafood products, leading them to purchase greater quantities of \nseafood, while consumers will benefit by having access to safer fish.\n  Unless this rule is covered by the safety and health exception--and \nit is far from clear that it is--then the moratorium will stop this \nrule in its tracks.\n  Are we willing to play politics with our food supply, needlessly \nendangering the public in order to score a few cheap political points? \nOr are we going to take responsibility for the health of Americans and \nacknowledge that many of these rules like the seafood safety rule, make \nsense and should move forward?\n  The same can be said about head injuries. Mr. President, the \nDepartment of Transportation has issued a rule requiring protection \nagainst head impacts in the upper interior of cars, light trucks, and \nlight multipurpose passenger vehicles. Each year we delay implementing \nthis rule, 1,000 Americans will lose their lives and several hundred \ncrippling head trauma injuries will occur.\n  The costs associated with these injuries will continue to drive up \nhealth care costs, insurance rates, and time away from work for injured \nvictims.\n  The greatest tragedy is that these deaths and injuries will have been \nprevented if the regulations had been kept in place. The moratorium \nwould, at a minimum, delay this rule from taking effect for many \nmonths, costing what otherwise would have been preventable deaths and \ninjuries. Is that the result intended by the authors of this \nmoratorium? I cannot believe that it is.\n  Third, with respect to radioactive waste, although we have identified \nsafer alternatives for nuclear waste disposal, that continues to \nrepresent a very serious problem. In spite of the fact that we are \nmaking progress, serious problems continue to exist with regard to how \nwe dispose of nuclear wastes in the future.\n Efforts have been underway for years to identify better places and \npractices that would assure the safe disposal of nuclear waste for the \nmany thousands of years that the waste remains dangerous.\n\n  This year, after considerable deliberation and analysis, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency proposed long-awaited rules for the \ndisposal of nuclear waste. While I do not expect that we are at the end \nof our quest for safe nuclear waste disposal, these rules represent a \ngiant step in the right direction. This rule would apply in particular \nto the first national nuclear waste repository, the waste isolation \npilot project in New Mexico.\n  The nuclear power industry and the Defense Department, as well as the \nDepartment of Energy, are looking forward to these rules to help create \nadditional certainty and safety in the disposal of nuclear waste. The \nmoratorium would halt the implementation of these rules. Given the high \nstakes in this debate, including the public health issues, risks and \neconomic factors, does it make sense to place a moratorium on rules \nthat would move us closer to a means of more safely disposing of \nnuclear waste? I do not think so.\n  Finally, during the Governmental Affairs Committee markup, Senator \nGlenn offered an amendment to exempt from the moratorium Environmental \nProtection Agency regulations to control contamination and disinfection \nbyproducts in drinking water. As many of us remember, the city of \nMilwaukee not long ago experienced a serious outbreak of disease due to \ncontamination of the city's water supply. In 1993, a microscopic \nparasite known as cryptosporidium got into Milwaukee's drinking water \nsupply. Ultimately, the outbreak resulted in over 100 deaths and \n400,000 illnesses. There are numerous other cities that have \nexperienced the ravages of bacterial contamination in their water \nsupply. Just ask the people of Carrollton, GA; Cabool, MO; or Jackson \nCounty, OR. In the wake of these episodes, the committee nevertheless \nrejected the Glenn amendment. Given the recent experience of residents \nin Milwaukee and other areas, I cannot imagine how anyone could defend \nthe moratorium on regulations designed to protect the public water \nsupply from contamination.\n  So, Mr. President, let us be clear. The regulatory moratorium is not \na tool of genuine reform. It is a blunt tool of expediency and, if \nenacted, it would have serious negative consequences.\n  Fortunately, the moratorium, as I have said, is dead. Real reform \nrequires hard work. Real reform allows a serious consideration of \nproposals that will allow us to make a difference in the regulatory \nprocess by defining good from bad. And that is exactly what we want to \ndo here. We want to provide meaningful alternatives to the moratorium, \nand I believe that the so-called Nickles-Reid approach is a beginning \nin that effort. It allows us to assess in a more constructive way which \nregulations ought to be issued and gives us the opportunity to stop \nthose that are not well-intended or certainly are not prudent. But we \nwill get into that debate tomorrow.\n  My purpose in coming to the floor today is simply to say that the \nmoratorium is recognized here as something that cannot work, a blunt \ninstrument that in our view is far more serious in remedy than the \nactual problem that it is trying to cure.\n  So I am hopeful that as we go through this deliberative process, \nfirst with regard to the very limited nature \n[[Page S4644]] of the Nickles-Reid amendment, and then ultimately in a \nmore comprehensive way later on, we can deal with the regulatory \nproliferation as we know it should be dealt with, in a way that \nprovides us an opportunity to use discretion, and in a way that gives \nus an opportunity to make better decisions about regulations as they \naffect the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to respond just briefly to a \ncouple of comments made by the minority leader, Senator Daschle, my \nfriend from South Dakota.\n  I noticed he said the GOP moratorium. We are not debating moratorium \nbecause we do have the substitute to it, but in his charts he said it \nwould block better meat, poultry, and seafood inspection. I take issue \nwith that because I do not think it does.\n  I happen to be the sponsor of the moratorium bill, and, again, we are \ngoing to offer a substitute, something I think is even better. But we \ndo have exceptions. We have exceptions for imminent threat to health or \nsafety or other emergencies. That is determined by the President of the \nUnited States. Maybe Senator Daschle does not have any confidence in \nthe President of the United States, but we allow the President of the \nUnited States to make that determination.\n  It also says protection against head injuries and so on. Again, I \nthink if the President felt that was a threat to health and human \nsafety, he could exempt it. Or if he felt it was necessary for the \nenforcement of criminal laws, he could have exempted it. Or I heard \nsome comments about the Safe Drinking Water Act, or could not \ndifferentiate between good and bad.\n  Again, in the bill, on page 9 of the bill, it says the President \ncould exempt a regulation if he found that the regulation has as its \nprincipal effect fostering economic growth, repealing, narrowing, \nstreamlining rule regulation, administrative process, or otherwise \nreducing regulatory burdens. The President could exempt it. Senator \nDaschle mentioned safe drinking water. Again, if the President felt it \nwas necessary to enact such a regulation in order to save lives--I \nheard the comments of hundreds of lives or something--certainly the \nPresident would have that authority. As a matter of fact, we did not \nhave judicial review. His authority would have been accepted without \ncourt review or anything.\n  So I just mention that. We do not have to continue debating this \nbill. I know Senator Daschle said the moratorium is dead and now we are \nlooking at this more streamlined Nickles-Reid bill.\n  Let me compare this to the moratorium. The bill that Senator Reid and \nmyself are proposing is congressional review of all regulations. The \nmoratorium bill that passed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee \ndid not review all regulations. It reviewed only a small percentage and \nthen allowed the President to exempt those.\n  We started out with eight exemptions. The committee added another two \nor three and then had some exemptions on specific amendments. So there \nare like 10, at least 10 exemptions in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee but that only applied to significant regulations.\n  So for people to say that was so draconian and so unfair and so much \na terrible disaster, I would say the Nickles-Reid substitute is a lot \nmore comprehensive because it has the potential of stopping any \nregulation. It says Congress can review them. It puts the burden on \nCongress. Granted, the bill that was reported out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee had the responsibility on the executive agencies, had \nthe responsibility on the President of the United States. The President \nwould have to exempt those regulations, due to the following \nexemptions. Now it is on Congress if we are successful.\n  Congress has the responsibility--and I want to underline the word \n``responsibility,'' because Congress, in my opinion, in many cases has \nabdicated that responsibility. We have passed laws and then we forget \nabout them. We are busy. We do not have time to go in and actually \nfollow up and do congressional oversight. And so we pass the laws, and \nbureaucrats take over and enforce them and come up with the rules and \nregulations to make those things happen.\n  Now Congress is going to have some responsibility to review those \nrules. Particularly those rules that have significant impact, we are \ngoing to have to find out does the rule make sense? Is it a good idea? \nAnd maybe even some of those rules that do not have significant \nimpact--maybe they do not have to have $100 million of economic \nimpact--we should review those rules as well, and if our constituents \nare telling us that these rules are far too costly or too expensive or \nbureaucratic or too complicated to comply with, maybe we will listen to \nthem and maybe we will stop them. Maybe we will make the administration \nmore accountable. And I think it is one of the reasons why President \nClinton should support this legislation. I expect that he will. I \nexpect that he will sign this legislation because this will make the \nbureaucrats more accountable. They will know if they come up with a \nregulation, they cannot hide behind the legislation. They know that \nMembers of Congress can have them appear before the various committees \nand they will have to justify the regulations. If there is a serious \nopposition to it, they will have to justify it in such a way or else, \nif we can get a majority vote in both Houses, we can rescind it. We can \nrepeal it. We can stop it. We can reject it, as we should.\n  Mr. President, I know this chart behind me talks about the number of \npages that are in the Federal Register. It shows the growth that we had \nbasically during the Carter years in 1977, 1978, 1979, and in 1980, we \nreached an all-time high. We had actually 73,258 pages in the Federal \nRegister. It declined significantly under Ronald Reagan's term, fell \nall the way down at the end of his first term in 1984 down to 48,000-\nsome pages. In 1986, it reached the low point, I guess, of 44,821. In \n1988, it had gone up to 50,000. At the end of 1992--and I guess that \nwas the end of President Bush's term--we were up to 57,000. And under \nPresident Clinton's term, the first couple of years, the number of \npages has increased up to almost 65,000, and seems to be continuing to \nincrease.\n  A lot of these regulations are good and a lot of them are not good. A \nlot of them are not well thought out. Some of them need congressional \nreview.\n  The Senator from Montana talked about having a hearing in Montana a \ncouple weeks ago. Senator Burns talk about having a hearing dealing \nwith logging and had somebody from OSHA there who had actually been \ndesigning the rules and regulations and having that kind of oversight. \nWe need more of that. We need the regulators to know that they can be \nheld accountable by Congress and, if they pass or try to implement \negregious rules, that we can have the opportunity to overturn those in \nan expedited process.\n  This bill has bipartisan support. I think it is a good substitute. I \nthink it is a better substitute, frankly, than the underlying bill. I \nhappen to be involved in both of these. And I think this one, because \nit is permanent, because it has, I think, a very good chance of passage \nand signature by the President of the United States, Mr. President, I \nthink are very positive reasons why it should be enacted. I hope my \ncolleagues would concur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas pertaining to the introduction of S. 629 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 43 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I hate to take exception with my distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma, but he said that we are not debating the \nmoratorium bill. \n[[Page S4645]] Yes, we are. I hate to disagree, but we are. That is \nexactly what we are debating today. That is what is before us.\n  The proposed Nickles-Reid substitute is one that we will address \ntomorrow. I know that the debate today has gotten off on that subject a \nnumber of times.\n  The bill that was voted out of committee, S. 219, the moratorium \nbill, as proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma, with a few changes that \nwere made in the committee, was, as I understand it, almost exactly the \nsame as H.R. 450, the House bill that has already passed. And that is \nthe bill that we are addressing a lot of our concerns toward today, as \nwell as S. 219.\n  When the Nickles-Reid substitute comes up tomorrow, I may well vote \nfor that. I am not against the legislative veto. What I am concerned \nabout is the moratorium bill. The House passed a devastating bill that \nis basically the same as S. 219, and that is what we are debating \ntoday.\n  I want to run through some of the regulations that would be stopped \nunder a moratorium. I have about 40 minutes remaining, and I would like \nto go through some of these particular regulations that would be \nknocked out if we pass the House bill or if we passed a version that \nwould then go to conference and be changed according to the House bill.\n  So we are debating the moratorium today and not what may occur \ntomorrow or what may be addressed tomorrow.\n  Now what would be affected? Well, we would have a lot of regulations. \nI will not go through all of them here. We have about 120 of them we \ncould bring up. Some of them have already been mentioned today.\n  Shrimp harvesting that the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, \nLouisiana, and Texas want would be cut back. The final rule was \npublished on that December 28, 1994, so that would be affected.\n  Another one is on fisheries management under the Department of \nCommerce, National Marine Fisheries Service. The moratorium would \naffect all States with fisheries. The rules that would be affected \nrestrict the number of fish that commercial fishermen can catch in \ncertain fisheries each year.\n  They are based on scientific data and designed to allow for the \nmaximum take of fish, while at the same time preventing depletion of \nfish stocks. Depletion has been a serious problem in many fisheries \naround the country.\n  Beneficiary of the rule include all fishermen and the consuming \npublic. So the impact of S. 219 and H.R. 450 would be that many of \nthese management specifications were published after November 20, 1994, \nand a moratorium could suspend these specifications, potentially \nallowing unlimited fishing in these fisheries, which could lead to \nlong-term decline in the number of fish available for future fishing.\n  How about seafood safety administered by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and the Food and Drug Administration? What States will \nbe affected? All.\n  The rule: FDA is proposing regulations to utilize hazardous analysis \ncritical control point [HACCP] principles as a most effective way to \nensure the safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products. \nHACCP procedures can be used by food processors and importers. \nBeneficiaries of the rule include consumers and the seafood industry. \nConsumers will benefit from safer products and will gain additional \nhealth benefits by substituting seafood products in place of other \nmeats higher in fats and cholesterol.\n  The seafood industry will benefit from increased consumer confidence \nin safer seafood products and more uniform inspection procedures.\n  What would be the impact of S. 219 and H.R. 450? Unless this rule is \nincluded in a health and safety exception, passage of a moratorium bill \nwill prevent the implementation of a final rule, consumption of seafood \nmay continue to decrease, and consumers' lack of confidence in the \nsafety of seafood products would persist.\n  That proposed rule was published January 28 of this year, and the \nfinal rule is slated for publication in the summer of 1995. That would \nbe knocked out if H.R. 450 and S. 219 prevail.\n  Another issue: Noncitizen housing requirements of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  All States would be affected.\n  This rule would restrict HUD housing assistance to U.S. citizens, \nnationals, and certain categories of legal immigrants. The \nbeneficiaries of the rule would be citizens and legal immigrants who \nwould be deprived of limited available housing assistance.\n  What would be the impact of S. 219 and H.R. 450? U.S. citizens and \nlegal immigrants would be deprived of the limited housing assistance \noffered by HUD and, instead, this housing could be available to illegal \nimmigrants. That final rule was submitted to OMB on December 30, 1994.\n  Another issue: Continuation of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \nand Federal National Mortgage Association housing goals administered by \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  I believe in the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Senator from \nOklahoma asked that that be addressed and it was, but it is not in H.R. \n450.\n  All States would be affected.\n  The rule: By statute, HUD is required to establish housing goals to \ndirect the purchase of mortgages by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae on \nhousing for low- and moderate-income families, housing located in \ncentral cities, housing located in rural and underserved areas, and \nhousing meeting the needs of low-income families and very low-income \nfamilies.\n  In October 1993, HUD established these goals for 1993 and 1994. This \nrule extended into 1995 the 1994 housing goals pending the issuance of \na more comprehensive final rule.\n  Beneficiaries of the rule? Very low- to moderate-income families in \ncentral cities and rural areas and other underserved areas.\n  The impact of H.R. 450 and S. 219: A moratorium could put a halt to \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac meeting housing goals set by HUD in \naccordance with the law and in recognition of the responsibilities of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac under their charters. The needs of moderate-\n, low-, and very low-income families would not be served, and the \nopportunities for such families to purchase homes would be greatly \nreduced.\n  The final rule was published November 30, 1994, after the election.\n  Community development block grants is another issue also administered \nby HUD.\n  All States are affected by this.\n  The rule establishes guidelines to assist the community development \nblock grant recipients to evaluate and select economic development \nopportunities for CDBG funds. The rule also makes changes for the use \nof CDBG funds for economic development.\n  Who benefits from this rule? State and local communities who receive \nthese CDBG funds. The rule reduces administrative burdens on the \nrecipients and focuses on assisting residents of low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods.\n  The impact of H.R. 450 and S. 219: State and local governments will \nhave limited use of CDBG funds for economic development which will \nadversely affect the communities served by these State and local \ngovernments.\n  The final rule on this was published January 5, 1995.\n  We can see just from these few I read so far that if we agree to H.R. \n450 from the House or if we pass S. 219 here, which is what is before \nus at the moment, then, indeed, as the minority leader said a few \nmoments ago, we can assume, I think, that the moratorium is dead; the \nmoratorium is dead.\n  This is only a beginning. I have probably another 75 or so, and I \nwill not be able to go through all of them today, but I plan to go \nthrough a few more to show that I, too, believe that the moratorium is \ndead and that the more the American people know about what the \nmoratorium, H.R. 450 in the House, proposes and what S. 219, its \ncompanion bill here, which is before us today, proposes, the more they \nwill agree that these are ill-considered pieces of legislation and \nshould not have been proposed.\n  I think whatever changes we may make in this tomorrow and whatever \nbill we may wind up sending over to the House, I want the record to be \nfull and complete in the Senate that what would happen under that bill \nin the House, if we accepted it or if we accepted S. 219 here, would be \ndevastating to the lives of all individuals in many of \n[[Page S4646]] these different areas. I am just addressing a very, very \nfew on the floor today.\n  Another one out of the Park Service: Cruise ship access to Glacier \nBay.\n  Only Alaska is affected.\n  The rule: The Department of the Interior recently decided to allow \nincreased vessel traffic in Glacier Bay. New vessel management plan \nregulations are planned to implement this policy decision.\n  The beneficiaries of the rule include travelers to Glacier Bay, area \nbusinesses, cruise ship industry, and businesses in Alaska.\n  The impact of S. 219 and H.R. 450: A moratorium could delay the \nimplementation of this new policy, which could reduce the number of \npotential cruise ship passengers and diminish trade to businesses in \nthe area.\n  The rule is planned for publication during 1995.\n  Another one, administered by the Department of Labor, is the Family \nand Medical Leave Act regulations.\n  All States will be affected.\n  The regulation would implement the Family and Medical Leave Act of \n1993, which allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid \nleave a year for the birth of a child, adoption of a child, or to care \nfor a seriously ill relative.\n  The beneficiaries of the rule include both employers and employees, \nwho will benefit from the clarification and guidance provided in the \nfinal rules, including, for example, clarification of what a serious \nhealth condition really is.\n  The impact of H.R. 450 and S. 219, without the final rules: \nUncertainties raised by the law and the interim regulations would \nremain.\n  The final rules were published on January 6, 1995, and they will \nbecome effective on April 6, 1995.\n  Another one is under OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, on logging safety. All States are affected. This rule \naddresses the major causes of logger deaths and serious injuries by \nproviding safety provisions for chain saws, logging machinery, tree \nharvesting procedures, training, and personal protective equipment.\n  Logging companies are expected to benefit from over 4,000 fewer lost \nworkday injuries and a standardization of industry safety requirements. \nThis rule is expected to prevent an average of 111 logger deaths, 4,759 \nlost workday injuries, and 2,639 other serious injuries each year.\n  The impact of H.R. 450 or S. 219: The logging occupation has the \nhighest death rate of all occupations--14,000 per 100,000 workers--\nalmost three times the private sector rate. If S. 219 would pass, or \nH.R. 450 were to be accepted, it would allow continuation of the \ncarnage that now takes place in the logging industry. Most of the final \nrule went into effect on February 9, 1995, with 12 provisions of the \nfinal rule having been stayed until August 1995.\n  Another one is administered by the Labor, Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration. All the coal mining States would be affected. The rule \nrelates to the use of diesel-powered equipment in underground coal \nmines, which has mushroomed in the past 18 years, without special \nsafety and health regulations or equipment approval regulations \nnecessary to control fire hazards and health concerns of acute and \nlong-term exposure to diesel exhaust gases. This rule will provide \nbasic common sense standards for use of this potentially dangerous \nmachinery.\n  The beneficiaries of the rule are mine workers and mine operators.\n  State regulatory officials have strongly supported finalizing diesel \nregulations. Many mine operators have already begun implementing some \nimprovements in anticipation of the standard rule. The impact of H.R. \n450 or S. 219, a moratorium, would allow diesel equipment to continue \nto be used without specific regulation or safety controls.\n  In a 13-year period, there were 10 diesel-related fires investigated. \nSuspension of this rule would stall or halt the good-faith efforts that \nmany mine operators have begun to work toward in improving the use of \ndiesel equipment in underground coal mines. The final rule is to be \nissued in March 1995--this year. I do not know whether it has been \nissued yet or not.\n  Another one from OSHA is a rule to reduce exposure to tuberculosis in \nthe workplace. All States are affected. Based on the Centers for \nDisease Control recommendation, this proposed rule will protect \nemployees from occupationally acquired tuberculosis, for engineering \ncontrols, administrative controls, work practice controls, respiratory \nprotection, medical surveillance, and training. In order to reduce the \nregulatory burden on facilities with low incidence of TB, this rule \nwill be especially tiered on the basis of the location and type of \nfacility.\n  The beneficiaries of the rule will be the 4\\1/2\\ million workers \ncovered under this rule, and the employers who will have fewer lost \nworkdays to this disease. The impact of H.R. 450 or S. 219: Unless \nworkplace transmission of TB presented an imminent threat to health and \nsafety, a moratorium could prevent effective control of this virulent \ndisease, especially in high-risk workplaces and locations.\n  Another area that is covered by the Department of Transportation is \nstandardizing regulations for domestic shipments of hazardous \nmaterials. All States are affected. The rule standardizes regulations \nfor shipments of domestic hazardous materials, making them more \nconsistent with similar international regulations.\n  The beneficiaries of the rule are shippers and carriers of hazardous \nmaterials that are engaged in both domestic and international \nshipments. Without revisions to the final rule, carriers would have to \ncomply with differing rules for domestic and international shipments of \nhazardous materials.\n  The impact of S. 219 and H.R. 450: They would increase the cost of \ndoing business for international and domestic shippers and carriers of \nhazardous materials, placing an unfair burden on U.S. businesses. \nMoreover, requiring different regulations for domestic and \ninternational shipments may stifle exports of hazardous materials, \nwhich had a positive balance of trade of approximately $17 billion in \n1994. The rule was in effect as of January of this year.\n  Mr. President, we can go on with others. I would like to state a \ncouple more here in this area, and then I want to get over into some of \nthe nuclear matters.\n  Airworthiness directives were mentioned by Senator Dorgan a few \nmoments ago on the floor. These are administered by the FAA. All States \nare affected.\n  Periodically, the FAA issues airworthiness directives--AD's, as they \nare known as in the industry. They are designed to rectify potential \nsafety problems in aircraft--potential, not imminent.\n  Several examples of airworthiness directives that could be suspended \nare: Restrictions on the operation of the ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft in \nicing conditions following the October crash in Indiana that we \nremember from last year. Another revision to the airplane flight manual \nto prohibit takeoff in certain icing conditions unless either an \ninspection is performed or specific take off procedures are followed. \nThat is applicable to the Fokker F-28 model aircraft; inspection \nmodification of the tail cone release assembly of certain McDonnell \nDouglas aircraft to ensure that passengers can escape during an \nemergency evacuation; inspection and repair of landing gear brakes for \ncertain Airbus aircraft. This was prompted by an accident in which an \naircraft was unable to stop on a wet runway. Another one: Replacement \nof bolts, nuts, and washers that hold together parts of the wing flap; \nthe new attachments prevent failures that could cause the aircraft to \nroll over upon liftoff, and that is applicable to Boeing 757 aircraft. \nAnother requires measures to prevent the sliding cockpit side windows \nfrom rupturing in certain Airbus models. Failure to prevent that can \npotentially result in rapid decompression of the aircraft.\n  The impact of S. 219 and H.R. 450: The moratorium could prevent these \ntypes of directives from being issued. The safety concerns they \naddress, though significant, may not be sufficiently imminent--repeat, \nimminent--to qualify for an exception under S. 219.\n  I know we had discussions this morning about the President making his \nown judgments on these things, because Congress is apparently not \nwilling to define what it means by imminent.\n  These airworthiness directives were published after November 20, \n1994. They \n[[Page S4647]] are out there now. If S. 219, as it came out of \ncommittee, or H.R. 450, was accepted, those airworthiness directives \nwould not be in effect.\n  Standardization of aviation rules is another one that is put out by \nthe FAA or followed by the FAA. They standardize regulations between \nthe U.S. and European joint aviation authorities regarding flight \noperations, aircraft safety considerations.\n  Commuter airlines safety standards are another one where all States \nare affected. The proposed rule is supposed to be issued in March of \nthis year, with final rules planned for December 1995. The rule would \nupgrade the standards for commuter airlines to those of major \nairlines--something I am sure we all would like to see happen and not \nbe held up by any legislation such as this.\n  So once again, I say, when the minority leader came out a little \nwhile ago and made his statement that the moratorium is dead, I agree \nwith that. These are just a few of the things I have been running \nthrough here today. But the moratorium had better be dead, or we are \ngoing to have a great deal of discussion on this when it comes back \nfrom conference with the House, if the House moratorium legislation \nwould prevail, as was proposed in S. 219, which is before us today here \non the Senate floor.\n  This is not all on airplanes and on health and safety matters.\n  We also have Government securities, large position reporting required \nby the Treasury. The proposed rule for public comment was put out on \nJanuary 24 of this year.\n  Another is an agreement to establish water quality standards in the \nSan Francisco Bay delta area. The final rule was published January 24 \nof this year.\n  We go on and on. Reducing toxic air emissions, the Environmental \nProtection Agency rule allows industries--this is one industry wants--\nto obtain pollution credits for voluntarily reducing air pollution \nbefore they are required to by law. Thus, this rule allows interested \ncompanies--those who now want to invest in clean air--to take credit \nnow for early compliance.\n  So we get the benefits of cleaner air sooner. Everybody gets a \nbenefit of that. Industry wants that.\n  Twenty-one companies have applied for the program and 17 more have \nindicated an interest. This is the proposal that came out November 21, \n1994. The final is supposed to come out later this year. That would be \nheld up by any moratorium.\n  For lead poisoning prevention, most regulations and guidelines have \nbeen proposed, and are to be finalized in summer or fall. Lead is a \nthreat to children, regardless of family income, and adversely affects \nthe nervous system, kidney, the hematopoietic system, causing decreased \nintelligence, impaired neurobehavioral patterns, coma, convulsions, \nhypertensions, and even death in children. Regulations on these matters \nwould be held up if H.R. 450 or S. 219 would happen to prevail.\n  Mr. President, I would like to focus for a few minutes on the effects \na regulatory moratorium would have on an area which I have long been \nconcerned--health and safety as it pertains to nuclear facilities, \nnuclear cleanup, and radiation protection. As we shall see, the \nproposed moratorium will delay a number of important regulatory actions \nthat have been crafted to provide for the public's health and safety--\nin a cost-effective manner.\n  Let me start by making a basic observation. Radiation protection, \nnuclear safety, and radioactive cleanup are complex, technical issues. \nIt follows that the regulations governing these issues are also \ncomplex. To wield indiscriminately the meat ax of a regulatory \nmoratorium at the existing nuclear regulatory framework is precisely \nthe wrong way to go about improving this situation.\n  As currently proposed, the regulatory moratorium would delay the \nimplementation of many important nuclear-related regulations--from \nstandards for nuclear waste disposal to standards for cleaning up \nradioactively contaminated sites to rules for improving the safe \noperation of Government nuclear facilities to rules governing health \nstudies of contaminated or potentially contaminated populations.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not deny that the existing regulatory \nframework for radiation protection standards can be improved. But a \nmoratorium is not the way to do it. In fact, I have been working for \nsome time to improve the Federal radiation regulatory framework. I \nwould like to call my colleagues' attention to an October 27, 1994, \n``Dear Colleague'' letter which I sent to all Senators on this issue. I \nwould like to quote from the letter, and I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 1994.\n       Dear Colleague: I want to draw your attention to the \n     enclosed GAO report on federal radiation protection standards \n     and regulations (Nuclear Health and Safety: Consensus on \n     Acceptable Radiation Risk to the Public is Lacking (RCED-94-\n     190). the GAO finds that:\n       ``Historically, interagency coordination of radiation \n     protection policy, . . . has been ineffective. Time-consuming \n     and potentially costly dual regulation of nuclear licensees \n     has been an issue between EPA and the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC), and standards for major sources of \n     radiation have been lacking for years because interagency \n     disagreements have delayed the completion of regulations.'' \n     ``At present, it is apparent that agencies' radiation \n     standards and protective approaches ultimately reflect a \n     general lack of interagency consensus on acceptable radiation \n     risk to the public.''\n       Congressional concerns in this area are long-standing. In \n     1979, I introduced legislation that prompted the Carter \n     Administration to form a federal radiation policy council \n     (later dissolved by the Reagan administration). In 1982, I \n     again introduced legislation which, though never enacted, \n     helped spur formation of the Committee on Interagency \n     Radiation Research and Policy Coordination (CIRRPC), whose \n     primary purpose is to coordinate Federal radiation policy. \n     The enclosed report indicates that, while there has been \n     limited progress recently, much remains to be done.\n       A coherent, rational approach to these issues is long \n     overdue. By helping to rationalize this important area of \n     regulation, we will lighten the regulatory burden, streamline \n     the federal bureaucracy and, enhance public protection and \n     public confidence. Another clear benefit from a coherent, \n     consistent radiation protection regime will be a savings of \n     taxpayer dollars from the resulting efficiencies in Federal \n     facility cleanup.\n       I believe, consistent with GAO's recommendations, the EPA \n     should take the lead to develop a plan for broadening and \n     strengthening its ongoing radiation protection harmonization \n     effort. I have asked that the EPA report to me with a plan \n     for a path forward to rectify the current radiation \n     regulation regime.\n       Such a plan should be developed with input from effected \n     agencies, including the NRC, DOE, and DOD. Clearly, CIRRPC \n     should serve in a coordinating role to assist in this plan's \n     development. I have asked that this plan be developed prior \n     to the beginning of the 104th Congress. After reviewing the \n     interagency plan, I will consider whether any legislative \n     remedies may be necessary to create a coordinated approach to \n     this field of regulation.\n       Radiation protection standards affect our entire \n     population. I encourage you and your staff to read this \n     report, and would be interested in any comments you may have. \n     My Governmental Affairs staff contact on this issue is Chris \n     Kline (4-7954).\n       Best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Glenn,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, quoting from the letter:\n\n       Dear Colleague: I want to draw your attention to the \n     enclosed GAO report on federal radiation protection standards \n     and regulations (Nuclear Health and Safety: Consensus on \n     Acceptable Radiation Risk to the Public is Lacking (RCED-94-\n     190). The GAO finds that:\n       ``Historically, interagency coordination of radiation \n     protection policy, . . . has been ineffective. Time-consuming \n     and potentially costly dual regulation of nuclear licensees \n     has been an issue between EPA and the NRC, and standards for \n     major sources of radiation have been lacking for years \n     because interagency disagreements have delayed the completion \n     of regulations. At present, it is apparent that agencies' \n     radiation standards and protective approaches ultimately \n     reflect a general lack of interagency consensus on acceptable \n     radiation risk to the public.''\n\n  My letter continues by describing past executive and legislative \nefforts, including several pieces of legislation which I introduced, \nthe purpose of which was to coordinate Federal radiation policy. The \nGAO report describes some 26 radiation protection standards, rules and \nregulations, which, when taken together, still result in gaps, \noverlaps, and inconsistencies. In my view, and that of the GAO, the \nradiation protection framework is broken and needs to be fixed.\n  [[Page S4648]] That is why, Mr. President, on the same day I \ncirculated the ``Dear Colleague'' letter mentioned earlier, I wrote to \nAdministrator Browner of the EPA, Chairman, Selin of the NRC, and Dr. \nGibbons of OSTP requesting that they develop a plan for a ``path \nforward'' to address the inconsistencies, gaps, and overlaps in current \nradiation protection standards. In my letters to these officials, which \nI ask to be made part of the record, along with their subsequent \nresponses, I stated that this plan should clearly identify and \nprioritize the standards and issues which need to be resolved. I asked \nalso that the plan identify feasible milestones on which there is \nconsensus agreement for progress to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 1994.\n     Hon. Carol Browner,\n     Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Browner: Since coming to the Senate, one \n     of my primary interests has been protecting our citizens' \n     health and safety from unnecessary exposure to ionizing \n     radiation. Radiation protection standards affect all \n     Americans, and directly influence the way that billions of \n     taxpayer dollars are spent as we attempt to clean up \n     contaminated facilities. As you clearly know, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plays a key role in the \n     Federal government with regards to regulating radiation. With \n     this in mind, I wanted to bring to your attention a recent \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) report that directly concern \n     programs under your jurisdiction.\n       The report ``Nuclear Health and Safety: Consensus on \n     Acceptable Radiation Risk to the Public is Lacking (RED-94-\n     190)'' examines the existing set of radiation protection \n     standards and analyzes whether these standards provide a \n     coherent, complete, federal framework for public protection. \n     The report describes a federal regulatory regime for \n     radiation that is inconsistent, overlapping and incomplete. \n     The GAO finds large disparities in the standards established \n     by different agencies and no consensus emerging on what those \n     standards should be. In fact, GAO finds that at least 26 \n     different draft or final federal radiation standards or \n     guidelines contain specific radiation limits. Some of these \n     agree numerically, but others differ.\n       Over the years I have chaired numerous Governmental Affairs \n     Committee hearings and made several legislative proposals \n     which address this issue. For example, in response to \n     legislation I introduced in 1979, President Carter created a \n     federal radiation policy council. While this organization was \n     disbanded by President Reagan, the problems it was intended \n     to address did not go away. I then introduced legislation in \n     1982 which would have created an interagency council to \n     address the fragmented and inconsistent nature or radiation \n     protection regulation. This proposal spurred the creation of \n     the Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and Policy \n     Coordination (CIRRPC). Since the mid-80's I have chaired \n     hearings which have highlighted similar problems with the \n     regulation of medical radiation, as well as the impact of \n     inconsistent radiation protection guidance on federal \n     facility cleanup operations.\n       The GAO report points out--and I would like to underscore--\n     the progress that has recently been made between EPA and the \n     NRC concerning the recent Memorandum of Understanding on this \n     subject. I congratulate you and your staff for the leadership \n     you have displayed thus far, and strongly encourage you to \n     expand this effort into a government-wide exercise in \n     coordination and harmonization of radiation exposure \n     standards and regulations.\n       I concur with the GAO's recommendation that the EPA should \n     take the lead in creating coherent, consistent standards in \n     cooperation with other agencies and CIRRPC. A coherent \n     federal approach to these issues is long overdue. By \n     rationalizing this important area of regulation, the EPA \n     could ease the burden on the regulated community while at the \n     same time enhancing public protection and public confidence.\n       However, past history has proven that initial progress on \n     this subject can easily become ensnared in interagency \n     disputes and bureaucratic infighting. For this reason, I \n     would request that, prior to the date the 104th Congress \n     convenes, EPA and NRC, in coordination with CIRRPC, develop a \n     plan for a ``path forward'' to address the inconsistencies, \n     gaps, and overlaps in current radiation protection standards. \n     This plan should clearly identify and prioritize the \n     standards and issues which need to be resolved. The plan \n     should also identify feasible milestones on which there is \n     consensus agreement for progress to move forward. Should the \n     EPA prove unable to develop and implement such a plan, I will \n     strongly consider introducing legislation to create an \n     interagency body which would be mandated to produce and carry \n     out this plan.\n       I appreciate your past and ongoing efforts in this very \n     important area, and I am willing to assist future activity in \n     any way that I can. Should you have any questions, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me directly.

Ivan Selin,\n     Chairman, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Since coming to the Senate, one of my \n     primary interests has been protecting our citizens' health \n     and safety from unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. \n     Radiation protection standards affect all Americans, and \n     directly influence the way that billions of taxpayer dollars \n     are spent as we attempt to clean up contaminated facilities. \n     As you clearly know, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), \n     along with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) play key \n     roles in the Federal government with regards to regulating \n     radiation. With this in mind, I wanted to bring to your \n     attention a recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report \n     that raises a number of important issues.\n       The report ``Nuclear Health and Safety: Consensus on \n     Acceptable Radiation Risk to the Public is Lacking (RED-94-\n     190)'' examines the existing set of radiation protection \n     standards and analyzes whether these standards provide a \n     coherent, complete, federal framework for public protection. \n     The report describes a federal regulatory regime for \n     radiation that is inconsistent, overlapping and incomplete. \n     The GAO finds large disparities in the standards established \n     by different agencies and no consensus emerging on what those \n     standards should be. In fact, GAO finds that at least 26 \n     different draft or final federal radiation standards or \n     guidelines contain specific radiation limits. Some of these \n     agree numerically, but others differ.\n       Over the years I have chaired numerous Governmental Affairs \n     Committee hearings and made several legislative proposals \n     which address this issue. For example, in response to \n     legislation I introduced in 1979, President Carter created a \n     federal radiation policy council. While this organization was \n     disbanded by President Reagan, the problems it was intended \n     to address did not go away. I then introduced legislation in \n     1982 which would have created an interagency council to \n     address the fragmented and inconsistent nature of radiation \n     protection regulation. This proposal spurred the creation of \n     the Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and Policy \n     Coordination (CIRRPC). Since the mid-80's I have chaired \n     hearings which have highlighted similar problems with the \n     regulation of medical radiation, as well as the impact of \n     inconsistent radiation protection guidance on federal \n     facility cleanup operations.\n       The GAO report points out--and I would like to underscore--\n     the progress that has recently been made between EPA and the \n     NRC concerning the recent Memorandum of Understanding on this \n     subject. I congratulate you and your staff for the leadership \n     you have displayed thus far, and strongly encourage you to \n     expand this effort into a government-wide exercise in \n     coordination and harmonization of radiation exposure \n     standards and regulations.\n       I concur with the GAO's recommendation that the EPA should \n     take the lead in creating coherent, consistent standards in \n     cooperation with other agencies and CIRRPC. A coherent \n     federal approach to these issues is long overdue. By \n     rationalizing this important area of regulation, the EPA \n     could ease the burden on the regulated community while at the \n     same time enhancing public protection and public confidence. \n     The NRC, however, as the federal agency with the most \n     relevant and diverse experience in regulating radiation must \n     provide crucial technical assistance and policy guidance \n     based on your experience in this complex field.\n       However, past history has proven that initial progress on \n     this subject can easily become ensnared in interagency \n     disputes and bureaucratic infighting. For this reason, I \n     would request that, prior to the date the 104th Congress \n     convenes, EPA and NRC, in coordination with CIRRPC, develop a \n     plan for a ``path forward'' to address the inconsistencies, \n     gaps, and overlaps in current radiation protection standards. \n     This plan should clearly identify and prioritize the \n     standards and issues which need to be resolved.

Gibbons,\n     Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Gibbons: Since coming to the Senate, I have \n     maintained a keen interest in protecting our citizens from \n     unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. Radiation \n     protection standards affect all Americans, and directly \n     influence the way that billions of taxpayer dollars are spent \n     as we attempt to clean up contaminated Federal facilities.\n       Historically, the federal government's program of standards \n     and regulations for radiation exposure have been fragmented, \n     overlapping, and poorly coordinated. In 1979 and 1982 I \n     introduced legislation to address this situation that later \n     prompted the creation of the Committee on Interagency \n     Radiation Research and Policy Coordination (CIRRPC) which was \n     chartered under the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, \n     Engineering and Technology, Office of Science and Technology \n     Policy. CIRRPC currently reports to the National Science and \n     Technology Committee's Committee on Health, Safety & Food \n     R\n       In light of CIRRPC's role as a coordinating body for \n     federal radiation policy, I want to bring to your attention a \n     recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report on the current \n     status of federal radiation policy coordination. In its \n     report, ``Nuclear Health and Safety: Consensus on Acceptable \n     Radiation Risk to the Public is Lacking (RCED-94-190),'' GAO \n     finds that despite some initial efforts at coordination \n     between the EPA and NRC, the federal program for regulating \n     radiation risks is characterized by ``ongoing disagreements \n     on jurisdictional and philosophical issues, including \n     protective strategies. Also, in recent years EPA and CIRRPC \n     have coordinated federal radiation policy ineffectively.''\n       The GAO recommends that EPA and NRC expand on their recent \n     coordinating activities to include the effective \n     participation of other agencies and CIRRPC in pursuing \n     interagency consensus on radiation policy. I have asked that \n     the EPA take the lead in implementing this recommendation and \n     report to me on its plans within 90 days. I want to encourage \n     CIRRPC to assist in this endeavor.\n       Should EPA, in coordination with CIRRPC and other agencies, \n     be unable to develop and implement such a plan, I will \n     strongly consider introducing legislation to create an \n     interagency body with the mandate to produce and carry out \n     this mission.\n       A coherent federal approach to these issues is long \n     overdue. By helping to rationalize this important area of \n     regulation, the CIRRPC could lighten the regulatory burden on \n     the regulated community while at the same time enhancing \n     public protection and public confidence. Another important \n     benefit likely to spring from a coherent, consistent federal \n     radiation protection policy is reduced cost to the taxpayer \n     for the cleanup of contaminated federal facilities.\n       I would appreciate learning of your plans for improving \n     CIRRPC's effectiveness, as well as any other proposals you \n     may have for addressing the issues raised by the GAO. Please \n     do not hesitate to contact me directly should you wish to \n     discuss this matter. My Governmental Affairs Committee staff \n     contact is Chris Kline (202) 224-7954.\n       Best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Glenn,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would note that a regulatory moratorium \ndoes none of these things. A regulatory moratorium doesn't ask for a \nplan. It doesn't provide for careful analysis of the existing \nregulatory framework. A regulatory moratorium is a blind and ignorant \nattempt to address complex issues.\n  In late January and February of this year, I received the responses \nfrom NRC, EPA, and OSTP. As a result of my efforts the current Federal \nradiation protection framework is being restructured. The previous \ncoordinating body, the Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and \nPolicy Coordination is being disbanded. While CIRRPC has had some \nsuccess in addressing some issues, it was widely viewed as being \nineffective.\n  In its place, the National Science and Technology Council, chaired by \nDr. Gibbons, has formed a subcommittee to coordinate interagency \nradiation research activities. This move will more effectively \nintegrate radiation research into the rest of the Federal R effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed letters concerning this.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, Feb. 10, 1995.\n     Dr. Alvin L. Young,\n     Chairman, Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and \n         Policy Coordination, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Young: Thank you for your letter of December 2 \n     regarding the future of the Committee on Interagency \n     Radiation Research and Policy Coordination (CIRRPC). We owe \n     you a great debt of gratitude for your outstanding service \n     over the years and accept your decision to resign as chairman \n     of the committee.\n       For a number of years CIRRPC has successfully complemented \n     radiation research and policy activities of the Federal \n     agencies. Under your able leadership CIRRPC has produced a \n     number of highly referenced documents and provided a forum \n     for the resolution of often contentious policy and scientific \n     issues. However, a number of factors have led to a recent \n     examination of CIRRPC as the appropriate body to coordinate \n     radiation matters among agencies, evaluate radiation research \n     and provide advice on the formulation of radiation policies. \n     The creation of the National Science and Technology Council \n     (NSTC) as the Administration's mechanism for addressing \n     interagency science and technology issues, the October 1994 \n     General Accounting Office report on nuclear health and \n     safety, and our efforts to create a government that works \n     better and costs less are some of those factors.\n       The NSTC Committee on Health, Safety and Food (CHSF) \n     leadership has reviewed CIRRPC's role in relation to the \n     charter and the factors described above and recommended that \n     CIRRPC phase out its activities. I have accepted this \n     recommendation with the understanding the CHSF will establish \n     a new subcommittee to coordinate interagency radiation \n     research activities in accordance with the NSTC roles and \n     responsibilities. Accordingly, the CIRRPC charter will not be \n     renewed.\n       I want to thank you for your unwavering commitment and \n     leadership over the past decade in the interagency radiation \n     research and policy environs. You clearly have played a \n     critical role in CIRRPC's many successes, and I commend you \n     for your work and dedication.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              John H. Gibbons,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n     for Science and Technology.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, Feb. 24, 1995.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Glenn: This letter is to update you on the \n     actions that have been taken since your October 27, 1994 \n     letter regarding the GAO report, ``Consensus on Acceptable \n     Radiation Risk to the Public is Lacking.''\n       Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) \n     representatives met with the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the \n     Department of Energy (DOE), and with your Governmental \n     Affairs Committee staff to explore better mechanisms to \n     coordinate radiation standards and radiation effects research \n     activities among Federal agencies.\n       I would like to summarize the results of these discussions. \n     The Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and Policy \n     Coordination (CIRRPC) has undergone a review by its parent \n     committee, the Committee on Health, Safety, and Food (CHSF) \n     of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). For \n     over a decade, CIRRPC has coordinated radiation related \n     matters among agencies, evaluated radiation research, and \n     provided advice on the formulation of radiation policies. As \n     a result of the CHSF review, I have decided that CIRRPC's \n     charter will not be renewed. I believe there are more \n     effective and less costly ways of coordinating radiation \n     issues and activities and that we have some excellent \n     mechanisms in place which, with minor reconfiguration, can \n     better achieve national goals.\n       First, EPA and NRC agreed to expand the scope of the \n     present Interagency Steering Committee on Radiation Clean-up \n     Standards, which currently includes EPA, NRC, DOE and the \n     Department of Defense (DoD). The Steering Committee will \n     immediately begin to develop a consensus on how to address \n     the issues cited in the GAO report, including acceptable \n     radiation risk to the public, the establishment of consistent \n     risk assessment and management approaches, and completeness \n     and uniformity in radiation standards and methods of public \n     education on radiation safety. The Steering Committee will \n     report its progress to OSTP, the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB), and to agency heads.\n       Second, since many of the issues involve ``risk \n     assessment'' in the promulgation of Federal regulations, the \n     Interagency Steering Committee referenced above will bring to \n     the Subcommittee on Risk Analysis those regulatory issues \n     that require review by the senior level of government. I \n     chair the Subcommittee on Risk Analysis which is under the \n     Regulatory Working Group chaired by Sally Katzen of OMB.\n       Finally, the CHSF will establish a new subcommittee to be \n     charged with coordinating interagency radiation effects \n     research activities across the Federal agencies. This body \n     will provide advice on the needs and priorities of radiation \n     effects research.\n       EPA and NRC have shared with us their responses to your \n     October 27 correspondence on this same matter. I am \n     encouraged by their efforts to coordinate radiation \n     activities, particularly the development of an EPA/NRC joint \n     risk harmonization white paper.\n       I deeply appreciate your interest in radiation issues and \n     believe that the recent events, which you have helped \n     promote, will \n     [[Page S4650]] provide better and more effective coordination \n     in the years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              John H. Gibbons,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n     for Science and Technology.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1995.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Glenn: I am responding on behalf of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission (NRC) to your letters dated October 27, \n     1994, concerning the Federal government's responsibility to \n     protect the public from ionizing radiation. Your letters \n     discussed the recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report \n     on this subject, ``Nuclear Health and Safety: Consensus on \n     Acceptable Radiation Risk to the Public is Lacking (GAO/RCED-\n     94-190), and requested that EPA and NRC, in coordination with \n     the Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and Policy \n     Coordination (CIRRPC) develop a plan, prior to the date the \n     104th Congress convenes, for a ``path forward'' to address \n     inconsistencies, gaps, and overlaps in current radiation \n     protection standards.\n       The GAO report combines 26 radiation-related standards or \n     guidelines into three categories: (1) general public, (2) \n     source--(or media-) specific, and (3) occupational. It also \n     identifies differences in ``estimated lifetime risks'' to \n     members of the public, as well as gaps and overlaps among the \n     standards making up categories 1 and 2. Such inconsistencies \n     are explainable in part by legal mandates, regulatory \n     responsibilities, and varied technical assumptions underlying \n     each of the standards (see attachment). However, we recognize \n     the need for more coherent, complete, and consistent \n     radiation standards, as well as a clear communication of \n     these standards throughout agencies and to the general \n     public.\n       The report note several ongoing efforts by EPA and NRC to \n     resolve many of these issues. For example, EPA has led an \n     interagency effort to develop and coordinate federal \n     radiation cleanup standards for contaminate sites. The effort \n     has been overseen by the Interagency Steering Committee on \n     Radiation Cleanup Standards composed of senior agency \n     managers. NRC has closely coordinated with EPA in developing \n     standards for the decommissioning of NRC-licensed facilities.\n       Also, on December 23, 1994 EPA proposed new federal \n     radiation protection guidance for the public. This guidance \n     has been developed with the help of a working group composed \n     of representatives from 13 federal agencies and a \n     representative of the Conference of Radiation Control Program \n     Directors (CRCPD).\n       Finally, the report cited a Memorandum of Understanding \n     (MOU) signed by EPA and NRC in 1992. The MOU provides a \n     formal mechanism for agency cooperation on issues relating to \n     environmental regulation of radionuclides subject to NRC \n     licensing authority. Among other things, the MOU committed \n     the agencies to ``actively explore ways to harmonize risk \n     goals'' and ``avoid unnecessary duplicative or piecemeal \n     regulatory requirements for NRC licensees, consistent with \n     the legal responsibilities of the two agencies[.]''\n       Pursuant to the MOU, EPA and NRC are developing a joint \n     Risk Harmonization White Paper which outlines the \n     similarities and differences in the agencies' approaches to \n     radiation risk assessment and risk management. NRC and EPA \n     are currently reviewing a drafting of this paper with other \n     federal agencies involved in enhancing the consistency of \n     federal radiation protection standards. Based on the findings \n     of this white paper, the agencies plan to develop a specific \n     set of actions.\n       EPA and NRC have also been working to eliminate unnecessary \n     regulatory duplication. For example, on July 15, 1994, EPA \n     published a final rule rescinding its Clean Air Act (CAA) \n     standards (40 CFR 61, subpart T) for NRC-licensed uranium \n     mill tailings disposal sites after the regulations under the \n     Atomic Energy Act (AEA) were revised to conform with the CAA \n     standard. EPA has proposed to rescind the CAA standard for \n     nuclear power reactors (40 CFR 61, subpart I) and intends to \n     issue a final rescission soon. For NRC-licensed facilities \n     other than nuclear power reactors, EPA and NRC have just \n     resolved a key issue and expect to agree soon on a process to \n     rescind subpart I for this category as well. In each case, \n     rescission will be based on a determination by EPA that the \n     NRC program provides an ample margin of safety to protect \n     public health.\n       There has also been a considerable amount of cooperation \n     between EPA and the Department of Energy (DOE) on radiation \n     protection issues. DOE has and continues to work actively \n     with EPA in such areas as EPA's radiation cleanup standards, \n     federal radiation protection guidance for workers and the \n     general public, CAA radionuclide standards, radiation dose \n     and risk assessment models, and in the development of DOE \n     implementing Orders and rules for radiation under the AEA.\n       The GAO report recommended that EPA, in cooperation with \n     NRC, take the lead in sustaining and broadening the ongoing \n     EPA-NRC harmonization effort to include the effective \n     participation\n      of other agencies. Your letter underscored this \n     recommendation and requested the development of a plan to \n     address the inconsistencies, gaps, and overlaps in the \n     standards.\n       As stated in our preliminary response to your letter on \n     November 8, 1994, we welcome your request and agree that more \n     effective federal leadership in radiation policy is needed. \n     We also accept GAO's recommendation that EPA take the \n     initiative in addressing the deficiencies in federal \n     radiation standards. We are taking steps to broaden our \n     ongoing harmonization efforts with the NRC to include senior-\n     level participation from other agencies as part of our ``path \n     forward.'' We have already begun to coordinate this effort \n     with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and \n     the Committee on Health, Safety, and Food (CHSF).\n       Accordingly, the plan EPA proposes is to continue the \n     efforts of EPA and NRC that are effective and that were cited \n     by GAO; to expand the scope of the Interagency Steering \n     Committee on Radiation Cleanup Standards to include review of \n     other radiation standards; and to select and prioritize new \n     issues for coordination. The committee is an appropriate \n     existing body that can effectively address uniformity of all \n     radiation protection standards. Its membership includes \n     senior level agency representatives from NRC, DOE, EPA, and \n     the Department of Defense (DOD). We also believe there is a \n     need for public information on radiation protection and have \n     incorporated this into our plan.\n       More specifically, the plan includes the following:\n       1. Continue to develop the Federal Radiation Protection \n     Guidance for the General Public.\n       Reach a consensus on how much radiation risk to the public \n     is acceptable.\n       Hold public hearings on proposed Federal Radiation \n     Protection Guidance for Exposure of the General Public on \n     February 22-24, 1995.\n       Explore approaches to provide information to the public \n     concerning radiation exposure.\n       Finalize recommendations on the guidance for the \n     President's approval by January 1, 1996.\n       2. Complete the draft NRC-EPA Risk Harmonization White \n     Paper.\n       Complete a coordinated EPA review of the draft white paper \n     by June 1, 1995 and add a description of NRC's and EPA's \n     approaches to selecting\n      acceptable risk standards and dose limits and a discussion \n     of the extent to which the agencies may be subject to \n     legislative constraints which inhibit greater risk \n     harmonization.\n       Conduct a review of the draft white paper by involved \n     agencies including OSTP by June 1, 1995.\n       Develop a set of actions based on interagency review of the \n     draft white paper and submit the proposed actions for \n     approval by the Administrator and Commission by September 30, \n     1995.\n       3. Based on the white paper, explore development of \n     consistent risk assessment and risk management approaches to \n     ensure consistency of radiation standards and sufficient \n     protection of the public.\n       Begin implementation of actions developed from the white \n     paper after interagency review and approval by November 30, \n     1995.\n       Publish interagency consensus tables of nuclide-specific \n     risks from ingestion, inhalation, and direct exposure for \n     uniform federal risk assessments (Federal Guidance Report No. \n     13) by February 1, 1996.\n       4. Reduce gaps and conflicting overlaps in radiation \n     standards.\n       Expand the scope of the current Interagency Steering \n     Committee on Radiation Cleanup Standards to review, \n     prioritize, and reduce the gaps and overlaps in radiation \n     standards in key policy areas including:\n       CAA regulation of NRC-licensed facilities;\n       Low-level radioactive waste disposal standards;\n       Radioactive mixed wastes;\n       Naturally-occurring and accelerator produced radioactive \n     materials (NARM);\n       Recycling.\n       Hold the first meeting of this refocused, senior level \n     steering committee in February 1995.\n       The Steering Committee will report its progress to agency \n     heads and OSTP within six months.\n       This proposal has been shared with OSTP and the principal \n     affected federal agencies whose standards were cited in the \n     report, namely, the NRC, DOE, and the Department of Labor \n     (DOL).\n       EPA and NRC greatly appreciated your concern and efforts to \n     protect the public from radiation and hope that this plan \n     meets with your approval. We thank you for your offer to \n     assist us and look forward to continuing to work with you on \n     this important public issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                              Mary D. Nichols,\n\n                                           Assistant Administrator\n     for Air and Radiation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               attachment\n\n       GAO recognized that the different risks associated by the \n     report with the standards result in part from different \n     technical assumptions. For example, the first high risk \n     standard in category two is the cleanup standard for radium \n     contamination in soil at uranium mill tailings sites. GAO \n     estimated that this standard (both the EPA standard and the \n     corresponding NRC implementing regulation) results in a \n     lifetime risk or 1 in 50, by assuming that an individual \n     resides on land with extensive deposits of soil contaminated \n     at this level. However, this is an unrealistic \n     [[Page S4651]] assumption, and such lifetime risks would not \n     likely occur. Given the actual conditions at the 26 sites to \n     which this standard applies, cleanup to the standard will \n     usually result in essentially total removal of the \n     contamination. When this is taken into account, the maximum \n     risk level is substantially lower and, since these disposal \n     sites are located in sparsely populated, arid regions, the \n     chance of exposure is small.\n       Further, two of the cited standards (NRC's 1982 low-level \n     radioactive waste (LLW) standards and EPA's 1977 uranium fuel \n     cycle standards) are regulations that use an old methodology \n     to specify dose (which can be related to specific risk \n     levels). This methodology has been superseded by the \n     committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) methodology used \n     by NRC and EPA in more recent rulemakings (e.g. EPA's 1993 \n     high-level waste disposal standards, draft cleanup and LLW \n     disposal standards, as well as NRC's draft decommissioning \n     standards). Therefore, comparing the estimated risks from \n     these two sets of standards is complicated by the change in \n     dose units and dose assessment methodology. However, a \n     detailed analysis shows that although the two sets of \n     standards are numerically different, they nonetheless provide \n     a similar degree of protection.\n       The report also recognized that the 26 standards or \n     guidelines (see Appendix II of the report) are indicative of \n     the standards' different regulatory applications and \n     separates them into three categories: (1) general public, \n     source- (or media-) specific, and (3) occupational. It \n     correctly distinguishes between standards applicable to all \n     sources of exposure combined (category 1) and standards that \n     apply only to specific sources or individual pathways \n     (category 2). However, the report fails to emphasize that \n     different (lower) standards for category 2 are generally \n     justified. This is because people may be exposed to several \n     different sources or pathways at the same time. On December \n     23, 1994, (59 Fed. Reg. 66414) EPA proposed new federal \n     guidance that would bring the existing standards applicable \n     to all sources of exposure combined into conformity, and \n     provide explicit guidance for relating these upper bound \n     limits to the (lower) source- and pathway-specific standards.\n       The other high risk ``standard'' cited in the report, EPA's \n     indoor radon action level, is unlike the other examples in \n     the second category because it is not a regulatory standard.\n      Pursuant to the Indoor Radon Abatement Act, EPA uses a \n     nonregulatory approach consisting of a series of action \n     levels indicating the risks associated with different \n     levels of indoor radon and the cost and technological \n     feasibility of reducing radon exposure. Importantly, the \n     Agency does not recommend the cited level as a ``safe'' or \n     ``acceptable'' level but emphasizes that, since \n     significant health risk exists below the action level, \n     mitigation of indoor radon is valuable at lower levels.\n       Therefore, although the radiation protection standards \n     listed in Table 1 (and Appendix II) of the report may \n     initially seem inconsistent, further examination reveals that \n     many do in fact provide a consistent degree of protection or \n     are different for legitimate reasons.\n       The GAO report also noted that the gaps and overlaps in \n     standards reflect individual legal mandates and independent \n     development by agencies to fulfill their different \n     responsibilities. NRC regulates its licensees under the AEA, \n     for the most part, on a site-by-site basis under the \n     ``umbrella'' of an upper-bound dose limit. This limit is \n     based on international and national recommendations of the \n     International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) \n     and the National Council on Radiation Protection and \n     Measurements (NCRP). The limit is coupled with the required \n     application of procedures and engineering controls to reduce \n     potential public doses to levels that are as low as is \n     reasonably achievable (ALARA), which almost always results in \n     significant reductions in actual risk levels.\n       EPA, in its primary role as a standards-setting (rather \n     than licensing) agency under the AEA and other statues, \n     regulates by class of facility or source, pollutant, or \n     environmental media. In setting its standards, EPA uses \n     either a risk objective and considers further risk reduction \n     if it is justified by cost/benefit considerations for the \n     class as a whole, or a contaminant goal (often mandated by \n     legislation) and considers technological feasibility, costs, \n     and other factors in determining levels to be achieved in \n     practice. EPA's standards for radionuclides are also \n     significantly influenced by its effort to be consistent with \n     its regulatory policies for chemicals under environmental \n     statutes, most notably the CAA, Safe Drinking Water Act \n     (SDWA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and \n     the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and \n     Liability Act (CERCLA).\n       Although the agencies have often worked together \n     successfully, their differing legal mandates and regulatory \n     responsibilities described above have contributed in large \n     part to the gaps and overlaps cited in the report including: \n     (1) radionuclide air emissions from NRC licensees under the \n     CAA, (2) groundwater protection requirements for \n     radionuclides, (3) radioactive mixed wastes, and (4) NARM.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Now, as far as the regulatory agencies--EPA and NRC--are \nconcerned, they still will play the key role in improving the existing \nradiation protection framework. As part of the administration's plan, \nEPA and NRC will expand the scope of the present interagency steering \ncommittee on radiation cleanup standards to address other radiation \nissues identified by the GAO, including acceptable radiation risk to \nthe public, the establishment of consistent risk assessment and \nmanagement approaches, and completeness and uniformity in radiation \nstandard, and public education on radiation safety.\n  Mr. President, the decision to expand the scope of this interagency \nsteering committee was made because it had been successful in \naddressing one of the primary problems identified by GAO, \ninconsistencies in how different agencies approach radiation \nprotection. This steering committee effectively coordinated EPA's \nproposed radiation cleanup standards with NRC's proposed \ndecontamination and decommissioning standards. As a result, these two \nmajor regulatory actions reflect the same risk and protection levels--\nsomething that has been notably absent from previous efforts.\n  Now Mr. President, some people may argue that the proposed EPA and \nNRC standards go too far, or not far enough. In fact, I have some \nconcerns that these standards may not be enough to protect the public. \nHowever, through this interagency steering committee, any changes that \nmight be made to the rules, based on public and scientific input, will \nbe reflected in both rules. At long last we will begin to move away \nfrom the illogical situation that has existed for some time which has \nled to different levels of protection based solely on the agency that \nis doing the regulating.\n  Let me make clear, this interagency committee will have the authority \nto examine the current radiation regulatory framework, recommend ways \nthat it can be improved--including consolidating or eliminating \nduplicative standards--and then implement their recommendations. Where \nlegislative action may be needed, I am prepared to assist the \ncommittee's effort.\n  Mr. President, I would note that the proposed moratorium would \nsabotage the progress that has recently been made to coordinate these \nstandards, resulting in delayed cleanup and increased costs.\n  Mr. President, a number of other rules concerning nuclear safety and \npublic exposure to radiation will be delayed as a result of this \nmoratorium. Let me list these for the information of my colleagues.\n  Epidemiology and Other Health Studies Financial Assistance Program \n[10 CFR 602, Final Rule Published Jan. 31, 1995, DOE]. This rule \nestablishes open and competitive procedures for providing financial \nassistance relating to health studies. These health studies support the \nDepartment of Energy's mission to protect the health of DOE and \ncontractor workers, as well as residents living near DOE facilities.\n  Standards for Nuclear Waste Disposal--primarily for Waste Isolation \nPilot Plant in New Mexico--proposed January 31, 1995, EPA. This \nproposed rule sets standards for transuranic waste disposal, low levels \nof plutonium among other radionuclides. This guidance has already been \ndelayed for many years and is critical to solving the nuclear waste \ndisposal problem.\n  Cleanup at Uranium Processing Sites, EPA. This new final rule, issued \non January 11, 1995, sets out cost-effective standards for preventing \nand cleaning up ground water contamination at inactive uranium \nprocessing sites. This rule replaces a restrictive and costly interim \nstandard.\n  Cleanup of NRC-licensed facilities, NRC. This proposed rule provides \ncleanup criteria for the decontamination and decommissioning of NRC-\nlicensed sites. These criteria include the cleanup and release of these \nfacilities for unrestricted and restricted use. These standards are the \nones I referred to earlier which have been developed in coordination \nwith EPA's general standards for radioactive cleanup.\n  Rulemaking expected by June 30, 1995. Nuclear Safety Management [10 \nCFR Part 830, DOE]. This action establishes requirements for DOE \ncontractors and subcontractors for ensuring nuclear safety at DOE \nfacilities. These requirements stem from the Department's ongoing \neffort to strengthen the protection of health, safety, and the \nenvironment from the radiological and \n[[Page S4652]] chemical hazards posed by these facilities.\n  Mr. President, a moratorium on this last rulemaking would result in \ndelays to long-sought efforts to bring DOE's nuclear facilities closer \nto commercial standards as far as safety is concerned.\n  To conclude, I strongly support regulatory reform, and good sense \nefforts to improve the current system. The unfortunate fact, which the \nproponents of the moratorium do not seem to fully grasp, is that to \nimprove a regulatory system you must first understand what it is you \nare trying to fix. A meat ax isn't the way to solve the problem; better \nto use a scalpel to save this patient.\n  As I have outlined here today, a responsible regulatory reform effort \nfor radiation issues is currently underway. The proposed moratorium \nwould delay this effort for no good reason. I urge my colleague to \noppose this moratorium.\n  I would summarize by saying a moratorium would bring all of this \nrulemaking to a stop, and the American people would not get the \nprotection they deserve. And that is what we are debating today.\n  This goes on to describe some of our efforts on the committee to get \nthat as an exception while the bill was in committee, and we failed. It \nwas a party line vote on E. coli. If there is ever an imminent threat \nto health and safety, that would be it.\n  During the committee markup, I submitted an amendment to exempt \nregulatory actions that would reduce pathogens in meat and poultry. \nThat amendment was rejected. I would like to discuss this important \nrule to show that the moratorium is indeed both dangerous and \narbitrary.\n  This amendment I offered would address rules to update inspection \ntechniques for meat and poultry and would provide a safeguard against \nE. coli and other contamination. Mr. Mueller, whose 13-year-old son \ndied from E. coli-contaminated hamburger, testified before the \ncommittee on February 22.\n  He stated:\n\n       I am here to tell you about the dire consequences that \n     would result in enactment of this moratorium. In the fall of \n     1993, my thirteen year old son died from eating a \n     cheeseburger. A new meat inspection rule which would have \n     prevented his death would be stopped by this legislation.\n\n  In January, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released a proposed \nhazardous analysis critical control point [HACCP] regulation to improve \nmeat and poultry inspection. This rule would mandate rigorous \nsanitation requirements and scientific testing for bacteria in meat and \npoultry processing.\n  Under HACCP, workers regularly monitory hazards in a production \nsystem on the basis of risk. They identify risks, they monitor the \ncontrols, and they sample end products periodically to check the HACCP \nprocess.\n  Under HACCP, emphasis is placed on the process rather than the end \nproduct. Instead of monitoring every carcass for a defect, plant \nemployees will regulatory monitor the processing of carcasses: the \ntemperature of storage areas, the cleanliness of the equipment, or the \nconsistency of carcass washes or other solutions used.\n  The employees will keep records of their observations. Samples of end \nproducts will be tested to make sure that the process is working \nproperly and the Government will review company HACCP records.\n  HACCP has been endorsed by the United Nations, the World Health \nOrganization, the General Accounting Office, the National Food \nProcessors Association, the National Broiler Council, the American Meat \nInstitute, and the Safe Food Coalition. Ten years ago, the National \nAcademy of Sciences recommended that the USDA adopt HACCP for meat and \npoultry inspections. Industry petitioned USDA to mandate the program. \nNow the implementation of HACCP is threatened by this moratorium.\n  The meat and poultry inspection laws were written in 1906. Federal \ninspectors are limited to touching, smelling, and visually inspecting \ncarcasses to determine whether they are fit for consumption. We all \nknow that inspectors are not going to find harmful bacteria like E. \ncoli without microscopes and sampling. Clearly, this inspection program \nshould be updated.\n  As you know, the moratorium bill allows for the President to exempt \nimminent threats to health and safety. The majority in our committee \nargued that E. coli and other contaminants in meat and poultry would be \nan imminent threat to health and safety. We simply do not agree. The \nmeat inspection rules are not emergency rules designed to address an \nimmediately pressing event or disaster. They have been under \ndevelopment for several years now.\n  Therefore, I and others strongly believed that we should specifically \nexempt these inspection rules from the moratorium.\n  We cannot afford to pass a law that would end up with more needless \ndeaths. While we do need to reform our regulatory process, we must not \ngive up our responsibility to protect the public health and safety. As \nMr. Mueller stated in his testimony before our committee, ``My son paid \nthe ultimate price for eating one of his favorite foods.'' We have the \nability to prevent this from happening again, and we should--by \nopposing the moratorium all together.\n  Mr. President, I addressed very briefly a moment ago the subject of \nairline safety. I will make a few more comments about that.\n  The lack of thought that went into the moratorium is seen in many \nways. Once example is the effort it took to ensure protections for \nairline safety.\n  In the House, the supporters of the moratorium resisted all arguments \nfor an exemption for airline safety--in committee and on the floor, \nwhere they defeated an amendment that contained an exemption for \naircraft safety. At the last minute, however, on the floor, the \nmanagers of the bill finally realized what a terrible idea it was, so \nthey accepted an exemption.\n  In the Senate, the moratorium also contained no exemption for airline \nsafety. Even after the bill was redrafted for our committee markup, the \nsupporters did not think it important enough to protect the traveling \npublic from unsafe aircraft equipment and operations.\n  Finally, in markup, I offered amendments that the majority could not \nreject. We exempted:\n  FAA airworthiness directives--these are rules that govern aircraft \nsafety, such as standards for aircraft engines, wing flap repairs, \nlanding gear brakes, et cetera; and\n  Commuter airline safety standards--these rules would upgrade \nstandards for commuter airlines to those of major airlines.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a \nletter I received from the Airline Pilots Association describing the \nurgent need for the commuter airline rules.\n  Commuter carriers, which operate aircraft with fewer than 30 seats, \nrepresent one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. airline \nmarket and often dominate airline service to many medium-sized cities \nand rural areas. This set of rules would require pilots on small \ncommuter aircraft to go through the same training as pilots of the \nlarge carriers. The rules will also increase crew flight and rest \nrequirements.\n  These rules were issued on Friday as proposed rules, and the new \nrules are supported by both the Regional Airline Association and the \nAir Line Pilots Association.\n  The proposed rules will be available for public comment for 90 days. \nI am sure that some will find provisions to object to, and I am sure \nthat the FAA will make changes. Given the projected cost of these \nrules--over $275 million--I am also confident that OMB will use its \nExecutive order powers to ensure that the rules are supported by a cost \nbenefit analysis.\n  This is how the process should work--rules to protect the public from \nharm or to serve some other purpose are proposed, made available for \ncomment, analyzed, reviewed and discussed. This is government working.\n  I believe the regulatory process needs reform. I've said that many \ntimes now. But, these air safety rules just prove my point about the \nmoratorium. Does the American public want Government shut down, while \nsome in Congress talk about reform, or do they want Government to try \nto make good decisions and protect them from harm, while we do our job \nof reform?\n  That is the issue. Let us work together to reform the regulatory \nprocess--which is what we have been doing in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Let us not waste time fighting \n[[Page S4653]] over important protections that all agree save lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from \nthe Airline Pilots Association describing the urgent need for these \ncommuter airline rules be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Air Line Pilots Association,\n\n                                                    March 8, 1995.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Glenn: It is my understanding that during the \n     committee's deliberations on S. 219, a bill to establish a \n     moratorium on federal rulemaking, that you will offer an \n     amendment to exempt proposed rules that the Department of \n     Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration plan \n     to issue later this month which would bring commuter airlines \n     up to the same safety standards as the larger carriers. On \n     behalf of the 42,000 members of the Air Line Pilots \n     Association, I wish to express our strong support for this \n     amendment and urge its adoption.\n       The Air Line Pilots Association has long advocated ``One \n     Level of Safety'' for all U.S. scheduled airline service. \n     These proposed rules were not developed in a vacuum. Many of \n     them have been pending for years and have already undergone \n     intensive review and analysis. Some originated with \n     recommendations from the National Transportation Safety \n     Board. In addition, because of the spate of accidents last \n     year, Secretary Pena, convened a two-day safety conference in \n     January, where hundreds of representatives from industry and \n     government worked together to develop the top 70 priorities \n     for increased air safety. ALPA was deeply involved in this \n     process and we believe the regulations that will be put \n     forward later this month will go a long way on the road \n     toward the goal of ``Zero Accidents.'' Now is not the time to \n     delay, it is the time to proceed.\n       ALPA understands and agrees with the goals of eliminating \n     burdensome, costly regulations and to bring common sense into \n     rulemaking. However, safety should not be compromised in the \n     process. The traveling public should not have to wait for a \n     fatal accident before the government acts. We should be in \n     the business of preventing accidents rather than responding \n     to them.\n       I strongly urge that the committee adopt your amendment and \n     allow these much needed safety regulations to go forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              J. Randolph Babbitt,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 54 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we could go on for a number of hours here \nreading all of these things, but I think I have made my point. I hope \ntoday we could agree that a straight moratorium, as proposed by S. 219, \nwhich is the bill we are debating here today--the substitute has not \nbeen laid down yet, and H.R. 450, its companion piece over in the \nHouse--is indeed ill thought out, ill considered, and bad for America \nand the American people, American business and industry.\n  In what time I have remaining I would like to just read a short table \nof contents of different regulations. Some of these have several \nregulations that would be held up if we passed this moratorium \nlegislation. All of these have some beneficial effect on the American \npublic, or in particular businesses or industries.\n                           Table of Contents\n\n\n                      i. public health and safety\n\n       (1) Towing Vessels Safety Regulations.\n       (2) Commuter Airline Safety Standards.\n       (3) Head Impact Protection.\n       (4) Cleanup of Nuclear Facilities.\n       (5) Prevention of Oil Spills.\n       (6) Environmental Review in Public Housing.\n       (7) Recovery of License Fees.\n       (8) Meat and Poultry Inspection.\n       (9) Alcoholic Beverage Labeling.\n       (10) Improved Poultry Inspection.\n       (11) Protection of Florida Keys.\n       (12) Pesticide Regulation Flexibility.\n       (13) Waste Management.\n       (14) Safety Zones for America's Cup.\n       (15) Airline Crew Assignments.\n       (16) Flight Attendant Duty Period Limitations and Rest \n     Requirements.\n       (18) Disease-Free Food.\n       (19) Security of Sensitive Information in Aviation.\n       (20) Bike Helmet Safety Standards.\n       (21) Flammability Standard for Upholstered Furniture.\n       (22) Radioactive Material Reporting.\n       (23) Child-Resistant Packaging.\n       (24) Lead-Free Cans.\n       (25) Nuclear Power Plant Safety.\n       (26) Approval of State Air Quality Plans.\n       (27) Reducing Toxic Air Emissions.\n       (28) Safe Drinking Water at Lower Cost.\n       (29) Lead Poisoning Prevention.\n       (30) Cleanup at Uranium Processing Sites.\n\n\n                           ii. worker safety\n\n       (1) Logging Safety.\n       (2) Ventilation in Underground Coal Mines.\n       (3) Safe Practices for Diesel Equipment in Underground Coal \n     Mines.\n       (4) Child Labor.\n       (5) Reducing Exposure to Tuberculosis in the Workplace.\n       (6) Worker Exposure to Cancer Causing Agent.\n       (7) Worker Exposure to Reproductive and Developmental \n     Risks.\n\n\n                  iii. economic growth and opportunity\n\n       (1) Small Business Development Center Program.\n       (2) Streamlining Loan Procedures for Small Business.\n       (3) Lower Electric Rates.\n       (4) Expanded Markets for American Farmers: (a) Sheep and \n     Lamb Producers; (b) Fruit, Vegetable, and Dairy Producers.\n       (5) Lower Costs for American Cotton Producers.\n       (6) Reducing FHA Fund Losses.\n       (7) Energy Efficient Applicances.\n       (8) Utility Rate Recovery.\n       (9) Education Funding Flexibility.\n       (10) Drawbridge Regulations.\n       (11) Missing Pension Beneficiaries.\n       (12) Indian Self Determination and Self Governance.\n       (13) Forestry Regulations.\n       (14) Landowner Relief Under Spotted Owl Regulation.\n       (15) Cruise Ship Access to Glacier Bay, Alaska.\n       (16) Alternative Fuel Providers.\n       (17) Extension of Port Limits, Hawaii.\n       (18) Recordkeeping by Casinos.\n       (19) Cable Rate Restructuring.\n       (20) Radio Frequency Allocation.\n       (21) Mobile Radios.\n       (22) Video Dialtone.\n\n\n                         iv. government reform\n\n       (1) Public Financing for Presidential Candidates.\n       (2) Political Campaigns Disclaimers.\n       (3) Efficient Clearance of Federal Checks.\n       (4) Government Securities Large Position Reporting \n     Requirements.\n       (5) Capital Sufficiency.\n       (6) Government Securities--Risk Assessment.\n       (7) Environmental Information ``One Stop Shopping.''\n       (8) Housing Reforms.\n\n\n               v. help for families and the middle class\n\n       (1) Student Loan Borrower Harassment Defenses.\n       (2) Caller ID.\n       (3) Mortgage Lending for Moderate Income Individuals.\n       (4) Foreclosure Alternatives.\n       (5) Increasing Home Ownership Opportunities for First Time \n     Buyers.\n       (6) Pell Grant Availability.\n       (7) Avoiding Homeowner Foreclosure.\n\n  Mr. President, I read all these to show the diverse nature of what we \nare dealing with here. This is not some little minor matter. It affects \nall businesses and industries. A moratorium would affect health and \nsafety for this country and all of our people. I go on at this length \ntoday talking about these things because H.R. 450 has already passed \nover in the House. When we go to conference, we will be dealing with \nall these things I mentioned today and more. We have not even listed \nall the impacts of what this moratorium would do.\n  I realize tomorrow we will have the Nickles-Reid substitute for this, \nwhich provides for legislative veto. I have favored legislative veto. \nBut I do not want to see it combined in conference with some of the \nthings I have mentioned here today, which go too far and which I think \nnever should have been proposed to begin with.\n  Our status on regulatory reform is this: We have passed regulatory \nreform out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. It is a good bill. \nSenator Roth deserves a lot of credit for bringing that bill to the \nfloor and making it a good, tough, solid bill. We should not be just \npicking little bits and pieces, such as a legislative veto, out of that \nbill. Those are parts of that bigger bill, and it is voted out now. It \nwill be ready for floor action shortly. I see no reason why we should \nbe picking out pieces of it for separate legislation unless the intent \nis to go to conference with the House and come back with something that \ngoes part way toward what the House has done with H.R. 450 and which \nhas been proposed here in the Senate with S. 219.\n  The President last September issued a directive to all Government \nagencies and departments to go through all rules and regulations and \ncome up with a sweeping proposal for correcting the problems we have \nwith the rules and regulations in effect now--all of them.\n  That will be with us on the 1st of June. They have committed to \nhaving \n[[Page S4654]] it to us on the 1st of June. So this legislation just \nmakes little sense to me. We will have the President's proposals before \nus on the 1st of June, which is just about 30 working days from now if \nyou take out the Easter break period. We will be able to take up those \nconsiderations along with regulatory reform and not even try to do \nsomething where we go to conference with the House on their moratorium \nbill.\n  I may have more to say on this subject tomorrow. We will be looking \nforward to the proposal I know the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \nis going to make tomorrow. But I hope we could get ahead with \nregulatory reform on a broad front and not just on this narrow issue of \nlegislative veto. If we make it something that has to be conferenced \nwith the House, as I see it, we can only lose.\n  If we go over to the House with this and we say it is this or \nnothing, the House is liable to not agree with that. I do not know \nwhere we go from there with compromise, which is usually the way we get \nby our conferences.\n  So, Mr. President, we will have more to say on this tomorrow, I am \nsure. I have asked for extensive things to be put in the Record today, \nI realize. But I think it is so important because, as the minority \nleader said a little while ago here on the floor, the moratorium is \ndead. If it is not, it should be. We want to make sure that it is.\n  As for the legislative veto, we may be able to vote on that tomorrow. \nI do not know. If we can say the moratorium is dead and regulatory or \nlegislative veto is what we are really going to stick with, and we are \nnot going to come back with something that accommodates the House, then \nI think legislative veto may be the way we all want to go. We might \neven get a unanimous vote tomorrow. I do not know.\n  I thank the Chair. I look forward to more debate on this subject \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have just a couple of very brief \ncomments.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 70 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It will be my intention to yield most of that time in \njust a few moments.\n  Mr. President, after listening to the long list of regulations that \nare so important and so effective, I wonder how we could be safer with \nbig Government doing so many wonderful things for us and saving so many \nlives. When you listen to the litany of regulations affecting \neverything, all the way down to safety zones for America's Cup--I did \nnot know we had regulations dealing with safety zones for America's \nCup, but I am sure they will be a lot safer. But I hasten to add that \nthe bill that was before us only applied to regulations that had \nsignificant economic impact. So the moratorium that passed out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee would not have limited the regulations \ndealing with safety zones for America's Cup. It would have had no \nimpact on them. As a matter of fact, most of the regulations that were \nmentioned would not have been impacted by the legislation that was \nreported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee because the \ncommittee decided to only impact significant regulations.\n  I have heard a couple of my colleagues say the moratorium bill is \ndead. But I should mention that the bill that Senator Reid and I are \npushing has a moratorium on significant regulations for 45 days to give \nCongress a chance to review them, and maybe a chance to repeal them. So \nthere is a moratorium on significant regulations, just as there is a \nmoratorium that passed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee moratorium would last until we pass a \ncomprehensive bill. We may pass a comprehensive bill in 45 days and \nhave it signed by the President. Or it could last until the end of the \nyear. I make mention of that.\n  I think when people said there is no moratorium, actually we have a \nmoratorium on significant regulations. That is what was in the bill \nthat was passed out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. But we have \nit for different purposes. In the bill that passed out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, it said we would exempt the small \nregulations and then the President could exempt. The moratorium would \nonly apply to significant regulations, and then the President had lots \nof exceptions, A through H in exceptions, that the President could \ndetermine would be exempt. My thought was that they ended up with \nalmost no regulations covered.\n  The substitute that Senator Reid and I will be pushing allows \nCongress to review all regulations. It is not just the significant ones \nthat we are able to review for all regulations. Hopefully, Congress \nwill do that. Hopefully, Congress will do a better job. We may even \nhave the opportunity to review the safety zones for America's Cup. I do \nnot know why I am intrigued by that. But I did not know the Federal \nGovernment had to be involved in making safety zones for America's Cup. \nYou would think that they would be quite able to do that without the \nbig hand of Federal Government. Maybe that is necessary. I am not sure.\n  But I see my friend and colleague from Rhode Island. Mr. President, \nit is my intention to yield back the remainder of the time shortly \nafter Senator Chafee's comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for the time he has given me. My comments will not be too \nlong.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow the Senator will vote on an amendment by the \nSenators from Oklahoma and Nevada; that is, a complete substitute to \nthe moratorium bill that is currently before us in the Senate. When we \ntake that action, the Senate will be on record in opposition to a 1-\nyear moratorium. Will they be for a moratorium? Yes. But it is a 45-day \nmoratorium, as the Senator from Oklahoma pointed out, solely applying \nto what are defined as significant regulations.\n  But this concern that I have is when the Reid-Nickles substitute goes \nto conference with the House bill, that some version of the moratorium \nincorporated in the House bill will come back from that conference. The \nmoratorium in the House bill applies to all regulations, and it is for \na year.\n  I share the concern that others have voiced that the legislation that \ncomes back from the House will include some significant moratorium, or \nlet us say 6 months, or maybe even a year. I would vigorously oppose a \nconference report if it included that type of moratorium.\n  There are many other problems with the House-passed bill. First, the \nHouse bill makes no distinction between good regulations that are \nneeded and poor regulations that are poorly designed and unneeded.\n  For instance, the Senator from Michigan has mentioned the rules-\nsetting quality standards for bottled drinking water which are to be \nissued by the Food and Drug Administration this coming April, next \nmonth. These rules would be blocked by the House bill. The bottled \nwater industry actually wants these rules to restore consumer \nconfidence. They have been urging FDA action, the Food and Drug \nAdministration action, for years, but they would be blocked by the \nHouse bill. The proponents in the House would say President has the \npower to exempt rules like that for bottled drinking water because they \nare needed to address an imminent threat to public health and safety. \nBut it is hard to believe that the bottled water industry would want \nthe President of the United States to declare that their product \nrepresents an imminent threat to health and to the people of the United \nStates before this rule could be issued.\n  There are many other regulations that are supported by the regulated \ncommunity that would be suspended by the House bill. For example, last \nDecember, EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Fish and \nWildlife Service, issued a rule that resolves a 20-year dispute between \nagriculture interests, the cities, and environmentalists over waters \ndischarged into the San Francisco Bay. This comes under the Clean Water \nAct. Reaching an agreement involving all those California interests was \nsome accomplishment. Even though all the affected interests now support \nthe agreement, it would be set aside for a year under the House bill. \nAs a result, sensitive wetland resources in the San Francisco Bay area \nwould experience further damage for no good reason.\n  [[Page S4655]] One frequently heard argument for the House moratorium \nof 1 year is the need to establish new procedures for development and \nreview of major regulations. What we need, the reason we have to have \nthis year's waiver, is we need some new approaches. We have to have a \ncost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. But most major rules already \nuse those tools. There are many regulations that are necessary to \nprotect health, safety, and the environment that have been designed by \nusing cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments. These would be \nneedlessly delayed by the moratorium.\n  For example, in February, the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed \nchanges to meat and poultry inspections to prevent life-threatening \ninfections. The science supporting that regulation is not going to be \ndifferent between now and next year. They are already using risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analyses. Yet, that rule would be set \naside. There is a possibility of more lives being endangered in the \ninterim.\n  Those on the other side supporting the House measure would say, ``Oh, \nwell. Those foods currently represent an imminent threat to health, and \nthe President could, therefore, exempt them from the delay.'' But that \naction by the President of the United States could be challenged in \ncourt and in the House bill. There is judicial review in the House \nbill. Thus, they could be held up for a considerable time.\n  Another major concern with the House bill that has not been discussed \nhere on the floor is the impact of the moratorium on the efforts by the \nStates to carry out the Clean Air Act and other laws. Let me explain. \nThe way the Clean Air Act works is State plans to reduce smog and \ncarbon monoxide pollution must be promulgated as Federal regulations \nbefore they become effective. In other words, the State comes up with a \nplan, files a plan, and the EPA then issues the regulations. But it is \nthe Federal Government that issues the regulations. EPA actually \nproposes the State plan in the Federal Register.\n  What the EPA does is take what the States have given them, puts it in \nthe Federal Register, considers comments and then promulgates the State \nplan as a Federal rule. States have been working for 4 years to develop \nnew plans under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Just as they \nare completing this difficult job, the House bill would impose a year-\nlong recess on their efforts. These are plans, mind you, that are \nwritten by the States, and they are going to be delayed.\n  Now, what is the purpose of all that? The House moratorium is also \nretroactive. It repeals regulations already in effect only to reinstate \nthem at a later time, a year from now. This is going to cause a lot of \nconfusion in the regulated community and actually can impose some very \nunfair costs on some industries.\n  Example: Under the moratorium bill passed by the House, the Clean Air \nAct program for reformulated gasolines that became effective last \nJanuary 1 would be suspended, which would cost the oil companies that \nare complying with this rule tens of millions of dollars as \nnoncomplying gasoline, nonreformulated gasoline would be allowed to \nenter into the reformulated market areas. Now, perhaps this will \nsurprise some.\n  By the way, this is not some kookie regulation dreamed up by a bunch \nof tree huggers from EPA. Reformulated gasoline is a requirement of the \nClean Air Act that was added to the law by an amendment on the floor \nsponsored by the two leaders, the current Democratic and current \nRepublican leader; namely, Senators Dole and Daschle. That came when \nthe Clean Air Act amendments were before the Senate in 1990. The \nregulation went into effect last January 1. But that is during the \nperiod covered by the House moratorium. So the requirement would be \nsuspended.\n  The oil companies subject to the regulation have built up stocks of \nmillions of gallons of reformulated gasoline to meet the demand in \ntheir markets. Information from the Congressional Research Service \nindicates the oil industry now has 1.85 billion--that is not million, \nthat is billion, B as in billion--gallons of reformulated gasoline in \nstorage right now.\n  If the House moratorium bill should be enacted, the reformulated \ngasoline requirement would be suspended and cheaper conventional \ngasoline could be brought into those markets. The oil companies that \nare complying with the law could probably still sell their reformulated \ngasoline. Sure, they could sell it, but they would have to obviously do \nit at the price of conventional gasoline, which is some 3 cents a \ngallon less expensive because of the costs that have gone into making \nthe reformulated gasoline. So that will be a loss of about $55 \nmillion--$55 million--if the House moratorium were enacted.\n  Mr. President, my vote on the final bill will, of course, depend upon \nthe amendments that might be offered and adopted during the course of \nthis debate. But I did want to join with others to express my grave \nconcerns about the House moratorium bill. Should I vote for this bill \nlater this week, I would oppose any report that came back from the \nconference with a regulatory moratorium, that is, a year, 6 months, \nsomething to that effect, which is quite different from the 45-day \ndelay that is in this legislation here before us.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know of no other Senators who wish to \nspeak on this issue. So I will yield back the remainder of our time.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/27/senate-section/article/S4642-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, today, I rise as a matter of personal \nprivilege to share with the Senate a Nevadan whose life is a role model \nfor all Americans. This man, Mike O'Callaghan, has not only had an \nimpact on me personally, but also the State of Nevada, our country, and \nmany parts of the world. Mike O'Callaghan is a man of unbridled energy \nwho has had an enviable and remarkable career as a war hero, an \neducator, a public servant, a distinguished State Governor, a newspaper \neditor and publisher, and a citizen of the world.\n  I first met Mike O'Callaghan in 1956 when he began teaching U.S. \nGovernment classes at Basic High School in Henderson, NV. He had been \ndecorated as a marine in the Korean conflict and was awarded 2 Purple \nHearts, a Bronze Star with valor, and a Silver Star for heroism. \nUnfortunately, he had also lost a leg in battle, but he never used that \ninjury as an excuse.\n  I learned a lot about government from Mr. O'Callaghan, but I learned \nmore about life. He was my boxing coach, my adviser, my mentor, and my \nfriend. And he was largely responsible for helping me obtain \nscholarships and personally assisting me with money to go to college.\n  This was not unusual, for Mr. O'Callaghan took an active interest in \nall of his students and pushed all of them to do their best. We stood \nin awe of him, we feared him, and we deeply respected him, and all of \nus students were better because of him.\n  While I was away in college and law school, Mike continued working \nfor \n[[Page S4656]] others as Las Vegas chief probation officer and as \nNevada's first director of health and human services. He also worked in \nvarious capacities in the Federal service including being a program \nmanagement director at Job Corps and also leading region 9 of the \nOffice of Emergency Preparedness, the predecessor to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  In 1970, as a distinct underdog, he ran for Governor of Nevada and in \none of the State's biggest upsets, he was elected chief executive of \nthe State. That same year, I was fortunate to have been elected \nLieutenant Governor. Once again, Mike O'Callaghan took me under his \nwing as my mentor and teacher. He guided the State through turbulent \ntimes and provided the kind of leadership that only one of his strength \nand determination could.\n  After leaving the Governor's mansion, Mike O'Callaghan returned to \nthe private sector but he never left public life. He\n became editor of the Las Vegas Sun, and as publisher of the Henderson \nHome News and the Boulder City News, Governor O'Callaghan has been a \nstaunch advocate for working people, for families, and for the \ncommunity. He upholds the great principle that ``The vital measure of a \nnewspaper is not its size, but its spirit--that is, its responsibility \nto report the news fully, accurately and fairly.''\n\n  In addition, Governor O'Callaghan has worked tirelessly to help those \nin underdeveloped countries to be more democratic and economically \nviable. He has served as a peace negotiator in Central America, \nmonitored elections in Iraq, and facilitated distribution of food and \nhumanitarian supplies all over the world. Whether it is working with \nMosquito Indians in Nicaragua, refugees in Iraq, or impoverished \nresidents of Mexico, Mike O'Callaghan has indeed proven himself to be a \ncitizen of the world, and he has been revered everywhere he has \ntraveled.\n  But his best work in a foreign land has been his assistance to the \npeople of Israel. From his role as a tank mechanic to his position of \ncabinet adviser, the people of Israel have always benefited from his \ninvolvement.\n  I am proud to have Mike as my friend and he continues to be my \nteacher. He and his wife, Carolyn, and their five wonderful children \nhave made Nevada a better place for all of us who live there. They have \ngiven much more than they will ever get in return. In fact, Mike \nO'Callaghan's most noteworthy contribution to me has been the example \nhe has set as a father and grandfather.\n  On April 2, 1995, Governor O'Callaghan will be honored by Hadassah \nfor his unceasing efforts on behalf of others. I want the entire \ncountry to know of Mike's achievement and to join those of us in Nevada \nin paying tribute to this great leader.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/27/senate-section/article/S4655-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills, previously received from the House, were read \nthe first and second times by unanimous consent and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 421.

Mr. President, development of the water resources of \nthe United States have been a vital factor in the growth and prosperity \nof this country. Our water resources have brought us a strong \nagricultural base, power generation, navigation, and domestic and \nindustrial water supplies. However, the gains we have made in terms of \nproductivity and efficiency have in many cases exacted a toll on our \nwater resources. Despite a concerted effort to improve the quality of \nour waterways, recent estimates indicate that 38 percent of our rivers, \n44 percent of our lakes, and 97 percent of the Great Lakes remain \ndegraded.\n  This is a continuing problem worthy of the earnest efforts of each of \nus. The Clean Water Act has made great improvements in the quality of \nthe Nation's waterways. The goals of the Clean Water Act \nreauthorization legislation now pending on the Senate calendar \ncertainly focus much needed attention on the continuing dilemma we face \nwith respect to our water resources.\n  Today, I am proud to join with Senator Thad Cochran, to introduce the \nWaterways Restoration Act in the hope of providing additional tools to \nimprove the waterways of the United States. The legislation I introduce \ntoday is the companion to legislation introduced in the House by \nCongresswoman Elizabeth Furse of Oregon. I compliment Congresswoman \nFurse for her fine leadership in this area and I am proud to introduce \nthe Senate version of this fine proposal.\n  The Waterways Restoration Act would establish a technical assistance \nand grant program for waterway restoration programs within the Soil and \nConservation Service [SCS] at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. No \nnew money would be required to fund this program. Rather, the program \nwould draw on existing funds by redirecting 20 percent of the SCS's \nexisting Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Program budget to \nfund nonstructural, community-based projects.\n  Waterway restoration is a cost effective way to control flooding, \nerosion and pollution runoff. This legislation would fund local \nprojects to establish riparian zones, stabilize stream banks, and \nrestore areas polluted by urban runoff. Both urban and rural areas \nwould be eligible for project funding. The bill also contains an \nenvironmental justice provision that would place a priority on projects \nin historically disadvantaged communities overlooked by Federal cleanup \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, this is sound, progressive legislation. It addresses \nin an effective way the pressing water resource problems continuing to \nface this Nation. As we search for ways to reinvent our Government to \nmake it more responsive to the citizens of this country, we should look \nmore and more to proposals--like this one--that draw on the initiative \nand ingenuity bubbling over in our communities rather than one-size-\nfits-all, top-down Federal programs. As Congresswoman Furse has noted, \nthis is a funded Federal nonmandate, which allows communities to design \nand implement the restoration projects they want for the streams, \ncreeks, and rivers in their neighborhoods.\n  I look forward to working with members of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee to advance this meritorious proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 626\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Waterways Restoration Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) restoring degraded streams, rivers, and other waterways \n     to a natural state is a cost effective means of controlling \n     flooding, excessive erosion, sedimentation, and nonpoint \n     pollution, including stormwater runoff;\n       (2) protecting and restoring watersheds provides critical \n     ecological benefits by restoring and maintaining \n     biodiversity, providing fish and wildlife habitat, filtering \n     pollutants, and performing other important ecological \n     functions;\n       (3) waterway restoration and protection projects can \n     provide important economic and educational benefits by \n     rejuvenating waterfront areas, providing recreational \n     opportunities such as greenways, and creating community \n     service jobs and job training opportunities in waterway \n     restoration for disadvantaged youths, displaced resource \n     harvesters, and other unemployed persons;\n       (4) restoring waterways helps to increase the fishing \n     potential of waterways and restore diminished fisheries, \n     which are important to local and regional cultures and \n     economies; and\n       (5) low income and minority communities frequently \n     experience disproportionately severe degradation of \n     waterways, but historically have had difficulty in meeting \n     eligibility requirements for Federal watershed projects under \n     the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1001 et seq.) due to Federal policy obstacles such as local \n     cost share requirements and formulas for assessing costs and \n     benefits that favor high land values.\n       (b) Policy.--Congress declares it in the national interest \n     to--\n       (1) protect and restore the chemical, biological, and \n     physical components of waterways and associated ecological \n     systems such that the biological and physical structures, \n     diversity, functions, and dynamics of the waterways and \n     systems are restored;\n       (2) replace deteriorating stormwater structural \n     infrastructures and physical waterway alterations that are \n     ecologically damaging with cost effective, low maintenance, \n     and ecologically sensitive projects;\n       (3) promote the use of nonstructural means to manage and \n     convey streamflow, stormwater, and flood waters;\n       (4) increase the involvement of the public and youth \n     conservation or service corps in the monitoring, \n     inventorying, and restoration of watersheds to improve public \n     education, prevent pollution, and develop coordinated citizen \n     and governmental partnerships to restore damaged waterways; \n     and\n       (5) benefit business districts, local economies, and \n     neighborhoods through the restoration of waterways and the \n     development of multiuse greenway corridors.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF WORKS OF IMPROVEMENT.\n\n       Section 2 of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 1002) is amended by striking ``Each project'' \n     and all that follows through ``of the project.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, up until now those of us who have supported \nreforming the application of the antitrust laws to baseball have been \ndivided between competing approaches. I, together with Senators \nMoynihan, Graham, and others, introduced S. 415. Senator Thurmond, \ntogether with Senator Leahy, introduced S. 416.\n  I am pleased to introduce today a bill that brings together these \ncompeting approaches and that has the consolidated support of Senator \nThurmond, Senator Leahy, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Graham. We \nbelieve that this bill will bring about sound reforms that ensure that \nbaseball is treated fairly and properly under the antitrust laws. We \nbelieve that in the long run our bill will contribute to constructive \nlabor relations between the players and the owners. We believe that the \nreforms proposed by this bill are worth making even apart from the \nexistence of the ongoing dispute between baseball owners and players.\n  Let me emphasize that our bill would not impose a big-government \nsolution to the current dispute between the owners and the players. On \nthe contrary, it would get government out of the way by eliminating a \nserious government-made obstacle to settlement.\n  Seventy-three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that professional \nbaseball is not a business in interstate commerce and is therefore \nimmune from the reach of the federal antitrust laws. This ruling was \nalmost certainly wrong when it was first rendered in 1922. Fifty years \nlater, in 1972, when the Supreme Court readdressed this question, the \nlimited concept of interstate commerce on which the 1922 ruling rested \nhad long since been shattered. The Court in 1972 accurately noted that \nbaseball's antitrust immunity was an ``aberration'' that no other sport \nor industry enjoyed. But it left it to Congress to correct the Court's \nerror.\n  A limited repeal of this antitrust immunity is now in order. Labor \nnegotiations between owners and players are impeded by the fact that \nbaseball players, unlike all other workers, have no resort under the \nlaw if the baseball owners act in a manner that would, in the absence \nof the immunity, violate the antitrust laws. This aberration in the \nantitrust laws has handed the owners a huge club that gives them unique \nleverage in bargaining and discourages them from accepting reasonable \nterms. This is an aberration that Government has created, and it is an \naberration that Government should fix.\n  The legislation that I am introducing would provide for a limited \nrepeal of professional baseball's antitrust immunity. This repeal would \nnot affect the two matters that owners say that the immunity \nlegitimately protects: Namely, franchise relocation rules, and the \nminor leagues. Under our bill, major league baseball's ability to \ncontrol franchise relocation and to deal with the minor leagues would \nremain unchanged. Our bill also would not affect any other sport or \nbusiness.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Major \nLeague Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995, which I am cosponsoring \nwith Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, and others. Our legislation would \nrepeal the antitrust exemption which shields major league baseball from \nthe antitrust laws that apply to all other sports and unregulated \nbusinesses in our Nation. This bill is a result of discussions between \nmyself and Senators Hatch and Leahy following the recent hearing which \nI chaired on this important issue. I am particularly pleased that this \nlegislation focuses on the ongoing policy issues relating to baseball's \nspecial antitrust exemption.\n  The Hatch-Thurmond-Leahy legislation eliminates baseball's antitrust \nexemption, with certain exceptions, and is based on S. 416, the Major \nLeague Baseball Antitrust Reform Act, which Senator Leahy and I \nintroduced on February 14, 1995. One substantive change has been made \nto include a provision relating to franchise relocation, in order to \naddress concerns raised by some about the practical effect of ending \nbaseball's antitrust exemption. As I have previously stated, however, \nit is my belief that it may be worthwhile reviewing the franchise \nrelocation issue as it relates to all professional sports.\n  The Hatch-Thurmond-Leahy legislation would also maintain the status \nquo for the minor leagues. It is important to protect the existing \nminor league relationships in order to avoid disruption of the more \nthan 170 minor league teams which exist throughout our Nation. the \nHatch-Thurmond-Leahy bill also makes clear that it does not override \nthe provisions of the Sports Broadcast Act of 1961, which permits \nleaguewide contracts with television networks.\n  Our bill is not specially drafted in an attempt to resolve the \nbaseball's current labor dispute. The legislation does not affect the \nso-called nonstatutory labor exemption, which shields employers from \nthe antitrust laws when they are involved in collective bargaining with \na union. Removing the antitrust exemption will not automatically \nresolve baseball's problems, but I believe it will move baseball in the \nright direction.\n  I noted earlier that as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's Antitrust, Business Rights, and Competition Subcommittee, I \nheld a hearing on baseball's antitrust exemption on February 15, 1995. \nAt the hearing, the subcommittee heard from both players and owners on \nwhether the exemption helps or hurts the sport, and what effect repeal \nwould have on labor relations and other issues. the subcommittee very \ndirectly told the owners and players that it is up to them to resolve \ntheir differences quickly and play ball for the sake of the American \npublic.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the Congress should interfere in \nbaseball's ongoing labor dispute. But it is my belief that the Congress \nshould repeal the Court imposed antitrust exemption and restore \nbaseball to the same level playing field as other professional sports \nand unregulated businesses. By removing the antitrust exemption, the \nplayers and owners will have one less distraction from their \nnegotiations, and the Congress will no longer be intertwined in \nbaseball's special antitrust exemption.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 628. A bill to repeal the Federal estate and gift taxes and the \ntax on generation-skipping transfers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    family heritage preservation act\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator Helms, to introduce the Family Heritage Preservation \nAct, a bill to repeal Federal estate and gift taxes, and the tax on \ngeneration-skipping transfers. A companion bill, H.R. 784, was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives last month by Congressman \nChris Cox of California.\n  [[Page S4661]] The Federal estate tax is one of the most wasteful and \nunfair taxes currently on the books. It penalizes people for a lifetime \nof hard work, savings, and investment. It hurts small business and \nthreatens jobs. It causes people to spend time, energy, and money \nfinding ways to avoid the tax--by setting up trusts and other devices--\nwhen they could otherwise devote those resources to more productive \neconomic uses.\n  The estate tax is particularly onerous for small family businesses. \nAccording to a 1993 survey by Prince & Associates--a Stratford, CT, \nresearch and consulting firm--9 out of 10 family businesses that failed \nwithin 3 years of the principal owner's death said that trouble paying \nestate taxes contributed to their companies; demise.\n  That is a travesty. As if the Federal Government didn't tax enough \nduring life, it has to prey upon people and their grieving families \never after death. As a constituent of mine, Pearle Wisotsky Marr, wrote \nin a recent letter to me:\n       Since my father died, our lives have been a nightmare of \n     lawyers and trust companies with the common theme, `you have \n     to protect the family business.' It was hard enough trying to \n     recuperate after my father's long illness, and then adjusting \n     to the reality he was gone.\n  That's wrong, and it's economically destructive. The Marr family \nbuilt up a small business from just one employee 35 years ago to 200 \nemployees today. Creating badly needed jobs in the community is not \nsomething for which the Marr family should be penalized. It's something \nthat should be encouraged.\n  A study published by the Institute for Research on the Economics of \nTaxation [IRET] looked at how the Nation's economy would have performed \nhad the transfer taxes been repealed in 1971. The simulation showed \nthat, by 1991, the gross domestic product [GDP] would have been $46.3 \nbillion higher, there would have been 262,000 more full-time equivalent \njobs, and the stock of capital would have been $398.6 billion greater \nthan the respective actual amounts in that year.\n  The report went on to project that if the transfer taxes were \nrepealed in 1993, the nation would experience significant economic \nbenefits by the year 2000. ``GDP would be $79.22 billion greater, \n228,000 more people would be employed, and the amount of accumulated \nsaving and capital would be $630 billion larger than projected under \npresent law.''\n  These taxes have an impact on Americans of all income levels. As \nnoted in the IRET's report, ``by discouraging private saving and \ncapital formation, these taxes depress labor productivity and real \nincome. Transfer taxes, thus, impede labor's upward mobility.''\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the \nFamily Heritage Preservation Act. I ask that the text of the bill be \nreprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 628\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Heritage Preservation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Hard working American men and women spend a lifetime \n     saving to provide for their children and grandchildren, \n     paying taxes all the while. Throughout their lives, they pay \n     taxes on the income and gains from their labor and their \n     investment. Because of the heavy burden of income taxes, \n     property taxes, and other levies, it is enormously difficult \n     to accumulate savings for a family's future. Worst of all, \n     when the purpose of that hard earned saving is about to be \n     achieved, families discover that between 37 percent and 55 \n     percent of their after-tax savings is confiscated by Federal \n     inheritance taxes.\n       (2) These transfer, estate, and gift taxes punish lifelong \n     habits of thrift; they discourage entrepreneurship; they \n     penalize families; and they have a negative effect on other \n     tax revenue sources.\n       (3) These taxes raise almost no material revenue for the \n     Federal Government. In fiscal year 1994, they produced only 1 \n     percent of total Federal revenues.\n       (4) The waste and economic inefficiency caused by \n     inheritance taxes is well known. American families employ \n     legions of tax accountants and lawyers each year to set up \n     trusts and other prolix devices designed to avoid these \n     onerous levies. The make-work imposed upon the economy \n     comprises billions of dollars.\n       (5) In order to pay these excessive taxes, many small \n     businesses must liquidate all or part of their assets. By \n     causing business closures, these taxes constrict business \n     activity, increase unemployment, and reduce tax revenues to \n     the Federal Government.\n       (6) Independent analyses indicate that, were these onerous \n     taxes repealed, the Nation's GDP, Federal and State tax \n     revenues, employment base, and capital formation would \n     increase substantially. According to one such survey, \n     repealing these taxes would increase GDP by $79,220,000,000, \n     create 228,000 new jobs, and increase savings by \n     $630,000,000,000 by the end of the century.\n       (7) Repealing these taxes will ensure economic fairness for \n     all American families and businesses, as well as economic \n     growth and prosperity for the Nation as a whole.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF FEDERAL TRANSFER TAXES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is hereby repealed.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The repeal made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to the estates of decedents dying, and gifts and \n     generation-skipping transfers made, after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Pressler):\n  S. 629. A bill to provide that no action be taken under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 for a renewal of a permit for grazing \non National Forest System lands; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                   grazing permit renewal legislation\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nis of very significant importance to the farmers and ranchers in my \nState of Wyoming and throughout the West.\n  Let me preface by saying that Wyoming is more than 50 percent owned \nby the Federal Government. That includes BLM lands and includes forest \nlands and park lands, of course. So the decisions made by public land \nmanagers is very important to us.\n  Recent decisions by the court have indicated that the U.S. Forest \nService and perhaps the BLM, as well, must now complete environmental \nimpact statements on environmental assessments on all term grazing \npermits that expire on December 31 of this year.\n  As most of you know, much of the land in these western States is \nintermingled private land, Federal land, State land. So that in order \nto put together an economic unit of livestock, there is private land, \ngenerally, with the water, and winter feeding, and summer grazing is \nquite often on Federal land. And these ranchers graze there with a \npermit based on animal unit months and they are 10-year permits \ngenerally.\n  Under this new environmental assessment, the review must be done \nunder NEPA regulations. This is in addition to the environmental \nassessments that are already made on the forest plan. Each 10 years, \neach forest goes through a plan. They talk about grazing, they talk \nabout mining, they talk about oil and gas, and other uses of these \nvarious lands.\n  The problem now is that, in addition to that already done evaluation \non grazing, the courts at least have implied that there has to be this \nnew environmental assessment on each of these grazing leases.\n  There are approximately 4,500 Forest Service grazing leases that \nexpire at the end of this year. There are nearly 200 of those in \nWyoming.\n  The problem is twofold. The first part of the problem, which I think \nhas to do with what we are talking about here, is that we already have \na mechanism for taking a look at the impact of grazing on forests. We \ndo this in a very extensive process every 10 years, and it can be \namended and renewed at any time.\n  Furthermore, those rangers and BLM employees who supervise this, any \ntime that there is damage to grazing lands, they have the authority to \ndo something about it. So it is redundant. It is an expense that we do \nnot need to have.\n  The second problem is that, assuming that it did go forward, there is \nno way that these can all be done prior to the end of 1995, when these \ngrazing permits expire, and we are faced with the proposition of not \nhaving the opportunity to put these animals on public lands, and \neventually the impact would be that farmers and ranchers would very \nlikely go out of business.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill simply says that the NEPA requirements \nthat \n[[Page S4662]] go below the Forest Service level would not have to be \ncarried out.\n  I think it is very consistent with what we are doing here on \nregulations. It is very consistent with saving a very important \neconomic industries in the West. I urge my fellow Senators to take a \nlook at this bill, particularly those of us from the West, and I urge \nthe support of those who come from outside of the West for the \nenactment of this important bill.\n  Because of recent court cases, it has been determined that the U.S. \nForest Service must now complete an environmental assessment [EA] or \nfull-blown environment impact statement [EIS] on all term-grazing \npermits that expire on December 31 of this year, in order to comply \nwith National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] guidelines.\n  This is in addition to the environmental analysis that is already \nrequired under NEPA for individual forest plans, which considers \ngrazing, timber sales, mining, oil and gas permits and other actions on \nForest Service System lands. This is a redundant process, and since the \nForest Service has decided that livestock grazing is a continuation of \nan existing use for which environmental concerns have been addressed in \nforest plans, creates an enormous workload burden for the agency.\n  What is worse, is the fact that no grazing permit will be reissued \nwithout the proper environmental evaluations. Forest Service officials \nwill have to scramble to complete all of the work that will be \nrequired, and the chances of some permits being altered or dropped \naltogether are high. This creates a great deal of uncertainty for folks \nwho depend on these permits for grazing livestock as their livelihood.\n  The bill that I am introducing today corrects this problem by stating \nthat no action needs to be taken under NEPA for renewal of a grazing \npermit on national Forest Service lands, which was not already \naddressed in the forest plan.\n  Nationwide, approximately 4,500 Forest Service grazing permits expire \nat the end of this year--and within the next 3 years--1995-97--a large \nmajority of grazing permits will expire throughout the country.\n  In my State of Wyoming, 191 Forest Service grazing permits expire at \nthe end of this year. I have heard from many ranchers who are extremely \nconcerned about this process, and are worried they will not be able to \ngraze their livestock if NEPA compliance is not completed in a timely \nfashion.\n  While farmers and ranchers continue to become more productive and \nmore efficient, they are continually faced with increased paperwork and \nFederal intrusion into their lives.\n  Likewise, even though President Clinton requested an increase of $25 \nmillion for the Forest Service's fiscal year 1996 budget to help \ncomplete NEPA requirements, no permit holder is safe from losing their \ngrazing privileges.\n  Mr. President, it is critical for Congress to address this issue and \nprevent the economic problems that will occur if some relief is not \ngiven. With issues such as grazing fees and rangeland reform \nresurfacing again, it is important to stop this heavy-handed directive, \nwhich will put many small- and medium-sized ranchers out of business, \nand potentially destroy the practice of multiple use on Forest Service \nlands.\n  I am proud to sponsor this piece of legislation because farming and \nranching are valuable assets to Wyoming and the rest of the Western \nUnited States. Besides addressing the short-term crisis that exists \nwith the number of grazing permits set to expire this year, the \ninitiative also addresses the long-term effects for permits expiring in \nthe years to come. I believe we have an excellent opportunity to work \nwith the Forest Service and ranchers alike, on a bipartisan basis, to \nchange this unnecessary burden and restore hope to America's farm and \nranch families. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and look \nforward to working with them in the coming months.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 630. A bill to impose comprehensive economic sanctions against \nIran; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                       iran foreign sanctions act\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am introducing the Iran Foreign \nSanctions Act of 1995.\n  Two months ago when I introduced S. 277, the Comprehensive Iran \nSanctions Act of 1995, many stated that while a total trade embargo \nbetween the United States and Iran, as called for in S. 277, could have \na real effect on Iran, the effects on foreign corporations would be \nnegligible. This bill is designed to address this issue.\n  My legislation will place procurement and export sanctions on any \nforeign person or corporation that has engaged in any trade with Iran \nin any goods or technology, as defined in the Export Administration Act \nof 1979. Simply put, a foreign corporation or person will have to \nchoose between trade with the United States or trade with Iran.\n  As long as Iran continues to support terrorism, seeks to obtain \nweapons of mass destruction, and continues its abysmal human rights \npractices, foreign companies and persons will be proscribed, with only \na few exceptions, from trading with the United States.\n  There is great precedence for this approach and I will list some of \nthese instances:\n  The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which authorizes the President \nto limit the importation into the United States of any product or \nservice of a foreign country to the extent to which that country \nbenefits from the sanctions imposed on South Africa by this act;\n  The Foreign Relations Act of 1994, which incorporated the Nuclear \nProliferation Prevention Act, providing for a ban on U.S. Government \nprocurement from any third country company which assists another \ncountry to acquire nuclear weapons;\n  Missile Technology Control Regime sanctions attached to the Arms \nExport Control Act [AECA] and the Export Administration Act [EAA] that \ndenies U.S. Government procurement; licenses for the transfer of any \nitem on the U.S. munitions list [AECA] or the dual-use technologies \nlist [EAA]; and the importation into the United States of any product \nof the foreign company; and\n  The AECA also has similar sanctions for chemical and biological \nweapons proliferation, as does the Iran-Iraq Non-Proliferation Act of \n1992, as well as various anti-Arab boycott pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. President, my legislation has precedent, and as such, I feel is a \nuseful tool to counter those who state that any ban on U.S. companies \nwill only hurt U.S. companies. I want to send the message that when you \ndeal with Iran, you are making a mistake. We cannot afford to provide \nthis brutal regime with the hard currency so vital to its existence. As \nlong as companies trade with Iran, we will have a regime that is \ncapable of supporting terrorism and aggression.\n  If there is anything that we can learn from last week's revelations \nof the positioning of Iranian chemical weapons in the Straits of \nHormuz, it is that Iran is a dangerous and aggressive nation with which \nappeasement will not work.\n  We cannot sit back and wish this entire problem away, we have to take \naction and send the message to the world that Iran's actions can no \nlonger be tolerated. Until the regime stops these offensive and violent \nactions, the world will not trade with it or deal with it at all.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it \nis important for the United States and our allies. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 630\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Foreign Sanctions Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

REPORT REQUIRED.\n\n       Beginning 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and every 90 days thereafter, the President shall transmit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     describing--\n       (1) the nuclear and other military capabilities of Iran; \n     and\n       (2) the support, if any, provided by Iran for acts of \n     international terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to prevent handgun violence and illegal commerce in \nfirearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              handgun control and violence prevention act\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, handgun violence is redefining the \nAmerican way of life. We must own up to this reality and bring \ndesperately needed rationality to our gun laws. This is why I rise \ntoday to introduce the Handgun Control and Violence Prevention Act of \n1995. This legislation is one more important step in ensuring that the \nmadness of gun violence in this country will be brought to an end.\n  Every year, more than 24,000 Americans--65 a day--are killed with \nhandguns, in homicides, by committing suicide, and by unintentional \ninjuries. Handguns account for only one-third of all firearms, but are \nresponsible for over two-thirds of all firearm-related deaths. Handguns \nare used in over 80 percent of all firearm murders. Ninety-five percent \nof the people injured by a handgun each year require emergency care or \nhospitalization. Of these, 68 percent require overnight care and 32 \npercent require a hospital stay of 8 days or more. In 1991, the United \nStates led the developed world with 14,373 gun murders, as compared to \n186 gun murders in Canada, 76 in Australia, 60 in England, and 74 in \nJapan. One difference between the United States and the other countries \ncited is that the other countries all have much stricter gun control \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, these statistics are not just idle numbers. A few days \nago, Sheila Gillespie, a 65-year-old widowed mother of four, was shot \nin the forehead when she got out of her car to open her garage door at \nher home in West Caldwell, NJ. Two carjacking assailants, ages 17 and \n19, followed her home, viciously shot her, stole her 1990 Honda and \nwere later apprehended driving the car. Ms. Gillespie, who attended \nmass every day at her local church and is well-known as an outgoing and \nfriendly person, is currently fighting for her life in an intensive \ncare unit at University Hospital in Newark, NJ.\n  Moreover, a few days after the senseless shooting in West Caldwell, \nfour people were murdered and another critically injured in an apparent \nrobbery attempt at a postal substation in my hometown of Montclair, NJ. \nMr. President, two postal workers, Ernest Spruill and Scott Walensky, \nand two customers, Robert Leslie and George Lomaga, were forced into a \nbackroom and made to lie down on the floor. They were then shot at \npoint blank range, execution style, with a 9-millimeter Taurus semi-\nautomatic pistol containing a high capacity magazine holding 15 deadly, \nflesh-ripping Black Talon bullets. A third customer, David \n[[Page S4664]] Grossman, entered the post office as the robbery was in \nprogress. He was shot in the face and is currently fighting for\n his life in the hospital.\n\n  Mr. President, the victims of the Montclair massacre were shot by an \nassault weapon. Because of a bullet from an assault weapon, Mr. \nPresident, Blanche Spruill, who telephoned her husband of 34 years, \nErnest, at the post office on the day of the murder and got no answer, \nwill never see nor talk to him again. Mr. President, because of a \nbullet fired from an assault weapon, Scott Walensky will never again \nsee his wife, Mary Ann, or his three children. Mr. President, this is \nexactly the type of situation we intended to prevent when the assault \nweapons ban was passed in the 1994 omnibus crime law. Thus, any \ndiscussion regarding a repeal of the assault weapons ban must begin \nwith the tragic fact that the wife of Scott Walensky is now a widow and \nhis three children are now fatherless.\n  Everyone is aware of the devastating gun violence that occurs on the \nstreets of urban America. However, the recent mass murder in Montclair \noccurred in a community that was described in the recent issue of New \nJersey Monthly as ``a desirable community where parents feel safe \nallowing young children to ride their bicycles around town.'' The \nplague of gun violence has engulfed America, and, Mr. President, the \nAmerican people want to know one question from their elected officials: \nWhen will the spiraling, senseless gun violence occurring in the cities \nand suburbs of this country cease? This legislation, Mr. President, is \nan attempt to stop the senseless violence.\n  Mr. President, some will argue that these grim statistics are the \nresult of weak law enforcement, light sentencing, legitimate fear, and \nthe waning of family values. Others will argue that they are the result \nof joblessness, poverty, and long-term neglect of our most violent \nneighborhoods. I have no doubt that the growing rate of violent \nactivity has been aggravated in part by all these factors. However, \naccepting many of these causes of handgun violence does not erase the \nreality that crime and deviant behavior have become much more of a \nburden on our society because of the explosive growth in handguns. \nDisputes that were settled with fists and knives 10 years ago are now \nbeing settled with guns. The number, availability, and destructive \nability of handguns has contributed significantly to this tragedy.\n  Every single handgun used in a crime starts out as a legal gun. \nHowever, Mr. President, many of the weapons used in crimes are \npurchased illegally. The black market in illegal handguns is enormous \nand deadly. Gunrunners go to States with lax gun control laws, purchase \nhundreds of guns using fake identification, and then sell them on the \nstreet corners of our cities to anyone with available cash. Straw \npurchasers with clean records often stand in to buy guns for criminals \nand gun-runners. We must crack down on these rogue dealers, gunrunners,\n and straw purchasers. Only then can we prevent the illegal sale and \nuse of guns. Only then can we help drive guns off our streets, out of \nour schools, and from our communities.\n\n  The purpose of this bill, Mr. President, is to make it at least as \ndifficult to use a handgun as it is to drive a car. A gun, like a car, \ncan be a dangerous instrumentality. As such, since we require \npurchasers of cars to have valid operator's licenses, we should, at the \nvery least, require that the purchaser of a gun obtain a license. Mr. \nPresident, when the evidence on the danger of handguns is made clear to \nus every day, it is irresponsible to allow an instrument which can \ncause so much physical and psychological damage to be made available to \npeople on such a liberal basis.\n  This bill makes it illegal to purchase a handgun without a valid, \nnationally uniform, State-issued handgun license. The license would be \nsimilar to a driver's license and consist of an identification card \nwith a photograph. In order to acquire the license, a person would have \nto undergo a background check, present proof of residency in the State \nof purchase, get fingerprinted, and pass a handgun safety course \noffered by a local law enforcement officer. Only new purchases of \nhandguns would require a license. Those who currently possess handguns \nwould not have to acquire a license unless they wanted to purchase more \nhandguns.\n  To stop the transfer of handguns from strawman purchasers to \ncriminals and others intending to commit crimes, this legislation \nrequires that all handgun transfers be registered with appropriate law \nenforcement officials. If the person transferring the weapon does not \nregister the transfer, he or she will be in violation of Federal law.\n  To curb interstate gunrunning, this bill limits the purchase of a \nhandgun by any one person to one gun a month. Mr. President, citizens \nhave the right to possess a gun for personal protection. However, Mr. \nPresident, I honestly cannot say that someone who purchases 15 to 20 \nguns at one time is doing so for personal protection. Mr. President, \nwhen this provision goes into effect, maybe Interstate 95 will lose its \nnickname, the ``Iron Road,'' as it becomes more difficult to run guns \nfrom States with little gun control to States, like New Jersey, that \nalready enjoy some of the protections in this bill.\n  This bill also includes tough standards for Federal firearms dealers \nlicenses. Federally licensed firearms dealers will have to pass strict \nbackground checks and meet all State and local laws. This will help \nguard against rogue gun dealers, who illegally sell thousands of \nfirearms to drug gangs and violent criminals.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also imposes stiff penalties on gun \nthieves. It further requires that dealers provide adequate security \nagainst theft from the dealer's place of business.\n  Mr. President, this bill also increases the licensing fees for \nfederally licensed firearm dealers to $3,000 over a 3-year period. \nToday, there are more gun dealers than grocery stores. This is \noutrageous, and I hope this bill will change that situation.\n  Mr. President, the first anniversary of the Brady law recently \npassed. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] estimates \nthat the number of applications to purchase handguns that were denied \nin the Brady States nationwide was approximately 41,000. In a survey of \nselected jurisdictions, ATF found that more that 15,500 persons who \napplied to purchase handguns, including 4,365 convicted felons and 945 \nfugitives, had their applications denied.\n  Of equal importance, Mr. President, is the fact that as a result of \nenforcement of the Brady law and provisions in the Federal crime bill, \nthere are now more gas stations than gun dealers in this country. As \nincredible as it sounds, Mr. President, just a few years ago there were \nmore gun dealers than gas stations in America. These encouraging \nresults, Mr. President, indicate that with strong legislation and tough \nenforcement, we can win the war on senseless gun violence.\n  In closing, Mr. President, we must continue our fight to end the \ndeath and destruction of our children and our families, which is too \neasily becoming a fact of life in our cities and towns. I urge support \nfor this responsible handgun licensing and registration legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 631\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Handgun Control and Violence \n     Prevention Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) crimes committed with firearms threaten the peace and \n     domestic tranquility of the United States and threaten the \n     security and general welfare of the Nation and its people;\n       (2) crimes committed with firearms, especially those \n     committed with handguns, have imposed a substantial burden on \n     interstate commerce;\n       (3) firearms are easily transported across State boundaries \n     and, as a result, individual State action to regulate \n     firearms is made ineffective by lax regulation by other \n     States; and\n       (4) it is necessary to establish uniform national laws \n     governing all aspects of the firearms industry, requiring \n     handgun licensing and registration, expanding the categories \n     of persons prohibited from possessing firearms, limiting \n     Federal firearms licensees to bona fide importers, \n     manufacturers, and dealers, \n     [[Page S4665]] and prohibiting the sale of semiautomatic \n     assault weapons and other dangerous weapons.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to call my colleagues' attention to the visit to the United \nStates this week of New Zealand's Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. James \nBolger. This is the first visit of a sitting Prime Minister to our \ncountry in over a decade.\n  New Zealand and the United States have had traditionally close \nrelations based largely on shared cultural ties to Great Britain and \nsecurity concerns in the South Pacific. We have been close allies in \nboth world wars, and New Zealand has participated with us and Australia \nin the regional ANZUS security alliance. We both participate in such \neconomic organizations as APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Corporation], \nPECC [Pacific Economic Cooperation Council], and the PBEC [Pacific \nBasin Economic Committee].\n  But the relationship has not been without its tensions. The primary \nfocus of United States-New Zealand relations over the last 10 years has \nrevolved around port visits nuclear by armed and powered United States \nNavy ships. In the mid-1980's, New Zealand enacted legislation \ndeclaring the country a nuclear-free zone. As a result, United States \nnuclear powered or armed Navy ships were banned from New Zealand ports. \nSince it is not U.S. policy to identify which ships are or are not \nnuclear--some 40 percent are--the effect was to prohibit any port calls \nby our Navy. Washington retaliated by formally abrogating our defense \ntreaty relationship with New Zealand, ceasing to share intelligence \ninformation, and cutting off all high-level ties between governments.\n  Mr. President, while this issue is one of importance in our bilateral \nrelationship and thus should not be swept under the rug, I choose not \nto dwell on it today for several reasons. First, it is not the only \nfacet to our relationship. The rift has narrowed somewhat over the \nyears; and in spite of it, we have continued to work side-by-side with \nNew Zealand on other security issues. New Zealand has been an active \nparticipant in a series of peacekeeping missions, and fought with \nAmerican troops in the gulf. More recently, New Zealand was the first \ncountry to make a monetary contribution to KEDO in furtherance of the \nagreed framework with North Korea.\n  In addition, New Zealand has made important and impressive economic \nstrides over the past decade which deserve our attention. In the \n1950's, New Zealand was one of the world's five wealthiest countries; \nbut by the late 1970's, it had fallen to near 20th. The reason appears \nto have been the country's economic policies which bordered on almost \nSocialist central-market control. New Zealand had one of the \n[[Page S4671]] most insulated and restrictive economies in the region; \nthe Government heavily regulated most industries, and nationalized \nothers. It subsidized exports, while at the same time shutting internal \nmarket access to protect its domestic industries. Finally, the \nGovernment ran high deficits, instituted wage and price controls, and \npromulgated tight limits on both interest rates and international flows \nof capital. Between the 1960's and 1970's, the marginal tax rate facing \nthe typical family rose from 23 to 35 percent--the top rate was 66 \npercent. Inflation was high, averaging more than 10 percent. In 1978, \nfor the first time ever, the unemployment rate passed 1 percent. By \n1983, it topped 5 percent.\n  In 1984, the Government began to institute a series of economic \nreforms. It scrapped controls on wages, prices, and interest rates. It \nalso phased out almost all subsidies and incentives for farming, and \nbegan charging market price for its energy supplies. Taxes were \nreduced--the maximum tax was halved to 33 percent.\n  More importantly, the Government opened the economy to the outside \nworld. In 1985, it abolished limits on foreign ownership of banks and \nother industries. Eventually, New Zealand privatized a great deal of \nits public enterprises, including telecommunications, computer services \nrail, airways, and so forth. This has been a boon for U.S. business. \nFor example, Wisconsin Central Railroads purchased a large interest in \nthe formally nationalized New Zealand Railways. Cyberstar, another \nWisconsin firm, recently concluded a contract to lay fiber-optic cable \nin the Nelson area. Ameritech and Bell Atlantic each have a 24.82 \npercent interest in Telecom New Zealand, the largest company in the \ncountry by stock market capitalization. Other U.S. firms which have \nmade substantial investments in the country are Bell South, MCI, and \nTime Warner,\n  The Government announced the phaseout of export incentives, export \ncredits, and import quotas. It also moved to end limits on who would \nbid for import licenses and how many such licenses each individual \ncould hold. In addition, New Zealand allowed people to borrow from, and \nlend to, foreigners without Government control and ended exchange \ncontrols. Finally, the Government embarked on a downsizing in the ranks \nof Government employees. The Government work force has been cut by \nalmost 53 percent in all sectors, resulting in a substantial savings to \nthe budget. This of it, Mr. President; if only we could emulate this \nfeat. The subsequent turnaround in the economy has been quite dramatic. \nThe following 1994 figures are illustrative of the results:\n\n                                                                        \n                              [In percent]                              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            New       United            \n                Category                  Zealand     States     Japan  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInflation..............................        2.8        2.7        0.7\nGDP....................................        6.2        3.8        0.2\nBudget Surplus (percent GDP)...........       +2.6       -1.8       -1.8\nGov't Debt (percent GDP)...............       50.7       64.7       83.4\nUnemployment...........................        7.8        5.4        2.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. President, the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, \nwhich I chair, will hold a hearing on these accomplishments on \nWednesday.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of \nNevada's dedicated citizens, on the event of his retirement. It is my \nprivilege to recognize the accomplishments and achievements of John \nByrne, a native of Nevada, as he is retiring from the International \nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers.\n  John comes from a pioneering family in Virginia City, a small \ncommunity in northern Nevada. He has played an enormous role in the \nrestoration of Virginia City and continues to play an active role as he \nserves on the Governors Committee For the Restoration of Virginia City. \nJohn is also a member of the Nevada State Industrial Safety Code \nRevision Committee and a board member and coordinator of Construction \nOpportunity Trust.\n  I know John as one of the most respected labor leaders in northern \nNevada. He served as business manager and financial secretary for the \nlocal Northern Nevada International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \nfor almost 25 years. His professional accomplishments also include his \nappointment in 1966 as secretary, and business representative of \nNorthern Nevada Building Trades Council where he was reelected in 1967 \nand 1969. John also served an interim appointment as secretary business \nrepresentative of the Honolulu Building Trades Council.\n  John's abundant leadership capabilities have benefited many groups in \nthe State. His many accomplishments in the community include his \nelection to serve on the Nevada Employment Security Board of Review, \nwhere he served under numerous Governors, including myself.\n  John is the only labor representative in Nevada to receive the \nService, Integrity & Responsibility (SIR] Award which is presented by \nthe northern Nevada chapter of the Associated General Contractors.\n  On March 30, friends, family, union, and community members will join \nin honoring John, thanking him for the many contributions he has made \nto the community. I am disheartened that I will be unable to attend, \nbut I would like to extend him my best wishes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/27/senate-section/article/S4671-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4671-S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE U.S.S. LST SHIP MEMORIAL\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to inform my colleagues about a truly outstanding group of \nAmerican veteran LST [landing ship tank] sailors that intend to sail a \n50-year-old World War II LST 13,000 miles from the Far East to our \nshores. Their plans are for this vessel to arrive and sail under the \nGolden Gate Bridge on August 14, 1995, to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific and to honor the \nthousands of LST sailors that served on them over the past half \ncentury.\n  After a 10-day layover on the west coast the seasoned crew of 70 \nsailors will sail the ship to its homeport, the National D-Day Museum \nin New Orleans. I say seasoned because these men sailed on LST's during \nWorld War II when they were just 18 to 24 years old. Now, 50 years \nlater they will again be sailing an LST. This time the voyage will be \nduring the peace they fought for so nobly and that we all now enjoy.\n  One member of the crew is a constituent of mine, William Irwin of \nHuntsville, AL. During World War II he was a decorated lieutenant who \nserved aboard LST 277. During the return voyage of the LST Ship \nMemorial, he will again be sailing as a lieutenant (3d deck officer). \nTo be considered, he and other members of the crew completed 4 months \nof training and were tested with Coast Guard standards; Lieutenant \nIrwin's score was 100 percent. All will meet rigid physical and \nprofessional requirements. I am enclosing a list of the proposed crew \nthat includes sailors from 24 States.\n  The crew will spend 10 days aboard the vessel checking out equipment \nand preparing for the historical voyage that is planned to commence \nupon its departure from the Far East on June 20, 1995. There will be \nstops in the Philippines, Guam, and Kwajalein along the 13,000-mile \nhomeward trek. Departing the Marshall Islands, the crew intends to \nproceed to the Equator and sail eastward until they cross the \ninternational dateline. They will continue on to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii \nand then will proceed to San Francisco. The voyage will require 47 days \nat sea with the LST traveling at an average of 7 knots.\n  This project has become a reality through the combined efforts of the \nU.S. LST Association, the National D-Day Museum, and the Navy that will \nprovide the crew and its training. The LST Ship Memorial, that will be \nfunded by private donations, will be the only one of its kind, \nworldwide.\n  [[Page S4672]] It is my understanding that the LST Memorial will be \nhomeported 6 months of the year at the National D-Day Museum, located \non Lake Pontchartrain, LA. For the remaining 6 months it is the \nintention of the organization to sail our inland waterways. The crew \nwill stop along the route and allow free public access for viewing, to \nkeep alive the memories of World War II and remind the public of the \nheroism, bravery, and sacrifice of the 2 million men that served and \nsailed on these gallant vessels. Plans are underway in the first year \nto sail the LST inland via the Mississippi, Ohio, Illinois, and \nMissouri rivers, as well as the Great Lakes, as the U.S. Navy did in \n1945 and 1946. The following year the LST will sail the east coast and \nthe third year she will sail the along the west coast, repeating the \ncycle every 3 years.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend Lt. William Irwin, Chief Milan \nGunjak, president of the United States LST Association, Dr. Stephen \nAbrose, founder of the National D-Day Museum, Comdr. Robert Jornlin, \nvice president of the U.S.S. LST Ship Memorial, Comdr. Jack Melcher, \nSr., president of U.S.N. and project director and all their supporters \nfor their hard work and efforts in securing this fitting memorial to an \nimportant naval vessel and to the sailors who served aboard LST's \nduring World War II.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a proposed list of the LST crew be printed \nin the Record.\n  The crew list follows:\n\n                   U.S.S.

Mr. President, in my home State of Vermont, \nabove my home city of Rutland, the Coolidge Range of the Green \nMountains dominates the skyline. One of the kings of this range is the \ngreat rounded summit of Pico Peak, 3,957 feet high.\n  On the northern and western slopes of this Vermont giant are the ski \ntrails of Pico Ski Resort, one of Vermont's oldest ski areas. Long \nknown as the Friendly Mountain, it is the place where my family has \nskied. Believe me, some of its trails test the friendly description.\n  Since 1971, Frank Heald, a good friend of mine, has well served Pico \nand Vermont. Frank is now retiring as Pico's executive vice president \nand general manager holding the later post since 1982.\n  Under Frank's leadership, Pico has grown into a major Vermont ski \narea, a major eastern ski area. His accomplishments loom nearly as \nlarge as the mountain itself.\n  When I was a youngster, the ski area reached only to a sub-summit of \nPico, the grand mass of the main mountain hardly utilized at all by the \nski area. Now the lift lines and ski trails go all the way to the top, \nnot only on Pico but on surrounding summits. On a cloudy day, the \ntrails seem to descend from the sky.\n  With Frank's sure guidance, modern lifts have been installed, as have \na \n[[Page S4673]] sports center and trailside condo complexes. New trails \nhave been cut, snowmaking has been upgraded. Summer has become almost \nas busy as winter with an alpine slide, crafts fairs, concerts. Some \n150,000 skiers visit the mountain each year.\n  But Frank has not limited his talents to serving Pico. His community \nand his State have benefited from his many talents, time and again. He \ncurrently serves as chair of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Vermont \nboard and as president of the Alpine Pipelines Co. He's a trustee of \nthe Vermont Historical Society and a member of the Rutland \nRedevelopment Authority and is a past president of the Vermont Ski \nAreas Association. And he has long worked to bring inner-city kids to \nPico to experience Vermont outdoor recreation. Also, he chaired my \nCongressional Youth Awards Program in Vermont.\n  That is only a partial list of the worthwhile enterprises which Frank \nhas graced with his unfailingly sound judgment and boundless energy. \nVermont is the better for his having come our way.\n  Pico is a place of legends. The Mead family, legends of American \nskiing, founded the area and on it many ski champions have learned the \nsport and developed into world class skiers. The most famous of all was \nAndrea Mead, the first American woman to win an Olympic ski medal.\n  When the stories of Pico and its famed sons and daughters are \nrecalled at firesides down the long winter nights of Vermont winters \nahead, the name of Frank Heald will be mentioned with the greats as a \ntrue pioneer and entrepreneur of Vermont skiing. His contributions are \nworthy of recognition here in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/27/senate-section/article/S4672-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1995\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
