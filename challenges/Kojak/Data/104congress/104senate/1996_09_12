Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3756, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3756) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive \n     Office of the President and certain Independent Agencies, for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Kassebaum amendment No. 5235 (to committee amendment on \n     page 16, line 16, through page 17, line 2), to express the \n     sense of the Senate regarding communications between \n     physicians and their patients.\n       Reid-Levin-Biden modified amendment No. 5256, to refer the \n     White House Travel Office matter to the Court of Federal \n     Claims.\n       Hatch amendment No. 5257, as modified (to amendment No. \n     5256), to reimburse the victims of the White House Travel \n     Office firing and investigation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 15 minutes debate, equally \ndivided, on the pending amendments, No. 5257 and No. 5256, with a vote \non amendment 5257 to follow immediately thereafter.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 5257, as Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we have it set up, there will be two \nvotes, one on the Hatch amendment and one on the Reid-Levin amendment. \nI do not see any reason for two votes. I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the Hatch amendment and the total vote be on the Levin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5257), as modified, was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5256, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would you advise the Senator from Nevada \nwhen I have consumed 3 minutes?\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How many minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Three. Our side has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, Members of the U.S. Senate should understand the \namendment before this body has nothing to do with the Travel Office. \nThe issue is whether the U.S. Senate is going to create a new precedent \nby reimbursing a legally indicted official who admitted, in addition to \nhaving been indicted, admitted to having done wrong.\n  There is a great deal of dispute about the facts in the Billy Dale \nmatter, but there are certain undisputed facts which have already been \nstipulated to, agreed to, and spread across this Record.\n  First of all, Billy Dale admitted to putting 55 checks for Travel \nOffice funds totaling some $54,000 into his personal account; and\n  Second, that he stole $14,000 in petty cash, and there would have \nbeen more but the fact is the records were destroyed.\n  Dale admitted he told no one in the Travel Office about his unique \npractice of depositing U.S. Government moneys, checks, into his \npersonal account. Dale admitted he did not even tell his coworkers of \n30 years about this practice. No one in his office knew about it. Of \ncourse, they did not know about it, because he was stealing the money.\n  After thorough investigation by the FBI, it was determined there was \nprobable cause to prosecute Dale. Dale, thereafter, was legally \nindicted. Dale agreed to plead guilty to a serious criminal offense, a \nfelony. Dale was lawfully prosecuted but Dale, like O.J. Simpson, was \nacquitted. Dale now appears at many Republican fundraisers. Dale was \noffered employment by the Dole campaign.\n  This body has never, never in its 200-plus-year history, reimbursed \nsomeone for attorney's fees after they have been legally, lawfully \nindicted.\n  The Senate Parliamentarian has ruled not once but twice that Billy \nDale's reimbursement to be a private relief claim. There is a procedure \nfor private relief claims to be heard by the Court of Claims. That is \nwhat we are asking be done. These facts are uncontested.\n  There are many new facts that we are just now learning because we \nrecently received the prosecution's memorandum prior to indictment. \nThey explain the reasons why we have offered this amendment today.\n  The issue is a patent attempt to embarrass the President in an \nelection year. Reimbursing an admitted, indicted wrongdoer with \ntaxpayer dollars is not something this body should be especially proud \nof, especially those who cry out about the need to balance the budget. \nHalf a million dollars, $500,000, is a lot of money to throw away.\n  If Mr. Dale's supporters are so confident of his innocence, they \nshould have no fear whatsoever of having this matter referred to an \nindependent Court of Claims review. That is why we have the Court of \nClaims. Is it not the least we can do, before we spend half a million \ndollars of taxpayers money?\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. This provision in the bill should \nbe eliminated. If this is a partisan vote and this passes, I hope the \nconference would have the ability and, in fact, the integrity to take \nthis out of this legislation. I hope this will be done.\n  I believe what has been talked about here the last couple of days \ngives the President every reason to veto the bill. I hope that will not \nbe necessary. I like this legislation. I think the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member worked very hard to come up with a \nbill. This provision should not be in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, few people had ever heard of the White \nHouse Travel Office before the Clinton administration took office. Now \nthe White House Travel Office is a household name and its former \nemployees have been falsely accused, they have been fired, they have \nbeen investigated by the IRS and the FBI, they have been defamed, and \nin one case indicted and finally, after a trial, they were fairly \nacquitted.\n  These employees served at the pleasure of the President. He could \nhave replaced them any time he wanted. There is no argument about that. \nBut it is the manner in which these employees were fired, the manner in \nwhich they were treated, and the web of improprieties uncovered as a \nresult of the investigation into these firings that I find most \ntroubling.\n  The White House, which promised what Newsweek magazine called, ``the \nmost stringent ethical requirements of any administration ever,'' has \nbeen the White House that has been entangled in one ethical \nmisadventure after another.\n  Instead of informing the Travel Office employees that their services \nwere no longer required, services which they could perfectly well do \nwhen they came into office, instead, they install one Katherine \nCornelius, a cousin of the President. Her duty was to monitor \nactivities in the office, and what did she come up with? She came up \nwith a scheme to replace all those employees with TRM, a travel agency \nowned by Harry Thomasson, a Hollywood friend and close adviser of the \nClintons. It was on so-called evidence of wrongdoing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do hope this individual will be \nreimbursed, and that is what this is all about here today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Clinton administration has set new \nstandards for protecting wrongdoers at the expense of victims.\n  We have seen the administration advance this culture in the criminal \njustice system. I've spoken to this point in the past on this floor.\n  But we have also seen the White House practice it in its own \nbackyard. I am talking about the issue of Travelgate. An issue in which \nthe victims of wrongdoing in the White House were charged by the \nwrongdoers with a crime.\n  Billy Dale and the other fired Travel Office workers were dedicated \npublic servants. They had served in the Armed Forces prior to serving \nat the pleasure of numerous Presidents, dating back to John F. Kennedy. \nTheir entire careers were dedicated to serving the American people, \nwith honor and dignity.\n  One day, without the slightest heads-up, the seven were summarily \nfired. Without a reason. Certainly not a justifiable one. Those who \nwere there were carted off in the back of an empty van. They were \ntreated like vermin. Others heard they were fired by listening on the \nnews.\n  It was certainly not the kindest and gentlest moment in the tradition \nof the White House.\n  At the time, these seven workers had no clue what was going on or \nwhy. It was only later that we discovered all the reasons.\n  The first was cronyism. A rich, Hollywood buddy of the President \nwanted the business. That would be Hollywood producer Harry Thomasson. \nTo get the business, he had to give Billy Dale the business. And that \nhe did. He spread unproven and false rumors about those running the \nTravel Office.\n  The second issue was White House paranoia. They must have thought \nthere was a conspiracy of all the dedicated career public servants. \nThey were all out to get the White House. The paranoids needed a \npretext to get these workers out, and get their own teamplayers in.\n  That let to a marriage of convenience. The paranoids could get rid of \nthe career workers. They could bring in their own teamplayers to \nreplace them. And, the cronies would get the business. What a \nconvenient confluence of interests.\n  And so, the Hollywood producer, Mr. Thomasson, held the gun; the \nFirst Lady, according to available documentation, said ``ready, aim, \nfire!''; and the White House staff pulled the trigger.\n  Having thought this was the perfect crime, the perpetrators didn't \nexpect to get caught. At first, they denied wrongdoing--just like the \nproverbial kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.\n  Public and press criticism mounted. So the White House tried \njustifying its actions.\n  First, they said the Travel Office workers were replaced as part of a\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\ndownsizing effort under the National Performance Review. But it became \nclear the NPR review came after the decision was made to fire them.\n  So the White House spinmeisters changed gears. They turned the \nvictims into criminals. They did so by publicly charging the seven with \nthe very same unfounded rumors that Harry Thomasson used to get them \nfired.\n  So not only did Billy Dale and his coworkers lose their jobs. They \nand their families were subjected to a public smear campaign by White \nHouse zealots trying to save face.\n  In trying to save face, these zealots co-opted the FBI, the IRS, and \nthe Justice Department into pursuing Billy Dale. They pursued him with \nmore vengeance than the Dallas Cowboys' doomsday defense.\n  But a jury would have none of it. Following his trial, a jury took \nonly 2 hours to return an acquittal. It recognized the trumped-up \ncharges brought by the Justice Department.\n  The net effect of all this harassment took a real toll--not only on \nthe seven employees, but their families as well.\n  Their reputations, their dignity, and their psychological well-\nbeing--all have suffered at the hands of irresponsible zealots in the \nWhite House.\n  This is a White House that, to this day, refuses to accept \nresponsibility for its wrongdoing.\n  No one takes responsibility for their firing.\n  There is only finger pointing.\n  Passing the buck.\n  And the harassment continues. Now, it is legislative harassment.\n  We have before us a provision in this bill to make Billy Dale \neconomically whole, at least for his legal expenses.\n  But the White House has fanned out its lieutenants to sabotage this \nprovision.\n  Their objective: Kill the provision to spare the President the \nembarrassment of signing it.\n  That is what this is all about. It's politics, getting in the way of \na right-and-wrong issue.\n  Political barriers to correcting a wrong will not stand, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Ultimately, public opinion will weight in against the Democrats and \nthe White House on this issue.\n  All the harassment strategies to save the President from \nembarrassment will only make the embarrassment worse.\n  It is inevitable.\n  There is a moral to this story, Mr. President.\n  Nothing is politically right which is morally wrong.\n  That's the issue here, Mr. President.\n  The Travelgate bill we're considering is all about Congress taking \nthe initiative to right a wrong.\n  And those trying to block it are conspiring against the President \ntaking responsibility for his mistakes.\n  I would urge my colleagues on the other side to save the President \nany more embarrassment.\n  Stop the legislative shenanigans.\n  Work with us to do what little we can to repair what was unjustly \ndone to Billy Dale and the other dedicated servants of the people.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment to strike \nthe reimbursement for Mr. Dale.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for 3 minutes. How much time does the \nSenator from Nevada have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 4 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator can have 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the issue here is not these individuals. \nThe issue here is one individual who was properly indicted, properly \nprosecuted, properly tried. There is no evidence that the FBI \ninvestigation was improper. There is no evidence here that the \nprosecution by the Department of Justice was improper. There is no \nevidence here that the trial was defective. The judge at this trial, a \ndistinguished Federal judge, ruled that the evidence was significant \nand substantial enough to convict this defendant.\n  As far as the other people who were fired, their legal fees have been \npaid and should be paid. That is not the issue. The issue is not errors \nby the White House in the firing of those employees. Those errors were \nmade. They were conceded years ago. The legal fees relative to those \nemployees have been paid, should be paid, and $50,000 of the amount of \nmoney in this appropriations bill completes that payment.\n  The issue here is whether or not Billy Dale should get $450,000 for \nhis legal fees when it wasn't the White House who investigated him, it \nwas the FBI. And that investigation has been ruled proper by four \ndifferent entities. It wasn't the White House which prosecuted Billy \nDale. It was the Department of Justice, and their prosecution was \nperfectly appropriate based on what Billy Dale did, not on what the \nWhite House did.\n  The prosecution of Billy Dale was based on the fact that he deposited \n$54,000 in checks meant for the Travel Office in his own personal \naccount that he had with his wife back in Clinton, MD, that he \nintermingled those funds belonging to the Travel Office without notice \nto anybody. No one at the Travel Office knew that that is what he was \ndoing.\n  The prosecution of Billy Dale wasn't based on White House actions, it \nwas based on the fact that he cashed $14,000 that was supposed to go \ninto the petty cash fund but which didn't and which is unaccounted. It \nwas his actions for which he was being tried.\n  There is a hypothesis here that somehow or another the prosecution \nwas improper. Test that hypothesis. Let the Court of Claims make the \ndetermination that there was something inequitable, in which case not \nonly will they be paid those legal fees, but he should be paid.\n  But the proponents of this, what looks to be a complete gratuity, \nkeep talking about some inequity perhaps in the prosecution. There has \nbeen none, no suggestion of any in the investigation or the prosecution \nof Billy Dale in a criminal proceeding.\n  We have never paid legal fees for somebody who was legally indicted. \nNever. This Senate would be setting a precedent which is unwise in the \nabsence of any record, and in order to test what we are doing, what we \nare saying is, refer it to the Court of Claims. That has been done with \nregularity on claims against the Government.\n  The Court of Claims has been given that jurisdiction by us. Let the \nCourt of Claims test this hypothesis that there was something \ninequitable in the prosecution of Billy Dale, not the firing of these \nseven people. We already know there was inappropriate behavior by White \nHouse staff in that area. We are talking about the prosecution by the \nDepartment of Justice of Billy Dale for depositing $54,000 of Travel \nOffice checks in his own personal account and telling nobody about it.\n\n  Test that hypothesis to see if there was something wrong with that. \nLet the Court of Claims approve this before taxpayers' moneys are paid.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Utah \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-seven seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am appalled by this debate. Relying on \nconfidential documents, some of my colleagues have continued, in my \nopinion, the public smearing of Billy Dale. I am astonished that they \nwould use such a tactic in the U.S. Senate, one that I think they have \nhistorically reserved for Presidential nominees and accused Communists.\n  I have little doubt that some of my colleagues would have been \ntempted to read Billy Dale's tax returns and medical files into the \nRecord if they thought it would advance their objective to win at any \ncost.\n  I believe there is substantial evidence to suggest the decision of \nthe Justice Department to indict Mr. Dale was tainted by a political \ncontext in which the case was referred to the Clinton Justice \nDepartment. I don't think anybody doubts that.\n  No. 1, when the case first came to the Justice Department, \nprosecutors ignored information that there was insufficient evidence to \nprove that Mr. Dale had committed the crimes for which they were \nseeking to charge him.\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\n  No. 2, my Democratic colleagues spoke of an FBI financial analysis \nthat showed Mr. Dale was improperly moving Travel Office funds. This \nwas directly refuted by an accountant that even the FBI used to train \nits agents. This important information was not reflected in the \nprosecution memo and was, therefore, not considered by the grand jury.\n  No. 3, the audit my colleagues have referred to conducted by Peat \nMarwick after the Travel Office firings found no evidence of \nwrongdoing. Despite a White House directive to find wrongdoing, Peat \nMarwick found no improper action. In fact, one of them commented the \nconclusion was reached before they even did their work.\n  No. 4, critical evidence was ignored, again, when prosecutors failed \nto interview Mr. Dale's children until after the prosecution memo was \nwritten and the indictment returned.\n  No. 5, also overlooked was the outstanding record that Billy Dale had \nestablished in his years working in the White House Travel Office. His \ncolleagues and members of the media he served characterized him as a \nprofessional and an honest man.\n  Again, this evidence was left out of the prosecution memo and not \npresented to the grand jury.\n  I mentioned that Sam Donaldson testified in his behalf. The moneys \nthat were involved were the media's moneys, and they had no complaints \nover the way he handled it.\n  In closing, I want to point out that at the same time my Democratic \ncolleagues are on the floor besmirching Mr. Dale and accusing him of \nbeing guilty after he was acquitted by 12 jurors who were peers of his \nin a formal trial, the White House has maneuvered a way in which its \nown people, those loyal first and foremost to the Clinton \nadministration, will be reimbursed for legal expenses: Bruce Lindsey, \nMack McLarty, and George Stephanopolous.\n\n  I personally don't have any problem with that, but I think it \nhypocritical for them seeking reimbursement of their own but not \nseeking reimbursement for a person they pretty well admit they smeared \nand they took apart from a reputation standpoint.\n  I am not here today to comment on the propriety of that reimbursement \nto those 23, other than what I said. In fact, if the law allows it, \nfine with me. My point in raising the issue is to show the sheer \nhypocrisy of the Clinton administration. The Clinton White House \nvictimized Billy Dale and the other members of the Travel Office \nleading to an unprecedented political prosecution costing Mr. Dale \nupward of $500,000 in legal fees. Even the White House admitted that it \nlacked proper judgment in the handling of the Travel Office employees.\n  I would like to quote again from a document produced to the Judiciary \nCommittee by the White House. This is a document advocating a certain \nposition. This was produced by the White House:\n\n       You may all dimly remember the Travel Office affair in \n     which a number of White House staff--many immature and self-\n     promoting--took impulsive and foolhardy actions to root out \n     problems at the beginning of the Clinton administration and \n     to gallantly recommend that they take over its operation. The \n     White House has the nerve to request the payment of legal \n     fees to its own people but not to those that they victimized.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the height of hypocrisy. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to defeat the Reid-Levin amendment and do justice here. I \nhope some on the other side feel the same way. No American deserves the \ntreatment Billy Dale has gotten and received from the White House, nor \ndid he deserve the treatment he received from some of my colleagues \nlast night on this floor. We should right this wrong which has been \nlingering for the last 3 years and lift the cloud above Mr. Dale's head \nand allow him to get on with his life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters, dated August \n13, 1996, from Jack Quinn to Helene M. Goldberg, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 13, 1996.\n     Helene M. Goldberg,\n     Director, Torts Branch, U.S. Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Re: Investigations by Congress and the independent counsel \n         into the Travel Office and related matters.\n       Dear Ms. Goldberg: This letter supplements my letter to you \n     of July 5, 1996, concerning reimbursement of White House \n     officials for legal fees and expenses incurred in connection \n     with the Travel Office and related matters. A copy of the \n     July 5, 1996 letter, together with attachments, is enclosed. \n     I understand that you need some further information with \n     respect to the duties of each individual requesting \n     reimbursement. That information is provided here. We have \n     developed this information essentially based upon the letters \n     sent to the White House requesting reimbursement; White House \n     records describing the responsibilities and job titles of the \n     witnesses; and deposition transcripts that are now publicly \n     available. We have enclosed those transcripts where we \n     believe it might be helpful in understanding the role of the \n     witness in the Travel Office matter.\n       1. Nelson Cunningham is the General Counsel in the Office \n     of Administration. As such, he has been asked to testify \n     about the chain of custody of the David Watkins memorandum \n     concerning the Travel Office matter, which was located in the \n     archives of the Office of Administration in December 1995.\n       2. Bruce Overton is the Deputy General Counsel of the \n     Office of Administration. He also was asked to testify about \n     the chain of custody of the David Watkins memorandum.\n       3. Douglass Matties is the Special Assistant to the \n     Director of the Office of Administration. He was also asked \n     to testify about the chain of custody of the David Watkins \n     memorandum.\n       4. Nell Doering is a Supervisory Management Analyst in the \n     Office of Administration. She is responsible for maintaining \n     documents in the archives. She also was asked to testify \n     about the chain of custody of the David Watkins memorandum.\n       5. Charles Easley is the Security Office for the Executive \n     Office of the President. He was recently been given \n     responsibility for personnel security for White House staff. \n     He has been asked to testify about the matters relating to \n     personnel security in connection with the Congressional \n     inquiry into the obtaining of FBI background investigation \n     files of former White House employees, an inquiry that grew \n     out of the Travel Office matter. A copy of his disposition \n     testimony is enclosed.\n       6. Carolyn Huber is a Special Assistant to the President \n     and Director of Personal Correspondence. Her office is \n     responsibility for personal correspondence of the First Lady. \n     In response to the House Committee's subpoena for documents \n     related to the Travel Office and other matters, Ms. Huber \n     identified a letter from David Watkins to the First Lady that \n     was located in her office and that was potentially responsive \n     to the subpoena. She was asked to testify about the \n     identification and chain of custody of this document. A copy \n     of her deposition testimony is enclosed.\n       7. Ed Hughes was the Executive Assistant in the Office of \n     Personnel Security. He served as the Executive Assistant to \n     Craig Livingstone. As a result of this position, he has been \n     asked to testify about the operation of the Office of \n     Personnel Security in connection with the FBI files matter.\n       8. Jonathan Denbo was the Security Assistant in the Office \n     of Personnel Security. He served as an assistant to Craig \n     Livingstone. As a result of his position, he has been asked \n     to testify about the operation of the Office of Personnel \n     Security in connection with the FBI files matter.\n       9. Dee Dee Myers was the White House Press Secretary. As a \n     result of her responsibility as press secretary, Ms. Myers \n     participated in press briefings and responded to press \n     inquiries about the Travel Office matter. She has been asked \n     to produce documents to the House Committee, including her \n     notes, and has been asked to testify about her knowledge of \n     the Travel Office matter. A copy of her deposition testimony \n     is enclosed.\n       10. Ashley Raines is the Customer Service Program Director \n     of the Office of Administration. She was the custodian of \n     certain documents and lists requested by Congress in \n     connection with the FBI files matter and has been asked to \n     testify about those documents and lists.\n       11. Ricki Seidman was the Assistant to the President for \n     Scheduling and Advance. Prior to holding that position, she \n     served as Deputy Communications Director and Counselor to the \n     Chief of Staff. She has been asked to respond to the subpoena \n     from the House Committee and, according to her counsel, has \n     been asked to testify concerning her knowledge of the Travel \n     Office matter as a result of her (1) editing the Management \n     Review; (2) attendance at any meetings where the matter was \n     discussed; and (3) in connection with any discussions she may \n     have had with other White House officials at the time. A copy \n     of her deposition testimony is enclosed.\n       12. Clifford Sloan was an Associate Counsel to the \n     President. As such, he participated in various investigations \n     of the Travel Office matter and has been asked to produce \n     documents and testify about these investigations.\n       I have no reason to believe that the conduct of any of the \n     above individuals, all of which was performed in the course \n     of their official duties, was not performed in good faith. \n     Accordingly, it is in the interest of the United States to \n     reimburse these officials for their legal fees and expenses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jack Quinn,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 13, 1996.\n     Helene M. Goldberg,\n     Director, Torts Branch, U.S. Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Re: Investigations by Congress and the independent counsel \n         into the Travel Office and related matters.\n       Dear Ms. Goldberg: I am writing pursuant to Frank W. \n     Hunger's letter to me of May 22, 1996, concerning the payment \n     or reimbursement of fees and expenses incurred by current and \n     former White House officials in conjunction with the House \n     Committee on Government Reform and Oversight's investigation \n     of the Travel Office matter.\\1\\ In addition, I am forwarding \n     for consideration a request for reimbursement for fees and \n     expenses incurred by a current White House staff member in \n     connection with the investigation by the Independent Counsel \n     into the Travel Office matter. We understand that this \n     request will be considered separately by the Department.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Since Mr. Hunger's letter of May 22, 1996, the ``Travel \n     Office Matter'' has grown to include investigations by \n     Congress into requests by the White House Office of Personnel \n     Security for FBI files related to former White House \n     employees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The information provided below has been developed \n     essentially based upon the letters sent to the White House \n     requesting reimbursement; White House records describing the \n     responsibilities and job titles of the witnesses; and \n     deposition transcripts that are now publicly available. We \n     have enclosed those transcripts where we believe it might be \n     helpful in understanding the role of the witness in the \n     Travel Office matter.\n       Enclosed are requests for reimbursement submitted on behalf \n     of the following officials:\n       1. Kelli McClure. Ms. McClure is the White House Personnel \n     Liaison in the Office of Management & Administration. She has \n     been asked to testify before the grand jury empaneled by the \n     Independent Counsel in connection with Travel Office related \n     matters as a result of her official responsibilities with \n     respect to personnel issues and maintenance of personnel \n     records.\n       2. Lisa Caputo. Ms. Caputo was the Deputy Assistant to the \n     President and Press Secretary to the First Lady. She has been \n     asked to produce documents and to provide deposition \n     testimony to the House Committee in connection with her \n     responsibilities as the First Lady's Press Secretary. As \n     such, she was involved in press briefings and discussions \n     related to Travel Office matters. A copy of her deposition \n     testimony is enclosed.\n       3. Thomas F. McLarty, III. Mr. McLarty was the Chief of \n     Staff and now serves as Counsel to the President. As Chief of \n     Staff, Mr. McLarty has been asked to produce documents and to \n     provide deposition testimony to the House Committee \n     concerning his knowledge and participation in the events \n     leading up to the firing of the Travel Office employees and \n     his role in the White House investigation of the matter. A \n     copy of his deposition testimony is enclosed.\n       4. Kathleen Whalen. Ms. Whalen is an Associate Counsel to \n     the President. As a member of the Counsel's Office, she has \n     responsibilities for Presidential Appointments. She has been \n     asked to provide deposition testimony to the House Committee \n     in connection with her knowledge of procedures relating to \n     the use of FBI background files for Presidential \n     Appointments.\n       Each of these officials has described in the enclosed \n     correspondence the requests that have been made and the \n     responses required by the Congressional Committee or \n     Independent Counsel. In each case, the Committee and/or the \n     Independent Counsel has requested documents and testimony \n     from these individuals about conduct performed in the course \n     of their official duties. I have no reason to believe that \n     the conduct of any of the above individuals was not performed \n     in good faith.\n       I recommend that each of these requests be approved and \n     that reimbursement be provided. I believe that reimbursement \n     is in the interest of the United States since these \n     individuals should be not be compelled to pay private \n     counsel, out of their own resources, to represent them in \n     connection with activities performed as part of their \n     government service.\n       I have advised these individuals that you will communicate \n     directly with them, or their counsel, in responding to their \n     requests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jack Quinn,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Maybe there are those who wish that there were impropriety. \nThere was not any. The people referred to by my friend from Utah were \nnot indicted. There has never been any hint of any in this case, in the \nprosecution, of impropriety. He agreed to plead to a felony. This \nmatter should be referred to the Court of Claims, an independent \ntribunal, if they believe their case is so just. We believe it is not. \nThe Court of Claims would handle the case properly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 3 seconds remaining. \nThe Senator from Nevada has 12 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let us do justice here. Let us reimburse \nthis man and give him his reputation back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on amendment No. 5256, as modified. The yeas and nays \nhave not been ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas about nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. \nSmith] is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nabsent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 286 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Pryor\n     Smith\n       \n  The amendment (No. 5256), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COHEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Kassebaum \namendment.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, was the motion to reconsider laid on the \ntable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could have the Senators' attention, \nmaybe I can outline where we are and begin to think about where we hope \nto go today and the balance of the week.\n  The Senate began consideration of this Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill at 4 p.m. on Tuesday of this week and has spent approximately 15 \nhours considering the legislation. This is not a bill that really is \nthat controversial. I was a little bit taken aback when Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle came up with, I guess, about 97 amendments last \nnight. Most of the 97 amendments are nongermane to this bill. And 15 \nhours has already been spent on it. We need to get serious now and \nnarrow this list down to the ones we really do feel are important, \nhopefully germane, and deal with them in a quick, reasonable period of \ntime.\n  Most of the time in this 15 hours has been spent considering \nnongermane issues. As it stands now, on the majority side of the aisle, \nwe have not more than 12 amendments that have to be\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\nconsidered in some way or other before passage, and I think less than a \nhalf dozen of those actually would require any time and the possibility \nof a recorded vote. I think we can get it down below that. Frankly, \nwhere we ought to be is a couple of amendments on each side and then \nmove to final passage of the bill.\n  I understand that on the Democratic side of the aisle they still have \n35 amendments that remain to be offered. Again, many, or most of those, \nare nongermane. I know that the minority leader has been working with \nhis leadership team, and they have had some amendments removed from the \nlist. But right now we are still looking at somewhere, I guess, between \n35 and 40 amendments. I really have to say that I think that is \nridiculous.\n  I hope all Members will exercise restraint with regard to offering \namendments in an effort to reach final passage early this afternoon. \nThe Senate must also consider the chemical weapons today, which has a \ntime limitation of up to 12 hours. And, needless to say, the Senate \nbegins that this afternoon. The earlier the Senate concludes this \nbusiness, the better.\n  All Senators should be aware that we must continue to make progress \non appropriations bills. That is our job. We should do it in regular \norder, with cooperation. But I am getting very concerned about what we \nare going to be able to do on these final four appropriations bills.\n  I would like to see the Senate do something that has not been done \nmore than once or twice in 25 years: complete all the appropriations \nbills before the beginning of the fiscal year. I can only do so much. \nThere are a lot of other bills that Members on both sides would like to \nhave considered. Some would only take a couple hours. We have to focus \non the appropriations bills. Members who insist on offering nongermane \namendments to the appropriations bills are delaying enactment of very \nimportant spending measures that will have an impact on us being able \nto complete our work by the first of the month.\n\n  So, with that in mind, and in order for the managers to assess what \ntruly remains to be considered, I ask unanimous consent that all \nremaining amendments in order to H.R. 3756 must be filed at the desk by \n12 noon today.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just say, for the \nRecord, that in the last Congress all the appropriations bills were \nfinished on time. We would like to see if we can do that 2 years in a \nrow. I have indicated my desire to work with the majority leader to see \nif we can get that done.\n  We have gone through our list and find about 18 amendments that may \nrequire action. So we have our work cut out for us in order to get this \nbill done. I think this is a good suggestion. I would like to see if we \ncan't work through the next couple of hours to have the amendments \nfiled, so we can look with some serious understanding of what it is we \nhave left to do. And if we require amendments to be filed, we will have \na much better understanding of that. So I hope that both sides can \nagree.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is a fair thing to do. Everyone knew this bill \nwas coming. If you have an amendment that you are serious about, \nsurely, you have it developed. So file it, and we can see who is \nserious. At 12 o'clock we can assess what we can do with regard to this \nbill, how we can wrap it up, and when.\n  But it would be my intent, probably around noon, to go to the \nChemical Weapons Convention. We all knew this has been coming. I made a \ncommitment to bring it up by the 14th. The administration wants it. Of \ncourse, it is ready to go. So we are going to have to do that. I am \ngoing to do my very best to request a number of Senators to finish it \ntoday and have the vote tonight, so we won't have to go over to \ntomorrow. Again, it takes cooperation. So let's go forward now for the \nnext hour and a half, or so, and assess where we are, and we will \nannounce at that time exactly when we are going to go to the chemical \nweapons treaty. Was there objection to that request?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, I would like to ask the \nmajority leader. One of the biggest problems that we have stuck in our \nthroat on this bill right now is the Kassebaum sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution followed by a second Wyden amendment. If we could wrap those \ntwo up, if we could get unanimous consent to vote on those right away, \nwe could move on.\n  There are a lot of these amendments that have been offered with \nSenator Shelby and I working with Republican and Democratic Members \ntrying to see if we can reach some accommodation so that we get this \nthing done. We have been on the bill 2 days. We have, as I said, the \nKassebaum sense-of-the-Senate resolution and the Wyden amendment. If we \ncould add those to the unanimous consent and vote on those right away, \nwe think we have a pretty good chance of resolving most of this.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, I would like to ask the managers \nto get with the Senators involved--Senators Kassebaum and Wyden, and \nthe assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, and those who are \ninterested in this issue. We debated this yesterday. I would like to \nsee if we can come to a conclusion on that. But I am not prepared to \npropound a unanimous consent on that right now because I do not know \nwhere everybody is. I believe, if we could go ahead and get started to \nmove forward on the bill and any other amendments, we can work on that, \nand maybe we can come to an agreement to get a vote on that at 11:30. \nWe will work on that with you.\n  Mr. KERREY. Unless we propound a unanimous consent to agree on those \ntwo amendments, I think it is going to be difficult to proceed. We just \nwon't be realistic about it. If leadership will help us get that done--\nI don't know why--I personally don't understand. We are prepared to \naccept both amendments, by the way, to be cleared on this side. I would \nbe prepared to accept both of the amendments. We are going to \nconference, for God's sake. Everybody knows what that means.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, if the Senator will yield, I know the \nmanagers of this legislation can come up with a good recommendation to \nthe leadership.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am making a recommendation. I recommend that we modify \nthe unanimous-consent request to include these two amendments for \nrollcall votes immediately. That is what we have to do to get these \nvotes up and out and get our business done. We have been talking about \nit for a couple of days. I say let us start voting.\n  Mr. LOTT. I feel a need at least to have a chance to talk with the \nSenators involved in this issue. I do not see Senator Kassebaum on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KERREY. If we can go into a quorum call for about 5 minutes and \nget it resolved. We have work to do. We know what needs to be done. Let \nus get the votes. For gosh sakes, one is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It is hardly what I would call Earth shattering.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Nebraska makes a \nvery good point. It might be in our interest just to check. I would be \ncompelled to object at this point to the request, even though I have \nalready expressed myself with regard to how I feel about the request, \njust to accommodate our ranking member in this regard. So I will not \nobject if we go into a quorum call to clarify whether or not we can do \nwhat the Senator from Nebraska has suggested. That would be my hope so \nwe can resolve at least that matter. Otherwise, I will be compelled to \nobject, and we can just continue to work.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that is why we should have asked for this \nrequest yesterday. We should have had all the amendments that are \nserious filed yesterday. We had the hotline even on the request to ask \nyou to file your amendments.\n  So we are going to go into a quorum call, and we are going to have a \ntime out, instead of doing business while their conversations are going \nback and forth. I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the people \ninvolved to get together and let us talk about how we can work it out. \nAt the same time we are again extending the time, or I guess we would \nhave to extend the time for Senators to file their amendments. The \nintent is that all amendments be filed by 12 o'clock. I hope that \nSenators will proceed on that assumption. I have\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\nno problem with our getting together to see if we can work out this \nproblem, and I cannot make a commitment because I have not followed the \nissue enough to be able to say right now that we ought to do this or \nthat. I have to consult with people who are familiar with the subject \non both sides.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, with respect, I think the unanimous \nconsent request is good. I would love to get it approved. I do not \nobject to the unanimous consent. But the next pending business is the \nKassebaum sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me renew my unanimous consent request \nand get an agreement on that so the Senate is on notice. We can take \nthe quorum call, and we will right now and try to come to a conclusion \nof the issue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond, if I could, to the majority leader, and \nthen I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey. I think that we have to resolve the matter the Senator from \nNebraska has presented to us prior to the time we enter into a \nunanimous-consent agreement. If we can do that, I think that is a good-\nfaith indication that we are able to resolve at least that part of it, \nand then we can go on to the next step. Let us do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. If we can go into a quorum call--but during that quorum \ncall I will also consider putting this bill down right now and proceed \nto the Chemical Weapons Convention. This is the kind of thing that \nmakes it impossible for us to do our work in a reasonable and \ncooperative way. I am saying that we should meet and discuss how we can \nsolve this problem. But 15 hours on the Treasury-postal appropriations \nbill with all of the work we have pending, it is time that we get \nserious. To have 40 amendments pending on this bill now is not serious.\n  I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \npending committee amendments be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the UC \nagreement earlier propounded by Senator Lott, the majority leader, be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Amendments Nos. 5261, 5262, 5263, and 5264 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send a number of amendments to the desk \nwhich have been cleared on each side of aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be considered and \napproved, en bloc, and that accompanying statements be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  Mr. President, the amendments are as follows: for Senator Grams, to \nimprove the IRS 1-800 help line service; for Senator Faircloth, \nregarding color printing of tax information; for Senator Levin, a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution in support of the U.S. negotiators' \nposition on autos and auto parts with Japan; for Senator Thompson, for \nthe GSA to create a pilot program for States to participate in the FTS \n2000 program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for the \namendments to be considered en bloc?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendments. There is \nno objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendments by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) proposes amendments \n     numbered, en bloc, 5261 through 5264.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 5261 through 5264), en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 5261\n\n    (Purpose: To require the Internal Revenue Services to allocate \n sufficient funds and staff for providing improved IRS 1-800 help line \n                         service to taxpayers)\n\n       At appropriate place insert the following section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . IMPROVEMENT OF THE IRS 1-800 HELP LINE SERVICE\n\n       ``(a) Funds made available by this or any other Act to the \n     Internal Revenue Services shall be available for improved \n     facilities and increased manpower to provide sufficient and \n     effective 1-800 help line for taxpayers.\n       ``(b) The Commissioner shall make the improvement of the \n     IRS 1-800 help line service a priority and allocate resources \n     necessary to ensure the increase in phone lines and staff to \n     improve the IRS 1-800 help line service.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this is a simple and straightforward \namendment. All it does is ask the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue \nService to make improvement of the IRS 1-800 help line service a \npriority, and allocate the necessary resources to ensure the American \ntaxpayers receive the assistance they need from the IRS.\n  Mr. President, although IRS spending increased from $2.5 billion in \nfiscal year 1979 to $7.5 billion in fiscal year 1996, the level of \nservice provided to the taxpayers has not grown proportionally. In \nrecent years, the IRS has invested billions of taxpayer dollars in its \nefforts to modernize its operations, including its information \nsystems--but the results have been described by the GAO as ``chaotic.'' \nAs an ironic consequence, the Nation's tax collector remains perhaps \nthe least taxpayer-friendly agency in the entire Federal Government.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal tax system has grown more complicated than \never before. In the mid-1950's, the Federal Income Tax Code was \ncomprised of 103 sections and 400,000 words. Today, it has ballooned to \n698 sections--a 578-percent increase--and nearly 1.4 million words. \nAdding to the aggravation of the Nation's taxpayers, tax regulations \nhave multiplied just as rapidly. Between 1955 and 1994, the number of \nwords in the regulations of the Internal Revenue Code increased more \nthan 550 percent, from just over 1 million words to 5.7 million. Even \nif you are a trained speed reader who can read 1,000 words a minute, \nand you did not do anything else but devote every hour of every \nbusiness day to reading these regulations, it would take you almost 3 \nyears to complete them.\n  The rapid growth of the Federal Tax Code and its regulations has \ndramatically increased the complexity of our tax system, to the point \nwhere no one but a very few tax specialists can understand it. Even IRS \nagents are often confused by their own tax laws. The complexity of the \nFederal tax system means that tax assistance for ordinary American \ntaxpayers is even more urgent now than ever before.\n  But this desperately needed assistance has not been adequately and \neffectively provided. For example, my State office receives complaints \ndaily from constituents frustrated they cannot get through to a human \nbeing at the toll-free lines established by the IRS: the lines are \nconstantly busy. In some cases, my constituents have tried for 3 or 4 \ndays before they finally got through.\n  Mr. President, we enact laws and require the people to obey them. But \nin this case, the IRS has failed to provide sufficient assistance to \nenable average Americans to understand and comply with the laws. And \nwhen innocent noncompliance occurs due to the complexity of the tax \nsystem, we punish the taxpayers by imposing all sorts of penalties. \nThis is simply not fair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a small but important step to \nimprove our service to the American taxpayers. All it does is urge the \nIRS to use existing funds to provide more IRS 1-800 help line servive. \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5262\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from using color \n printing for purposes other than to call attention to changes in tax \n                law or to make tax forms easier to use)\n\n       On page 26, after line 9, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . No funds made available by this Act, or any other \n     Act, to the Internal Revenue Service may be used to pay for \n     the design and printing of more than two ink colors on the \n     covers of income tax packages, and such ink colors must be \n     the same colors as used to print the balance of the material \n     in each package.\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                           amendment no. 5263\n\n      (Purpose: Sense-of-the-Senate resolution in support of U.S. \n negotiators' position in Framework Agreement on Autos and Auto Parts \n                       with Japan consultations)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       That the Senate finds: on June 28, 1995, the United States \n     and Japan finalized the text of the U.S.-Japan Framework \n     Agreement on Autos and Auto Parts in Geneva.\n       That the 30 page text spells out a wide-ranging set of \n     commitments by the Government of Japan to meet the Framework \n     objective of ``achieving significantly expanded sales \n     opportunities to result in a significant expansion of \n     purchases of foreign parts by Japanese firms in Japan and \n     through their transplants, as well as removing problems which \n     affect market access, and encouraging imports of foreign \n     autos and auto parts in Japan.''\n       That the commitments to action by the Government of Japan \n     and statements by the Japanese private sector address the \n     major barriers to access that have frustrated U.S. producers \n     of competitive autos and auto parts in their efforts to sell \n     in Japan and to the Japanese transplants, and\n       That the Framework Agreement represents an unprecedented, \n     enforceable set of commitments to open the Japanese market to \n     foreign competitive autos and auto parts and to increase the \n     opportunities for competitive parts suppliers to sell to the \n     Japanese transplant manufacturers.\n       Therefore, it is the Sense of the United States Senate to \n     fully support the goals set out in the Framework Agreement \n     and support the U.S. negotiators in their first annual \n     consultations with Japan on September 18 and 19 in San \n     Francisco in their efforts to obtain full compliance with the \n     letter and spirit of the Framework Agreement.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n              framework agreement on autos and auto parts\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as co-chairman of the Senate auto parts \ntask force, I offer, with my colleague Senator Specter, the other \ncochairman of the Senate auto parts task force, a bipartisan resolution \nin support of obtaining full compliance with the letter and spirit of \nthe Framework Agreement on Autos and Auto Parts.\n  Last summer, the United States and Japan signed an historic trade \nagreement that promises to open Japan's closed markets to United States \nautos and auto parts and deregulate Japan's convoluted and \ndiscriminatory auto parts safety inspection process.\n  However, the success of this agreement pivots on its strict \nmonitoring and enforcement. An important part of that process is the \nannual consultations with Japan that are built into the terms of the \nagreement. The first annual review of the agreement between United \nStates and Japanese negotiators takes place on September 18 and 19 in \nSan Francisco.\n  With September 18 quickly approaching, Senator Specter and I, as \ncochairs of the Senate auto parts task force, offer this resolution \ntoday in strong support of the goals set out in the framework agreement \nand in support of our U.S. negotiators.\n  With this resolution, we want to make it clear that there continues \nto be strong bipartisan congressional support for achievement of the \ncommitments made in the agreement. We want Japan to know that Congress \nwill be watching the September 18 and 19 consultations and we expect to \nsee compliance with the letter and spirit of the framework agreement.\n  The success of this United States-Japan agreement lies in the level \nto which it is complied with. We know all too well from past experience \nthat Japan will not open its markets without strong pressure from the \nUnited States.\n  The September consultations offer United States negotiators the \nchance to review Japan's progress and insist that the agreement be \nlived up to. With this resolution we stand firmly behind our \nnegotiators in insisting that we see true progress and concrete \nresults.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5264\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the Administrator of General Services to conduct \n a pilot program involving States participation in the FTS2000 program)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration is authorized to conduct a pilot program \n     involving up to 10 States to provide FTS 2000 service to a \n     State government, if:\n       (1) the appropriate authority of such State government \n     makes application to the Administrator to receive FTS 2000 \n     service and, as part of the application, agrees to pay all \n     costs associated with access; and\n       (2) the Administrator finds that it would be advantageous \n     for the federal government to provide FTS 2000 service to \n     such State government.\n       (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize \n     the Administrator of the General Services Administration to \n     implement cooperative purchasing under 40 U.S.C. 481(b)(2).\n       (c) The authority provided in this section shall expire on \n     September 30, 1998.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendments are \nagreed to, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5261 through 5264) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is noon on Thursday. We have work to do. \nThe managers of the bill are doing very constructive work here \nunofficially, but we need to get back to business.\n  We are discussing with the minority leader and, through him, with the \nadministration on how to proceed, if at all, on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. There is some indication perhaps agreement may be reached \nto not do that at this time, but I have to have that request from the \nadministration. We have to have an understanding about what that means.\n  In the meantime, we ought to be working on the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. I am not asking much here. I am just asking that \nthe Senate move forward. I think the Members would like to move \nforward, if we could get the staff to agree.\n  So I feel that I must ask for these consents--and I believe Senator \nDaschle wants to cooperate with this--but as the time goes by today, we \nhave to consider other options.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, then, that there be 20 \nminutes remaining for debate on the Kassebaum amendment No. 5235, to be \nequally divided in the usual form, and following the debate, the \namendment be laid aside and Senator Wyden be recognized to offer an \namendment on the same subject, the text of which Senator Wyden will now \nsend to the desk.\n  I further ask that there be 20 minutes for debate on the amendment, \nto be equally divided in the usual form and no further amendments be in \norder during the pendency of the Kassebaum and Wyden amendments.\n  I further ask that a vote then occur on the Kassebaum amendment, \nwithout further action or debate, to be followed immediately by a vote \non the Wyden amendment.\n  I think this is a fair way to proceed. This is what the Senator from \nOregon indicated he wanted to happen. I think this is a way to get a \nvote on both of these issues and other issues.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that this agreement be implemented at \nthe call of the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I regret this objection. The agreement seemed to be the \nbest course of action involving this impasse.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kassebaum amendment \nbe laid aside for consideration of one amendment, and following the \ndisposition of that amendment, the Kassebaum amendment become the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. This allows us to proceed then, Mr. President, to the next \namendment in order. The managers have some things they have been \nworking on. They can do that. This makes good sense. I appreciate at \nleast this cooperation. We will take them one teeny step at a time. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my earlier request, with a change of \ntime, that all amendments must be filed by Senators by 2 p.m. this \nafternoon on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I should clarify that these have to be the \namendments that were on the list that we agreed to. Of course, the \nwhole world was on the list. But this would have to be amendments on \nthe list. And they need now to be filed by 2 o'clock in order to be \nconsidered at all. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his help in \ngetting that agreement. I hope now that he and the chairman can make \nsome progress on maybe some agreed-to amendments and take up some \namendment that is pending.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I, along with my colleague, Senator \nKerrey, encourage all Senators now who have amendments that we might be \nable to clear and agree on between us, that they come down here and \ndiscuss them with Senator Kerrey and me, because we are working off of \na list. We have already worked four or five off in the last 30 minutes. \nPerhaps we can, if they will come on over--it is just a few minutes \nafter 12--in the next hour or two we can perhaps work 8 or 10 off this \nlist. I think it would be helpful and constructive, and we would be \nmoving forward on this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from Alabama, the \nchairman of the subcommittee, said, we are trying to--and we are \nalerting both Senators and staff--we are trying right now to identify \nthose amendments that we can agree to accept.\n  We also are trying to identify those amendments where we are going to \nagree together that we will both oppose or move to table. Senators need \nto be alerted to that, that there will be amendments offered on both \nsides of the aisle--Democrats will offer amendments that I may move to \ntable; and, likewise, Republicans may offer amendments that Senator \nShelby agrees to table--and we are going to be aggressive in tabling \namendments that we regard in some cases as nongermane or to be \nincorrectly offered, to just let people have a heads-up on that.\n  Third, we will look for opportunities, if we can, to talk to Members \nthat have open--that is to say, they filed a place mark in here to \nidentify whether or not their concerns have been taken care of in other \nareas, so that we can begin to winnow this list of amendments down.\n  There is a very good chance, as we now understand it, we will be on \nthis bill all night long and until we get it passed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is right.\n  I thank the Senator. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 5271 through 5278, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send a number of amendments to the desk \nwhich have been cleared on each side.\n  Mr. President, the amendments are as follows: Senator Gramm, a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution regarding the border States in Laredo, TX; for \nSenators Bingaman and Jeffords regarding energy savings; for Senator \nDaschle regarding explosives and arson information; for Mr. D'Amato \nregarding the commemorative coin programs; for Senator McCain regarding \nthe Udall Scholarship Foundation; for Senator Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \nDaschle, and Mr. Pressler regarding the transfer of excess properties \nto Indian tribes; for Senator Byrd regarding telecommuting; and for \nSenator Hatfield to provide care funds for the Pioneer Courthouse in \nPortland, OR.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be considered and \napproved, en bloc, and that accompanying statements be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MINT MANAGERIAL STAFFING REFORM.\n\n       Section 5131 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (c); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (c).\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this amendment will begin the necessary\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nreform of the commemorative coin programs authorized by Congress and \ncarried out by the U.S. Mint. The amendment, supported fully by the \nMint, includes many programs of H.R. 2614 passed by the House as well \nas recommendations for reform from the GAO. The amendment is a \ncomprehensive substitute that enjoys widespread support.\n  Commemorative coins are collectibles. The coins issued for each \nprogram satisfy a number of objectives.\n  First, they raise awareness. Coin themes are meant to recognize \nsignificant national, and sometimes international, events, heroes and \nheroines, and historic sites vital to our American experience. They are \nexpressions of our tremendous pride in all that molded this great \ncountry.\n  Second, they allow the Treasury a means of decreasing the national \ndeficit through profitable programs.\n  Third, the sale of these coins enables worthy causes to raise money. \nFor example, the restoration of our Nation's Capitol, the construction \nof memorials to our fallen heroes, and equally important for upkeep and \nmaintenance of great homes such as Mount Vernon and the White House, \nand even the notable open-air home to four of our most prestigious \nPresidents, Mount Rushmore have been funded through commemorative coin \nprograms.\n  As wonderful as these programs seem, serious problems exists--as \nunderscored by the recent General Accounting Office report I requested \nlast year. The commemorative coin market has been flooded with far too \nmany coins. Overzealous programs trying to generate as many products as \npossible only reduce the value of coins for collecting. When mintage \nlevels go through the roof, the value of these commemorative coins \ndrops considerably.\n  More importantly and much to my dismay, taxpayers end up carrying the \nburden of coin programs that are not received well by the collectors. \nAnd while the sponsoring organizations may satisfy its goal of raising \nfunds, the U.S. Mint incurs a loss which is passed on to the taxpayers.\n  The amendment I am offering has been crafted to augment the valuable \nwork on commemorative coin program reforms sponsored by Representative \nMichael Castle, chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic and \nInternational Monetary Policy of the Committee on Banking and Financial \nServices. Congressman Castle's bill, H.R. 2614, which was supported \noverwhelmingly in the House, serves as a clear foundation for the \nreforms embodied in this bill. I commend him on his guidance and \nperseverance as it relates to this issue.\n  Mr. President, the reforms contained in this amendment will \naccomplish three major goals: Protect the taxpayer from losses incurred \nby the Mint, keep the number of coins in the market at a collectible \nlevel for collectors, and keep the total number of yearly programs at a \nmanageable level for the Mint. Fulfillment of these goals will not only \nprotect the American taxpayer, but will ensure the preservation and \nsuccess of future commemorative coin programs produced by the U.S. \nMint.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Shelby, \nfor his work in this area. As a member of the Banking Committee he is \nkeenly aware of the necessity for these reforms.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Contains a technical correction to a previous \n     amendment to H.R. 3756 concerning exclusive use of the Mint \n     facility at West Point to produce all gold and all platinum \n     numismatic items and bullion products.\n       Section 2. Commemorative Coin Program Reform. Section (a) \n     addresses commemorative coin program restrictions. Section \n     ``(m)'' to be added to Section 5112 of title 31, USC, \n     requires that the Secretary of the Treasury may mint and \n     issue no more than two commemorative coin programs per \n     calendar year beginning on January 1, 1999. It also sets \n     guidelines of maximum mintage levels for each denomination of \n     numismatic product as prescribed by the Citizens \n     Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. This section includes \n     an exception for the Secretary to increase the mintage levels \n     as he determines appropriate from results of adequate, market \n     based research.\n       Subsection (c) defines designated recipient organization.\n       Section (b)(1) addresses the recovery of mint expenses \n     required before payment of surcharges to any recipient \n     organization. Section 5134(C)(2) of title 31, USC is amended \n     by inserting ``, including amounts attributable to any \n     surcharge imposed with respect to the sale of any numismatic \n     item'' before the period.\n       Section (b)(2) amends Section 5134(C) of title 31, USC by \n     adding subsection (f), Conditions of payment of surcharges to \n     recipient organizations. Subsection (f)(1) states no amount \n     of any surcharge imposed shall be paid from the fund to the \n     recipient organization unless the program costs have been \n     recovered. Subsection (f)(1)(B) requires submission of an \n     audited financial statement, which demonstrates to the \n     satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the \n     organization has raised funds from private sources in an \n     amount equal to or greater than the maximum amount of \n     surcharges that organization may receive from the sale of \n     numismatic items.\n       Subsection (f)(2) requires annual audits beginning after \n     the commencement of the surcharge payments. Subsection \n     (f)(2)(A) requires these audits to begin with the first \n     fiscal year in which the payments are received. The audit \n     shall be in accordance with generally accepted government \n     auditing standards and performed by an independent public \n     accountant selected by the entity. The annual audits shall be \n     conducted until the surcharges are fully expended. Each audit \n     shall report the amount of surcharges received, the amount of \n     surcharges expended, and whether the expenditures were for \n     authorized purposes.\n       Subsection (f)(2)(B) sets minimum requirements for the \n     annual audits. Required to be included in the audit shall be \n     the amount of payments received, expenditures from the \n     proceeds, and verification that expenditures were for \n     authorized purposes.\n       Subsection (f)(2)(C) requires an accounting of surcharge \n     monies separate from all other revenues and expenditures of \n     the recipient organization. Subsection (f)(2)(D) calls for \n     the submission of the annual audit no later than 90 days \n     after the end of any fiscal year of the recipient \n     organization. This report shall be submitted to the Secretary \n     of the Treasury and made available to the public. Subsection \n     (f)(2)(E) allows the recipient organization to pay the cost \n     of the audit with surcharge funds. Subsection (f)(2)(F) \n     allows the Secretary of the Treasury to waive the annual \n     audit requirements, and Subsection (f)(2)(G) states that \n     Federal entities are exempt from this paragraph.\n       Subsection (f)(2)(H) requires recipient organizations to \n     provide, at the request of the Treasury Department's \n     Inspector General or the Comptroller General of the United \n     States, books, records and workpapers relating to receipts \n     and/or expenditures of surcharge monies.\n       Subsection (f)(3) prohibits surcharge monies from being \n     used, in any form or fashion, to attempt to influence or \n     support Congressional numismatic legislative action. \n     Subsection (f)(4) defines designated recipient organizations \n     as ``the recipient of any surcharge imposed on the sale of \n     any numismatic item.''\n       Section (b)(3) applies to the scope of the amendment which \n     will involve all proceeds of any surcharge imposed on the \n     sale of any numismatic item that are deposited in the \n     Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       Section (b)(4) repeals the existing recipient report \n     requirement as mandated by Section 302 of Public Law 103-186 \n     (31 U.S.C. 5112 note).\n       Section (c) amends section 5134 of title 31, USC, by adding \n     the new section ``(g) Quarterly Financial Reports.'' \n     Subsection (g)(1) requires that the U.S. Mint shall provide a \n     quarterly financial report to Congress for all authorized \n     commemorative coin programs to be due no later than the 15th \n     day of the month following each calendar quarter.\n       Subsection (g)(2) outlines the minimal requirements of \n     these quarterly reports. Subsection (g)(2)(A) calls for a \n     financial statement prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles with information specific to \n     action for each quarter as well as cumulative financial \n     information relating to the entire program.\n       Subsection (g)(2)(B) states further requirements for all \n     quarterly reports such as all costs relating to marketing \n     efforts, all funds projected for marketing use, all costs for \n     employee travel relating to the promotion of the programs, \n     all numismatic items minted, sold, not sold, and rejected \n     during the production process, and the costs of melting down \n     all rejected and unsold products.\n       Subsection (g)(2)(B) requires the Mint to include \n     information showing adequate market-based research for all \n     non-circulating commemorative coin programs. Subsection \n     (g)(2)(D) requires a description of the efforts of the Mint \n     doing what it can to keep the price of numismatic items as \n     low as practicable.\n       Section (d), the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory \n     Committee amends Section 5135(a)(4) of title 31, USC, to \n     shorten the length of service for members appointed to the \n     Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee (CCCAC) to a \n     term of 4 years and Subsection (d)(2)(A) allows for the \n     Chairperson of the CCCAC to be elected by and from the \n     Committee members by amending Section 5135(a)(6). Subsection \n     (d)(2)(B) further states that the representative of the\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\n     Mint, or the alternate to that member, appointed to serve in \n     the CCCAC may not serve as Chairperson effective June 1, \n     1999.\n       Section (e) defines the effective date of all sections in \n     this amendment to take effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       Section 5, the Mint Managerial Staffing Reform provision, \n     no longer requires a presidential appointment of the \n     following positions at each Mint facility: superintendent, \n     assayer and engraver at the Philadelphia Mint.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5274\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the continuation of the term of a member of \n   the Morris K. Udall Scholarship Board after the member's term has \n                  expired until a successor is chosen)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n       Sec.   . Section 5(c)(1) of Public Law 102-259 (20 U.S.C. \n     5603(c)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A)(iii), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding after subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) a Trustee may serve after the expiration of the \n     Trustee's term until a successor has been chosen.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It ensures \nthat trustees of the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in \nNational Environmental Policy Foundation be able to serve after the \nexpiration of their term until a successor is chosen.\n  Under the act which established the Morris K. Udall scholarships and \nfoundation, trustees are nominated by the President and confirmed by \nthe U.S. Senate. We all know that the nomination and confirmation \nprocess can be time consuming, and the work is not always completed in \ntime for an efficient transition between new trustees and those whose \nterm has expired. The resulting vacancies are disruptive to the \norganization and do not serve the purposes for which Congress created \nthe foundation.\n  The Goldwater Foundation, also chartered by Congress, has an \nidentical provision as this amendment, and the modification is worthy \nof the Senate's approval.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5275\n\n (Purpose: To allow the Department of Interior, through the Bureau of \n  Indian Affairs, to transfer directly to Indian tribes in North and \n South Dakota portable housing units at the Grand Forks Air Force Base \n   which have been declared excess by the Department of Defense and \n         requested for transfer by the Department of Interior)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     of the Interior, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, may \n     directly transfer to Indian tribes in North and South Dakota \n     portable housing units at the Grand Forks Air Force base in \n     North Dakota which have been declared excess by the \n     Department of Defense and requested for transfer by the \n     Department of the Interior.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to resolve a \nbureaucratic nightmare which has arisen in conjunction with the \ntransfer of excess Department of Defense property from the Grand Forks \nAir Force Base in North Dakota to Indian reservations in North and \nSouth Dakota. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators \nConrad, Daschle, and Pressler.\n  As a result of the realignment of the 321st Missile Group at the \nGrand Forks Air Force Base, housing needs were reduced and 486 existing \nhomes were declared excess property by the Department of Defense. The \nDepartment of Interior requested these housing units with the intent of \ntransferring them through its Bureau of Indian Affairs to certain \nreservations in North and South Dakota under Operation Walking Shield. \nWhen the first house was on a truck bed and ready to be transferred \nfrom the Grand Forks Air Force Base to the Oglala Sioux Reservation in \nPine Ridge, SD, it hit a road block. At the last minute, we were \ninformed that the Bureau of Indian Affairs had no authority to transfer \ntitle to these homes directly to the Indian tribes. My amendment is \nintended to resolve this problem.\n  As I am sure my colleagues are aware, the housing conditions faced by \nmany native American communities are shocking. A recent Urban Institute \nstudy revealed that approximately 27 percent of all Indian households \nreside in substandard dwellings that are overcrowded and/or lack \nkitchen or plumbing facilities, electricity, and/or central heating.\n  In August, I had the opportunity to view the housing conditions on \nthe Standing Rock Sioux and Fort Berthold reservations in North Dakota. \nWhat I saw was deplorable. Many homes fail to meet even basic safety \nand health standards. They lack roofs, windows, plumbing, and they \nsmell of gas. And many Indian families have to wait for years for \ncritical home repairs. It is truly a national disgrace.\n  The Senators from North and South Dakota were most hopeful that some \nof the critical housing shortages on the reservations in our respective \nStates could be addressed with the transfer of this excess DOD housing \nto the tribes. In order to ensure that these desperately needed homes \ncan be transferred, we must first pass this amendment.\n  The Department of Interior and the General Services Administration as \nwell as the Governmental Affairs and Indian Affairs Committees have \nreviewed and cleared this narrowly targeted amendment, and I want to \nthank everyone involved for their efforts in helping to resolve this \nproblem.\n  With adoption of the amendment, we have an opportunity to prevent \nGovernment waste and stretch Federal resources to meet the urgent and \nreal housing needs of Indian families. In short, this amendment \nrepresents an example of how Government should work, and I urge its \nadoption.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5276\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for the acquisition, lease, construction, \n    and equipment of certain flexiplace work telecommuting centers)\n\n       On page 49, line 18, insert before the colon ``: Provided, \n     That of such amount provided for non-prospectus construction \n     projects $250,000 may be available until expended for the \n     acquisition, lease, construction, and equipping of flexiplace \n     work telecommuting centers in the State of West Virginia''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering would make \navailable an amount of $250,000 out of non-prospectus construction \nprojects, for the establishment of a flexiplace work telecommuting \ncenter in West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, both Jefferson and Berkeley Counties of West Virginia \nare now considered to be part of the Washington Metropolitan \nStatistical Area. I am advised that officials of the Jefferson County \nDevelopment Authority have been working with the staff of the General \nServices Administration to develop a telecommuting center in the \nCharles Town area. The purpose of the center is to establish a job site \nthat could easily be linked through computer and telecommunication \ntechnologies to federal agencies in the central Washington, DC area, \nthus diminishing commuting time and helping to alleviate severe traffic \ncongestion. The parties negotiated in good faith and were under the \nimpression that funds were available for the establishment of the \ncenter. Unfortunately, the funds to establish such telecommuting \ncenters are only available to establish such centers in Maryland and \nVirginia.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make an amount of $250,000 \navailable for the establishment of a telecommuting center in the \nCharles Town area. The amendment would not diminish the funds already \navailable for centers in Maryland and Virginia. Rather, the funds would \nbe derived from monies set aside in the bill for non-prospectus \nconstruction projects, that is, projects costing less than $1.5 \nmillion, including such minor projects as periodic painting and repair \nof mechanical, electrical, and other building components.\n  In summary, the amendment I am proposing would allow for the \nestablishment of a flexiplace work telecommuting center in Jefferson \nCounty, West Virginia, which is now considered by the Department of \nLabor to be part of the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5277\n\n       On page 55, line 11 after ``Missouri'' insert: ``: Provided \n     further, That $1,450,000 may be available for the renovation \n     of the Pioneer Courthouse located at 520 SW Morrison in \n     Portland, Oregon''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5278\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate in support of new border \n                 station construction in Laredo, Texas)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF NEW BORDER STATION \n                   CONSTRUCTION IN LAREDO, TEXAS.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that:\n       (1) In 1995, over one-third (35%) of all U.S. exports to \n     Mexico were processed through the Port of Laredo;\n       (2) Nearly two-thirds of all U.S. exports to Mexico that \n     went through a south Texas port of entry went through the \n     Port of Laredo in 1995;\n       (3) The value of imports processed through the Port of \n     Laredo in 1995 exceeded $15 billion, and the value of all \n     exports was $14.7 billion for that year;\n       (4) The number of loaded, cross-border shipments, both \n     northbound and southbound, through the Port of Laredo is \n     projected to double from 1995 to the year 2000, from 851,745 \n     shipments to 1,703,490;\n       (5) The City of Laredo received on October 3, 1994 a \n     Presidential Permit from the U.S. State Department to \n     construct a third bridge in the city, and in February 1996 \n     the U.S. Coast Guard issued a permit for the bridge's \n     construction;\n       (6) Financing of the new bridge has been secured from both \n     sponsors, the cities of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, and in \n     February 1997 the City of Nuevo Laredo is scheduled to begin \n     construction of an access road connecting the bridge with the \n     loop around Nuevo Laredo;\n       (7) U.S. Customs revenue generated at the Port of Laredo \n     totaled $216 million in 1995, an increase of $13 million from \n     the previous year, while the U.S. Government's estimated cost \n     for operating border station facilities in Laredo is $10 \n     million, so that the Port generated over $200 million for the \n     U.S. Treasury in 1995; and\n       (8) The new bridge will greatly enhance safety in the \n     downtown area because it will allow the diversion of \n     commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges to \n     the new bridge, since the two downtown bridges will be \n     strictly passenger bridges, with the new bridge and the \n     Colombia Bridge (22 miles from Laredo) devoted to commercial \n     traffic.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The construction of a third bridge in Laredo is vitally \n     needed to accommodate increased trade with Mexico and to \n     relieve traffic congestion, road damage, and pollution in \n     downtown Laredo caused by commercial traffic; and\n       (2) The Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration should accelerate the timetable for design and \n     construction of a border station for the new Laredo bridge to \n     ensure that the bridge can be opened to international traffic \n     as soon as possible.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we have reviewed these amendments, and we \nconcur. They are all worthy amendments and we support their adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendments are \nagreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5271 through 5278), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I understand the pending business is the \namendment of the Senator from the State of Oregon. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KERREY. Kansas.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Kassebaum \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move that the pending business be temporarily laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5279\n\n  (Purpose: To make funds available for a study of tagging explosive \n                   materials, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5279.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 6, strike ``$395,597,000'' and insert \n     ``$416,897,000, of which $21,300,000, to remain available \n     until expended, shall be available to conduct the study under \n     section 732(a) of Public Law 104-132 (relating to marking, \n     rendering inert, and licensing of explosive materials) and to \n     conduct a study of threats to law enforcement officers from \n     the criminal use of firearms and ammunition; and''.\n       On page 22, line 14, strike $4,085,355,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,064,055,000''.\n       On page 25, between lines 21 and 22, insert:\n       Sec.   . (a) Section 732(a)(2) of the Antiterrorism and \n     Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-132) is \n     hereby repealed.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the $21,300,000 \n     reduction in funds available for tax law enforcement to fund \n     the explosive materials and law enforcement officers safety \n     study be achieved as follows:\n       (1) $9,700,000 from the delay required by this Act in \n     implementing field restructuring of the Internal Revenue \n     Service.\n       (2) $11,600,000 from administrative and other savings in \n     tax law enforcement activities.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is an amendment which attempts to deal \nwith a problem that has long been identified within the law enforcement \ncommunity and which many within the law enforcement community feel is \nan essential ingredient in our ability to be able to improve our \nantiterrorist activities and our ability to be able to bring people to \nprosecution for terrorist acts.\n  Earlier this year, Congress took a very important and long overdue \nstep toward making it easier to track the origin of explosives that are \nused by terrorists and other criminals when we passed the antiterrorism \nbill. That legislation, which was signed by the President in April, \ndirected the Secretary of the Treasury to study the feasibility of \ntagging explosives for the purposes of detection and identification. We \npassed the provision asking for a study that would identify how we can \npossibly put taggants into explosives so that if there is----\n  Mr. SHELBY. Will the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts yield \nfor an inquiry as to a possible time agreement?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. SHELBY. What about an hour equally divided?\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to inquire of my colleagues for a moment. I know \nthe Senator from California wants to speak, and I want to see who else \nmight like to speak. I know Senator Kennedy may.\n  If the Senator will allow me, I will continue my opening comments.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Sure. We will come back to it.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be happy to enter into an agreement if we can \ndetermine who wishes to speak.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. KERRY. We will touch base with a couple of offices and ascertain \ntheir intentions.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to emphasize that we passed and the \nPresident signed legislation that begins to deal with this question of \ntaggants and the feasibility of using taggants as a means of tracking \nexplosives in the aftermath of a bombing.\n  As I think most of our colleagues know, a taggant is a plastic \ntracing device--or metal--which can be placed in the explosive material \nand, after an explosion, these taggants can actually be scooped up \neither by magnetic or other means so that you can gain enough of them \nto be able to determine from the taggant code precisely where it was \nsold, when it was sold, and where it was manufactured, and begin to be \nable to track the person who committed the crime.\n  There are millions of different codes that are capable of being \ncreated, so you have this enormous ability to be able to determine when \nand where a particular explosive might have been made. If the study \nresults that we have ordered already are positive, then the Secretary \nof the Treasury is authorized to begin to issue additional regulations \nthat will enable us to use these taggants in explosives manufactured or \nimported into the United States.\n  Unfortunately, this provision in the anti-terrorism bill did not \ninclude all dangerous materials in the study. It explicitly excluded \nblack and smokeless powder. One can ask why we chose to leave out these \nsubstances when they are used in 90 percent of the pipe\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\nbomb attacks in the United States. I regret we did not include these.\n  I think the public has been, all too often, denied, for various \nreasons, its ability to try to maximize law enforcement's ability to \nmove forward. I am not suggesting that we ought to do anything that \nsays we are going to absolutely mandate the use of taggants, but we \nwould like to have the study to at least analyze whether or not adding \ntaggants to black and smokeless powder will provide us the ability to \nfight terrorism and safely--and I emphasize ``safely''--deal with the \nproblem of black and smokeless powder in bombs.\n  All we are asking for is a study. Let us study whether or not that \ncan be done in a safe way. Why anyone would want to object to law \nenforcement being able to study something that they say they definitely \nwant and need, and that they know works, is beyond me. My hope is that \nwe will not have objection to it, that we will be able to proceed \nforward with the Congress unanimously saying: In the United States of \nAmerica, common sense will rule. It is appropriate to have a study, an \nanalysis independently done, of whether or not it is safe to have \ntaggants in black and smokeless powder.\n  I have heard opponents suggest that taggants might not be safe \nbecause they might destabilize the powder. I personally believe this is \na red herring. Taggants have been used in black powder previously \nwithout a stability problem. But that is the purpose of the study. If, \nin fact, it is unsafe, let the study come back and tell us it is \nunsafe. The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, the \nfeasibility, and the effectiveness of adding the taggants.\n  Why should we do this? I was a prosecutor, and I gained great respect \nfor the forensic laboratory during that experience. Today, it is even \nmore extraordinary what forensic experts are able to tell us about the \nthings which just escape the naked eye or which escape all of us who \nare not experts. But the experts tell us they want this technology to \nenable them to determine the origin of explosives and to help them work \ntheir way back to the perpetrator of a bombing.\n  When Pam Am 103 crashed over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1989, the \nauthorities determined almost immediately that the cause was a bomb, \nbut it took them a year to find the tiny clue that led to the Libyan \nsuspects. If the explosives in that bomb had been marked with taggants, \nthe source of the material would have been immediately known, and the \ninvestigators would have gained a tremendous advantage.\n  We have recently witnessed again the horrific spectacle of a massive \nexplosion in the air of a still as yet undetermined source, as a 747 \nwent down. We know there was some kind of explosion of undetermined \norigin. We have watched the painstaking process of an effort to try to \nrebuild the airplane itself, recouped from the floor of the ocean, and \nthat makes it even more difficult. But if investigators do determine \nthat a bomb triggered the crash of TWA 800, they will then have an even \nmore difficult investigation to find the bomber. This time the problem \nis exponentially more difficult because the wreckage is under water. \nBut it does not take a forensic scientist to understand that a \nmechanism to determine the origin of explosive material would be a \ntremendous value in this explosion, too.\n\n  This investigation has already indicated evidence of holes blown \nthrough the back of seats that show the direction of that explosion. \nBut they do not have taggants. They do not have the ability to quickly \ndraw a conclusion of its type or origin or, even yet, whether that came \nfrom a bomb.\n  Attacks of the magnitude of Pan Am 103 obviously cause devastating \nimpact. They grab our attention. So did the TWA flight. But attacks \nusing pipe bombs are actually a much more common experience in the \nUnited States, and these devices also cause death and destruction. This \nwas demonstrated all too vividly in July when just such a bomb exploded \nat the Olympic Centennial Park, causing two deaths and spreading terror \nthrough an event that was supposed to celebrate the triumph of the \npeaceful human spirit.\n  Unfortunately, the Olympic bombing was not an isolated incident. From \n1990 through 1994, there were 4,095 pipe bomb attacks in the United \nStates. Let me repeat that. From 1990 through 1994, there were 4,095 \npipe bomb attacks in our country. These bombs killed 44 people, injured \n384, and they caused property damage of almost $10 million. In 1994 \nalone, there were 862 incidents. Of these, 86 percent used smokeless \nand black powder.\n  Taggants have already proved to be a useful tool for law enforcement. \nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms conducted a pilot project \nin the late 1970's. They added taggants to dynamite and other blasting-\ncap-sensitive explosives. In 1979, Nathan Allen, of Baltimore, was \nkilled by a bomb hooked to his car ignition. The subsequent \ninvestigation found that the explosive used in that bomb contained \ntaggants. The investigators identified the specific batch from which \nthe explosives came. The police then used the sales records to track \ndown and convict Mr. Allen's killer.\n  That should have become a routine investigative practice, post-1979, \nbut 17 years later, here we are still talking about it. Here we are, 17 \nyears later, and law enforcement, which managed to convict a killer by \nthe use of taggants, is still asking us: Let us have taggants.\n  All we are asking today is, let us analyze and study the benefit of \nadding taggants to explosives so we can make an informed decision. If \nthe study finds them to be safe, then it seems the benefits are \nobvious. The ability to track the origin of explosive materials is an \ninvaluable tool for criminal investigations, and I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in adding black and smokeless powder to the study and \nproviding the necessary funding.\n  It seems to me, despite any group's opposition for reasons that they \nunderstand but which, frankly, do not bear up to scrutiny when measured \nagainst where most people in this Senate or Congress are prepared to \ngo, we ought not delay further this analysis.\n  So I hope that colleagues will join with Senator Feinstein, Senator \nKennedy, myself, and others in an effort to provide law enforcement \nwith the tools that they need to combat terrorism and to track down \nthose cowardly individuals who see bombs as a way to achieve their \nmisguided goals.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I commend the \nSenator from Massachusetts for what was a strong, accurate and, I \nthink, eloquent statement, something that has become very controversial \nand really should not be controversial.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, can I ask my colleague to yield for a \nmoment? The manager asked if we were able to enter into a time \nagreement. I know he wants to do that. How much time does my colleague \nexpect to consume?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Give me 10 minutes, maybe a little more.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, can we suggest an hour equally divided?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 \nhour of debate, equally divided in the usual form, on the Kerry \namendment pending a motion to table. I further ask that no second-\ndegree amendment be in order prior to the motion to table, and no vote \noccur before the hour of 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I inquire, \ncan we have an up-or-down vote?\n  Mr. SHELBY. It is going to be a motion to table.\n  Mr. KERRY. I heard that, which is why, Mr. President, I was wondering \nwhether we could have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We would, over here, rather have a motion to table. That \nis what we talked about.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object. I think it is really \ntime for us to go on record. Senator Kerry and I participated, as did \nthe distinguished Senator from Idaho sitting in the back of the room, \nin a special effort where we tried to negotiate something and were not \nable to do so.\n  I think what we hope to do is lay out the case, and I am sure the \ncase in opposition to studying black and smokeless powder will be laid \nout. We would\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\nreally appreciate an up-or-down vote, I say to my colleague.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If I may respond, I have talked to Senator Kerrey from \nNebraska. He is not on the floor. We had agreed earlier to move to \ntable this, along with other amendments that came up that we thought we \ncould not fund at this point. With an hour of debate--if I can just \nproceed a second--if we can agree on this, there will be an hour of \ndebate. Of course, everybody knows the rules. Once we get recognized, \nwe can move to table and there will be no debate. Whereas, we get an \nhour on this equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object. Mr. President, do I \nunderstand, according to the unanimous-consent request, the motion to \ntable then would be on the Kerry amendment as submitted?\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is right, but no second degrees.\n  Mr. KERRY. And no second degrees. I understand, prior to the motion \nto table, no second degrees.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Correct, and no vote before 2:15 p.m., which is an hour.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], \nis recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which I strongly support, would repeal \nthe prohibition of requiring or even studying the use of taggants in \nblack and smokeless powder. What we are saying is, let's take a look, \nin a comprehensive, well-done, study of using taggants in black and \nsmokeless powder. It provides the funding, $21 million, for the \nexamination of the safety and the effectiveness of taggants, which is \nrequired before they can be used.\n\n  Why do we want black and smokeless powder? Senator Kerry was \neloquent. Ninety percent of all of the pipe bombs have black and \nsmokeless powder. Therefore, not to be even able to study it renders us \nimpotent in ever using taggants in a meaningful way to trace those who \npractice terrorist incidents.\n  Why is this important? It is important because today--today--the \nUnited States of America is in the top 20 nations with the highest \nlevel of terrorism in the world. We have more incidents than Lebanon.\n  The Senator has indicated the number of incidents: well over 4,000 \nnow since 1990. We all know of the Unabomber. We all know a pipe bomb \nwas used at the Atlanta Olympics. We all have seen what happened in the \nWorld Trade Center. We are all deeply concerned about TWA Flight 800.\n  What is a taggant? A taggant is a small sandwich-shape microchip. It \nis color coded in different codes. When it is broken down, it looks \nlike the smallest little flecks of sand, different colors, so small you \ncan barely see them at all. These are put in the powder. And then \ndepending on the color coding of the taggant, you can trace where this \nwas purchased.\n  So it becomes like a fingerprint that enables somebody to go back to \nthe source and trace a perpetrator. It is not a solution, but it is an \naid to law enforcement to be able to ferret out and arrest, I think, \nthe biggest cowards of all time--the people who use bombs on innocent \npeople. That is why it is important.\n  We have heard a lot about the fact that this information to make pipe \nbombs is so easily available. Youngsters are making these bombs from \ninformation available on the Internet--pipe bombs, 80 percent of all of \nthe bombings according to one study have become all too common.\n  Let me go back to some of the concerns. Some of the concerns are \nsafety: There was an explosion in 1979 at a firm called GOEX \nManufacturing Co. in Arkansas. I have here an affidavit, which I would \nlike to submit for the Record, from a gentleman by the name of James P. \nPalmquist, who was the senior attorney with the office of the general \ncounsel of 3M, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. He handled for 3M \na lawsuit against 3M involving this explosion at GOEX in Arkansas in \n1979.\n  I want to read three parts of his affidavit, and I quote:\n\n       4. That in the course of discovery concerning the \n     allegations made in this lawsuit, records were discovered \n     which identified the exact location at the time of the \n     accidental explosion of all MICROTAGGANT materials which were \n     then being evaluated, which records proved that there was no \n     MICROTAGGANT materials in the booster materials that were \n     being reworked at the time of the accidental explosion;\n\n  The point is Taggants were not in the materials that were exploded in \n1979, which is the incident that the National Rifle Association most \nuses to discredit taggants.\n\n       5. That further information was discovered indicating other \n     reasons for the increased instability of the booster \n     materials which were being reworked at the time of the \n     accidental explosion;\n       6. That based upon such facts it became clear to all \n     involved in the lawsuit that there was no evidence whatsoever \n     that 3M's MICROTAGGANTs could have contributed in any way to \n     subject explosion, said lawsuit was dismissed.\n\n  It is signed by James P. Palmquist. It is notarized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Affidavit\n\n     State of Minnesota\n     County of Ramsey\n\n       Known all men by these presents:\n       That, before me, the undersigned authority, on this day \n     personally appeared James P. Palmquist, who, after having \n     been duly sworn by me, upon his oath deposed and said the \n     following:\n       1. That he is a Senior Attorney with the Office of General \n     Counsel, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (``3M'') \n     with offices located at Building 220-11E-03, 3M Center, St. \n     Paul, MN 55144-1000;\n       2. That he has been employed by 3M since 1963 and has been \n     an attorney within 3M's Office of General Counsel from 1973 \n     to present;\n       3. That in such capacity he handled for 3M a lawsuit filed \n     against 3M involving a July 25, 1979 explosion at GOEX, \n     specifically the GOEX manufacturing plant in East Camden, \n     Arkansas, which lawsuit alleged, among other things, that \n     3M's MICROTAGGANTs which were then being evaluated \n     as possible identification taggant materials for explosives, \n     was a contaminet in certain booster materials that were being \n     reworked and that the MICROTAGGANTs contributed or \n     caused the GOEX accidental explosion;\n       4. That in the course of discovery concerning the \n     allegations made in this lawsuit, records were discovered \n     which identified the exact location at the time of the \n     accidental explosion of all MICROTAGGANT materials \n     which were then being evaluated, which records proved that \n     there was no MICROTAGGANT materials in the booster \n     materials that were being reworked at the time of the \n     accidental explosion;\n       5. That further information was discovered indicating other \n     reasons for the increased instability of the booster \n     materials which were being reworked at the time of the \n     accidental explosion;\n       6. That based upon such facts it became clear to all \n     involved in the lawsuit that there was no evidence whatsoever \n     that 3M's MICROTAGGANTs could have contributed in \n     any way to subject explosion, said lawsuit was dismissed.\n       Further affiant sayeth not.\n                                               James P. Palmquist.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Additionally, there was a study performed by the \nAerospace Corp. and contracted out by ATF. This was done about 15 years \nago. And I would like to read from a letter of Dr. Carl Boyars who is \nthe manager of the Explosives and Materials Control Directorate of the \nAerospace Corp. He was in charge of this study. And he says in a letter \nto me, dated July 31, 1996:\n\n       The only firearms for which black powder is now used as a \n     propellant explosive are antiques and antique replicas, both \n     commonly referred to as ``muzzle loaders''. Black powder is \n     sold in cans for use by hobbyists who reenact battles of \n     prior centuries and carry out similar activities. It is also \n     used, illegally, by some makers of pipe bombs because of its \n     ready availability and ease of ignition. Addition of \n     identification taggants in the final step of black powder \n     manufacture was easily performed, involved no hazard, and \n     performance of the tagged product in muzzle loading firearms \n     was no different from the performance of untagged black \n     powder in tests carried out by a muzzle loading firearms \n     expert selected by the black powder manufacturer.\n\n  So the black powder manufacturer selected a specific expert, and that \nexpert carried out these tests and found no difference between muzzles \nloaded with tagged black powder and muzzles loaded with untagged black \npowder.\n  He continues:\n\n       Smokeless powder is also sold in cans for use by reloaders. \n     These are individuals who\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\n     prefer to load cartridge ammunition by hand rather than use \n     factory manufactured ammunition in their own firearms. \n     Advantages cited by reloaders are cost (e.g., in shotgun \n     ammunition) or greater accuracy because of more precise \n     control of the load in each cartridge. The smokeless powder \n     intended for reloaders is also used, illegally, by some \n     makers of pipe bombs because of its ready availability, ease \n     of ignition, and much higher energy content than black \n     powder.\n       Unlike black powder, smokeless powder can come in a wide \n     range of chemical compositions and physical shapes and sizes, \n     depending on the manufacturer. The individual particles of \n     smokeless powder may be cylindrical, flat, or spherical, \n     although all particles within any can of smokeless powder for \n     reloaders will have the same chemical composition and shape. \n     This makes the development of an identification taggant for \n     smokeless powders a more complex problem.\n       A test program was set up to examine the feasibility of \n     identification tagging of spherical smokeless powder. However \n     the manufacturer of the spherical powder biased the test \n     conditions so greatly that failure was guaranteed.\n\n  This is from the definitive person who did the study by the Aerospace \nCorp., as contracted by ATF back in 1980.\n  The Swiss also took this study, and the Government of Switzerland \nbegan requiring their use--taggants--in all commercial explosives. The \nsuccess has been outstanding. In over 10 years, they have solved 565 \ncrimes based on taggants.\n  The report compiled by the Swiss Scientific Research Council stated \nthe following:\n\n       After more than a 10 year experience in the field of \n     marking explosives, safety fuses and detonating cords, we \n     feel that our methods and procedures have proven highly \n     practical and efficient. In summary, it is safe to say that \n     Switzerland with its marking methods is on the right lines. \n     Fears that adding marker substances might negatively \n     influence the safety of explosives for civil use has proven \n     unsubstantiated.\n\n  Here is my point. I have, I think, adequately debunked this incident \nwhere opponents say powder with taggants exploded. No taggants were in \nthe powder that exploded in 1979 in that Arkansas plant.\n  Two, the head person of the Aerospace study found that taggants were \nsafe for use with one exception that needs further study.\n  Three, Switzerland has used taggants for 10 years, made 565 arrests \nsuccessfully.\n  Four, we are now No. 20 in terrorist incidents in the world. And 90 \npercent of pipe bombs use this kind of black and smokeless powder. \nTherefore, should not this body exercise its responsibility and do a \nstudy of black and smokeless powder? The Senator from Massachusetts and \nI both say, yes, let us do that study, let us spend the money. We can \nsave lives, and we will arrest perpetrators. I thank the Chair. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am concerned at the moment, as one of \nthe managers of the bill, not about the study that the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from California discussed, because in a \nlot of ways that makes a lot of sense. I am concerned about the \noffsets--how are we going to pay for it? I understand the Senator is \nproposing to pay for this study.\n  Because of that, as I indicated, Senator Kerrey and I at the \nappropriate time would move to table the amendment. Mr. President, this \namendment proposes to appropriate $21.3 million for this study, and it \nis probably going to cost a lot of money to do a proper study of this \nkind. The offset, Mr. President, I remind my colleagues, would come \nfrom reductions in the IRS.\n  Now, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of the IRS \nare already calling and imploring us to try to put some more money in \nthe IRS. Senator Kerrey and I believe we are properly funding the IRS, \nbut to take an additional $21.3 million out, I think, would not be the \nproper time to do it, and it would not be the proper thing to do. I do \nnot believe it is the appropriate thing to do on this bill.\n  I was wondering if the Senator from Massachusetts and California \ncould find some other way to fund the study?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am very happy to respond through the Chair to the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  It is my understanding that the Treasury Department supports this \nappropriation. In other words, the Treasury Department has agreed to \nthe offset.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am not aware of that at all. I talked with the \nSecretary of the Treasury until 11 o'clock this morning and he \ncertainly did not mention this to me. I do not know if he mentioned it \nto Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as I understand it, half the funding would \ncome from savings that would occur only if the reorganization proposed \nby the IRS would not occur, but the reorganization is supported by \nTreasury. The IRS actually has objected to the reorganization delay \nthat is contained in another amendment that is on this bill. It is not \nclear whether or not that reorganization amendment is going to be \nsustained. I had one conversation with Secretary of Treasury Rubin \nabout that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will yield, we are verifying this at \nthis moment. I was informed by my staff that the Treasury Department is \nin support of this offset. We will be happy to verify it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have the amendment now in front of me. I \ndid not earlier. The $9.7 million comes from the delay required by the \nact in implementing field restructuring of the Internal Revenue \nService. We have not passed that delay yet. That delay was added as an \namendment. It has not been enacted yet.\n  I did receive notification from Secretary Rubin that he is concerned \nabout a delay in reorganization. I do not know, perhaps they are not \ngoing to support it. It was in the IRS recommendations that they wanted \nto do this reorganization.\n  To be clear on this, or attempt to be clear on this, the \nreorganization effort itself has not been fully justified to me. A \nreason we put the amendment on, asking for delay, was for the purpose \nof provoking a full justification from the standpoint of the mission of \nthe IRS, as well as customer service of the IRS. We have some problems \nalready with their 800 numbers and we want to make sure that this \nreorganization was both cost justified and was not going to produce a \ndeterioration in service.\n  The second area is one that I must say, if the administration \nsupports this, really flies in the face with things they have been \ntalking to our committee about every single time they have come up. Mr. \nPresident, $11.6 million from administration and other savings in tax \nlaw enforcement activities--we cut back tax law enforcement activities \nfrom the levels that they requested. Tax law enforcement activities are \na tool we use to try to get compliance from about, I believe, 83 or 84 \npercent today, and hopefully up to the 90 percent goal, which is the \nadministration's objective.\n  The more, of course, we collect in taxes, the less pressure you have \non people who are voluntarily complying and saying, ``I will send my \ntaxes in; I know I owe them.'' Tax enforcement is for the purpose of \nrelieving the burden on law-abiding citizens willing to pay their taxes \nwithout having to be jostled by the IRS.\n  I am interested to see what the administration says, if they are \nwilling to make a statement on both of those things. First, I do not \nknow how they will be able to work out the objection they raised to \nreorganization. Even if they do, it is not clear that will be in the \nlaw.\n  Second, as I said, with great respect to the Senator from California \nand the Senator from Massachusetts, I think they have a good proposal \non that. It does, as I said, fly in the face of the recommendations. I \nam prepared to make an argument anyway that we are dangerously close to \nunderfunding what we need to be able to fund on tax enforcement so that \nwe can say to our taxpayers that 83 percent to 84 percent of American \ntaxpayers file voluntarily the correct amount. They do not make any \nmistake at all. Mr. President, 85 out of 100 or 83 out of 100 \nAmericans--Coloradans, Idahoans, Nebraskans,\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\nCalifornians--are filing taxes and they are all right.\n\n  The enforcement division and the enforcement effort is to try to \nreduce the burden on them. Once we have decided how much money needs to \nbe collected to pay the bills, the more compliance; the higher \ncompliance rates we get, the lower the burden is going to be on \neveryone.\n  This is a very important effort. Again, I have great respect for the \nintent of the amendment but until and unless the administration or \nsomeone is able to persuade me that this would not be a good offset, I \ncontinue to oppose the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10349-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10365-S10366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the agreement entered into on June 28, 1996, with respect \nto Executive Calendar No. 12 be vitiated.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, may turn to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 12.\n  Before the Chair rules, I know that the Democratic leader would like \nto comment, but I would like to comment, too.\n  First of all, just a little history on this. We worked on both sides \nof the aisle to come to this unanimous-consent agreement back in June. \nIt was related to the defense authorization bill. We came to an \nagreement, and I felt compelled to honor that agreement. I fully \nintended to go to the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty this morning, \nto go to conclusion today or tomorrow, as provided under the unanimous-\nconsent agreement.\n  After consultation with the Democratic leader, and having gotten \nindications from the administration, including just now from the \nSecretary of State, that their preference would be at this time that we \nnot proceed with the previous agreement, I have prepared the pending \nunanimous-consent agreement. I understand their request, and I am \nprepared to comply with it.\n  I want to say to the leader that I think we ought to continue working \non it. The parties involved who have interest on both sides of the \naisle should communicate on amendments, and examine if potential \namendments to the resolution of ratification can be worked out. \nHopefully that can happen. It may not happen.\n  We have to recognize the period of time that we are in. There are \nlots of interests, and lots of time pressures. The important thing is \nto be careful what we do and to make sure that we do it the right way \nwith as little partisan rancor as possible. We will keep working with \nyou on that.\n  I want to emphasize that we are not setting a time certain for a vote \non the convention this year. I am not going to be in a position to be \nintimidated or to have other matters held hostage in an effort to force \na vote before we adjourn. To say in the future what we can or can't do \nin an effort to force a vote would be irresponsible and demonstrate a \nlack of good faith. It is at the request of the administration that we \nare not voting tonight on the convention. But I will say--and I think I \nnow have a record to back it up--that I will work with the Democratic \nleader, and we will see what we can do, and we will keep working to see \nif agreement between both sides can be reached.\n  I renew my unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say that the decision we have made \nrepresents our best effort to try to deal with the circumstances we \ncurrently have before us. The amendments that are contemplated during \nthe debate on the chemical weapons treaty have not yet been shown to \nthe administration or to Members of this side of the aisle, and for \ngood reasons. They have been working on them, and I do not fault them \nnecessarily for not showing them to us, but we are concerned that the \namendments have the opportunity to be considered carefully, that we \nwork with the authors of the legislation over the next few days to see \nwhether we can't resolve the differences that the amendments represent.\n  The administration is desirous of attempting to find some resolution \nto those amendments so that we can send a clear message as a country \nabout the importance of this treaty as is possible.\n  I appreciate very much again the cooperation of the majority leader \nin coming to this conclusion. I think it is the right one. He and I had \nanticipated bringing the treaty up this afternoon and having a good \ndebate, but I think a 1-hour time limit under these circumstances may \nnot be the definition of a good debate on issues of this import.\n\n  So we will continue to work to continue to try to find ways in which \nto resolve these differences and, subject to the agreement of both \nleaders, perhaps bring it up later. It would be my hope that we will \nbring it up later, but that will be subject, of course, to our success \nin these negotiations on the amendments themselves and the schedule. \nBut we will address that and issues relating to the treaty at a later \nday.\n  So, again, let me thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Two points I would like to make before the leader leaves. \nWe are still requesting additional information with regard to the \nconvention. I have been corresponding with the White House and \ncommunicating with the administration. I think that there is additional \ninformation that could be obtained and perhaps be declassified. I am \ngoing to continue to work on that. I may ask the minority leader to \ngive me a hand with that as part of the ongoing process. I think there \nis some more information that could be made available and could be \ndeclassified which could be helpful on both sides, quite frankly.\n  The other thing is that we are going to proceed on the Treasury-\nPostal appropriations bill to try to make some progress on that. I am \nnot going to try to get another unanimous-consent agreement at this \npoint. But it is my intention to keep working on that and come back \nhere after further consultation to see if we can't get some further \nnarrowing of the amendments and some way to complete this bill tonight.\n  Is that your understanding, or your intention?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just came from a caucus meeting and \nencouraged our colleagues to come to the floor to offer the essential \namendments, to wait for another day to offer those that may not be \nessential, to agree to time limits, recognizing there is a real \npossibility we could finish this bill tonight. I would like to work \nwith that goal in mind with the majority leader and with an expectation \nthat we can accommodate Senators' schedules on Friday and on Monday. \nBut we will do our best to see if we cannot get additional cooperation \nand narrow that list more completely this afternoon.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts. He has a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I should like to ask the majority leader, if I may, Mr. \nPresident, is it my understanding that it is the majority leader's \nintention to try to work through the amendments with the specific \nnotion of bringing the convention, the treaty, back within the \ntimeframe that we are here in September?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is not the way I stated it. I gave my assurance that \nwe will continue to work with interested parties on both sides of the \nissue and to see if amendments could be agreed to or not. It was \nobvious that to proceed at this time was not the right thing to do.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understood that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not making a commitment on a specific time or even \nthis September. It will depend on what happens.\n  Mr. President, while other Senators are conferring, I do want to \nencourage the managers of this legislation to\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\nkeep working to move amendments and to see if we can find a time to get \nvotes. I reiterate, I am not making any commitments on times, and I am \nnot going to be threatened in how we do this. But I am prepared to work \nin good faith with both sides of the issue and both sides of the aisle, \nand I think that is all that can be expected of me at this time.\n  With that, Mr. President, unless there are further questions, I will \nobserve the absence of a quorum so the managers can return to the floor \nand proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is a very straightforward vote on \nwhether or not we are prepared, finally, to include black and smokeless \npowder in a study by appropriate law enforcement authorities of the \nUnited States. A study to determine whether it can contain taggants so \nthat we can investigate pipe bombs and other bombs in the United \nStates. Law enforcement has sought this for 17 years. It is a very \nsimple vote. There is an adequate offset in the IRS. They have cut the \nbills funding by $1 billion already. The most that this will cost is \n$21 million and of course we hope it will be less, but any argument to \nthe contrary that suggests you cannot find the $21 million that have \nbeen offset here is simply unacceptable.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Excepted Committee Amendment, beginning on Page 129, Line 20 through \n                           Page 130, Line 18\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I intend to move to table the \ncommittee amendment beginning on page 129, and ask that it be in order \nto consider that committee amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, as I indicated, I will move to table the \ncommittee amendment that strikes a House provision capping the number \nof political employees who are appointed by the President. The effect \nof tabling the committee amendment will be to retain the House language \nand therefore limit the number of executive branch political \nappointees.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort by both Senators \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain and Mr. Kyl, my neighbor from the neighboring \nState of Minnesota, Mr. Grams, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum.\n  Madam President, the House language we seek to retain caps the number \nof political appointees at 2,300. The CBO estimates that doing so will \nsave $228 million over the next 6 years. This bipartisan proposal is \nbroadly supported for both its deficit reduction and its policy \nimplications.\n  Madam President, it has been endorsed by the Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, and similar versions of this provision have been \nincluded in the CBO's deficit reduction proposals, as well as the \nbudget assumptions of the other body. The other body passed this exact \nprovision on a vote of 267-150, with strong bipartisan support.\n  I note that this is a more modest provision than the one the Senate \npassed last year as part of the fiscal year 1996 Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. At that time, we in this body capped the executive \nbranch political appointees at 2,000, a level that in practice would \nhave required a reduction that would have been 60 percent greater than \nthe reduction we are proposing today, the reduction that has already \nbeen approved in the House version of this legislation.\n  The provision is also consistent with the recommendations of the Vice \nPresident's National Performance Review which called for reductions in \nthe number of Federal managers and supervisors. That report argued that \novercontrol and micromanagement not only stifled the creativity of line \nmanagers and workers, they ``consumed billions per year in salary, \nbenefits, and administrative costs.''\n  Madam President, that assessment is especially appropriate when we \nthink about and look at the issue of political appointees. Between 1980 \nand 1992, the number of political appointees in our executive branch \ngrew by more than 17 percent, over three times as fast as the total \nnumber of executive branch employees. Since 1960, political appointees \nhave grown in this country in the executive branch by a startling \npercentage of 430 percent. While we have made significant strides in \nthe last few years in slowing and even reversing the growth\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\nin the total number of Federal employees, our progress with respect to \npolitical appointees has lagged behind.\n\n  Madam President, the exploding number of political appointees was a \ntarget of the 1989 National Commission on the Public Service which was \nchaired by former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. As the \nCommission noted, Presidents must have the flexibility to appoint staff \nthat are ideologically compatible. Political appointees, of course, can \nbe enthusiastic sources of fresh ideas, and they do bring many times \nmeaningful experience from the private sector into an administration. \nEqually as important, political appointees help ensure Government \nresponse to the policy priorities that were actually mandated by the \nelectorate at the ballot box.\n  You cannot say that no political appointees are needed. It is very \nimportant if our election of a President is to have real meaning. \nHowever, Madam President, as the Volcker Commission found, far from \nenhancing responsiveness, the mushrooming number of Presidential \nappointees actually undermined effective Presidential control of the \nexecutive branch. The Commission noted that the large number of \nPresidential appointees simply cannot be managed effectively by any \nPresident or by any White House. There are just too many.\n  Altogether, the Volcker Commission argued that the lack of control \nand focus may dilute the President's ability to develop a coherent and \ncoordinated program, and to hold Cabinet Secretaries accountable. The \nCommission found that the excessive number of appointees are actually a \nbarrier to critical expertise, distancing the President and his \nprincipal assistants both from the most experienced career officials \nand from the front-line workers. These are the people who are often the \nbest positioned to make the critical assessments of Government policy.\n  The problem of distancing that was raised by the Volcker Commission \nhas been chronicled in more detail by Paul Light in his book \n``Thickening Government.'' Light found that the increasing number of \npolitical appointees are arrayed in layer upon layer of management, \nlayers that did not exist 30 years ago. He found in 1960 there were 17 \nlayers of management at the very top level of Government; by 1992 there \nwere 32 layers. Compounding the problem, Light notes that the 32 layers \ndo not stack neatly on top of one another in a unified chain of \ncommand. Some layers come into play on some issues, but not on other \nissues. Mr. Light asserts that as this sediment has thickened over the \ndecades, Presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of \nGovernment, and the front lines from them. He adds that Presidential \nleadership, therefore, may reside in stripping Government of the \nbarriers to do its job effectively.\n  Madam President, many will recall the difficulties, for example, that \nthe current administration has had in filling even some of the more \nvisible political appointments. A story in the National Journal in \nNovember 1993 focusing upon the delays in the Clinton administration in \nfilling political positions noted that in Great Britain the transition \nto a new government is finished a week after it begins. A speedy \ntransition is possible because the British Government runs on a handful \nof political appointees. According to Paul Light, they have about one-\ntenth as many career executives, and only five layers of management \nbetween the Minister and the British equivalent of the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary, compared to more than 16 layers here in a comparable \nsituation.\n  By contrast, the transition of U.S. administrations over the past 35 \nyears has seen increasing delays and logjams and perfectly illustrates \nanother reason why the number of these political appointee positions \nshould be cut back. Madam President, the average length of time from \ninauguration to confirmation of top-level executive positions has \nsteadily risen from 2.4 months under President Kennedy, to 5.3 months \nunder President Reagan, to 8.1 months under President Bush, and now to \na pretty staggering 8.5 months, on average, under President Clinton.\n\n  The consequences of having so many critical positions unfilled when \nan administration changes can be serious. In the first 2 years of the \nClinton administration, there were a number of stories and problems \ncreated by delays in making these appointments.\n  From strained relationships with foreign allies over failures to make \nambassadorial appointments, to the 2-year vacancy that we all read \nabout at the top of the National Archives, the record is replete with \nexamples of agencies left drifting while a political appointment was \ndelayed. Obviously, there were many situations where the delays were \ncaused by circumstances beyond the control of this administration. And, \nof course, the figures I just read indicated that this has been a \nproblem in many administrations. It is just that, over time, with each \nadministration, regardless of party, it has gotten somewhat worse.\n  Nonetheless, it is clear that with a reduced number of political \nappointments to fill, the process of selecting and appointing \nindividuals to key positions in a new administration is very likely to \ngo more smoothly and to be enhanced.\n  Madam President, let me also stress that the problem is not simply \nthe initial filling of a political appointment, but also the problem of \nkeeping somebody in that position for a reasonable period of time. \nBetween 1970 and 1986, the tenure of a political appointee was, on \naverage, 20 months, and even shorter for schedule C employees.\n  In a recent report, the General Accounting Office reviewed a portion \nof these positions for the period of 1981 to 1991, and found high \nlevels of turnovers--seven appointees in 10 years for one position--as \nwell as delays, usually of months but sometimes years, in filling \nvacancies.\n  As I have noted before on this floor, this proposal may not be \npopular with some within this administration and perhaps some in the \nother party who hope to win back the White House in the upcoming \nelection.\n  I want to stress that I do not believe the effort to reduce the \nnumber of political appointees should be a partisan issue. It is \nbecause the only way we are ever going to have control over this is by \na bipartisan commitment in the House and the Senate to do something \nabout the exponential growth in the number of political appointees.\n  So I was pleased to introduce earlier in the 104th Congress \nlegislation that would have implemented the recommendations of the \nVolcker Commission, and that would have capped the political appointees \nat 2,000. And I was proud to have as cosponsors of that measure my \nfriends, the senior Senator from Arizona and also his colleague and my \nfriend, the junior Senator from Arizona.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this body adopted that provision to last \nyear's fiscal year 1996 Treasury-postal appropriations bill. It had \nbipartisan sponsorship. So this body has already gone on record in \nfavor of the cap at 2,000. But what we are trying to do by tabling the \ncommittee amendment today is to at least get us down to the 2,300 that \nthe other body has already supported in this legislation we are \nconsidering today.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the sacrifice that the deficit reduction \nefforts require really have to be spread among all of us. That has \nalready been felt by many people all over this country and many \nGovernment workers all over this country. This measure requires us to \nbite the bullet and impose limitations upon political appointments that \nboth parties would probably want to retain.\n  The test of a commitment to deficit reduction, however, is not simply \nto propose measures that impact somebody else. As we move forward to \nimplement the recommendations of the National Performance Review Board \nto reduce the number of Government employees and streamline agencies \nand make Government more responsive, we should also take this \nopportunity today to right-size the number of political appointees, to \nimplement the policies of any administration, without, at the same \ntime, unnecessarily burdening the Federal budget.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \neffort. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I listened, I regret to say, only to about \nthe last half of the Senator's statement. If he doesn't mind, I would \nlike to ask a couple of questions. First of all, my memory, such as it \nis, says that there\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\nwas not a rollcall vote on this last year, is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. You have cited a Volcker Commission report repeatedly \nhere. Can you describe the details of that commission and how many \npeople were on it? Do you have any other cites besides the Volcker \nCommission to base this on?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In addition to Mr. Volcker's commission, which was \ncited by a number of articles, I also cited the work of Mr. Light, who \nwrote a more extensive book about this subject called ``Thickening \nGovernment,'' which I quoted at length. It was described that the \ngrowth of these political appointments has outstripped growth in other \nareas of Government. Therefore, while we have cut back on some of our \nFederal employees, this area continues to grow. I can certainly provide \nthe Senator with the details of the Volcker Commission and Mr. Light's \nbook.\n  Mr. KERREY. The one statement that the Senator from Wisconsin made \nthat causes me to have some concern is the statement that I believe the \nVolcker Commission said that political appointees actually make it more \ndifficult for the President to carry out whatever it was he or she \ncampaigned upon. One of the facts here is that this would take it from \n2,800 down to----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The current estimate, if I may say to the Senator from \nNebraska, is about 2,900, but it varies and the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that it averages around 2,700 or 2,800. The effect of \nthis would be, as I understand it, to require, within the next year, a \nreduction of between 400 and 500 positions.\n  Mr. KERREY. So that the public can put this into perspective, there \nare 1.971 million Federal employees. Right now, there is an allowance \nfor 3,400. I think we are at 2,800 now. This would take us down to \n2,300.\n  My concern with the Senator's amendment is based upon having been \nelected for 4 years as Governor, where I came into office with very \nlittle opportunity for appointments below the top slot. It made it \ndifficult, therefore, to come in, having promised to do something, for \nexample, with agriculture, with taxes, or with some other area of \ngovernment, and carry that out. The public expected me to be able to do \nit. But, in fact, I would come in with very little real power, because \nthere was little opportunity to bring people in who agreed with the \npositions that I had taken during the campaign itself.\n  That is why I was concerned when I heard that. It runs against my own \ncommon experience, my own personal experience. It does not seem to me \nthat running at the current level of 2,800, with 3,400 being the cap, \nthat does not seem, on the surface, to be like a thickening of the \nGovernment. It is less than half of 1 percent--current political \nappointees. I know the administration raised concerns, not just for \nthemselves but for whoever might follow, that this could impede their \nability to carry out whatever he or she campaigned upon. It seems to me \nthe people expect him to be able to come in and run the bureaucracies \nwith the people that have similar views to theirs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, of course. I respect very much his distinguished tenure \nas Governor of Nebraska and his knowledge of the importance of having a \npolitical presence within any kind of executive administration, if you \nwant to implement the policies you run on.\n  I indicated that, and it was also indicated from the Volcker \nCommission, and others' comments to that effect.\n  The question is what level? What I have indicated here and want to \nrepeat is that that clearly has been a greater theme of government with \nrespect to political appointees than other people in executive \npositions. It has grown 17 percent, while in the nonpolitical area it \nhas only grown approximately 5 percent. That is the question.\n  Clearly, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. President, there \nmust be some point at which there are too many political appointees--\nperhaps 10,000, or 8,000. At some point there are too many people. What \nthese reports have suggested, almost ironically, is that, if you get \ntoo many political appointees, the chief executive of a State or the \nFederal Government cannot even keep track of them so that it actually \ncan backfire on them. It could actually end up being worse than having \nthe right mix between civil service career people and political \nappointees.\n  In response to the earlier question, as I understand it, there were \nsix members of the task force within the Volcker Commission that \nexamined the specific issue of political appointees. The chairman of \nthat task force was Elliot Richardson. Among the members were Robert \nMcFarlane, Walter Mondale, Benjamin Read, Anne Wexler, and Alan Wolff, \nand they came up with this conclusion that we ought to go to 2,000 \nagain.\n  To reiterate, my amendment--actually the House amendment that I \nsimply want to restore--would not take this to 2,000 as I originally \nhoped. It would simply take us to the 2,300 figure.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I still have some questions about this. I \ncome at this with some background of longstanding. The Volcker \nCommission report is about 7 years old at this time. I had hearings on \nit when it first came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I am \nvery familiar with the Volcker Commission report. It came out in 1989, \nI believe. I had hearings on it in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nat the time it came out because I, too, was concerned about the growth \nof Government. We had hearings and worked on some ways to peel back on \nsome political appointees to hit the proper balance that needs to be \nhit.\n  I do not believe, however, that just mandating it, as we are doing \nwith this particular proposal, is the way to go at this thing. I think \nit is in many ways unnecessary and unwarranted because the proposed \nlegislation would enforce an arbitrary cap. And it is arbitrary. It is \nnot done going department by department and agency by agency, and \nsaying, ``Here are some that are excess; here are some that are not.'' \nDoing a study that way just lops off about a third, or 30 percent the \ntotal number of political appointees, without saying who is going to do \nthis job or whether their job can be done by somebody else or absorbed \nby people in the regular civil service ranks, or whatever.\n  Let me just say that President Clinton has taken the lead to reduce \nFederal employees while making Government work better. The President's \nplan has carefully analyzed the Federal Government, and it has \nrecommended specific and pragmatic ways to reduce the number of \nGovernment employees. The plan makes 180 specific recommendations to \nstreamline the Government and deliver more services for less money.\n  By contrast, the proposed legislation singles out political \nappointees while failing to account for how the arbitrary number of \nremaining appointees will manage the Government. As far as reducing \nGovernment and cutting costs, we began 3 years ago when President \nClinton began the effort to reduce Government.\n  We are all familiar with the National Performance Review under the \ndirection of the Vice President. His goal was to create a Federal \nGovernment that works better and costs less.\n  Under the NPR--let us see how we have done with the NPR. After 3 \nyears in office, the President is well ahead of schedule to reduce the \nsize by 272,900--that was the goal by the end of this year--or about a \n12-percent reduction in the Federal workforce. In fiscal year 1995, \n185,000 full-time equivalent positions were cut. By the end of fiscal \nyear 1996, 214,000 will have been cut. So we are well on the way to \ncutting that 272,900. So we have reduced. We are about two-thirds of \nthe way toward the goal in one-third of the time that we thought it was \ngoing to take.\n\n  In the Reagan and Bush administrations, from 1980 to 1992, we saw an \nincrease of 67,000 in the Federal civilian workforce. That was an \nincrease of 3.1 percent. This administration has cut the number of on-\nboard Federal employees by 225,000 in 3 years. It is a decrease of 10 \npercent. A similar reduction has occurred in the percentage of \npolitical appointees.\n  So it has been across the board. It has not been only civil service. \nIt has also been the political appointees. There are approximately 6 \npercent\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\nfewer political appointees in this administration than there were \nduring the previous administration.\n  This is an important thing to note. The last time American taxpayers \nsaw levels of Federal employment this low was during the administration \nof President Kennedy.\n  This administration established a plan to reduce not only the size of \nthe Government but also the number of programs, the number of \nregulations, and the way Government works to develop new partnerships. \nEven though the current level of appointees in this administration is \nbelow that of the Bush administration in 1992, the proposed legislation \nwould force a 30-percent reduction of political appointees in addition \nto the reductions that have already been accomplished.\n  The National Performance Review accomplishes the goals of this \nproposed amendment. I have been much involved with the NPR. President \nClinton has sought to reduce the cost of Government to the American \npublic while providing higher quality services. The National \nPerformance Review has carefully analyzed the Federal Government and \nhas recommended specific, pragmatic ways to reduce the number of \nGovernment employees, including political appointees, to manage with \nfewer layers of middle management, and to reduce Government \nregulations. For example, President Clinton has reduced the number of \nDepartment of Agriculture agencies from 43 to 29 and plans to close or \nconsolidate 1,200 field offices.\n  I think the proposed amendment looks only at one frame of really the \nbig picture. The proposed amendment singles out political appointees. \nBy singling out political appointees, it examines only one-sixth of 1 \npercent of the total Federal employees. About half of the political \nappointees are schedule C employees who are junior and midlevel staff. \nThese are not all senior-level managers even though they may be \npolitical appointees.\n  This administration has instead focused on all Federal employees by \nremoving layers of management to offer lower level employees greater \nresponsibility. It also decentralized decisionmaking and increased the \nscope of managers' control.\n  Political appointees execute the policy priorities voiced by the \nAmerican public at the ballot box. Political appointees play a key role \nin carrying forward policy priorities. The Clinton administration has \nan obligation to ensure that the Government is a well-managed \ninstrument of the public interest in carrying out programs important to \nthe public. Political appointees are entrusted with managing the \npriorities of the American public.\n  So just arbitrary cuts in the number of political appointees endanger \nthe administration's ability to respond to policy priorities created \nboth by law and the American public at the ballot box.\n  Mr. President, there was a statement made about how the British \nfunctioned and how their Government operates and how they can turn \naround the Government in a much shorter time than we can. That is very \ntrue. Perhaps there are some areas where we can learn from the British \nand other parliamentary forms of government. But they operate on a \nparliamentary form of government quite different from ours. Indeed, \nthey are a democracy, but their functions of government are completely \ndifferent than ours where we split the powers out and have the powers \nof government balance each other between the executive and legislative \nbranches. Then ours is monitored by the judicial branch, of course, \nwhen there are any challenges to this. But in a parliamentary system \ntheirs is centered in that Prime Minister, and a Prime Minister is \nnormally far more powerful than any American President. We may be a \nbigger country and a bigger economy, but as far as the authority to \ncommit the affairs of government in a certain direction, a Prime \nMinister speaks with authority for his or her government with a shadow \nCabinet out there in the offing. That is the reason they always can \nturn over faster than we can. In a parliamentary form of government, \nthe Prime Minister can say, ``Here is what is going to happen,'' and \nthat is a commitment of government, or that person is turned out of \noffice when there is a new election or the party turns him or her out \nof office.\n  And so a Prime Minister, as far as getting things done, and as far as \nthe hierarchy, the bureaucracy of Government to back that person up, \nthere is less turnover in that type system than there is normally in \nour type system with all of its remainder of powers back and forth.\n  The loyal opposition in a parliamentary situation has a cabinet, a \nshadow cabinet standing there waiting to come in. They know right then \nwho their appointees are going to be, if there are going to be many at \nall, and the actual form of Government goes on. The full-time civil \nservants are lifetime, usually spend a lifetime career in those \nparticular positions.\n  Now, let us look back at the NPR a minute, the National Performance \nReview. We worked very closely with the National Performance Review in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. We provided some of the \nlegislation, the legal authority for buyouts, for early outs, for early \nretirements, but done with fairness--done with fairness.\n  We have cut out a lot of those positions. And as I just read a moment \nago here, we have, indeed, cut out a number of the political appointees \nwith that, and that was done at the initiative of the administration, \nto cut some of those out, cut out some of these layers of management.\n  I know Paul Light, in reference to his work. I have his book and have \nread his book. He was on our committee staff at one time and went from \nthe committee staff, I think, to the position he has now where he has \nauthored a lot of articles, and so on, has done an excellent job in \nwhat he has done. So I am thoroughly familiar with Paul's work. I know \nhim personally. He has done a good job in pointing out a lot of these \nthings. We do, indeed, have to be working toward the end he points out \nin the book of this layering of Government, the many layers and levels \nthat we have to fix if we truly are going to have efficiency in \nGovernment.\n  But as my distinguished colleague from the Nebraska, the floor \nmanager of the bill, pointed out a few moments ago, political \nappointees in our system come in not just as political favors to give \nsomebody a Government job. They are put in over the normal civilian \nbureaucracy, the civil service, so that the policies of the new \nPresident can be implemented; you have people in each one of these \ndepartments or agencies to do exactly that, to see that the President's \npolicies are carried out. They are the implementers.\n  Now, do we have too many implementers? Well, I would not quarrel that \nmaybe we do, but I think to just arbitrarily say we are going to lop \noff a third of these because we do not like that big number out there \nis a pretty shortsighted way to go at this thing.\n  How do we make that kind of change, just whacking away at the \nmanagement levels that the President uses for control in these \ndifferent agencies and departments? How do we just whack away at them \nwithout knowing what the impact is going to be? I guess I would feel \nmuch better about it if we had had some hearings on this and have some \nspecificity about where we are going to see these cuts occur, how they \nare going to do this. Maybe it will work in some departments; in other \ndepartments, it might be catastrophic.\n  I do agree very much with the distinguished Senator's comments about \nthe turnover in the political appointees once they are in office, and \nthat disturbs me mightily because we did some studies on that and have \nGAO figures on it. I do not have the current figures with me to be up \nto speed on this.\n  Well, I guess I do. Staff just handed me a comment on this.\n  Turnover rates of political appointees: Appointees average 2 years of \nservice. When NPAS vacancies occur, it often takes months, if not \nyears, to fill the slots. Some positions go unfilled for months, if not \nyears. By the time you get up to speed on major issues and budget \nprocurement and financial management, you are on the way out, and that \nis no way to run the Government.\n  So when I have conducted hearings in the past, when we have had \npeople come up for confirmation before the committee, I have always \nasked them for a commitment. I asked them for a personal commitment \nthat they are in for this term of office of the President. Everyone I \nhave run into so far, all those who have been through confirmation--we \nhad, I think it is, 40 or 40-\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\nsome who have come before our committee--everyone has given me that \ncommitment. I do not think anyone has violated it.\n\n  So we are doing our little bit to get this constancy of Government in \nthere also, which I think is very important. I think it is about half \nof the appointees are gone within 28 months, or something like that, I \nthink, is the current figure. That is in the ballpark anyway. We would \nhave to get more detailed figures on that.\n  In fact, we had a hearing on this back a few years ago; I was \nconcerned enough. We had GAO do a study, and they came up and gave the \nresults to us. We were trying to make sure whatever administration, \nRepublican or Democratic, it got a commitment from their political \nappointees coming in not just to get a new entry in their dossier or in \ntheir record but came in to do their job to the end of that \nadministration's 4-year term, whatever it might be.\n  So I would feel better about this proposal if we had had some \nhearings or we had details on exactly who was going to be affected--\nmost, how the President is expected to do his job if he does not have \nhis political appointments in there to carry out the policies that he \nhas been elected to put into effect in Government, and I do not think \nwe have that.\n  So I hate to oppose this, but I have to, in all good conscience, do \nthat because I do not like this sort of, what I call, a meat-ax \napproach to Government, just say we do not like the number of \nemployees; we will whack a third of them off.\n  That is basically what we are doing with this. It sounds great. \nPolitical appointees, everybody would probably agree they are the most \nexpendable people in Government, but they are not really. Whether it is \na Republican administration or Democratic administration, there are \npeople out there in Government as political appointees, either \nSecretary, Under Secretary level or whatever, who are implementing the \npolicies the administration had just been elected to put into practice.\n  So just to say that because they are political appointees we \nautomatically can do away with approximately a third of them I do not \nthink is realistic. So I have to oppose this. This will probably be \npopular enough--we are going to have a vote on it--to go through, but I \nurge my colleagues to think twice about this before they vote for \nsomething like this.\n  We are progressing in this direction. The administration has had well \nover 200,000 positions cut. We are at the lowest employment level since \nJohn F. Kennedy. We are bringing the employment of Government down not \nonly in civil service but in these political appointments.\n  A number of those positions, as I said earlier, have already been \neliminated by the National Performance Review and more are coming. \nThat, to me, is the way to go at this thing--keep the course we are on \nof cutting down civil service. Right now, we are ahead of schedule on \nreaching that cut of 272,900 that the administration set as a goal \nafter they did their assessment of all the civil service and of all the \nGovernment positions.\n  I hope we will vote this down so that we do not do more damage here \nthan we are doing good. We are heading in the right direction right \nnow, and to just automatically say we are going to arbitrarily pick a \nnumber off the top of our head and whack away is the wrong way to go, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me, first of all, say that there is no one who has \nshown more commitment to Government efficiency and making sure we have \nspent our tax dollars properly than the Senator from Ohio, so it is no \nfun disagreeing with him on an issue like this.\n  Let me, as I must, respond to a few of the points he made.\n  First of all, to hear some of the comments from the Senator from Ohio \nand some of the questions of the Senator from Nebraska, you would think \nwhat we are proposing to do is to essentially eliminate all political \nappointees.\n  That is not what we are doing. The figure that has been bantered \nabout is we are cutting the number of political appointees by a third, \nbut that is not the case. The estimate we have is that the number \naverages about 2,700 or 2,800 political appointees. The effect of this \namendment would take it down to about 2,300.\n  That is far less than one-third. It is more like 17 percent or \nsomething close to it. I understand the comparison between the rounding \noff at 3,000 versus the original bill at 2,000 would have produced that \nresult, but that is not the effect here. Neither I nor Mr. Volcker's \ncommission or Mr. Light at any point suggested you do not need \npolitical appointees. In fact, I took great care in my original remarks \nto indicate that you absolutely do need some political appointees. You \nmust have them in order to implement the political will that \naccompanied a Chief Executive's election to office. So there is no \ndisagreement on that point. The only question is what is the proper \nlevel, and that goes to the second question.\n\n  Are we, as the Senator from Ohio suggested, singling out political \nemployees for a cut? Or is it just the opposite, that they have been \nsingled out for protection? Federal employment in general, in this \narea, only went up 5 percent between 1980 and 1992; political \nemployment has gone up 17 percent. It is awfully hard to explain to the \npeople back home, while various local jobs at the Federal level as well \nas so many other things are cut, this area continues to grow and grow \nquickly.\n  I think it is interesting the very period that figure comes from, the \n17 percent growth, is the 12 years we are always talking about out \nhere--what happened between 1980 and 1992 with our Federal deficit. \nThat was the period of exponential growth in the deficit and that is \nwhat we have been trying to remedy. It seems to me this is admittedly \nsmall in the big picture but, again, one example of how things got out \nof control. In effect, blank checks were being written all over this \nGovernment, including in the area of constantly adding political \nappointees.\n  That leads me to the point I want to stress to my friend from Ohio. \nHe is absolutely right, the progress that has been made by this \nadministration is tremendous. I am very proud of it. I would like to \nthink I have had a small part in it. The Vice President's national \nperformance review has been key. The reductions have been very \nimpressive. Every American should be proud that, overall, we have made \ngreat progress, as the Senator from Ohio has suggested. All I am trying \nto do by this amendment is to round it out; to make sure it does look, \nin the words of the Senator from Ohio, fair; that it just did not \nhappen to civil service people but it also happens to political \nappointees.\n  I think it is most unfortunate to speak of the great reductions that \nhave been made in one area and then find the area where reductions have \nnot been made at all is the most sensitive area, of political \nappointees.\n  So, some of the language that has been used to describe this \namendment--being unfair or arbitrary or taking a meat-ax approach--I \nthink, is wrong. This is very consistent with the philosophy and spirit \nof the national performance review.\n  I want to respond to the Senator from Ohio by pointing out four ways \nin which this is not at all a meat-ax approach.\n  First, I reiterate, this does not eliminate all political appointees. \nIt reduces them from a figure of about 2,800 now to about 2,300.\n  Second, it does not have to happen tomorrow. The President has an \nentire year to get down to this figure. That is the effective date of \nthe amendment. It is not immediate.\n  Third, and this is a question the Senator from Ohio properly raised \nand it deserves an answer. We put no constraints in this provision on \nhow the President is to do this. We do not micromanage it. We do not \nsay that some specific number has to come from this department or this \narea of political appointees. We give the President full discretion to \nmake this determination, as it generally should be. Sometimes I get \nconcerned. We have experienced this, for example, in the area of \nforeign policy, where some folks in this body were trying to \nmicromanage the State Department in every respect. That is wrong. But \nit is appropriate for us, in the appropriations process, to set an \noverall level, a maximum number of political appointees, and then say: \nMr.\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\nPresident, we want you to reach that level within a year; we, of \ncourse, will understand you will make your own determinations how this \nis to happen.\n  Finally, though it may not be the most important, because I think the \nGovernment efficiency aspect and cutting spending are both critical, I \nthink a last point needs to be emphasized from my earlier presentation. \nThat is these experts, Mr. Volcker, Mr. Light and others, concluded not \nonly that we did not need all these folks, necessarily, to have a \nFederal Government that can implement the policies of the President, \nbut that it actually is harder for a President to be effective, or a \nGovernor to be effective, when there are too many political appointees \nto manage; when there are so many they become a life and an entity of \ntheir own and the President no longer has the time nor the ability to \nmanage all of that.\n  That is the title of Mr. Light's book, ``Thickening Government, \nFederal Hierarchy and the Diffusion of Accountability.'' We are noting \nhere, not only about limiting the number of employees, we are talking \nabout making sure the political appointees who are put in their \npositions are actually accountable to the Chief Executive who was \nelected and whose policies we are concerned about continuing. This is \nnot a hatchet job or meat-ax approach. It is a modest amendment. It \ngives the President a year to go forward with this change and I think \nit is perfectly consistent and would be a proud addition to the \nPresident's tremendous record and progress, not only on reducing the \nnumber of Federal employees, but his magnificent record on reducing the \nFederal deficit from what would have been $300 billion and is now \nestimated to be only about $117 billion, moving in the right direction \nfor the coming fiscal year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am pleased to join once again with my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, in reducing waste from the budget and \nstreamlining government. Senator Feingold and I have stood shoulder to \nshoulder on a number of occasions to cut corporate welfare and to \nreduce the Federal deficit.\n  Just a few months ago, we were joined by Senator McCain and Senator \nThompson in a bold attempt to reduce unnecessary and wasteful corporate \nwelfare in the Federal budget by $60 billion over the next 6 years. It \nis sometimes difficult to stare down the special interests and take aim \nat the excess in our budget, but I am determined to continue the fight \nto ensure our children a debt-free future. Mr. President, I appreciate \nhaving the Senator from Wisconsin as a comrade in arms.\n  Last year, I introduced a bill which reduced spending by more than \n$90 billion by the year 2002. One provision of that bill calls for a \nreduction of political appointees in the Federal Government to 2,000. \nThe proposal by the Senator from Wisconsin is not quite as ambitious, \nbut it is a fine start to rein in the surge in political appointees.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear on this point: The great growth of \npolitical appointees has not occurred under the Clinton Administration. \nAs a matter of fact, Vice President Gore has been a stalwart in \nreducing the size of government. Facing the legacy of 12 years of \nirresponsible growth in government under the Reagan-Bush \nAdministrations, our current Vice President has worked with the \nCongress to reduce the federal payroll to the size it was when John \nKennedy was in the White House.\n  This amendment supports the spirit of the Vice President's efforts \nand reflects my efforts to curtail the growth of political appointees \nin the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, in my home state of Massachusetts, political \nappointees are known as walruses, and I am pleased to help retire a few \nwalruses today. We need to reduce Government responsibly at the Federal \nlevel and I hope the states follow our leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and join us in \nreducing the size of government and the level of unnecessary Federal \nspending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin how much time does he think he will debate this?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am prepared to make the motion to table.\n  Mr. SHELBY. How about the Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. GLENN. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the Senators, both the Senator \nfrom Ohio and Wisconsin.\n  The language the Senator is attempting to restore here is a hot \npolitical topic, to say the least. The debate about it will, no doubt, \nbe one of the main points the media reports in the bill. It will make, \nno doubt about it, the papers and the nightly news, if it is adopted.\n  This amendment is great political rhetoric. We all have talked about \ntoo many political appointees in the past, depending on who was the \nPresident of the United States. Right now, there are about 2 million \ncivil employees in the executive branch of Government. Political \nappointees are responsible for final decisionmaking there, as we know. \nWe might not always like what they do, but how many of us can say we \nhave not questioned actions of the career bureaucracy? Do we want to \nhave a system like Great Britain and Japan and others, in which their \ncareer bureaucracy runs the Government? I hope not. Political \nappointees, on the other hand, are accountable. They are accountable \nfor the decisions they make. I believe, overall, the civil bureaucracy \nis not.\n  The American people, I think, deserve accountability from their \nGovernment officials. By reducing political appointees and increasing \nthe size and the power of a faceless bureaucracy, we are reducing \naccountability. Do we want to do that? We may need to adjust where they \nare, but is one-tenth of 1 percent too much for political \nrepresentation? I hope not. I hope my colleagues, at the proper time, \nwill vote against the motion to table this amendment, as I agree with \nthe Senator from Ohio, this is not the time and this is not the place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I have just a few comments here and then we will be \nfinished with this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article out \nof the Washington Post from back in 1994, April 21, 1994, called ``The \nPermanent Non-Government.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 1994]\n\n                      The Permanent Non-Government\n\n       This is no way to run a government. Indeed, to judge from a \n     General Accounting Office study release yesterday, it's a \n     small miracle that the government runs at all. The study, \n     conducted at the request of Sen. John Glenn, found that \n     political appointees stay on the job for only 2.1 years. In \n     other words, they usually leave about the time they might be \n     expected to have figured out what they're doing.\n       For some big jobs in troubled agencies, the turnover rates \n     are actually worse. The Federal Aviation Administration has \n     had seven appointed and four acting administrators in the \n     past 15 years; the Federal Housing Administration has had 13 \n     commissioners within the past 14 years. And to point out just \n     how bad it can get, Sen. Glenn, the chairman of the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee, noted that within an 18-month \n     period in 1991 and 1992, three different people served in the \n     Education Department as assistant secretary for post-\n     secondary education.\n       President Clinton has been unusually dilatory in filling \n     government jobs, but the problem of getting people to stick \n     around is not new--the GAO study covered 10 years and three \n     administrations. And once people leave, it takes a long time \n     to get new people behind their desks--from six to 20 months \n     depending on the agency. This all adds up to a big problem, \n     since a president has just four years to make a mark on the \n     government. As Sen. Glenn said in a letter to Mr. Clinton, \n     ``the fact remains that when senior positions are in a \n     constant state of flux, it diminishes the ability of any \n     president to carry out an agenda, to bring needed change in \n     the way government works, or to ensure that the long-term \n     interests, including the use of hard-earned taxpayer dollars, \n     are properly managed.'' Among other things, Sen. Glenn urged \n     Mr. Clinton to seek long-term commitments from his appointees \n     and ``fill vacant positions expeditiously.''\n       This is sound advice, especially the part about the \n     vacancies. But the study ought to force a broader inquiry by \n     the reinventing government crew in Vice President Gore's \n     office. Obviously not all of the jobs in question are equally \n     important, nor are the turnovers equally damaging. For some \n     appointees, 2.1 years in government may turn out to be two \n     years too long. And there's nothing wrong with a successful \n     deputy assistant secretary rising to become an assistant \n     secretary. But\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\n     taking hold of the government and giving it direction is a \n     difficult task.\n       Sen. Glenn's study suggests that the entire appointment and \n     confirmation process could use radical streamlining--people \n     will serve in their posts longer if they get there faster. \n     The relationship between civil servants and political \n     appointees also needs fixing. With this kind of turnover, top \n     civil servants have to spend an inordinate amount of time \n     ``educating'' political appointees about their jobs. Yet the \n     United States has tended to reject the British model of \n     having a shallow layer of political appointees on top of a \n     large mandarin blass. But if we don't like the British model, \n     how can we make the one we have created work better? Sen. \n     Glenn deserves some answers.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. It goes into some of these things about the high turnover \nrate that we have of these appointees that come in. I think that is \nalmost scandalous in the turnover rate.\n  Since I mentioned this a moment ago, we have had a chance to look up \nthe figures here. Back in May of 1994, I had hearings on this subject. \nWe looked into what had happened over the past decade. In fact it \ncovered an 11-year period, back through the Reagan and Bush years. I am \nnot pointing it out just politically, because I think the same kinds of \nfigures apply, maybe slightly reduced, in the Clinton years so far, \nalso.\n  At that time, over that 11-year period, during the Reagan and Bush \nyears, 30 percent of political appointees had left the Government \nwithin 18 months of their appointment. Almost one-third of the people \ndid not even stay beyond 18 months after being politically appointed. \nAnd 50 percent--this was the average for that 11-year period--50 \npercent of the political appointees were out of Government 27 months \nafter their appointment.\n  You know, a person comes in here and it takes them a little while to \nfind out where the washroom is and who they write to and hiring their \nsecretary and one thing or another, so the first 2 or 3 months they are \nhere they are not as productive as they should be. And once they decide \nthey are going to leave, they are out there and they are short-timers, \nas we used to say in the service. Because they are short-timers and you \ncannot expect anything out of them, so do not give them anything real \nto do. So, take that 6 months out of the service; 30 percent are gone \nafter 18 months, you get 1 year out of these people and you cannot \nexpect the President's appointees, whether it is Reagan, Bush or \nanybody else, to do a good job in implementing their policies if their \npolitical appointees are going to turn over in that fast a period of \ntime.\n  I don't have complete, up-to-date, current figures that compare with \nthose. I think it has improved a little bit, but I think it is still \none of the major problems we face in administering Government, is \ngetting these political appointees, not just reducing their overall \nnumbers, but getting them to come in and stay long enough to do the job \nfor which they were appointed to do. I just wanted to get those figures \nin the Record.\n  I gave all my reasons for opposing this before. I would feel much \nbetter if we had hearings and detailed the exact effect of this thing. \nI urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, very briefly, again I salute the Senator \nfrom Ohio for his knowledge in this area. It is extensive and a great \ncontribution to Government efficiency.\n  I want to be clear. The great growth in this area did not occur under \nPresident Clinton. I am, of course, a Democrat supporting his \nreelection, and I am in no way pointing my finger at this \nadministration. The facts don't show that at all. This has been a \ngradual process over the years which both parties participated in. I \nwant to be clear about that.\n  I also want to point out, because I was very appreciative of the \nfigures just placed in the Record, yes, there is a high turnover rate. \nThis is something I mentioned in my remarks.\n  I will add, I gave a number of reasons why I didn't think we had a \nharsh provision. That turnover rate means it is going to be very easy, \ncomparatively speaking, for the President to deal with this. If that is \nthe turnover rate during the course of the next year, a lot of those \nfolks who turn over won't have to be replaced. In other words, we're \nnot talking here about mass firings; we are talking about not \nreplacing, in many cases, those who have simply chosen to leave after a \nbrief tenure.\n  Mr. President, if it is consistent with the managers' wishes, I now \nintend to move to table.\n  Mr. President, I now move to table that portion of the committee \namendment beginning on page 129, line 20 through line 18 on page 130.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the committee amendment beginning on page 129, line 20 \nthrough page 130, line 18. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``nay''.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is \nabsent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the excepted \ncommittee amendment.\n  The excepted committee amendment on page 129, line 20 through page \n130, line 18 was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee amendment with the second-degree \namendment from Senator Kassebaum.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Kassebaum \namendment temporarily be laid aside.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to object at this time, I object.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from New Jersey has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is the question, then, the matter of \nfinishing amendments or some other procedural thing that has to be \nattended to?\n  Otherwise, Mr. President, I have been waiting here for about 2 hours.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I respond to the Senator from New Jersey that I have a\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\ncouple of things. I would like to adopt the committee amendment, the \nmotion failed to table a few minutes ago, and I would like to move to \nreconsider the vote. I have a unanimous-consent to modify an amendment. \nIt will take 2 minutes at the most.\n  Senator Specter also has been trying to speak.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have been waiting for recognition. I ask unanimous \nconsent to permit the manager to dispose of the committee business with \nthe right to regain the floor after the manager has disposed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I worked it out with the \nmanager 5 minutes to speak after he finished the business matters. If I \ncould be incorporated in that, I shall not be long. I would not raise \nan objection. I worked it out with the manager.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that \nrecognition is given based on the request from the floor. Now, I do not \nwant to get stuck on this too much but I have been waiting a long time. \nI would indulge the Senator from Pennsylvania if I have an assurance \nthat it would be no more than 5 minutes of time that he would occupy.\n  I would be happy to modify my unanimous-consent agreement if that is \nthe understanding we can get.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is what I understand.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the manager have the opportunity to clear up committee business, \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania be recognized for not more than 5 \nminutes, and that I then regain the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nKassebaum amendment temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5273, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask that a modification be made to \namendment No. 5273, which was previously adopted. This has been cleared \nby the ranking member, Senator Kerrey. I send the modification to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5273), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V of the bill, insert the following new \n     sections:\n\n     SEC. 5____.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers and my \ncolleague from New Jersey for a brief opportunity to comment about a \ntrip which I made to Saudi Arabia, to Dhahran on August 25 and Riyadh \non August 26, and a report made by the staff of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, the Khobar Towers at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, was the \nscene of a tragic terrorist attack killing 19 Americans and wounding \nhundreds of other Americans. There has been a suggestion made that \nthere was an intelligence failure leading to that attack. In my \ncapacity as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the committee has \nmade an exhaustive study of this subject, and I made a personal visit \nto Saudi Arabia, to Dhahran on August 25 and Riyadh on August 26, and \nmy personal conclusion, backed up by the staff report, was that there \nwas no intelligence failure.\n  In fact, in the preceding year, there had been more than 100 \nintelligence reports on alerts of a general nature, and very specific \nreports on an alert to the danger of a car bomb at Khobar Towers. That \nwas the essence of a report by the Office of Special Investigations of \nthe U.S. Air Force in January 1996. There had been previous reports \nabout terrorist attacks at Khobar Towers--the same report about a car \nbombing, which, in fact, did take place in Riyadh on November 13, 1995, \nclaiming the lives of five Americans; the State Department alert on \nJune 13, just 12 days before the terrorist attack; and a report by the \nDefense Intelligence Agency on June 17, just 8 days before the attack, \nwhich emphasized the vulnerability of the area and the necessity for \nincreased security. Specifically, what the DIA report said about Khobar \nTowers, with a large picture, was, ``A pattern appears to be developing \nthat warrants improved security efforts.''\n  Notwithstanding these warnings, improved security efforts were not \nundertaken by the Pentagon, by ranking military-civilian DOD \nauthorities.\n  I visited the scene, Mr. President, and was amazed to see how close \nthat fence was to those towers--less than 60 feet away, which was an \nopen and notorious invitation to terrorism. For anybody to say, on the \nbasis of this record, on the basis of what I have personally observed, \nand on the basis of a staff report by the Intelligence Committee, that \nthere was intelligence failure is, simply stated, preposterous. It was \nobvious that that fence had to be moved back. That issue has been \nraised in hearings before the Senate oversight committees and has not \nyet been answered by top officials in the Pentagon.\n  Requests have been made for the oversight committees to be informed \nabout what military personnel made what request of Saudi officials and \nwhat the responses of those Saudi officials were, and no information \nhas been provided to the oversight committees. The Intelligence \nCommittee asked ranking DOD officials what the obligation was to report \nup the chain of command any failure by Saudi officials to move the \nfence back, and that has not been done.\n  But on the face of this record, Mr. President, it is plain that there \nhas not been a failure of intelligence on the terrorist attack at \nKhobar Towers on June 25, 1996.\n  The United States Code requires that the oversight Intelligence \nCommittee be informed of significant intelligence failures. My \nconclusion is that there was no such intelligence failure, but, in \nfact, there was a failure of DOD officials to follow up on a well-known \nand obvious terrorist threat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the report by the staff \nof the Intelligence Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       In the wake of the June 25, 1996, deadly bombing at the \n     Khobar Towers housing complex Saudi Arabia, the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence staff undertook an inquiry to \n     determine the adequacy of the intelligence concerning the \n     terrorist threat situation in Saudi Arabia. The Committee \n     staff reviewed the collection posture, the analytical \n     products available and the dissemination of threat \n     information.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       The Khobar Towers tragedy was not the result of an \n     intelligence failure.\n     Threat level\n       Intelligence regarding the terrorist threat in Saudi Arabia \n     was sufficient to prompt the Defense Intelligence Agency \n     (DIA), in July 1995, to raise the Terrorist Threat Level for \n     Saudi Arabia From Low to Medium.\n       Reporting from enhanced intelligence efforts following the \n     November 13, 1995 bombing of the Office of the Program \n     Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard (OPM-SANG), in which 5 \n     Americans were killed by a car bomb, prompted DIA to raise \n     the Threat Level to High, where it stayed until the Khobar \n     Towers bombing.\n       The threat in Saudi Arabia is now considered Critical--the \n     highest Threat Level on the Department of Defense scale.\n     Collection\n       The U.S. intelligence Community in Saudi Arabia gave its \n     highest priority to the terrorist target and aggressively \n     collected against a range of internal and external threats \n     including Iran, Hizballah, and others.\n     Analysis\n       From April 1995 through the time of the Khobar Towers \n     bombing in June 1996 the intelligence analytic community \n     published\n\n[[Page S10375]]\n\n     more than 100 products on the topic of terrorism on the \n     Arabian peninsula. Among these were several Counter Terrorism \n     Center Threat Assessments and DIA Threat indicators.\n       Among the most significant analytical products were the \n     June 13, 1996 Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and \n     Research report and the June 17, 1996 Military Intelligence \n     Digest article outlining numerous suspicious incidents that \n     had occurred at Khobar Towers, which noted that ``a pattern \n     appears to be developing that warrants improved security \n     efforts.''\n       The above warnings incorporated intelligence such as (1) \n     ongoing Iranian and radical Islamic fundamentalist groups' \n     attempts to target American servicemen in Saudi Arabia for \n     terrorist acts; (2) the heightened threat that accompanied \n     the execution, carried out on May 31, of the four suspects in \n     the November OPM-SANG attack; and (3) well before the Khobar \n     attack, there was reporting that Khobar might be the target \n     of a bombing attempt.\n     Vulnerability assessments\n       The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) \n     conducted a vulnerability assessment of the Khobar Towers \n     facility and published its findings in January 1996.\n       This AFOSI assessment highlighted various weakness that \n     could be exploited by terrorists, but emphasized the \n     particular vulnerability of perimeter security given the \n     proximity of the outside fence to many of the buildings as \n     well as the lack of the protective coating Mylar on the \n     windows of the Khobar Towers compound where Americans were \n     housed.\n       In fact, this weakness had already come to the attention of \n     the base security personnel, who approached the Saudis with a \n     request to move the perimeter 10 feet back. The request to \n     move the fence, made initially in November 1995, was still \n     pending in June 1996, but successive base commanders did not \n     push hard enough for a meaningful movement of the fence for \n     fear of offending host country sensibilities.\n       The recommendation concerning Mylar was made part of a \n     ``five-year plan'' for security enhancements on the compound \n     and thus had been delayed indefinitely at the time of the \n     June 25 attack.\n     Dissemination\n       Analytical products, threat and vulnerability assessments, \n     and valuable raw intelligence were readily available to \n     senior military commanders in Saudi Arabia and their civilian \n     counterparts at the Pentagon.\n       Among the most significant were monthly briefings prepared \n     and presented in Saudi Arabia beginning in April 1995 that \n     informed senior military commanders of the three most \n     vulnerable U.S. installations in Saudi Arabia; of the three, \n     two have been attacked (OPM-SANG and Khobar Towers) and the \n     third (the PX Commissary in Riyadh) has been closed.\n\n  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Staff Report on the Khobar \n                        Towers Terrorist Attack\n\n\n                   scope, objectives, and methodology\n\n       The Staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \n     has conducted a preliminary inquiry into the United States \n     Intelligence Community's collection, analysis and \n     dissemination of intelligence concerning terrorist threats in \n     Saudi Arabia prior to the June 25, 1996, bombing at the \n     Khobar Towers housing complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The \n     Committee staff reviewed raw and finished intelligence \n     produced from late 1994 through June 1996. These products \n     include reports from the Central Intelligence Agency, the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, \n     the State Department and others. The staff also interviewed \n     individuals in the Intelligence Community, the Defense \n     Department, and the State Department and accompanied the \n     Chairman of the Committee, Senator Arlen Specter, on a trip \n     to Dhahran, Riyadh, and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and other Middle \n     East countries from August 24-29, 1996.\n       During and immediately following the visit to Saudi Arabia \n     and the Middle East, Committee staff interviewed field \n     commanders and military personnel who played a critical force \n     protection and security role just prior to and immediately \n     after the blast. The staff also interviewed the FBI lead \n     investigator on the scene in Dhahran, as well as top ranking \n     Intelligence Community personnel. Finally, the staff \n     accompanied Senator Specter to meetings with Saudi Crown \n     Prince Abdullah and Defense Minister Sultan while in Jeddah, \n     as well as other Middle East leaders with unique insight into \n     terrorist activity in the region such as Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu of Israel, President Assad of Syria, and President \n     Arafat of the Palestinian Authority.\n       Since the Khobar blast, the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence has held seven hearings focusing on terrorism, \n     Saudi, Arbia, and support to the military in the region. The \n     Committee received testimony from Secretary of Defense \n     William J. Perry, CIA Director John Deutch, FBI Director \n     Louis Freeh, numerous other Administration officials, \n     academicians and other experts.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       On June 25, 1996, at approximately 10:00 p.m. local time, a \n     massive explosion shook the Khobar Towers housing compound in \n     Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The blast killed 19 American military \n     service personnel and at least one Saudi civilian, wounded \n     more than 200 Americans and injured hundreds of other \n     civilians. At the time, the Khobar Towers complex was home \n     for the airmen of the U.S. Air Force's 4404th Fighter Wing \n     (Provisional) under the operational command the U.S. Central \n     Command (USCENTCOM). The complex also housed forces from the \n     United Kingdom, France, and Saudi Arabia participating in the \n     United Nations effort to enforce the ``no-fly'' zone in \n     southern Iraq.\n       Before the explosion, American personnel at an observation \n     post on the roof of Building 131 at the northeast corner of \n     the Khobar complex reported seeing a fuel truck and a car \n     approach the northwest end of the Khobar Towers compound from \n     the north and turn east onto 31st Street just outside the \n     perimeter fence separating the compound from a public parking \n     lot. The truck and the car that it was following traveled \n     along the perimeter fence toward the northeast corner of the \n     compound and then stopped. A car already in place and facing \n     the two approaching vehicles flashed its lights, presumably \n     to signal to them that their approach was ``all clear.'' The \n     two companion vehicles then continued to travel along the \n     perimeter fence. When the vehicles reached a point adjacent \n     to Building 131, they turned left pointing away from the \n     building, and stopped. The fuel truck backed into the hedges \n     along the perimeter fence directly in front of Building 131 \n     as the third car idled and then departed. Two men exited from \n     the truck and hurried into the remaining car, which then sped \n     away.\n       Noting this suspicious activity, the U.S. personnel at the \n     Building 131 observation post began an evacuation, but within \n     three to four minutes the bomb exploded, completely \n     demolishing the front facade of this eight-story building. \n     The explosion severely damaged five adjacent buildings and \n     blew out windows throughout the compound. According to a \n     recent report by the House National Security Committee, the \n     size of the blast indicates that the truck carried between \n     3,000 and 5,000 pounds of explosives. In addition to the \n     American causalities, hundreds of Saudi and third country \n     nationals living in the complex and immediate vicinity were \n     also wounded. U.S. intelligence experts and 4404th Wing \n     leaders have concluded that Americans were the target of the \n     terrorist attack.\n       The attack at Khobar Towers was the second major terrorist \n     incident directed at U.S. interests, and U.S. military \n     presence specifically, in Saudi Arabia in the past year. On \n     November 13, 1995, a car bomb containing approximately 250 \n     pounds of explosives detonated outside the headquarters of \n     the Office of the Program Manager of the Saudi Arabian \n     National Guard (OPM-SANG) in Riyadh. The building was used \n     by American military forces as a training facility for \n     Saudi military personnel. Five Americans died and 34 were \n     wounded in this attack. Prior to this incident DIA \n     categorized the threat to Americans in Saudi Arabia as \n     medium. Six weeks after this incident, that threat level \n     was raised to high.\n\n\n                        adequacy of intelligence\n\n     Collection\n       Pursuant to Presidential Decision Directive 35 (PDD-35), \n     terrorism targets in the Middle East are Tier 1 targets and \n     receive the highest priority for collection. Thus, current \n     Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch has placed from \n     the beginning of his tenure the utmost urgency on collection \n     against these targets.\n       Even prior to the issuance of PDD-35, however, the U.S. \n     intelligence collection posture in Saudi Arabia had shifted \n     focus. In late 1994, the U.S. Intelligence Community in Saudi \n     Arabia began reporting an increase in threatening activity \n     directed against Americans in the region. Much of this \n     heightened activity was carried out by agents of Iran, either \n     alone or in cooperation with elements of regional radical \n     Islamic fundamentalists. During a visit to Saudi Arabia in \n     December 1994, DCI James Woolsey raised with senior Saudi \n     officials the CIA concern over Iranian intentions and \n     activities in the region.\n       Upon his confirmation in May 1995, Deutch concentrated \n     immediately upon the issue of antiterrorism and force \n     protection as a top priority. Deutch visited Saudi Arabia on \n     October 22, 1995, and raised with senior Saudi officials his \n     ``serious concerns'' over Iranian intentions in the region as \n     he emphasized the commitment of the United States to fighting \n     the terrorist threat. Deutch also dispatched other senior CIA \n     officials to Saudi Arabia for detailed discussions of how to \n     address this problem. Intelligence was focused during this \n     period on Iranian operatives in the Eastern Province who were \n     attempting to gather intelligence on the Dhahran Air Base.\n       After the OPM-SANG attack on November 13, 1995, collection \n     against terrorist targets in general intensified. \n     Intelligence Community personnel interviewed in Saudi Arabia \n     said that almost all of their time was devoted to \n     counterterrorism and force protection issues and much of this \n     work was driven by the requirements of the military \n     commanders in the theater.\n     Analysis\n       By March 1995, the Intelligence Community had determined \n     that Iranian operations in Saudi Arabia were no longer simply \n     intelligence gathering activities but contained the potential \n     for the execution of terrorist acts. It had been previously \n     learned that weapons and explosives had been moved in and \n     stored in apparent support of these acts.\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\n       From the period beginning in April 1995 through the time of \n     the Khobar Towers bombing in June 1996, the Intelligence \n     Community issued finished analysis that clearly highlighted \n     the ongoing and increasing terrorist threat in Saudi Arabia. \n     The CIA and DCI's Counter Terrorism Center (CTC) issued at \n     least 41 different reports on terrorism on the Arabian \n     peninsula. Ten of these were specific threat assessments and \n     six were CTC commentaries focused on the threat to U.S. \n     personnel in Saudi Arabia.\n       During the same period, the Defense Intelligence Agency \n     produced more than 60 intelligence products on the terrorist \n     threat in Saudi Arabia. Many of these were factual in nature, \n     reporting on terrorist incidents such as the OPM-SANG \n     bombing, but many others reflected the Intelligence \n     Community's analytical judgment of higher threat levels. In \n     July 1995, DIA raised the terrorist threat level for Saudi \n     Arabia from Low to Medium. After the OPM-SANG attack, the \n     threat level was raised again to High where it stayed until \n     the Khobar Towers bombing. The threat in Saudi Arabia is now \n     considered Critical--the highest threat level on the DIA \n     scale. Perhaps the most significant single DIA analytical \n     product was a June 17, 1996 Military Intelligence Digest \n     article outlining numerous suspicious incidents that had \n     occurred at Khobar Towers and noting that ``a pattern appears \n     to be developing that warrants improved security efforts.'' \n     This report followed only four days after the Department of \n     State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research published ``Saudi \n     Arabia/Terrorism: US Targets?'' focusing attention on the \n     same series of incidents occurring at the Khobar facility.\n       Some officials prior to June 25 bombing believed that the \n     earlier events and planning for terrorist acts were actually \n     leading up to a larger bombing campaign against U.S. forces \n     in the Eastern province. These officials postulated after the \n     June 25 attack that Khobar Towers was the likely end-game of \n     the earlier bombing scheme.\n     Dissemination\n       The emphasis that the DCIs placed on providing intelligence \n     for force protection was reflected by the U.S. intelligence \n     officers in the field as well. As early as January 1995 \n     intelligence officers briefed the commander of Joint Task \n     Force/SouthWest Asia (JTF/SWA) and the commander of the Air \n     Base in Dhahran of the serious threat posed to U.S. forces in \n     the Eastern province.\n       These briefings continued throughout 1995. The incoming \n     JTF/SWA commander, Major General Franklin, and his Deputy, \n     Admiral Irwin, were briefed on March 16, 1995 along with \n     General Keck, Commander of the 4404th Air Wing, on the most \n     recent intelligence.\\1\\ Follow up briefings were ordered for \n     JTF/SWA command and security personnel to alert them to the \n     threat. By April 5, 1995, all senior military commanders in \n     the region had received detailed briefings on the threat \n     posed by the increased Iranian presence and activity in the \n     area.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On April 20, 1995 the senior U.S. intelligence official in \n     Saudi Arabia briefed the top military commanders in the \n     region on the Iranian plotting against U.S. military \n     personnel in Saudi Arabia. Discussions were held on actions \n     to be taken to beef up security awareness at various \n     installations throughout Saudi Arabia where a U.S. military \n     presence existed. The intelligence official provided his \n     assessments on the ``softest targets'' in the kingdom (OPM-\n     SANG, Khobar Towers, and the PX-Commissary in Riyadh).\\2\\ A \n     decision was then made to brief all military commanders in \n     the region on a more regular basis on the serious terrorist \n     threat to U.S. military personnel in the region. The \n     military, based upon these threats, sent out a general threat \n     advisory to remain in effect through June 15, 1996. The plan \n     was apparently to supplement this general threat notice with \n     the regular briefings.\n       On April 30, 1995, the briefings were expanded to include \n     the ``working level'' commanders in the various units in \n     Saudi Arabia. As part of these briefings, Major General \n     Franklin put out an advisory to senior military commanders \n     including the following: ``Our facilities and access \n     procedures should be reexamined to ensure we are doing the \n     necessary things to minimize unauthorized individuals or \n     vehicles from entering our compounds. Of special concern are \n     unattended vehicles parked near entrances and exits or close \n     to our work and living areas.''\n       At the same time Major General Boice, Commander of the U.S. \n     Military Training Mission increased the threat posture for \n     the troops under his command from ``no security threat'' to \n     ``threat alpha.'' On June 25, 1995 Security officers from \n     across the Kingdom held the first monthly (and later weekly, \n     after OPM-SANG) counter-intelligence/force protection \n     meeting.\n       In sum, prior to the OPM-SANG bombing there was extensive \n     information available to U.S. personnel in Saudi Arabia \n     concerning the nature of the threat posed by Iranian and \n     other terrorist groups. After the OPM-SANG bombing, more \n     specific intelligence threat information became available. \n     Notable among these are:\n       Well before the Khobar attack, there was reporting that \n     Khobar might be the target of a bombing attempt; there were a \n     variety of reports in 1996 indicating that large quantities \n     of explosive had been smuggled into the Eastern province of \n     Saudi Arabia; threats from associates of those Saudi \n     dissidents beheaded by the Saudi government on May 31, 1996 \n     for their alleged role in the November 13, 1995 bombing of \n     OPM-SANG; \\3\\ a Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence \n     and Research report on June 13, 1996 focusing attention on \n     a series of incidents around the Khobar facility; and a \n     June 17, 1996 Pentagon intelligence report highlighting \n     the same incidents at Khobar Towers concluding that a \n     suspicious ``pattern [of surveillance of the Khobar \n     compound's perimeter and other similar incidents] seems to \n     be developing that warrants improved security efforts;''\n       In addition, military commanders in the region were very \n     familiar with the terrorism vulnerability assessment of the \n     Khobar Towers compound conducted by the Air Force Office of \n     Special Investigations (OSI) in January 1996. Included within \n     the OSI vulnerability assessment is a ``threat scenario,'' \n     based upon a State Department threat warning system, that \n     included: ``an assessment that a `park and abandon' car bomb \n     was a threat to the compound's security, and an additional \n     assessment that moving back the perimeter fence would lessen \n     the damage that would result from a `park and abandon' car \n     bomb; \\4\\ a recommendation for the additional security \n     measure of Mylar protective coating on the compound's windows \n     to avoid shattering and fragmentation of glass; the Air Force \n     made this recommendation part of a 5-year plan and thus \n     delayed the addition of Mylar indefinitely.'' \\5\\\n       This intelligence and the vulnerability assessments were \n     combined in three separate but related series of meetings. \n     First, a monthly force protection meeting was convened, co-\n     chaired by the Defense Attache and senior intelligence \n     officer. These force protection meetings were made more \n     frequent (once a week) following the OPM-SANG bombing. \n     Second, regular political-military meetings were held at the \n     U.S. Embassy, at which the threat intelligence and \n     vulnerability assessments were discussed. Third, after the \n     OPM-SANG bombing an Emergency Action Committee composed of \n     the most senior military and intelligence officials in the \n     region met regularly and discussed threat intelligence and \n     vulnerability information as the major topic at each meeting.\n       As discussed above, senior military commanders in the \n     region were fully briefed on the vulnerability and \n     intelligence threat information. Further, General \n     Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was \n     briefed at length on all intelligence and vulnerability \n     assessments by the senior intelligence officer in Saudi \n     Arabia in May 1996. This officer referred to his briefing of \n     General Shalikashvili as ``intense and to the point'' \n     concerning the threat and vulnerability information. Also, \n     senior military commanders in the regions were quite familiar \n     with the Long Commission Report of the Beirut bombing in \n     1983, which destroyed the U.S. Marine barracks, killing 241 \n     Marines.\\6\\\n\n\n                 there was not an intelligence failure\n\n       Section 502 of the National Security Act of 1947 makes it \n     incumbent upon the Director of Central Intelligence, as well \n     as the heads of all departments, agencies, and other entities \n     of the United States Government involved in intelligence \n     activities to: ``* * * keep the intelligence committees \n     [House and Senate] fully and currently informed of all \n     intelligence activities. . . . including any . . . \n     significant intelligence failure''; 50 United States Code \n     Sec. 413a*(1)(italic added).\n       The totality of the threat information available to the \n     Department of Defense, as well as the posture of the \n     Intelligence Community at the time of the Khobar Towers \n     bombing makes clear that an intelligence failure, either in \n     collection, dissemination or analysis, did not occur. \n     Military commanders in the region and in Washington received \n     highly relevant threat information for a year and a half \n     prior to the Khobar Towers bombing. Intelligence personnel in \n     the region briefed this information exhaustively throughout \n     the region, and the DCI Counterterrorism Center ensured that \n     senior policymakers in Washington were made aware of the \n     threat and vulnerability information.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Regarding the question of the adequacy of the collection, \n     analysis and dissemination of intelligence concerning \n     terrorist threats in Saudi Arabia to Defense Department \n     officials in Washington and military commanders in the field \n     prior to the June 25, 1996, bombing at the Khobar Towers \n     housing complex, the available information leads the \n     Committee staff to conclude that the U.S. Intelligence \n     Community provided sufficient information not only to suggest \n     active terrorist targeting of U.S. personnel and facilities, \n     but also to predict probable terrorist targets. Further, \n     having concluded that the DCI was fully cognizant of and \n     attentive to the force protection issues in the Eastern \n     Province prior to the June 25 attack, and that consecutive \n     DCIs ensured that this force protection information was \n     disseminated to proper Defense Department recipients, the \n     Committee staff concludes that an intelligence failure did \n     not occur. Therefore, the Director of Central Intelligence is \n     not obligated to report a significant intelligence failure to \n     the intelligence oversight committees pursuant to Section \n     502(1) of the National Security Act of 1947.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ An April 3, 1995, a U.S. intelligence cable noted that \n     ``U.S. military commanders here are very/very concerned about \n     the Iranian efforts in Saudi Arabia.''\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\n     \\2\\ After this briefing, the Commander of OPM-SANG, General \n     Nash, approached the same intelligence official to express \n     concern for physical security at the OPM-SANG facility and to \n     specifically ask the official to pass along his concern to \n     U.S. and Saudi intelligence and security officials, which he \n     did.\n     \\3\\ Between May 31 (the date of the execution of the alleged \n     OPM-SANG co-conspirators) and the date of the Khobar bombing \n     on June 25, a primary focus of intelligence was on the threat \n     of associates of the executed individuals seeking revenge \n     against U.S. persons.\n     \\4\\ Senator Specter and staff found the distance to be \n     slightly less than 60 feet from the perimeter fence to the \n     front of Building 131. This is significant because (a) the \n     Defense Department had previously placed the distance at 80 \n     feet; (b) according to the House National Security Committee \n     in a recent study, the AFOSI report makes clear that targets \n     closest to perimeter most vulnerable; and (c) the AFOSI \n     report concluded that ``every effort should be made to \n     maximize the distance between a given structure and a \n     potential threat.'' It is also significant because the \n     military commanders apparently never asked the Saudis to move \n     the fence back 400 feet, as DoD had previously claimed. The \n     request was instead to move the fence back 10 feet, which the \n     Saudis quite correctly deemed a purely cosmetic and de \n     minimus action and did not take seriously.\n     \\5\\ Accordingly to tests conducted by military experts since \n     the Khobar attack, even if a bomb the size of OPM-SANG had \n     been used (250 pounds) rather than the 3000-5000 pound device \n     that a House National Security Committee report said was used \n     at Khobar Towers, there would still have been 12 fatalities \n     because the glass on the windows of Building 131 were not \n     treated with Mylar to prevent shattering (as had been \n     recommended by the OSI report).\n     \\6\\ The Secretary of Defense has recently testified that the \n     military was not prepared for a bomb the size of the Khobar \n     device because an explosive that large was unheard of in the \n     region. This testimony is inconsistent with the fact that the \n     U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut was destroyed by a 12,000 \n     pound bomb in 1983, killing 241 U.S. Marines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10374-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10377-S10379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will proceed as planned. We will \nwait for the manager to be represented here.\n  This amendment, very simply, would establish a policy of zero \ntolerance when it comes to guns and domestic violence. The amendment \nwould prohibit any person convicted of domestic violence from \npossessing a firearm. In the simplest words, the amendment says that a \nspouse abuser, wife beater, or child abuser should not have a gun.\n  Mr. President, the amendment probably sounds familiar. In fact, the \nSenate adopted this exact proposal as an amendment to the antistalking \nbill in late July. Unfortunately, when it got to the House of \nRepresentatives they, despite a commitment of support, let it be known \nthat they will not let this ``no guns for domestic abuser'' amendment \nsurvive. They will not act on the antistalking bill, and there is no \nindication that they intended to do so at any time soon. Since the \nstalking bill may not become law, we, therefore, need to pursue another \nvehicle that has a realistic chance of being enacted, and this is one \nof the few such vehicles remaining.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment ought not to be controversial. As I \nsaid, it passed unanimously before as an amendment to the stalking \nbill. That happened only after Senators, like Senator Lott, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Craig, Senator Hutchison, and I, got together and \nreached an agreement on changes to my original proposal. The compromise \nthat we reached was acceptable to all involved, even if none of us was \nentirely happy. That is the way it usually has to be with any \ncompromise.\n  So, again, this amendment is identical to that proposal and should \nnot be controversial. I would also note that since the Senate approved \nthis proposal in July, both President Clinton and former Senator Bob \nDole have endorsed the concept of keeping guns from those convicted of \ndomestic violence. As a matter of fact, the spokesman for Senator Dole \nsaid, ``Bob Dole believes that all guns, not just handguns, should be \nkept out of the hands of domestic abusers.''\n  Mr. President, I couldn't put it better myself. Our colleague, \nSenator Hutchison, has also praised this proposal. This is what she had \nto say when the agreement was reached, and the amendment was passed \nalong with the stalking bill. She said: ``Because of Senator \nLautenberg's amendment, we are also going to be able to keep people who \nbatter their wives or people with whom they live from having handguns. \nSo I think this is going to be a great bill that will give women and \nchildren of this country some protection that they do not now have, and \nI am very pleased to be supportive of this compromise.''\n  Clearly, Mr. President, this amendment has strong bipartisan support. \nSo I am hopeful that it will again win easy approval. But I want to \ntake a few minutes to explain why it is so important.\n  Under current Federal law, it is illegal for persons convicted of \nfelonies to possess firearms. Yet, many people who engage in serious \nspousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of \nfelonies. At the end of the day, due to outdated laws or thinking, \nperhaps after a plea bargain, they are, at most, convicted of a \nmisdemeanor. In fact, most of those who commit family violence are \nnever even prosecuted. But when they are, one-\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\nthird of the cases that would be considered felonies, if committed by \nstrangers, are instead filed as misdemeanors. The fact is that in many \nplaces domestic violence is not taken as seriously as other forms of \nbrutal behavior. Often acts of serious spouse abuse are not even \nconsidered felonies.\n  In over 30 States, even today, beating your wife or your child is a \nmisdemeanor. In just the past few years, some judges have demonstrated \noutrageous callousness and disregard for women's lives. Right up the \nroad in Baltimore County, just 2 years ago a State circuit court judge \nwas hearing a case involving a man who shot his wife in the head and \nkilled her. As he handed down the light sentence, with time to be \nserved weekends only, and not a very long time at that, the judge \nsaid that the worst part of his job is, and I quote, ``Sentencing \nnoncriminals as criminals,'' as if shooting your wife in the head was \nnot criminal behavior.\n\n  Or take the case of a man who tracked down his wife, shot her five \ntimes in the face and killed her. The judge in that case gave the man a \nminimal sentence to be served on weekends. In explaining why he was \nbeing so lenient, the judge said the victim provoked her husband by not \ntelling him that she was leaving their abusive marriage.\n  These are just two examples of the way that our criminal justice \nsystem often treats domestic violence--not as a serious crime. Yet, the \nscope of the problem is enormous. Every year there are 2 million cases \nof domestic violence reported. Many of those cases are never finally \nresolved because the plaintiff withdraws the complaint, or it is \ndismissed casually. When women are killed in domestic disputes, \nhowever, the murderers are holding a gun about 65 percent of the time.\n  Put another way: Two-thirds of domestic violence murders involve \nfirearms. In 150,000 cases of abuse, spousal abuse, a gun is present. \nThat means that perhaps it is put to a woman's head or put to her face \nin front of a child, or children, and even though the trigger is not \npulled, the trauma is enormous. There is no reason for someone who \nbeats their wives or abuses their children to own a gun. When you \ncombine wife beaters and guns, the end result is more death.\n  This amendment would close this dangerous loophole and keep guns away \nfrom violent individuals who threaten their own families, people who \nhave shown that they cannot control themselves and are prone to fits of \nviolent rage directed, unbelievably enough, against their own loved \nones.\n  The amendment says: Abuse your wife, lose your gun; beat your child, \nlose your gun; assault your ex-wife, lose your gun; no ifs, ands, or \nbuts. It may sound like a tough policy, but when it comes to domestic \nviolence it is time to get tough. There is no margin of error when it \ncomes to domestic abuse and guns. A firearm in the hands of an abuser \nall too often means death. By their nature, acts of domestic violence \nare especially dangerous and require special attention.\n  These crimes involve people who have a history together, and perhaps \nshare a home or a child. These are not violent acts between strangers, \nand they do not arise from a chance meeting. Even after a split, the \nindividuals involved, often by necessity, have a continuing \nrelationship of some sort. The people who commit these crimes often \nhave a history of violence or threatening behavior, and, yet, \nfrequently they are permitted to possess firearms with no legal \nrestrictions.\n  The statistics and the data are clear. Domestic violence, no matter \nhow it is labeled, leads to more domestic violence, and guns in the \nhands of convicted wife beaters leads to death.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has been endorsed by over 30 \nprominent national organizations, including, by way of example, the \nNational Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Network to \nEnd Domestic Violence, the Family Violence Prevention Fund, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, and the YWCA of the United States.\n  The amendment would save the lives of many innocent Americans, but it \nwould also send a message about our Nation's commitment to ending \ndomestic violence and about our determination to protect the millions \nof women and children who suffer from this abuse.\n  Again, I do not expect this to be a controversial amendment since it \nhas already passed this body unanimously.\n  Once again, I will ask for the yeas and nays, but it is essential \nthat we have someone from the majority side in the Chamber. Otherwise, \nit is deemed unfair. But I think it is unfair not to have someone from \nthe majority side in the Chamber unless this is a subject that does not \nmatter, killing your wife, if you want to beat her up first.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It was a very \ndisappointing experience we had when it went over to the House after \nbeing unanimously passed in this body and then casually dropped. But we \nwant to have everybody have a chance to vote on this, and once again, \nMr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on behalf \nof this amendment proposed by my colleague and good friend, Senator \nLautenberg from New Jersey, and I want to start out in a very direct \nway and say that from my experiences and the experiences of my wife, \nSheila, working in this area of domestic violence, I have learned that, \nall too often, the only difference between a battered woman and a dead \nwoman is the presence of a gun.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. The facts, unfortunately, \nspeak for themselves. If you work in the area of domestic abuse or if \nyou just pick up the newspaper in your own State, you will read stories \nabout violence, abuse, and murders within families and among intimates \nhappening all the time, and, colleagues, you will realize that in all \ntoo many cases the only difference between a battered woman and a dead \nwoman is the presence of a gun. That is what this amendment that my \ncolleague has introduced speaks to.\n  In the historic Violence Against Women Act that was enacted into law \nas a part of the 1994 crime bill, thanks to the tireless efforts of \nSenator Biden and Senator Hatch, there was a provision which was \naccepted--eventually and after much negotiation--that I offered in the \nSenate and Representative Torricelli, and Representative Schroeder \nsponsored in the House. This provision prohibits anyone who has a \nrestraining order issued against them from owning or possessing a gun, \nand it also prohibits anyone from selling or giving a gun to someone \nthey know has a restraining order against them for having abused their \nspouse or their child.\n  This was a severely modified and much weaker version of what was \noriginally known as the Domestic Violence Firearm Prevention Act, a \nbill that I introduced. Senator Lautenberg now takes the next logical \nstep with this very important piece of legislation, which would \nprohibit the possession of a firearm by someone who has been convicted \nof an act of domestic violence.\n  I imagine my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, went through all the \nstatistics. Let me just simply state, again, that: Four women a day are \nkilled at the hands of their batterer; every 15 seconds a woman is \nbattered in our country. The leading single cause of injury among women \nin America today is violence in the home. It is just unconscionable.\n  The good news--and it really is, I think, good news--is that no \nlonger in our country, no longer in our States, and no longer in our \ncommunities are we saying that this violence in the home is not our \nbusiness, no longer do we just turn our gaze away from it without doing \nanything about it. I think we have finally realized that this violence \nin homes, all too often directed at women and their children, is\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\nreally everybody's business. If we do not stop the violence in the \nhomes, it is going to continue to spill out into the streets and into \nour communities.\n  The problem which Senator Lautenberg speaks to with this amendment, \nof which I am so proud to be an original cosponsor, is as follows: In \nall too many cases, unfortunately, if you beat up or batter your \nneighbor's wife, it is a felony. If you beat up or batter, brutalize \nyour own wife or your own child, it is a misdemeanor.\n  If the offense is a misdemeanor, then under the current law there is \na huge loophole. We do not let people who have been convicted of a \nfelony purchase that firearm. What the Senator from New Jersey is \ntrying to do is plug this loophole and prohibit someone convicted of \ndomestic abuse, whether felony or misdemeanor, of purchasing a firearm. \nFor example, in my State of Minnesota, an act of domestic violence is \nnot characterized as a felony unless there is permanent physical \nimpairment, the use of a weapon, or broken bones.\n  I just want to simply say one more time to colleagues, because I can \nrattle off all the statistics, this is no small issue in our country. \nWe are talking about significant violence. For any Senator who says \nthat we do not want to prohibit any law-abiding citizen from purchasing \na gun, I respond that we are not talking about law-abiding citizens. We \nare talking about citizens who have been convicted of an act of \nviolence against a spouse or child and we are saying in those cases, \nthe law should prohibit that person from purchasing gun, from owning a \ngun. Once again, the reason we support this law is because we know that \nin all too many cases, the only difference between a battered woman and \na dead woman is the presence of a gun.\n  Mr. President, for a period of time I was coming to the floor to \nannounce the domestic violence hotline number which was set up under a \nprovision of the Violence Against Women Act. Since its opening on \nFebruary 21, 1996, the hotline has received over 30,000 calls for help \nfrom residents in 50 States and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, \nand the Virgin Islands. Let me announce that one more time. The hotline \nhas received since February 21, 30,000 calls for help from 50 States, \nthe District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. I \nwant to announce the number one more time. The number is 1-800-799-\nSAFE.\n  We in the U.S. Senate, by adopting this amendment, will be saying \nthree things. We will be saying we will not tolerate this violence; we \nwill not ignore this violence; and we will no longer say that it is \nsomeone else's responsibility. All of us have a chance to make a \ndifference.\n  My fellow Senators, someone's safety depends on your vote. My fellow \nSenators, someone's safety depends on your vote. That is usually the \nsafety of a woman and a child. There is no more important vote than the \none that is coming up on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota \nfor his eloquent reminder about what it is we are considering here. The \nstatistics, the data do not have to be reiterated. It is very clear. \nThe underlying problem is, in this country of ours, that domestic \nviolence, no matter how severe the beating, is often dismissed as a \nsquabble.\n  I have heard reports of judges saying, ``Oh, he didn't really mean \nit. He didn't intend to hurt you. Can't you go home and settle it \nbetween you?'' And very often, of the cases reported, there is so much \ntrauma attached to the recipient of the abuse that she--typically it is \na she--is afraid to pursue the case any further because, along with the \ncontinuing relationships, inevitably are the threats of further \ndisassociation, which, in many cases, could mean the end of income, \nsupport, mean the end of some reassurance that there is a roof over \ntheir heads. So they sell their souls. They quit when, if they knew \nthat the State cared more about it, they would continue to pursue it.\n  The other thing is, they are afraid that the guy, the fellow who \nfirst treated them to a fist in the face, may come home with a gun and \ntake their lives.\n  One can only imagine what kind of rage exists within a man who would \nbeat up a woman, and often in front of the children they have. It is an \noutrageous condition that exists. And this country has not yet taken it \nseriously enough.\n  We hope this amendment will send a loud and clear message that you \nare not going to get away with this kind of thing, because we are going \nto take away your gun. We are going to take away that extra chance that \nthe woman might be killed.\n  You heard it from my friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, the \nSenator from Minnesota: Four women a day will lose their lives. I can \ntell you this, from the research that we have done, that is a very \nconservative estimate. The data are not good in that situation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. We are ready to vote. I \nurge the adoption of the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10377-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10379-S10382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUNS AND DOMESTIC ABUSE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nLautenberg amendment to the Treasury-postal appropriations bill, taking \nguns away from individuals convicted of domestic violence. I am a \ncosponsor of his original bill, and want to congratulate Senator \nLautenberg on offering this important legislation in the form of an \namendment today.\n  Just getting the gun out of the home would make the difference in so \nmany of these horrible stories we hear about domestic violence, in the \nnews, or from people on the street. I don't know how many people on the \nfloor of the Senate have heard the cries of a family in crisis; I don't \nknow if you have ever had to dial 911 out of worry for a neighbor. But, \nI have.\n  If this amendment makes a difference for one victim of domestic \nviolence, it will have done its job.\n  One woman I know told me the story of her abusive ex-husband. He was \nphysically abusive, and had been convicted of misdemeanors. What is \nmore, he knew he was prone to violence against his family, and did not \ntrust himself. He purposely separated the gun and the bullets at two \ndifferent ends of their house, so he would not be able to shoot her in \nthe heat of the moment.\n  But the measures he took were not quite enough, when he came home one \nnight, drunk, and yelling that the house wasn't clean enough for him. \nBecause he was able to find the bullets, find the gun, load it, and \npoint it at his wife. That she is alive today is a miracle.\n  This man was not the sort of law-abiding citizen we so frequently \nhear about from the NRA. He had a record. He did not even trust \nhimself. This man should not have had a gun.\n  If he did not have a gun, the man in the story may have used some \nother weapon. But we know from the research that nearly 65 percent of \nall murder victims known to have been killed by intimates were shot to \ndeath. We have seen that firearms-associated family and intimate \nassaults are 12 times more likely to be fatal than those not associated \nwith firearms. A California study showed when a domestic violence \nincident is fatal, 68 percent of the time the homicide was done with a \nfirearm.\n  Again, the gun is the key ingredient most likely to turn a domestic \nviolence incident into a homicide. But the people this amendment would \ntake guns away from--these people have already broken the law, and in a \nvery relevant way. In the face of the reality of domestic violence and \nthe role guns play in homicides in such situations, the Senate cannot \nallow convicted abusers to have guns.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment will not make life better for many \nwomen who are abused, even when guns are present in the home. We know \nthat most domestic violence is not even reported, and of the cases that \nare reported, many do not lead to a conviction. This is a problem \nassociated with the horrible effects of victimization, and has a \ndifferent set of solutions.\n  But, for thousands of women and men in this country, this amendment \nwould mean immediate results. To get the gun out of the home will mean \nthe difference between life and death. I urge the Senate to pass the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Lautenberg\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\namendment, because I believe it offer women a vital protection against \nthose who might do them harm.\n  Every year, an estimated 2 million women are victimized by domestic \nviolence.\n  Of these 2 million, nearly 6,000 die.\n  And 70 percent of the time, the perpetrators of the deadly violence \nuse a gun.\n  Mr. President, we already prohibit convicted felons from possessing a \nfirearm. But is an unfortunate fact that many domestic violence \noffenders are never convicted of a felony. Outdated or ineffective laws \noften treat domestic violence as a lesser offense.\n  Sometimes, victims are reluctant to cooperate for fear of more \nviolence.\n  And sometimes victims just don't want to pull themselves through the \nordeal of a trial.\n  And finally, plea bargains often result in misdemeanor convictions \nfor what are really felony crimes.\n  As a result, Mr. President, many perpetrators of severe and recurring \ndomestic violence are still permitted to posses a gun. Mr. President, \nthese people are like ticking time bombs. It is only a matter of time \nbefore the violence get out of hand, and the gun results in tragedy.\n  Something must be done to close this dangerous loophole.\n  This amendment looks to the type of crime, rather than the \nclassification of the conviction. Anyone convicted of a domestic \nviolence offense would be prohibited from possessing a firearm. Fewer \nabusers will have guns, and fewer of the abused will wake up each \nmorning wondering whether they will live through the day. I thank the \nSenator from New Jersey for his efforts, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs an amendment No. 5241.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Daschle and I have continued to confer, and a \nnumber of Senators have started asking about the plans for the night. I \nam looking at the list of amendments here. We still have a good number, \nsomewhere between 25 and 30 first-degree amendments, but only 2 or 3 of \nthem are relevant to this underlying bill.\n  Our intent is to keep working. The managers have been working, trying \nto get things agreed to. We have a couple of pending amendments we are \ntrying to get to an understanding on how to vote on them. We are acting \nin good faith.\n  As I look at this list, so many of these amendments, really, should \nnot be offered. We should go ahead and get this work done. We are in \nagreement now, the leadership on both sides of the aisle, that we are \ngoing to get it done tonight. We are going to keep working and dealing \nwith these amendments. We are going to keep voting until we get this \nbill completed. Then we will be able to advise Members when we get it \ndone tonight, we will have debate tomorrow but no votes.\n  We are now coming close to getting an understanding on what we can do \non Monday, with votes early Tuesday morning. Members can do what needs \nto be done, fulfill commitments and religious holidays, but to get that \ndone we must finish this bill tonight.\n  So, please, we should not offer these amendments that are not \nserious. We should the job done. Our intent is to keep going tonight.\n  We are honoring my colleague, Sonny Montgomery, after 30 years of \nservice in Congress. I will be there for 3 minutes to introduce him. \nOther than that, I would love to be here the rest of the night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I echo what the majority leader said. \nThere are many evenings where we arrive here at 2 or 3 o'clock in the \nmorning, and then we start to do the sorts of things that we could have \ndone at 5 o'clock in the evening.\n  We know what needs to be done. We have put out contacts to offices. \nThere are many amendments that we are prepared to accept, but we need \nMembers to come to the floor and offer the amendments up or notify us \nif they are willing to take the amendments down. Otherwise we will be \nhere until 2, 3, or 4 o'clock in the morning. We could wrap this thing \nup quickly.\n  The substantive disagreements, at least on the bill itself, have all \nbeen taken care of. We have some disagreements on some amendments we \nare working on right now that we think we can work out, as well as \ngetting a managers' amendment to wrap this up.\n  I hope those who would like to get out of here at a relatively nice \nhour tonight, or those who desire not to have votes tomorrow, will get \ndown here as quickly as they can. Both Senator Shelby and I are willing \nto work with Members to see whatever reasonable differences there are \nand we will work them out.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 5313 and 5314, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have several managers' amendments. I \nsend two amendments to the desk which have been cleared on each side. I \nask unanimous consent these amendments be considered and approved en \nbloc and that any statements be placed at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] proposes amendments \n     en bloc numbered 5313 and 5314.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5313\n\n      (Purpose: To provide funding for the review of trade issues)\n\n       On page 19, line 2, before the period add the following new \n     provision: ``:Provided further, That of the funds \n     appropriated $2,500,000 may be made available for the review \n     of trade issues authorized by Public Law 103-182''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5314\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place: ``Provided further, That \n     from funds made available for Basic Repairs and Alterations, \n     $2,000,000 may be transferred to the Policy and Operations \n     appropriation''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every Member of Congress and every \npermanent Federal worker has access to comprehensive health insurance. \nThis is true from the Senate cleaning crew, to the staff director of a \ncommittee, to Members of Congress and their families. We get insurance \nthe way most working Americans do--through our employer, with a shared \ncontribution between employer and employee. Our coverage is secure, \ncomprehensive, and affordable.\n  This is not true, however, for employees of firms contracting with \nCongress. Many of these individuals, who work side by side with Federal \nworkers, have no such guarantee. In fact, about 1,900 employees of \ncompanies that contract with the Congress have no insurance. Current \nefforts to privatize services previously performed by Federal \nGovernment workers exacerbate this situation. Who are these \ncontractors? They include House restaurant and mailroom staff, \nelectronics technicians, day care providers, accountants, data \nprocessors, and construction and maintenance workers.\n  They work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules; yet, they don't \nhave the same kind of health security that we take for granted. I know \nsuch people here in the Congress. One in particular is a person whom I \ngo to every so often to have my hair cut. She has worked in the House \nBeauty Shop for 14 years. For 12 of those 14 years, she was a Federal \nGovernment employee and had health insurance. When the House privatized \nthe House haircut facilities in 1995, this particular individual lost \nher insurance. She purchased a private health plan, but had to drop it \n3 months ago because she could not afford the $187 per month premium. \nShe asked the company who runs the shop--a large firm in San Francisco \nthat operates hundreds of shops--if they would pay 50 percent of the \npremium. Her employer, so far, has refused, and she is now without \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\n She recently had a serious case of food poisoning but, because of her \nlack of coverage, could not afford to go to the doctor for treatment.\n  This kind of situation cannot and should not be tolerated. As we \ndevise new ways to extend health coverage to the uninsured, it just \ndoesn't seem fair to me that we in Congress could allow these \ncontractors, working side-by-side with Federal Government employees who \nwe call upon every day to do the work of the Congress, to go without \nany coverage at all.\n  How can we enjoy subsidized comprehensive insurance while people who \nfix our computers, maintain our buildings, or cut our hair have no \ncoverage at all? It seems to me that, in fairness, we just can't do \nthat.\n  That is why I have introduced this amendment, which would require \nfirms that contract with Congress--and only Congress--to offer health \ninsurance to their employees. This requirement would apply to firms \nthat employ 15 or more workers and that have Federal contracts worth at \nleast $75,000. These contractors could buy a private health plan or \ncould select a plan from the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program \nthat currently is available to all permanent Federal employees. In \neither case, they would be required to contribute to their employees' \npremiums, just as the Federal Government contributes to its workers' \ncoverage. This would ensure that everyone working full time for \nCongress has access at least to the comprehensive coverage that is now \navailable to congressional employees.\n  This kind of action is certainly not without precedent. Several years \nago, concern over high turnover among Senate day care employees led the \nSenate to give these contract workers the Federal health benefits \ncoverage that we now enjoy. And Congress has a long-established history \nof taking action to guarantee fair working conditions for its contract \nworkers. For 65 years, Davis-Bacon and other similar measures have \nguaranteed competitive wages to Federal contract workers. This bill \ncomplements these efforts.\n\n  The introduction of this amendment is not just a humanitarian \ngesture. It is, frankly, a very practical one. Health costs for \nuninsured workers who become ill are simply shifted onto others; \nshifted onto public programs like Medicaid, or shifted onto doctors and \nhospitals in the form of charity care.\n  In addition, the uninsured forgo preventive care and later need \nexpensive emergency room treatment. We should not tolerate this kind of \ninefficient cost shifting. We should be setting an example for the rest \nof the Government, and certainly the private sector.\n  Some may say this measure will reduce cost savings from \nprivatization. I believe Congress should contract out services \nperformed more efficiently by the private sector. But, certainly, \nCongress should not save money by denying workers a basic benefit that \nis guaranteed to all other Federal workers. We want services that are \nleaner, but not meaner.\n  Outsourcing may be the wave of the future and, frankly, I generally \nsupport this trend. But we need to make sure that those workers caught \nin the transition have basic benefits to which other Federal workers \nare entitled.\n  For many years now, Members of Congress have spoken on the floor \nabout the need to extend coverage to the uninsured. We all recognize \nthere can be no financial security without health security. Let us \nsimply put our money where our mouth is. Let us show our country that \nwhat is good for Members of Congress and their employees is also good \nfor the contractors who work with us.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will join me in support of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, my view is that this is a reasonable \namendment. I understand there is no budget cost.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska will yield, there is no budget cost to this. It is completely \npaid for. There is a negligible cost that is completely offset. So \nthere is no increase in the deficit that is the result of this \namendment.\n  The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. I certainly support the amendment.\n  We are waiting for Senator Stevens' view on this amendment. Both he \nand the chairman are right now at a defense appropriations conference \ncommittee. They should be back momentarily. Once they are back, we \nshould be able to wrap this up and get a vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I urge Senators who would like to get out \nof here tomorrow to get to the floor and offer their amendments. There \nare no more than seven or eight amendments on either side. We have \nworked this down to a relatively small amount, and now all we are doing \nis waiting.\n  There are a number of Senators who would like to have rollcall votes. \nIt takes time to have rollcall votes. We have been working as \ndiligently as we can. I want nobody to be surprised when it comes to 2 \nor 3 o'clock in the morning around here, if we wait until 7, 8, 9 \no'clock before somebody comes down and offers amendments.\n  This is an age-old problem, and we are heading to a very predictable \npoint here. We have done about all we can from the floor. Now we have \nto have Members come down and offer their amendments.\n  Mr. SHELBY. As the Senator from Nebraska said, we made a lot of \nprogress. We are getting down to what we hope is the beginning of the \nend tonight. If people who have some amendments pending come over here \nand try to work with us, we might work some of them out. If we cannot \nwork them out, maybe they can offer them and keep the process moving. \nIt is 10 minutes to 6 now. We could be out of here in a couple of \nhours, maybe less, if people would cooperate. I know the Senator from \nNebraska has been pushing it all day, and so have I. This is our third \nday on this bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed for not to exceed 10 minutes as in morning business. And if we \nneed to, I will be glad to yield the floor back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10379-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10382-S10383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE DOLE ECONOMIC PLAN\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as the Democrat leader on the Senate Budget \nCommittee with a long and established record as a fiscal conservative, \nas Governor of my State longer than any other in its history, and proud \nof continuing that record for 18 years in the Senate, I begin today a \nnumber of statements on sound budgeting.\n  These will be based on fact and proven or provable economic theory, \nor just common sense, in a hope that I might divert America from \ncareening again down a path that will certainly lead our Nation to new \nirresponsible depths--new depths indeed--of national debt, if not \ndepression.\n  Alarmingly, the latest ``Follow The Yellow Brick Road'' path of \nwizardry blends $550 billion in tax breaks, unspecified spending cuts, \nand rosy economic scenarios into one shameless political ploy. When the \nunsuspecting Dorothys of the world pull back in wonderment the curtain, \nthey discover a huffing and puffing candidate Bob Dole as the wizard. \nThis is the same wizard who for the first 72 years of his life \nforeswore such economic nonsense.\n  Bob Dole's transformation from a deficit hawk into a carrier pigeon \nfor supply-side economics is a great loss and disappointment to fiscal \nconservatives of both parties.\n  In my 18 years in the Senate, I often stood shoulder to shoulder with \nthen Senator Dole. Although we have had different priorities when it \ncame to spending cuts, we were both strong advocates of a line-item \nveto, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and a no-\nnonsense approach to economic policy.\n\n[[Page S10383]]\n\n  But as Senator Bob Dole became Presidential candidate Bob Dole, \nfiscal responsibility was turned on its ear. Irresponsible tax cuts \nbecame his fetish. Listening to the advice of the campaign consultants \nand pollsters instead of using common sense, Bob Dole, I am afraid, has \nlost his moorings. And to pay for his folly, he would have us fall into \na deeper pit of deficits and debt.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow that to happen to the American people \na second time. We cannot allow the 1980's gibberish of supply-side \neconomics to go unchallenged again. As a freshman Senator, I supported \nit, as did Senator Dole. In retrospect, I acknowledge it was the worst \nvote that I ever cast, in the Senate.\n  To understand the terrible gamble Bob Dole is taking with our future, \nthe American people should understand the history behind it. I would \nlike to spend a few moments today describing the fiscal carnage of the \n1980's, or as George Bush once christened it, ``Voodoo Economics.'' And \nthere is no magic to it. It is just misery.\n  During the 1980's, the American people got their first taste of the \nsupply-side mumbo-jumbo. It was the Reagan-Bush feel-good, no-fuss, no-\nmuss way to reduce the deficit and grow the economy. There was only one \ncatch: It simply did not work.\n  Enacting huge tax cuts and increasing spending without balancing the \nbudget, was a ghastly experiment gone terribly awry. Fed by a quick \nshot of high-octane tax cuts, the economy revved up and then sputtered. \nThe promised revenues evaporated and the deficit exploded with a big \ndeficit bang. A small hill of debt became a mountain.\n  The supply-side economics of the 1980's was a classic example of the \ndifference between promise and performance. Supply-side tax cuts were \nsupposed to boost the private sector's economic performance. In fact, \nthe economy put in a mediocre showing only, during the Reagan years.\n\n  For example, private-sector job growth was 3.3 percent per year in \nthe Carter years, compared with 2.3 percent under Reagan and 0.4 \npercent in the Bush years. It finally rebounded to 2.9 percent during \nthe Clinton administration--but without, and I repeat, without supply-\nside economics.\n  Private investment, which also was supposed to receive a boost from \nsupply-side tax cuts, slumped during the Reagan years. Real business \nfixed investment, which had been growing at a 7.1-percent annual clip \nduring the Carter years, slowed to a 2.6-percent pace under Reagan, and \ncame to a screeching halt under Bush. During the Clinton \nadministration, business investment has soared at a 8.4 percent rate, \nthe strongest showing since World War II.\n  With both private-sector employment and business investment suffering \nunder supply-side policies, it is not surprising that private-sector \ngross domestic product also posted an inferior performance, by any \nmeasure. The growth of the private-sector slowed from a 3.5-percent \npace under Carter to a 3.0-percent rate during the Reagan years. Having \nregistered a meager 1.3-percent showing under Bush, private-sector \ngrowth now currently has averaged 3.2 percent during the Clinton \nadministration.\n  We are often told that the Reagan tax cut led to a doubling of tax \nrevenue by the end of the 1980's. That is merely a manipulation of the \nfacts. Total revenue doubled during the 1980's but income tax revenue \nfell far short of doing so. Revenue from Social Security taxes, \nhowever, more than doubled as a direct result of a major Social \nSecurity tax increase in 1983. That tax increase, incidentally, was \npassed when Republicans held a majority of the U.S. Senate and Senator \nBob Dole was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n  Having failed to deliver on its economic promises, it should not be \nsurprising then that supply-side tax cuts also failed to deliver the \ndeclining deficits promised by the Republicans.\n  In March 1981, the Reagan White House predicted that the deficit \nwould shrink from its $79 billion level and the budget would be \nbalanced by 1985. Instead, the deficit widened dramatically, hitting \n$212 billion in 1985--when it was supposed to be zero--and topping out \nat $290 billion in 1992.\n  A year later, the Reagan administration could see the red ink rising. \nPresident Reagan told the Nation in 1982, and I quote,\n\n       One area of justifiable concern is the deficit. And believe \n     me, we take it as seriously as any problem facing us. But \n     let's recognize why such a huge deficit is projected. It is \n     not, as some would have you believe, a product of our tax \n     cuts.\n\n  I am here to tell you and the American people that it was because of \nthe tax cut. But do not just take it from me. More than 10 years after \nPresident Reagan made that famous speech, his OMB Director, David \nStockman, said his boss was wrong. The deficit was caused by the huge \ntax cuts that were the hallmark of President Reagan's first year in \noffice.\n  In an article on the deficit in the March 1993 issue of New \nPerspectives Quarterly, Mr. Stockman wrote, and I quote,\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy \nof excessive and imprudent tax cuts that shattered the Nation's fiscal \nresponsibility . . . It ought to be obvious by now that we can't grow \nour way out [of the deficit].\n\n  Mr. President, the huge deficits of the Reagan years have left \ntaxpayers with a gargantuan burden of debt and debt service. When \nPresident Reagan took his oath of office, the debt was under $1 \ntrillion. When he left, our national debt was over $2.6 trillion, a \ndebt expanded over fourfold since President Carter to over $4 trillion \nby the time President Bush left office. If it were not for the interest \npayments on the debt built up during the last two Republican \nadministrations, the Federal budget would now be in surplus.\n  The Nation has paid a terrible price for the mistakes of the 1980s, \nand we are still paying for them. Supply-side economics left an \neconomic radioactive fallout that pollutes the economy for years to \ncome. We still do not know its halflife. I feel as though I have spent \nmost of my Senate career trying to clean up the mess, and many of my \ncolleagues have joined in that work, but the job is still unfinished.\n  We in the Senate spend a lot of time talking about the legacy we will \nleave our children and grandchildren. But if we are indeed concerned \nabout mortgaging our children's future, we cannot and we must not \nresurrect supply-side economics. We clearly made a horrendous mistake \neconomically in the 1980s. To duplicate it in the 1990s would be \nunforgivable. Neither Dorothy nor any self-respecting munchkin would or \nshould forgive us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10382-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10383-S10400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1977\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5244\n\n  (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to gun \nfree schools, and for other purposes)\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, today's Washington Post tells the story of \nyoung children being shot in their own neighborhoods by feuding gangs \nwho are targetting innocent bystanders. It tells us eloquently why we \nmust do all that we can to keep guns out of the hands of children. And \nthe most insidious form of juvenile violence is violence in our \nschoolyards. We must take this opportunity to do what we can to keep \nour school zones from becoming war zones. So I would like to offer the \nGun Free School Zones Act as an amendment.\n  The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1995 is a commonsense, bipartisan, \nconstitutional approach to combating violence in our schools. It bars \nbringing a gun within 1,000 feet of a school, with a few commonsense \nexceptions. It modifies the Supreme Court's 1995 Lopez decision to \nensure the law's constitutionality. So, let me make a few points.\n  First, we need a Federal law. The Federal Government has a crucial \nrole to play in dealing with the gun traffic that leads right into our \nclassrooms. After all, how can we turn our backs on a national problem \nthat we can help solve?\n  The problem is national is scope. Anyone who thinks that this is a \nlocal problem isn't looking at the evidence. Interstate commerce is \nexactly what is causing the problem. Sometimes these guns get into \nchildren's hands through the efforts of nationwide gangs.\n  One 14-year-old Madison, WI, gang member told the Wisconsin State \nJournal that the older leaders of his gang brought car loads of guns \nfrom Chicago to the younger gang members. For example, the Boston \npolice recently discovered that all of the handguns being bought by \ngang members in one neighborhood came from Mississippi. The young man \nwho was running guns up to Boston was arrested and shootings in the \nneighborhood dropped more than 60 percent, from 91 to 20.\n  These guns have infiltrated our school system and created a national \ncrisis. A Lou Harris survey this year found that one in eight youths--\ntwo in five in high crime neighborhoods--reported having carried a gun \nfor protection. One in nine said they had stayed away from school \nbecause of fear of violence. That number jumped to one in three in \nhigh-crime neighborhoods.\n  Although State laws can help address this national problem, not every \nState has a law. And not every State law is adequately drafted to do \nthe job. Moreover, in many of these States, people do not serve any \ntime for violating the law. In Federal cases, they do. With a Federal \nlaw, we can fill in loopholes and put violators behind bars for up to 5 \nyears. In short, the Gun Free School Zones Act gives prosecutors the \nflexibility to bring violators to justice under either State or Federal \nstatutes, whichever is appropriate--or tougher.\n  No one claims that our legislation is a panacea. No one claims that \nthe violence will go away if we pass it, just as the violence did not \ngo away when the original law was passed. But a Federal law can help. \nThe Federal Government can step in and assist State prosecutors when \nthey do not have the resources they need. The Federal Government can \ntake on particularly bad offenders who will receive stiffer penalties \nin a Federal prosecution. And this measure has bipartisan support: The \nunderlying bill is cosponsored by Senators Specter, Chafee, Simon, \nKennedy, Kerry, Kerrey, and others.\n  Finally, the new act addresses the constitutional concerns of the \nSupreme Court which struck down the original Gun Free School Zones Act \nlast year. What we have done to ensure this result is simple and \nsufficient: In every prosecution under the act, the Government will now \nhave to prove that the gun traveled in or affected interstate commerce. \nThis very provision was suggested by language in Chief Justice \nRehnquist's majority opinion. And the vast majority of constitutional \nscholars agree that this new bill complies with the Supreme Court.\n  In conclusion, it does not make much sense to treat a modest and \nsensible proposal as a major threat to the Federal-State balance. Our \nfounding fathers were concerned with commonsense, not with alarmist \npredictions about the fate of Federal-State relations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my extended remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Extended Remarks of Senator Herb Kohl on the Gun Free School Zones \n                               Amendment\n\n       The problem of school violence is a national one that begs \n     for national attention. Anyone who argues that the problem is \n     an exclusively intrastate problem is not looking at the \n     evidence. Interstate commerce is creating this problem.\n       The unchecked proliferation of guns and their delivery into \n     the hands of school-aged children is national in scope. The \n     raw materials for guns are mined in one state, are turned \n     into guns in another state, and are put into a child's hands \n     in another state. The gangs that arm these children and \n     encourage them to bring guns to school operate across state \n     lines.\n       The effects of guns in schools stretches across this \n     nation. Schools and districts with particularly bad gun \n     problems sink deeper and deeper into despair. They have \n     difficulty procuring Federal aid or grants from national \n     foundations. People will not move from out-of-state to that \n     school area because they do not want their children in \n     dangerous schools. Businesses will not relocate or establish \n     themselves in areas with dangerous school zones.\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\n       Finally, and perhaps most tragically, the children in those \n     schools are prevented from learning their ABC's. All they \n     learn is to live in terror. Children from Maine to Wisconsin \n     to Alabama to Oregon go to school in fear--fear that they may \n     be shot, that their teacher may be terrorized by a gun-\n     wielding student, that their school day will consist of \n     nothing but dodging from one perilously dangerous situation \n     to another. These children cannot learn and the educational \n     system cannot teach. Our national economy is crippled.\n       The Federal Government has a role to play in combatting \n     this national problem. We must put the full weight and \n     investigative abilities of the Federal Government behind the \n     drive to keep guns out of school. No state should be forced \n     to stand alone in confronting this problem.\n       Although many states have their own laws, we need a Federal \n     law for two reasons: first, many of these State laws are \n     inadequate; and second, a Federal law will serve as a \n     critical support and back-up system for state law enforcement \n     officials.\n       But before dealing with these reasons, I want to point out \n     that the amendment we have introduced today will not hamper, \n     preempt or harm the enforcement of those laws in any way \n     whatsoever.\n       However, about 5 to 10 states do not have laws which deal \n     with guns in schoolyards.\n       In addition, of the forty plus states that have laws, \n     almost half of them simply make it a misdemeanor to bring a \n     gun into school. Unfortunately, that has almost no effect on \n     a juvenile who knows that a juvenile misdemeanor record is \n     virtually meaningless. A stiff Federal penalty means a lot \n     more.\n       Some of the states also have weaker laws. Take, for \n     example, Alabama. Alabama requires that the person charged \n     have brought the gun to school with ``intent to do bodily \n     harm.'' So you can bring a gun to school, disrupt and \n     frighten all of the students but still get off because you \n     did not intend to actually shoot anyone. That is \n     unacceptable. Alabama's statute also only applies to guns on \n     public school grounds. Private schools are uncovered, so \n     anyone can walk into a parochial or private school with a gun \n     and without a fear of prosecution.\n       And there is still another reason why a federal law is \n     needed. We need federal and state cooperation to deal with \n     this problem. The states need our help. Sometimes they are \n     overwhelmed and need backup. Other times, they want to use \n     stiffer Federal penalties. This Gun-Free School Zones Act \n     will not preempt a single state law. And after decades of \n     dealing with complementary Federal-State laws, good State and \n     Federal prosecutors know how to coordinate their efforts--and \n     Federal prosecutors know to step aside when the state has a \n     stiffer law. Just ask Bob Wortham, the former Texas U.S. \n     Attorney nominated by Senator Gramm. Wortham prosecuted \n     more people under the Gun-Free School Zones Act than \n     anyone else. And he did it while getting rave reviews from \n     state police, prosecutors, and teachers. This Act is a \n     modest but useful measure that surely cannot threaten our \n     State governments.\n       You will not hear state officials complaining about \n     meddling federal officials. Instead, state officials welcome \n     federal assistance in this area.\n       The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1995 assures a Federal-\n     State joint venture.\n       This amendment is clearly constitutional. Our original Gun \n     Free School Zones Act was struck down as unconstitutional in \n     United States versus Lopez. In drafting this amendment, we \n     consulted with the Justice Department and a variety of legal \n     experts who carefully scrutinized this bill and concluded it \n     would easily pass the Lopez test.\n       In fact, the very provision that has been inserted into the \n     bill to make it constitutional was suggested by a section in \n     the Chief Justice's opinion in Lopez. In a portion of that \n     opinion, the Chief Justice noted that if the law \n     ``contain[ed] . . . [a] jurisdictional element which would \n     ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm \n     possession in question affects interstate commerce,'' then \n     the law would probably be constitutional.\n       By requiring an ``explicit connection with or effect on \n     interstate commerce'' Congress will be clearly regulating \n     interstate commerce pursuant to its constitutional Commerce \n     Clause power. And the fact is that guns in schools are an \n     interstate commerce problem. There are many known instances \n     of gangs travelling to other states to equip themselves with \n     guns which they then bring into schools. That is what this \n     bill seeks to regulate: the travel of guns through interstate \n     commerce to our schoolhouse steps.\n       This measure does not, as some opponents have argued pave \n     the way to federal regulation of state education. I firmly \n     believe that education is first and last the business of the \n     state governments. And this law does not get the Federal \n     Government in the business of regulating schools. It simply \n     gets the government in the business of controlling the \n     interstate commerce in guns. Since this bill rests on the \n     Federal Government's power to regulate interstate gun \n     commerce, I do not believe it could be used to justify \n     Federal regulation of state education.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor \nof the Gun Free School Zones amendment offered by Senator Kohl, which \nis critical to protecting the sanctity of our schools and the safety of \nour students.\n  Mr. President, each day, an estimated 135,000 students pack a gun \nwith their books on their way to school. In 1990, the Centers for \nDisease Control found that 1 in 20 students carried a gun in a 30-day \nperiod. Three years later, that figure was 1 in 12.\n  At a time when guns are becoming increasingly prevalent on \nneighborhood streets, we cannot simply stand by and allow our \nplaygrounds to become battlegrounds. We cannot expect our students to \nthrive in an atmosphere where they must fear for their lives and for \ntheir safety.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the original Gun Free School Zones Act with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. As many of my colleagues know, a \nsharply divided Supreme Court has invalidated that bill, saying that it \nexceeded congressional power.\n  I personally disagreed with the Supreme Court decision, and signed an \namicus brief supporting the law's validity. But that is not the issue \nbefore us today. Today, the issue is the safety of our children.\n  This amendment ensures the constitutionality of the Gun Free School \nZones Act by requiring the prosecutor to prove as part of each \nprosecution that the gun moved in, or affected, interstate commerce. \nThat provision will place only a small burden on prosecutors and will \nensure our power to keep America's schools safe.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has the support of the law \nenforcement and education communities. It has been endorsed by the \nNational Education Association, the American Association of School \nAdministrators, the National School Boards Association, the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals and the American Academy of \nPediatrics.\n  Is this legislation a panacea, Mr. President? Of course, not. \nHowever, it is a worthwhile effort to keep our children away from the \ndangers of guns and violence.\n  Mr. President, the National Rifle Association likes to say that guns \ndo not kill; people do. But the gun statistics I have seen belie their \ncontentions. Firearms kill more teenagers than cancer, heart disease, \nAIDS, and natural diseases combined. Guns are now the leading cause of \ndeath for both white and black teenage boys.\n  We need to fight back the wave of gun violence that is overtaking our \nstreets and neighborhoods once and for all. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment and to help protect our children and \nour teachers from gun violence.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is a very good amendment, a change in \nthe law that is needed as a consequence of the Supreme Court decision. \nI support the amendment fully.\n  If the Senator wants to request the yeas and nays we can move \nimmediately to a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I add Senator Biden as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like a rollcall vote, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5295\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for the rescheduling of flunitrazepam into \n schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, and for other purposes.)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment 5295 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n\n[[Page S10386]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. RESCHEDULING OF FLUNITRAZEPAM INTO SCHEDULE I OF \n                   THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.\n\n       Notwithstanding sections 201 and 202 (a) and (b) of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811, 812 (a), (b)), \n     respecting the scheduling of controlled substances, the \n     Attorney General shall, by order--\n       (1) transfer flunitrazepam from schedule IV of such Act to \n     schedule I of such Act; and\n       (2) add ketamine hydrochloride to schedule II of such Act.\n\n     SEC. ____.

Penalty for administering a controlled substance to \n              facilitate a felony.''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me get right to the point. What I am \nattempting to do here, so I do not confuse my colleagues who do not \nhave the opportunity or requirement to deal with the drug issue as much \nas I do, I am attempting to change the schedule--that is the term of \nart--of these two particular drugs, Rohypnol, and another drug which is \nreferred to as ``Special K,'' and I will get into this in a minute.\n  They are now the lowest classified drug that you are not able to use. \nI want to move them up into the highest classification, which make them \na schedule 1 drug, the most dangerous drugs that are out there. When \nyou change the schedule, you change all the resources of the Government \nas to how much attention they pay to the illicit use of these drugs.\n  Now, the best time, Mr. President, to target a new drug which is \ncoming on to the scene is at the front end. For example, I remember \nSenator Moynihan in the early 1980's standing on the floor of the \nSenate and saying, ``Hey, look, there is a new drug called crack \ncocaine.'' It had not been around before. ``There is a new drug called \ncrack cocaine that is being used heavily in the Bahamas. We are \nbeginning to see it being imported in New York. We really should set a \npriority to deal with that drug.''\n  Now, that is one of the whole purposes for drug strategy: You pick \npriorities and say, ``Look, we will focus on this drug or that drug.'' \nI know the Presiding Officer knows what happened. He knew in Utah long \nbefore they found out in Iowa, and they have not found out yet in \nDelaware, but they knew before him in California about a thing called \nmethamph- etamines--``meth.'' What most people do not know, but the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows, is that there are more drive-by \nshootings in Salt Lake City than any other major city in the country--\none of finest cities, lowest crime rates in the country.\n  What happened? Along came this drug called ``ice,'' or \nmethamphetamine. It is a drug that is manufactured, that has properties \nthat are similar in effect and that are more intense than cocaine. All \nof a sudden, the gangs that were manufacturing this synthetic drug, the \nBloods and Crips in Southern California--things got too hot for them \nthere, so they literally moved to Utah. Then things got too hot for \nthem in Utah, and they moved up into Montana and Idaho. Now they have \nmoved, literally, into Iowa, which is a major producing State now.\n  So what is happening then? It is like a wave. See, ``ice'' started in \nHawaii, and we had notice of it. I have been hollering about it for 6 \nyears now. But we did not focus on it. We always wait until the wave \nhits us before we focus on it. Then it hit California, and literally, \nyou could see it working its way across America.\n  Now, the reason I bother to say that is that when we have moved \nbefore an abuse of a particular drug has overwhelmed our communities, \nwe have been successful. The advantages of moving early are clear. \nThere are fewer pushers trafficking in that drug, and, most important, \nthere are fewer dependencies, fewer people dependent on the drug, so \nthere are fewer people needing to go out and push the drug they are \ndependent on to make the money to consume the drug. Literally, we can \nget it before the networks are in place.\n  There are organized networks, and there are networks that come about \nas a consequence of the consumption, because the people consuming need \nto make money to continue to consume their drugs. So what do they do? \nThey make a deal with their pusher and say, ``I will get you two more \ncustomers.'' It is kind of like the old pyramid scheme. But the problem \nis, once the pyramid has been built, we play heck with trying to break \nit up at that point.\n  So today, we are tracking the arrival of two new drugs, Rohypnol, and \na drug called ``Special K''--I will get into that in a moment--as they \nbegin their slow popularity across the country and begin to show \nextreme popularity in several States. So today--now--is the time to act \non trying to snuff them out before they become too popular.\n  There is a heightened urgency because of one stark fact. These new \ndrugs--the one with the slang name ``Special K,'' which is an animal \ntranquilizer, I might add, and Rohypnol, which is a different drug--are \nbeing used primarily by our children. Now, all of a sudden, everyone \nfrom the administration to the Republican-controlled Congress, \nincluding Democrats in the Congress, has discovered that drug use among \nyouth is up.\n  I came to the floor of the U.S. Senate a year and a half ago and laid \nout the facts, figures, numbers, and even wrote a report that you all \ngot stuck on your desk. Understandably, like most reports, none of us \nread them. In the report, I start off saying, ``Our Nation has already \nseen the first signs of a trend that chills every parent--a rising drug \nuse among young children. This is the proper focus of our national \ncrime debate in the months ahead.''\n  That was a year and a half ago. I laid out all the reasons why it was \nthere. To anybody involved in the drug problem, dealing with the drug \nissue, they are not surprised by the figures. But all of a sudden, in \nthis election year, Democrats and Republicans alike have found that we \nhave a problem with youth violence and a problem with drug abuse among \nour young.\n  Well, I am here to tell you all again that we have an additional \nproblem. We have an additional problem. There are two particular drugs \nthat are gaining vast popularity among young people, and they have an \nincredibly negative effect, which I will describe in a moment, and we \nare not targeting them. They are schedule 4 drugs, which means they are \nat the bottom of the heap. They are viewed as the least dangerous of \nall the things out there. As a consequence of that, Mr. President, what \nhappens is, local police don't focus on them, Federal resources don't \nfocus on them, parents don't pay attention to them, nobody looks at \nthem because they are the thing that is the least problematic. Well, \nthese two are incredibly pernicious.\n  So that is why I am calling on the Senate to pass legislation to make \nboth of these drugs subject to much stricter regulation. This can be \naccomplished by moving these drugs to a different schedule under the \nFederal Controlled Substance Act. I realize that sounds bureaucratic. \nBut it is a big deal, how you schedule the drug. This is not a step, I \nmight add, to be taken lightly, because there is a regulatory procedure \nin place for scheduling controlled substances. Unfortunately, this \nregulatory procedure can take years to accomplish and change. It has to \nbe done now. It has to be done now.\n  In the past decade--to underscore my point here--Congress has taken \nlegislative action by going around or over the bureaucratic procedure \nto reschedule drugs. Guess what? It has worked. In 1984, Mr. President, \nI came to the floor\n\n[[Page S10387]]\n\nof the Senate and I said, ``Hey, look, what I am hearing from all the \ndrug experts in the country is that Quaaludes are being abused in \nproportions that we should be very worried about. They are on the verge \nof becoming an epidemic that, in fact, will impact upon young people.'' \nAnd so, with the help of many of my colleagues, we passed a law to make \nQuaaludes, a previously medically approved sedative, a controlled \nsubstance, a schedule 3 controlled substance.\n  Now, Mr. President, in the decade since that legislation took effect, \nQuaalude abuse has dropped significantly. Emergency room Quaalude \noverdoses--the best way to measure abuse is by the overdoses in the \nhospital emergency rooms--are down 80 percent. It worked; they are down \n80 percent from 1984 to 1994.\n  In legislation I sponsored, which was passed as part of the 1990 \nCrime Control Act, steroids were reclassified as a schedule 3 \nsubstance, scheduling them to more strict controls. I see my friend \nfrom Florida on the floor. He has been deeply involved in these drug \nabuse issues. He can tell you that we were hearing from every athletic \ndirector, we were hearing from every coach, we were hearing from \nschoolteachers, we were hearing about this incredible abuse of \nsteroids. All you had to do was pick up any magazine, from Sports \nIllustrated to Time magazine, several years ago, in the late 1980's and \nearly 1990's, and they are saying, ``Wow, this is a big-deal problem.'' \nIt was a big-deal problem. So we rescheduled the drug. Since we \nrescheduled the drug, subjecting it to stricter regulation, the annual \nuse of steroids is down 42 percent in the first 2 years after enacting \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I just cite this to point out to the skeptics--like in \nCalifornia the referendum for the use of marijuana for medical uses--to \nthe people who have given up--whether it is William Buckley, Mayor \nSchmoke, George Shultz, or whoever, who are talking about \nlegalization--the reason they are giving up on that stuff is not \nbecause they think it is good to legalize it, but they don't think we \ncan do anything about the problem. Well, we can. It is like any \ndisease. It is like anything, from breast cancer to any other disease \nyou can name, the earlier you detect it, the quicker you act on it \nbefore it spreads, the better your chances are of dealing with it.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, it is time to legislate stricter \ncontrols for Rohypnol and ``Special K.'' The record-high abuse rates of \nthe 1970's were accompanied by a unique drug culture, signified by the \npresence of what used to be called ``club drugs.'' By a club drug, I \nmean a drug popular with youth and young adults who frequent dance \nclubs and often mix drugs with alcohol and other substances.\n  Quaaludes are one of those club drugs. That is the manner in which \nthey were consumed because it enhanced the high and you were very \nmellow.\n  Recently club drugs have made a resurgence in popularity, and they \nare now showing up in both bars and what they call ``raves.'' For some \nof you who are not as old as I am, ``raves'' are all-night dance \nmarathons popular with teenagers.\n  Club drugs are typified by the way they have suddenly gained \npopularity and have become a drug of choice. They have become trendy \namong youth, and often these drugs are legally manufactured, but are \nbeing used by youth in ways unintended by the manufacturer and \nunapproved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Rohypnol and ``Special K'' are two of the drugs which have recently \nhit the youth scene and quickly become popular. Both of these drugs are \nvery dangerous drugs whose current legal status does not reflect the \ndangers inherent in their abuse.\n  Rohypnol abuse was first documented in the United States in 1993. \nAlthough abuse was first noted in southern Florida, in the past 2 years \nabuse has spread rapidly, and Rohypnol activity has been reported in \nmore than 30 States.\n  Without rapid and strong Government action, I predict that this abuse \nwill continue. It will spread. Teenagers find Rohypnol an attractive \ndrug for a number of reasons. Frighteningly, one of the major reasons \nthat youth do not see Rohypnol as a dangerous drug is because it has \nlegitimate medical use in some areas of the world, and they mistakenly \nbelieve that if they are taking that drug in its original packaging \nform, the manufacturer indicates that it is both safe and \nunadulterated. They think, ``Well, how can that hurt me? Why is that a \nproblem?''\n  In addition, there are few existing means for testing and prosecuting \nyouth for Rohypnol possession and intoxication. The combination of \nRohypnol and alcohol makes it possible for a young person to feel very \nintoxicated while remaining under the legal blood-alcohol level for \ndriving. That is one of the reasons for its popularity.\n  In addition to gaining attention for the increasing rate of abuse, \nRohypnol has also been the focus of another social problem, a \nparticularly ugly crime: that is what is referred to as date rape. In \nfact, in many areas and in a number of newspaper accounts, Rohypnol is \nreferred to as the ``date rape drug.''\n  Let me explain why. This connection between Rohypnol and rape is due \nto the drug's disinhibitory effects and its likelihood of causing \namnesia when it is taken with alcohol. Unfortunately, the amnesia \neffect is one of the reasons why many people who abuse Rohypnol are \nattracted to it. It is commonly reported that people taking Rohypnol in \ncombination with alcohol typically have blackouts and memory losses \nthat last 8 to 24 hours. The novelty of the blackouts attract youth, \nparticularly youth who are combining drugs and alcohol.\n  In addition, this has led to it being referred to as the ``forget me \npill'' or the ``forget pill.'' Even more frightening, many of the \npeople are finding the drug attractive as a way of creating blackouts \nin other people.\n  So we have increasing accounts of unscrupulous males in almost every \ninstance literally--back in our day you would hear the phrase, or my \ngrandfather used to talk about a Mickey Finn--spiking somebody's drink. \nThere is a real reward when a young man spikes a drink of a young \nwoman: (a) she becomes much more uninhibited; and, (b) when he takes \nadvantage of her, rapes her, has sex with her, molests her, she is \nincapable of remembering with enough specificity to prosecute him that \nhe is the one. Let me give you an example.\n\n  She will be able to remember that she has been violated. So the \ndamage is done physically and psychologically. But when in a courtroom \nbeing asked by a cross-examining defense attorney, ``Well, tell me \nwhere you were exactly. Tell me what he was wearing. Tell me what room \nyou were in.'' All of the things that go to credibility, she is \nincapable of remembering.\n  So it has become increasingly popular to abuse young women. That is \nwhy they call it--not just young women, any woman. But because it is \nused in this club scene, that is the place that it is used most often.\n  So the combination of a lack of inhibition and memory loss caused by \nRohypnol mixed with alcohol makes women especially vulnerable to being \nvictims of date rape by people who convince women to take Rohypnol \nwhile drinking, or who put the drug in the woman's drink without her \nknowledge.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. We have just been notified by the majority leader that it \nis his intention to file and say no more votes past 9 o'clock, which \nmeans we would have, unless we are able to finish this bill up tonight \nby 9, votes on Friday.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, is there any likelihood that my colleagues \nwill be willing to accept this amendment?\n  Mr. KERREY. Apparently there is some Republican on this side of the \naisle that has a problem.\n  We are talking about the Rohypnol amendment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. Because the drug companies, the outfit that \nmanufactures Rohypnol, does not like it being moved into schedule 1.\n  I will take 2 more minutes to talk about Ketamine, and then I will \nyield the floor, and I am ready for a vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. Are you going to need a second amendment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. No. This is all in one amendment.\n  So let me just briefly explain what Ketamine is. Ketamine is an \nanimal\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\ntranquilizer. Ketamine is a hallucinogen that is very similar to PCP. \nIt is called ``Special K.'' It has become a new, popular ``designer'' \ndrug.\n  Although the drug has been in existence for several years, its abuse \nhas rapidly become more prevalent in recent years.\n  In fact, a club in New Jersey was recently closed by police after it \ndiscovered teens were attending these things called ``raves'' where \nclub employees distribute bottled water for the purpose of being able \nto take this drug called ``Special K.''\n  In addition to seizures in New Jersey, recent newspaper articles have \nmentioned seizures in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, \nCalifornia, and Florida. Drug trafficking experts have also cited the \npresence of ``Special K'' in Georgia and the District of Columbia and \nin my home State of Delaware.\n  It is considered the successor to PCP, or ``angel dust,'' as it is \nknown in the streets, due to the similarity of the two drugs' chemical \ncompositions and mind-altering effects. There have also been reports of \nPCP being sold to people who think they are buying ``Special K.''\n  The bottom line is that this is becoming an incredibly popular drug.\n  The point I will conclude with is I say to my colleagues that by \nmoving Rohypnol to schedule 1 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act \nand adding ``Special K,'' Ketamine, to schedule 2 of the act, this \nlegislation will subject both drugs to tough controls, increased \npenalties for unlawful activities involving the two drugs, and it will \nincrease the attention of law enforcement and direct Federal efforts \nagainst this.\n  Mr. President, It also enhances the penalties for people who abuse \nboth these drugs.\n  In an attempt to cooperate as much as I can, I will yield the floor \nunless there is somebody who will argue against it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Would the Senator like to have the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to have the yeas and nays.\n  I would be delighted if it could be accepted. If it can be accepted, \nI will not seek a vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. At this point we cannot.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to tell all the Members that \nhave been conferring with the majority leader that he wants us to be \nout of here at 9 o'clock. There are a number of amendments. We have \nmade a lot of progress. People have come over here. I know Senator \nMcCain is ready to move. He has been detained somewhere else. In just a \nfew minutes he will get moving. There are others who have been called \nto the floor. If we are not through at 9 o'clock--which is in 2 hours \nand 20 minutes--the majority leader has informed me and asked me to \nshare with everybody that we will be in session tomorrow on this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, to underscore again, we had an amendment \nearlier that Senator Kohl brought down. We were ready to vote on it. A \nMember somewhere--Lord knows where they are --said, no, we want to come \ndown and speak against it. They still are not here.\n  We would have accepted this amendment that Senator Biden just \noffered. We have a rollcall vote. I have a couple Members who want to \nspeak against. They are not here. It is quarter to 7. It is one thing \nto say I want a chance to offer an amendment but if, for gosh sakes, \nall you want to do is speak on the amendment, put a statement in. Let \nus go to a vote. Do not tie this thing up forever just because you want \nto come and make a statement. If you are not prepared to come down to \nthe floor to talk, then put in a written statement. I will put a \nwritten statement in for you, speak passionately for you, whatever it \ntakes, but let us get to these votes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5266\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funding for drug interdiction efforts by \n                              $32,769,000)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 5266 at the desk. I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Helms, proposes an amendment numbered 5266.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, line 14, strike ``$4,085,355,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$4,052,586,000'';\n       On page 42, line 26, strike ``$103,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$135,769,000''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am aware, as I propose this amendment, \nthere are I believe a couple of other speakers who wanted to come over \nand speak in opposition to the amendment. I hope they will display the \ncourtesy to the managers of the bill by coming over so that we can \ncomplete our work by 9 o'clock this evening.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would increase funding for the High-\nIntensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program by $32.7 million. That $32.7 \nmillion is derived by cutting the tax law enforcement appropriated \nlevel to the amount that was passed by the House.\n  Sunday's Washington Post stated:\n\n       President Clinton signed Presidential decision Directive \n     No. 14 shifting U.S. antidrug efforts away from intercepting \n     cocaine as it passed through Mexico and the Caribbean and \n     instead attacking the drug supply at its sources in Colombia, \n     Bolivia, and Peru.\n       The two policy changes marked 1993 as a watershed year in \n     the hemispheric war on drugs and now the results are in. \n     Mexico became the main gateway into the United States for \n     illegal narcotics . . . and teenage drug use in the United \n     States doubled.\n\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President.\n\n       Mexico became the main gateway way into the United States \n     for illegal narcotics . . . and teenage drug use in the \n     United States doubled.\n\n  Mr. President, the problem of teenage drug use is growing rapidly. \nAccording to published reports, drug use by teens in general is up 105 \npercent, teenage marijuana use is up by 141 percent, and teenage \ncocaine use has risen a startling 166 percent. Clearly, something must \nbe done.\n  The High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program was established by \nthe Antidrug Abuse Act of 1988 and provides Federal assistance to State \nand local law enforcement agencies in the areas of our Nation most \naffected by drug trafficking. This program has been very successful.\n  It is clear that we must do more, much more. The fact that drug use \namong teenagers has doubled is a startling and disturbing statistic. It \nshould cause us all to stop what we are doing and question our \nchildren's future. The facts are clear. Their future will be in \njeopardy if the drug epidemic continues unabated.\n  Rhetoric is not going to solve the problem. The President has tried \nthe political approach. He gutted the drug czar's office and changed \nour Nation's drug interdiction strategy. Now that an election is \napproaching and startling facts regarding the skyrocketing use of drugs \nare in the press, the President is paying this issue lip service. This \nis not enough.\n  We need action. We need to curb drug use. That is exactly what this \namendment will do. It will fund more police on our border. It will fund \nmore interdiction programs. It will fund a special project to curb the \nproduction and distribution of methamphetamines in the Midwest.\n  According to Monday's Washington Post, the President wrote:\n\n       In the national drug control strategy, I asked Congress to \n     be a bipartisan partner and provide the resources we need to \n     get the job done. That is why I urge you to ensure that \n     Congress fully funds my antidrug budget requests before you \n     conclude your work and return home.\n\n  I think we should comply with the President's request. He said, ``I \nurge you to ensure that Congress fully funds my antidrug budget \nrequests before you conclude your work and return home.''\n  This amendment represents a good start. I admit the $32 million this \namendment would add to our drug\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\ninterdiction program will not solve the problem. But it is a necessary \nfirst step.\n  We must fund these programs. As the data demonstrates, we are clearly \nnot doing enough now.\n  The money to fund this increase in our drug interdiction program is \nderived by funding the IRS tax auditor section of the bill at the \nHouse-passed level rather than at the higher Senate amount. The House \nbelieves the IRS can fulfill its duties on the amount appropriated, \nespecially in the auditor section. I am inclined to agree and believe \nthe Senate add-on will be better spent on our drug control efforts. The \neffects of this cut have been incorporated into the bill and will not \ncause any budgetary problems.\n  Mr. President, we have to act on this matter. The future of our young \npeople depends on stopping our country's drug epidemic, and this \namendment I believe is a reasonable restraint and logical first step. I \nhope it will be adopted.\n  In deference to the fact we are working on a 9 o'clock time \nconstraint, in deference to the fact that my colleague from Georgia, I \nbelieve, Senator Coverdell, is waiting here to speak, and we have other \namendments, I will abbreviate my remarks. But the abbreviation of my \nremarks should not be interpreted as a lack of concern or a lack of \npriority that I feel about this drug problem in America.\n  I happen to come from a State that cocaine is pouring through. \nUnfortunately, it is not all going through my State. A lot of it is \nstopping in Arizona. Tragically, in the poorer sections of Phoenix, AZ, \nand Tucson, AZ, and around my State the use of drugs is dramatically on \nthe increase. I have met with individuals who have had personal \nexperiences, residents of these areas, and they are deeply alarmed and \ndeeply concerned. They blame the rise of gang activities on the \neconomic aspects of the sale of drugs. They blame the deaths and \nwounding of young individuals on gang wars and gang-related activities. \nThey blame a great deal of the problems that exist in their \nneighborhoods on this horrific drug problem that is going up and up and \nup.\n  I had hoped that this amendment would have been accepted. I \nunderstand that Senator Shelby may have a motion to table this \namendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Sometimes brevity is the best thing to do. I must say \ninitially perhaps it is pride of authorship; when you put a bill \ntogether yourself, you think nobody can make an improvement upon it. I \nhave had a lot of experience with it, and especially in the Midwest we \nhave a very serious methamphetamine problem in Nebraska.\n  I just checked with the chairman's staff person on this, and I \nbelieve we would be prepared to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I do thank my friend from Nebraska. And I hope my friend from \nNebraska will keep in mind its importance as they go to conference.\n  I thank my friend. I am grateful to my friend from Nebraska.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Coverdell as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Nebraska. I do want to point out \nthat as on many issues the Senator from Nebraska has been a leader \nagainst this fight in the drug war and I thank him for it.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, [Mr. McCain] to provide an \nadditional $32.7 million dollars to fight the deluge of illegal hard \ndrugs into the United States. This additional funding will go to the \nHigh-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, the purpose of which is \nto provide increased Federal assistance to the most critical drug \ntrafficking areas in our country.\n  This amendment is fully offset by a reduction in the Senate \nrecommended IRS enforcement funding level to the level passed by the \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment is another necessary step toward \nrecommitting our government and the American people to the war on \ndrugs. It supplements an amendment, builds on one I offered last week \nduring consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. The Senate \nunanimously passed that amendment to provide an additional $20 million \nto fight drug use in public housing projects. I hope we will see that \nsame level of support for the pending amendment.\n  This amendment is consistent with the testimony of the experts who \ntestified at the recent Foreign Relations Committee hearing on \ninternational drug trafficking. At that hearing, over which I presided, \ntwo North Carolina law enforcement officers, Charlotte- Mecklenburg \nPolice Dept. Sgt. Terry Sult and Sheriff B.J. Barnes of Guilford \nCounty, NC, along with a member of the L.A. gang known as the \n``bloods,'' described in graphic detail, the devastating effects of the \ndrug trade at the local level. They also confirmed what national \nexperts, such as John Walters, the deputy drug czar in the Bush \nadministration, who also testified at our hearing, told us about \nchanges in the distribution of drugs at the national level.\n\n  Mr. President, these experts all spoke of the increasing influx of \nillegal narcotics, the vast majority of which are produced in South \nAmerica, into their communities. They also addressed the violence \nassociated with the drug trade and the despicable practice of employing \never younger children in the peddling of this poison. According to the \nDEA, much of our Nation's violent crime, particularly among juveniles, \nis linked to drug trafficking and drug use. Recent statistics have \nshown that over one-third of all violent acts and almost half of all \nhomicides among juveniles are linked to drugs.\n  Recent drug abuse statistics have confirmed what many of us already \nknew. Namely, that our Nation has been losing ground in the war against \ndrugs. The most recent annual survey of drug use among our Nation's \nyouth revealed some shocking statistics. Just two examples from the \nsurvey will demonstrate the enormity of the problem we now face. For \nexample, the survey found:\n  First, drug use by U.S. teenagers skyrocketed 105 percent between \n1992 and 1995; and\n  Second cocaine use among teens increased 166 percent in the 1 year \nfrom 1994 to 1995.\n  These statistics reflect a continued breakdown in our social fabric. \nThe damage this poison inflicts is measured not merely in terms of \ndollars and cents, but more importantly, in lost and squandered lives. \nEach year, illegal drugs claim the lives of 25,000 Americans and \ndevastate countless thousands of family and friends who are left \nbehind.\n  Mr. President, while there is no single solution to the problem of \nillegal drug use, it is abundantly clear that we must redouble our \nefforts if we are to stop the loss of yet another generation to the \nscourge of illegal drugs. The McCain amendment will focus resources on \none of the areas that they are most urgently needed--in those cities \nand ports of entry that are most heavily impacted by drug-trafficking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5266) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Florida is here to \noffer an amendment. I wonder if he can tell me how much time he has, \nbecause what I would like to do is propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest. We have two amendments up here that are waiting for votes. We \nare waiting for Members to come down and speak. In one case, it was an \nhour ago they were on the way down here. I would like to propound a \nunanimous-consent request that we proceed to a vote on the Kohl \namendment, a 15-minute rollcall vote on the Kohl amendment, immediately \nfollowed thereafter by a 15-minute vote on the Biden amendment.\n  How long did the Senator want to speak?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Kohl amendment \nvote begin at 7:20, immediately followed by the rollcall vote on the \nBiden amendment.\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have two unanimous-consent requests. \nFirst, that Ms. Nani Coloretti, of our office, be allowed the privilege \nof the floor during the consideration of the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And, second, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for a moment so I can inform \ncolleagues, once again, the objection was offered for the purpose of \nallowing Senators to come over to offer a perfecting amendment on the \nBiden amendment. We have 2 hours and 5 minutes. Otherwise, we get votes \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask the pending amendments be laid aside for purposes \nof offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5245\n\n (Purpose: To ensure medicare beneficiaries have emergency and urgent \ncare provided and paid for by establishing a definition of an emergency \n  medical condition that is based upon the prudent layperson standard)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5245.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE.\n\n       (a) Access to Emergency Services.--Subparagraph (B) of \n     section 1876(c)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395mm(c)(4)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(B) meet the requirements of section 3 of the Access to \n     Emergency Medical Care Act of 1995 with respect to members \n     enrolled with an organization under this section.''.\n       (b) Timely Authorization for Promptly Needed Care \n     Identified as a Result of Required Screening Evaluation.--\n     Section 1876(c) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395mm(c)) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9)(A) The organization must provide access 24 hours a \n     day, 7 days a week to individuals who are authorized to make \n     any prior authorizations required by the organization for \n     coverage of items and services (other than emergency \n     services) that a treating physician or other emergency \n     department personnel identify, pursuant to a screening \n     evaluation required under section 1867(a), as being needed \n     promptly by an individual enrolled with the organization \n     under this part.\n       ``(B) The organization is deemed to have approved a request \n     for such promptly needed items and services if the physician \n     or other emergency department personnel involved--\n       ``(i) has made a reasonable effort to contact an individual \n     described in subparagraph (A) for authorization to provide an \n     appropriate referral for such items and services or to \n     provide the items and services to the individual and access \n     to the person has not been provided (as required in \n     subparagraph (A)), or\n       ``(ii) has requested such authorization from the person and \n     the person has not denied the authorization within 30 minutes \n     after the time the request is made.\n       ``(C) Approval of a request for a prior authorization \n     determination (including a deemed approval under subparagraph \n     (B)) shall be treated as approval of a request for any items \n     and services that are required to treat the medical condition \n     identified pursuant to the required screening evaluation.\n       ``(D) In this paragraph, the term `emergency services' \n     means--\n       ``(i) health care items and services furnished in the \n     emergency department of a hospital (including a trauma \n     center), and\n       ``(ii) ancillary services routinely available to such \n     department,\n\n     to the extent they are required to evaluate and treat an \n     emergency medical condition (as defined in subparagraph (E)) \n     until the condition is stabilized.\n       ``(E) In subparagraph (D), the term `emergency medical \n     condition' means a medical condition, the onset of which is \n     sudden, that manifests itself by symptoms of sufficient \n     severity, including severe pain, that a prudent layperson, \n     who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, \n     could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical \n     attention to result in--\n       ``(i) placing the person's health in serious jeopardy,\n       ``(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or\n       ``(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.''.\n       ``(F) In subparagraph (D), the term `stabilizationn' means, \n     with respect to a emergency medical condition, that no \n     material deteriorationn of the condition is likely, within \n     reasonable medical probability, to result or occur before an \n     individual can be transferred in compliance with the \n     requirements of section 1867 of the Social Security Act.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall be effective for contract years beginning on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Congress has created an anomaly, a catch-\n22 situation which occurs in one of the most traumatic areas of our \nsociety, the hospital emergency room. The anomaly is that under the \nFederal Emergency Medical Treatment Act, physicians in hospitals which \nparticipate in Medicare must provide ``an appropriate medical screening \nexamination to any patient who presents himself or herself in an \nemergency room without regard to insurance coverage or ability to pay. \nIf the emergency condition exists, the patient must be stabilized \nbefore transfer or release.''\n  So, the hospital which provides Medicare services is required to \nreceive any persons presenting themselves to the emergency room and to \nprovide initial stabilization and screening, without regard to the \npersons' ability to pay.\n  Second, health maintenance organizations, which, today, provide \nMedicare services for almost 1 out of 10 Medicare beneficiaries, are \nnot required to reimburse the emergency room if it performs the \nservices that we have statutorily required the emergency room and its \nprofessional staff to perform.\n  Who is affected by this anomaly? Who is caught in the catch-22 which \nwe have created? Obviously, it is the Medicare beneficiaries, the \nMedicare beneficiaries who, as we have increasingly encouraged them to \ndo, have signed a contract with a health maintenance organization and \nnow have found that, after having gone to the emergency room, had \nservices provided, finds that they are denied reimbursement and become \nfinancially obligated for what, in many cases, is a very substantial \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I have, and I would like to offer as one of several \nitems to appear immediately after my remarks, a letter from a health \ncare organization in Clinton Township, MI, St. John Emergency \nPhysicians. They outline an example of this instance in which a 46-\nyear-old female patient presented herself to their emergency room \ndepartment. The patient was traveling in a car with her husband when \nshe experienced a sudden onset of shortness of breath and collapsed. \nShe was rushed to the emergency department in an ambulance.\n  Despite the best efforts of the emergency room personnel, the \npatient, unfortunately, did not respond to any of the emergency \ntreatment. She was pronounced dead. The cause of death was cardio-\npulmonary arrest. The patient belonged to a HMO organization. They \nrefused coverage and have sent a bill of $1,200 to the widower of the \ndeceased patient.\n  That is illustrative of situations which relate to emergency rooms in \nHMO's.\n  You might say this certainly is an anomaly; this is aberrant; this \ncannot be a recurring condition. In fact, presently 60 percent of all \nof the claims disputed between Medicare beneficiaries and managed care \nplans involve emergency services. Sixty percent of the disputes between \nMedicare beneficiaries and an HMO plan relate to circumstances that \nrevolve around emergency room services.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to resolve that dispute. We are not \ndoing this for the first time. In November 1995, this Senate, by \nunanimous vote, adopted this amendment as part of the Medicare \ncomponent of the Balanced Budget Act.\n  We are not the only ones to be concerned about this. Increasingly, \nStates are adopting provisions to resolve this dispute between HMO \npatients and emergency rooms. To date, Maryland, Virginia, and the \nState of Arkansas, have all adopted legislation that relates to this \nsubject, and action is\n\n[[Page S10391]]\n\nbeing taken by the leaders of the industry, of the health maintenance \norganizations. Washington Health Week of August 26, 1996, states that:\n\n       HMO patients who make emergency room visits may benefit \n     from the unlikely alliance of a leading HMO company and an \n     emergency physicians group, jointly pushing for federal \n     standards that would make it harder to deny coverage for such \n     services.\n       Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and the American College of \n     Emergency Physicians are advocating standards for emergency \n     care coverage that include the controversial ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The jointly developed standards would require managed care \n     plans to cover non-emergency services provided in an \n     emergency department if a prudent lay person would reasonably \n     think that his or her condition needed emergency treatment. \n     HMOs would have to cover medically necessary ER [emergency \n     room] services without preauthorization. Emergency MDs \n     [physicians] would have to notify the plan within 30 minutes \n     after the enrollee's condition is stabilized to obtain \n     authorization for promptly needed services. HMO's would have \n     30 minutes to respond. If the HMO and the doctor couldn't \n     agree on a post-stabilization treatment, the plan would have \n     to arrange alternative treatment.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the essence of the amendment we have offered. \nIt is an amendment which the Senate has already adopted. It is an \namendment which is increasingly being adopted by States, not just for \nMedicare patients but for all patients who are members of a health \nmaintenance organization. And it is the position that is now being \nadvocated by one of the leading HMO's in the country and the College of \nEmergency Physicians.\n  I recently had an experience, as I do on a monthly basis, taking a \ndifferent job. In this case, it was working with the fire and rescue \ndepartment of Palm Beach County, FL, in an area of the county which has \na large number of Medicare beneficiaries in their population. I was at \none of the fire and rescue stations which said they got as many as 40 \ncalls in a 24-hour period for emergencies.\n  I asked them, ``What would you do, for instance, if you came to the \nhome of an older person, a home of any person, who was suffering from \nchest pains?''\n  Their answer was: ``Our instructions are to provide stabilization and \nimmediately deliver that individual to an emergency room. We are not to \nmake any independent attempts to assess what the cause of those chest \npains may be. We rely on the reasonable judgment of this lay person \nthat those chest pains would be symptomatic of a serious life-\nthreatening condition. We deliver that individual into the hands of \npersons who are capable of making the judgment as to whether, in fact, \nthat is the circumstance.''\n  Mr. President, that is the essence of this amendment. It is to use \nthe standard of a prudent lay person who felt that their condition was \nsuch that it required emergency medical evaluation, and if that \nstandard of a prudent lay person is met, then that individual should be \neligible, or the physicians or the emergency room which provided the \nservices, should be eligible for the reimbursement for the services \nwhich they provide.\n  As I say, that is the standard the Senate has adopted. It is the \nstandard increasingly States have adopted. It is the standard which the \nleaders in the health maintenance organization industry and the College \nof Emergency Physicians recommended be adopted.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment which will give peace of mind \nto millions of Americans and will help resolve the largest single \nsource of contention between Medicare beneficiaries, for whom we have a \nparticular responsibility, and health maintenance organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several articles and a \nletter to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          St. John Emergency Physicians, P.C.,\n\n                           Clifton Township, MI, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer R. Abraham,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: As you know, the Medicare portion of \n     Budget Reconciliation is currently being debated upon the \n     Senate Floor. I write to you with an urgent request to \n     support an amendment to be offered by Senator Bob Graham of \n     Florida regarding access to emergency medical services.\n\n\n                   an example of my own from michigan\n\n       I am the Vice Chief of Emergency Medicine at St. John \n     Hospital & Medical Center in Detroit. On March 21st of this \n     year a 46 year old female presented to our emergency \n     department. The patient was traveling in a car with her \n     husband when she experienced a sudden onset of shortness of \n     breath and then collapsed. She was rushed to our emergency \n     department by ambulance. To make a sad story short, despite \n     the best efforts of my colleague and the personnel in our \n     department, the patient unfortunately did not respond to any \n     sort of emergency treatment. She was pronounced dead. Cause \n     of death was cardiopulmonary arrest. (I've attached a copy of \n     the notes from this event.)\n       The patient belonged to Blue Care Network, a health \n     maintenance organization for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of \n     Michigan. Blue Care Network has denied coverage for these \n     services because the services were not pre-authorized. What \n     is even more disturbing is that the patient's husband has \n     been left with a bill of over $1,200.00 during this time of \n     personal loss.\n       Senator, this example speaks for itself. Even with the best \n     emergency medical transport and treatment available to us, \n     she died. There was no time to call the HMO ``gatekeeper'' to \n     get permission. There was no time for anyone to do anything \n     but to try and save this poor young woman's life. The denial \n     associated with this case is simply unbelievable.\n       This is why Senator Bob Graham's amendment concerning the \n     definition of an emergency is necessary. I urge your support \n     of his effort when he offers his amendment later today or \n     tomorrow. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           James M. Fox, M.D.,\n\n                                                       Vice Chief,\n     Department of Emergency Medicine.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   HMO, Emergency Docs Join to Seek Federal Standards for ER Coverage\n\n       HMO patients who make emergency room (ER) visits may \n     benefit from the unlikely alliance of a leading HMO company \n     and an emergency physician group jointly pushing for federal \n     standards that would make it harder to deny coverage for such \n     services.\n       Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and the American College of \n     Emergency Physicians are advocating standards for emergency \n     care coverage that include the controversial ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard.\n       ER coverage mandates, particularly the prudent layperson \n     language, have been a source of conflict between physicians \n     and the managed care industry.\n       Kaiser, the nation's second largest HMO chain, is trying to \n     get other managed care companies to support the standards, \n     but doesn't have any takers yet. The national HMO chain broke \n     with the managed care industry on the issue because at least \n     12 states have enacted varying ER coverage mandates, and \n     compliance with a national standard would be preferable.\n       The jointly developed standards would require managed care \n     plans to cover non-emergency services provided in an \n     emergency department if a prudent layperson would reasonably \n     think that his or her condition needed emergency treatment. \n     HMOs would have to cover medically necessary ER services \n     without preauthorization. Emergency MDs would have to notify \n     the plan within 30 minutes after the enrollee's condition is \n     stabilized to obtain authorization for promptly needed \n     services; HMOs would have 30 minutes to respond. If the HMO \n     and doctor couldn't agree on a post-stabilization treatment, \n     the plan would have to arrange alternate treatment.\n       Rep. Ben Cardin (D-Md) introduced legislation (HR 2011), \n     with over 140 co-sponsors, that's similar to what Kaiser and \n     the emergency docs are advocating. Although it is not \n     expected to pass this year, the issue expected to reemerge in \n     1997.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 9, 1995]\n\n H.M.O's Refusing Emergency Claims, Hospitals, Assert--Two Missions in \n                                Conflict\n\n\n    `managed care' groups insist they must limit costs--doctors are \n                               frustrated\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, July 8.--As enrollment in health maintenance \n     organizations soars, hospitals across the country report that \n     H.M.O.'s are increasingly denying claims for care provided in \n     hospital emergency rooms.\n       Such denials create obstacles to emergency care for H.M.O. \n     patients and can leave them responsible for thousands of \n     dollars in medical bills. The denials also frustrate \n     emergency room doctors, who say the H.M.O. practices \n     discourage patients from seeking urgently needed care. But \n     for their part, H.M.O.'s say their costs would run out of \n     control if they allowed patients unlimited access to hospital \n     emergency rooms.\n       How H.M.O.'s handle medical emergencies is an issue of \n     immense importance, given recent trends. Enrollment in \n     H.M.O.'s doubled in the last eight years, to 51 million, \n     partly because employers encouraged their use as a way to \n     help control costs.\n       In addition, Republicans and many Democrats in Congress say \n     they want to increase the use of H.M.O.'s because they \n     believe that such prepaid health plans will slow the growth \n     of Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and \n     the poor, which serve 73 million people at a Federal cost of \n     $267 billion this year.\n       Under Federal law, a hospital must provide ``an appropriate \n     medical screening examination'' to any patient who requests \n     care in its\n\n[[Page S10392]]\n\n     emergency room. The hospital must also provide any treatment \n     needed to stabilize the patient's condition.\n       Dr. Toni A. Mitchell, director of emergency care at Tampa \n     General Hospital in Florida, said: ``I am obligated to \n     provide the care, but the H.M.O. is not obligated to pay for \n     it. This is a new type of cost-shifting, a way for H.M.O.'s \n     to shift costs to patients, physicians and hospitals.''\n       Most H.M.O.'s promise to cover emergency medical services, \n     but there is no standard definition of the term. H.M.O.'s can \n     define it narrowly and typically reserve the right to deny \n     payment if they conclude, in retrospect, that the conditions \n     treated were not emergencies. Hospitals say H.M.O.'s often \n     refuse to pay for their members in such cases, even if H.M.O. \n     doctors sent the patients to the hospital emergency rooms. \n     Hospitals then often seek payment from the patient.\n       Dr. Stephan G. Lynn, director of emergency medicine at St. \n     Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, said: ``We are \n     getting more and more refusals by H.M.O.'s to pay for care in \n     the emergency room. The problem is increasing as managed care \n     becomes a more important source of reimbursement. Managed \n     care is relatively new in New York City, but it's growing \n     rapidly.''\n       H.M.O.'s emphasize regular preventive care, supervised by a \n     doctor who coordinates all the medical services that a \n     patient may need. The organizations try to reduce costs by \n     redirecting patients from hospitals to less expensive sites \n     like clinics and doctors' offices.\n       The disputes over specific cases reflect a larger clash of \n     missions and cultures. An H.M.O. is the ultimate form of \n     ``managed care,'' but emergencies are, by their very nature, \n     unexpected and therefore difficult to manage. Doctors in \n     H.M.O.'s carefully weigh the need for expensive tests or \n     treatments, but in an emergency room, doctors tend to do \n     whatever they can to meet the patient's immediate needs.\n       Each H.M.O. seems to have its own way of handling \n     emergencies. Large plans like Kaiser Permanente provide a \n     full range of emergency services around the clock at their \n     own clinics and hospitals. Some H.M.O.'s have nurses to \n     advise patients over the telephone. Some H.M.O. doctors take \n     phone calls from patients at night. Some leave messages on \n     phone answering machines, telling patients to go to hospital \n     emergency rooms if they cannot wait for the doctors' offices \n     to reopen.\n       At the United Healthcare Corporation, which runs 21 \n     H.M.O.'s serving 3.9 million people. ``It's up to the \n     physician to decide how to provide 24-hour coverage,'' said \n     Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, chief medical officer of the \n     Minneapolis-based company.\n       George C. Halvorson, chairman of the Group Health \n     Association of America, a trade group for H.M.O.'s, said he \n     was not aware of any problems with emergency care. ``This is \n     totally alien to me,'' said Mr. Halvorson, who is also \n     president of Health-Partners, an H.M.O. in Minneapolis. \n     Donald B. White, a spokesman for the association, said, ``We \n     just don't have data on emergency services and how they're \n     handled by different H.M.O.'s''.\n       About 3.4 million of the nation's 37 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries are in H.M.O.'s. Dr. Rodney C. Armstead, \n     director of managed care at the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, said the Government had received many \n     complaints about access to emergency services in such plans. \n     He recently sent letters to the 164 H.M.O.'s with Medicare \n     contracts, reminding them of their obligation to provide \n     emergency care.\n       Alan G. Raymond, vice president of the Harvard Community \n     Health Plan, based in Brookline, Mass., said, ``Employers are \n     putting pressure on H.M.O's to reduce inappropriate use of \n     emergency services because such care is costly and episodic \n     and does not fit well with the coordinated care that H.M.O.'s \n     try to provide.''\n       Dr. Charlotte S. Yeh, chief of emergency medicine at the \n     New England Medical Center, a teaching hospital in Boston, \n     said: H.M.O.'s are excellent at preventive care, regular \n     routine care. But they have not been able to cope with the \n     very unpredictable, unscheduled nature of emergency care. \n     They often insist that their members get approval before \n     going to a hospital emergency department. Getting prior \n     authorization may delay care.\n       ``In some ways, it's less frustrating for us to take care \n     of homeless people than H.M.O. members. At least, we can do \n     what we think is right for them, as opposed to trying to \n     convince an H.M.O. over the phone of what's the right thing \n     to do.''\n       Dr. Gary P. Young, chairman of the emergency department at \n     Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., said H.M.O.'s often \n     directed emergency room doctors to release patients or \n     transfer them to other hospitals before it was safe to do so. \n     ``This is happening every day,'' he said.\n       The PruCare H.M.O. in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, run by \n     the Prudential Insurance Company of America, promises ``rock \n     solid health coverage,'' but the fine print of its members' \n     handbook says, ``Failure to contact the primary care \n     physician prior to emergency treatment may result in a denial \n     of payment.''\n       typically, in an H.M.O., a family doctor or an internist \n     managing a patient's care serves as ``gatekeeper,'' \n     authorizing the use of specialists like cardiologists and \n     orthopedic surgeons. The H.M.O.'s send large numbers of \n     patients to selected doctors and hospitals; in return, they \n     receive discounts on fees. But emergencies are not limited to \n     times and places convenient to an H.M.O.'s list of doctors \n     and hospitals.\n       H.M.O.'s say they charge lower premiums than traditional \n     insurance companies because they are more efficient. But \n     emergency room doctors say that many H.M.O.'s skimp on \n     specialty care and rely on hospital emergency rooms to \n     provide such services, especially at night and on weekends.\n       Dr. David S. Davis, who works in the emergency department \n     at North Arundel Hospital in Glen Burnie, Md., said: \n     ``H.M.O.'s don't have to sign up enough doctors as long as \n     they have the emergency room as a safety net. The emergency \n     room is a backup for the H.M.O. in all it operations.'' Under \n     Maryland law, he noted, an H.M.O. must have a system to \n     provide members with access to doctors at all hours, but it \n     can meet this obligation by sending patients to hospital \n     emergency rooms.\n       To illustrate the problem, doctors offer this example: A \n     57-year-old man wakes up in the middle of the night with \n     chest pains. A hospital affiliated with his H.M.O. is 50 \n     minutes away, so he goes instead to a hospital just 10 blocks \n     from his home. An emergency room doctor orders several common \n     but expensive tests to determine if a heart attack has \n     occurred.\n       The essence of the emergency physician's art is the ability \n     to identify the cause of such symptoms in a patient whom the \n     doctor has never seen. The cause could be a heart attack. But \n     it could also be indigestion, heartburn, stomach ulcers, \n     anxiety, a panic attack, a pulled muscle or any of a number \n     of other conditions.\n       If the diagnostic examination and tests had not been \n     performed, the hospital and the emergency room doctors could \n     have been cited for violating Federal law.\n       But in such situations, H.M.O.'s often refuse to pay the \n     hospital, on the ground that the hospital had no contract \n     with the H.M.O., the chest pain did not threaten the \n     patient's life or the patient did not get authorization to \n     use a hospital outside the H.M.O. network.\n       Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, \n     said he would soon introduce a bill to help solve these \n     problems. The bill would require H.M.O.'s to pay for \n     emergency medical services and would establish a uniform \n     definition of emergency based on the judgment of ``a prudent \n     lay person.'' The bill would prohibit H.M.O.'s from requiring \n     prior authorization for emergency services. A health plan \n     could be fined $10,000 for each violation and $1 million for \n     a pattern of repeated violations.\n       The American College of Emergency Physicians, which \n     represents more than 15,000 doctors, has been urging Congress \n     to adopt such changes and supports the legislation.\n       When H.M.O.'s deny claims filed on behalf of Medicare \n     beneficiaries, the patients have a right to appeal. The \n     appeals are heard by a private consulting concern, the \n     Network Design Group of Pittsford, N.Y., which acts as agent \n     for the Government. The appeals total 300 to 400 a month, and \n     David A. Richardson, president of the company, said that a \n     surprisingly large proportion--about half of all Medicare \n     appeals--involved disagreements over emergencies or other \n     urgent medical problems.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, July 30, 1995]\n\n                HMOs in the ER: A View From the Trenches\n\n                         (By Paul R. Lindeman)\n\n       I arrived for my 12-hour shift in the Emergency Department \n     at 7 p.m. As the departing physician and I went over the \n     cases of the current patients, I was told the woman in Room 2 \n     was being transferred to a psychiatric facility. The patient \n     was pregnant, addicted to crack cocaine and had been assessed \n     as suicidal by a psychiatrist.\n       An obstetrician was required to care for the patient during \n     her stay at the mental health facility. The only two groups \n     of practicing obstetricians who were on this woman's HMO \n     ``panel'' and on staff at this facility both refused to \n     accept this high-risk case. That left this unfortunate woman, \n     and our staff, caught in the ``never-never land'' of managed \n     care.\n       When I left the Emergency Department at 7:30 the following \n     morning, she was still in Room 2. It took hospital \n     administrators and attorneys all day to arrange disposition, \n     and the patient was eventually transferred--at 6:30 that \n     evening.\n       Managed-care health plans typically limit choice of doctors \n     and hospitals and attempt to closely monitor services \n     provided. Their goal is to curb unnecessary tests and \n     hospitalizations to keep costs down. In the case of for-\n     profit managed-care companies, the additional purpose is \n     obvious. But what happens when managed care meets the \n     emergency room?\n       Federal law requires a screening exam at emergency \n     facilities, but HMOs are not required to pay. By exploiting \n     this fact, managed care is able to shift costs onto \n     hospitals, doctors and policyholders, thereby ``saving'' \n     money.\n       Consider the case of a 50-year-old male who awakes at 4 \n     a.m. with chest pain and goes to the hospital 10 blocks \n     away--instead of his HMO hospital an extra 30 minutes away. \n     After examination and testing, it's determined that the \n     patient is not having a heart attack and that it's safe for \n     him to go home.\n       His diagnosis is submitted on a claim form with a code for \n     ``gastritis.''\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\n       His insurance company denies payment, stating that \n     ``gastritis'' is not an emergency. As a result, the hospital \n     and the company who employs the emergency department \n     physician both bill the patient.\n       While this ``retrospectoscope'' is widely employed and an \n     industry standard for denying payment, there are many other \n     ``savings'' techniques. For instance, many HMOs require \n     ``pre-authorization'' to treat a patient in the ER.\n       Consider now a 60-year-old female who arrives at the \n     emergency room complaining also of chest pain. The triage \n     nurse examines the patient, obtaining a brief history and \n     vital signs. A call is placed to the insurance company and a \n     recorded message is obtained without specific instruction \n     regarding emergencies. The patient is treated but the payment \n     is denied. Reason: Authorization was never obtained.\n       Here's an alternate scenario, same patient, again waiting \n     for pre-authorization. (Noncritical patients often wait for \n     more than an hour.) This time ``the insurance company'' \n     answers the phone. Reading from a list, a series of questions \n     is asked, limited almost exclusively to obtaining recorded \n     numbers. Based on these numbers, the individual speaking for \n     the company determines that it is safe for the patient to be \n     transferred to its hospital. The emergency physician \n     disagrees. The patient stays and is admitted to the hospital.\n       The HMO denies payment for the ER visit and the 24-hour \n     hospitalization, stating that the patient should have been \n     transferred. Again, the patient/policyholder, who pays a \n     monthly premium for his or her insurance, is billed for all \n     hospital and physician services.\n       The representative for the insurance company who decides on \n     pre-authorization can range from someone with no medical \n     background at all to another physician (albeit with a vested \n     economic incentive). Generally the level of expertise is \n     somewhere between this. Thus, the near-Orwellian scenario \n     frequently plays out whereby a doctor who has seen and \n     examined a patient is trying to convince a nurse, over the \n     telephone, that a patient is sick.\n       Rudy Braccili Jr., business operations director for the \n     North Broward Hospital District, was quoted in The Herald as \n     saying. ``It's just a game they play to avoid paying, and \n     it's one of the ways they save money. They do not see the \n     realities of people who in the middle of the night come into \n     emergency rooms.'' He estimates that North District hospitals \n     have lost millions of dollars a year because of HMOs' \n     reluctance to pay bills.\n       Part of the problem is that what managed-care organizations \n     are trying to do is often quite difficult: determine \n     prospectively which patients are truly deserving of \n     emergency-room care. Indeed, this may in fact be a Catch-22. \n     I know of no way to accurately discern acute appendicitis \n     from a ``tummy ache'' without a history and physical \n     examination. Furthermore, medicine does not always lend \n     itself to black and white. For instance, is a woman who \n     screams and gyrates hysterically as a result of a squirming \n     cockroach in her car an emergency?!\n       Unfortunately, problems with HMOs in the ER go beyond cost \n     shifting and denial of payment. They often turn an otherwise \n     brief encounter into a harrowing ordeal. Another example from \n     ``the trenches'' is illustrative.\n       Our patient this time is an 85-year-old woman with a hip \n     fracture. But instead of being admitted, her HMO mandates \n     that she be transferred across town to the emergency \n     department at another facility where they contract their \n     surgical hip repairs. The patient waits three hours for the \n     HMO ambulance service, which is ``backed up.''\n       Consumers note: Had the patient not sold her Medicare \n     privileges to this HMO, she would have been admitted to our \n     hospital uneventfully in a fraction of the time required to \n     complete her managed-care sojourn.\n       No matter how well trained or talented the emergency \n     physician, there are also times when she or he requires the \n     urgent services of a consultant to provide definitive care \n     for a patient (for instance, vascular and orthopedic surgeons \n     to repair a severely traumatized limb). In these cases, \n     delays in care due to managed-care bureaucracy can become a \n     legitimate hazard to the patient.\n       Dr. Charlotte S. Yeh. chief of emergency medicine at the \n     New England Medical Center, has said. ``In some ways, it's \n     less frustrating for us to take care of homeless people than \n     HMO members. At least we can do what we think is right for \n     them, as opposed to trying to convince an HMO over the phone \n     of what's the right thing to do.''\n       In my experience that is not an exaggeration. In the \n     emergency department, the homeless--while certainly deserving \n     of medical care--often receive better and more prompt care \n     than the HMO policyholder.\n       Conventional political wisdom holds that health-care reform \n     is dead. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. \n     Reform has been taking place at breakneck speed entirely \n     independent of Washington. In the last five to 10 years, \n     managed-care companies and the private sector have changed \n     profoundly the manner in which many Americans now receive \n     their health care.\n       As for-profit managed care has usurped decision-making \n     authority from physicians, so have they also diverted funds \n     from hospitals, physicians and policyholders to their own \n     CEOs and stockholders. Last year, HMO profits grew by more \n     than 15 percent with the four largest HMOs each reporting \n     more than $1 billion in profits. What Democrats and \n     Republicans alike fail to appreciate is that the allegiance \n     of managed care is to neither the patient nor the reduction \n     of the federal deficit, but to its CEOs and stockholders.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. KERREY. Does the Senator wish to request the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays, unless the \nmanagers of the bill are prepared to accept this amendment. If they are \nso prepared, I will waive the yeas and nays. If not, I will ask for \nthem.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator from Florida will yield, we have a Member \nwho is on his way who wants to look at this amendment, perhaps talk on \nit. Whether we can accept it might be premature right now. If the \nSenator will just withhold that request.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to ask for the yeas and nays, \nand if this amendment is capable of being accepted, I will ask that \nrequest be vitiated and will accept a voice vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment of the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. HATCH. It has not been adopted yet?\n  Mr. KERREY. Do you want to set it aside and go to the Biden \namendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside so we can return to the Biden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5315 to Amendment No. 5295\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide a penalty \nfor the use of a controlled substance with the intent to commit a crime \n          of violence, including rape, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an amendment to the Biden \namendment, both of which address a horrible problem of considerable \nconcern to this body and, indeed, to everyone in this country who has \nbecome aware of it.\n  Several months ago, law enforcement officers began to find an unusual \nphenomenon: that unscrupulous men were abusing a prescription drug to \ntake advantage of women, particularly young women, by sedating them and \nraping them.\n  That drug, Rohypnol--or, as it is called on the street, ``roofies''--\nis a sedative marketed in literally dozens of countries.\n  Rohypnol is not sold legally in the United States, nor can it be, \nbecause the manufacturer made the business decision that the already-\ncrowded market for sedatives did not warrant the considerable time and \nexpense of subjecting the product to the lengthy Food and Drug \nAdministration approval process.\n  Rohypnol is one of the widely used class of prescription medications \nknown as benzodiazepine. These Valium-like drugs are commonly used to \ntreat anxiety, sleep disorders, seizure disorders, and muscle spasms. \nRohypnol is currently approved for human use in 64 countries.\n  Many of my colleagues have seen reports about the use of Rohypnol in \ndate rape, during which men have apparently placed Rohypnol in their \ndate's drink and then, after the drug has taken effect, proceeded with \na sexual assault.\n  In response to the growing abuse of Rohypnol, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration instituted the formal rescheduling process for this drug \nby submitting a request on April 11, 1996, to the Food and Drug \nAdministration to conduct an evaluation of the scientific and medical \nissues with regard to Rohypnol. That evaluation, an appropriate \nexamination of the law enforcement and the health aspects of Rohypnol \nuse, is continuing and ongoing.\n  In a letter from Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala \nto me on July 24, 1996, Secretary Shalala said that the goal of the \nrescheduling process was to make Rohypnol subject to increased \npenalties for illicit use and trafficking.\n  Since this particular drug has become an agent of abuse and the focus \nof considerable debate, I agree with Secretary Shalala that it is \nappropriate to increase the penalties for illegal trafficking in \nRohypnol.\n  The amendment that I have just filed accomplishes that purpose, \nwithout depriving 64 countries of a drug that they find to be safe and \nefficacious, a drug which we have every reason to believe would have \nbeen found to be safe and efficacious in this country if the company \nwere willing to go through our arduous and lengthy Food and Drug \nAdministration approval procedures.\n  The drug comes into our country is clandestinely, generally through \nMexico, and certainly not legally. And the company that produces \nRohypnol has nothing to do with that.\n  Mr. President, none of us are sure how many times these drug-induced \nrapes have occurred.\n  As far as I am concerned, one occurrence is one too many. I find that \nsituation deplorable; it is a heinous crime for someone to use any \nsedative for the purpose of date-raping a partner.\n  Our amendment is a strike back at those who would use controlled \nsubstances to engage in the most reprehensible of crimes--that is, \nrape. That is why we need the toughened penalties for the illegal use \nof Rohypnol, which is what Senator Coverdell and I are advocating with \nthis amendment.\n  The approach advocated in the Biden amendment, to reschedule the drug \nto schedule I, is seriously flawed.\n  My major concern is that schedule I is the most restrictive category, \nwhich is reserved for the drugs which have a high potential for abuse, \ndrugs which have no currently accepted medical use in treatment, and \ndrugs for which there is a lack of accepted safety for use under \nmedical supervision. That is what a schedule I drug is.\n  These standards clearly do not apply to Rohypnol, a member of the \nbenzodiazepine class which generally falls within the less restrictive \nschedule IV.\n  If the United States were to single out this drug and place it in \nschedule I, it would send a strong, and inappropriate, signal to other \ncountries that we find there is no medical use for Rohypnol. Such a \nsignal would be false.\n  To reschedule Rohypnol this way simply is not right. It could \nunfairly result in the drug being rescheduled in some of the 64 other \ncountries where it is not being abused as it is in the United States, \nwhere it is being used safely and efficaciously as a legitimate \nsedative.\n  Rohypnol is no different from any other drug in its class, and many \nhealth care professions are fearful that if this benzodiazepine were \nremoved from clinical use, ultimately the others will be removed also, \nif and when they are implicated in similar crimes.\n  These pharmaceuticals are some of the most beneficial drugs in some \nof the most difficult areas of medical treatment, such as mental \nhealth.\n  Mr. President, the more appropriate--and expeditious--alternative \nthat we offer today is to impose all the penalties that apply to \nschedule I drugs to Rohypnol without rescheduling the drug.\n  Specifically, our amendment would create an express violation under \nthe Controlled Substances Act for unlawful distribution, with intent to \ncommit a crime of violence, including rape, of a controlled substance \nto a person without that person's knowledge. The penalty will be up to \n20 years without probation, and fines will be imposed of up to $2 \nmillion for an individual. The definition of ``crime of violence'' is \nprovided in section 16 of title 18 of the United States Code.\n  We believe our amendment advocates the appropriate way to solve this \nproblem. It does not interfere with the safe and efficacious use of a \ndrug which is approved in 64 countries, but not our own.\n  I think my colleagues should agree it is not the manufacturer's fault \nthat people are abusing this drug, bringing it across the border so it \ncan be abused in this country in the way that Senator Biden has so ably \nexplained. I deplore the situation as much as he; I just do not agree \nwith his proposed solution to the problem.\n  The Hatch-Coverdell amendment also provides enhanced penalties for \nmanufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing with the intent \nto manufacture, dispense, or distribute large quantities of the drug \nflunitrazepam, marketed as Rohypnol. One gram or more of the drug will \ncarry a penalty of not more than 20 years in prison and 30 milligrams a \npenalty of not more than 5 years in prison. In addition, the amendment \nextends the so-called long-arm provisions of 21 U.S.C. 959(a) to the \nunlawful manufacture and distribution of flunitrazepam outside the \nUnited States with the intent to import it unlawfully into this \ncountry. It also directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend the \nsentencing guidelines so flunitrazepam will be subject to the same base \noffense level as schedule I or II depressants.\n  Finally, at the request of law enforcement officials, we have added a \nnew penalty for unlawful simple possession of Rohypnol. Law enforcement \nofficers have indicated to me their concern that they need additional \ntools to apprehend would-be rapists before the crime is committed. \nAccordingly, the final provision provides increased penalties for \nsimple possession of flunitrazepam of not more than 3 years.\n  Mr. President, it has become obvious that we have a serious problem \nin this country with abuse of drugs by teenagers. While the \noverwhelming abuse of drugs by teenagers focuses on illicit drugs, the \nillegal diversion and misuse of medicines is also a growing problem in \nour country.\n  And I have to say that many manufacturers are concerned that if the \nUnited States takes the approach advocated by the Senator from \nDelaware,\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\nthen we could end up harming many people who need benzodiazepines \nthroughout the world. In other words, what my colleague is \ncontemplating could end up affecting all drugs in this class of \nsedatives, drugs which are of value. And this would work to the \ndetriment of patients all over this country, and indeed, all over the \nworld.\n  I believe that the Federal Government must show it will not tolerate \nthe use of this drug--or any drug--to facilitate rape. It is necessary \nand prudent that the Congress act, and approval of our amendment would \nbe a good start.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I must point out that 64 other countries \nhave found this drug to be safe and efficacious. The manufacturer has \nchosen not to market it in this country because of the cost of the \nlengthy approval process at the FDA and the number of other similar \nproducts on the market.\n  I cannot fault the manufacturer for that decision, because the drug \napproval process is too lengthy, in my estimation. Studies have shown \napproval times can extend from 10 to 15 years, at a cost of half a \nbillion dollars. Approval of this drug probably would not have taken \nthat long, but who knows? Of course, we will never know, because the \nmanufacturer made the conscious choice not to introduce Rohypnol in the \nAmerican market.\n  The fact remains that use of these controlled substances in violent \ncrimes, such as rape, ought to result in a sure-fire penalty, a penalty \nwhich sends the signal to would-be perpetrators that the United States \nwill not tolerate such crimes. That is what our amendment does.\n  If we want to do something about the misuse of this drug and other \ndrugs of a similar nature, the benzodiazepines, then it seems to me \nthis is the way to do it--impose tough penalties, let people know there \nare tough penalties, see a few people go to jail for years. Perhaps \nthen we will find such drugs will not be abused anymore in this \ncountry. That is the signal we should be sending.\n  So, I hope my colleagues will support this amendment, because it is \nan important amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from Delaware for raising this issue. He has \nbeen one of the principal legislators raising the issue about date \nrape. I give him a lot of credit for that.\n  I give him credit for this amendment, as well, as I do my dear \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, who has worked very closely \nwith me in formulating this amendment and bringing it to the floor \ntoday.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hatch-\nCoverdell amendment. It has been an honor to work with Senator Hatch, \nwith his longstanding efforts to engage the drug war.\n  I point out to my colleagues in the Senate that just last week we \ndiscovered the first death from Rohypnol, a young teenager who \napparently was given Rohypnol in a drink of soda, who has now lost her \nlife as a result of this awful drug, and some predator yet to be \ndiscovered.\n  The Hatch amendment embraces the legislation that I introduced \nshortly after our hearing where we heard from two young American \nfemales who were stricken and the victims of predators with this drug \ncalled Rohypnol. It is important to note that Rohypnol cannot be \ndetected: You cannot smell it; you cannot see it; and you cannot taste \nit.\n  The effect of our amendment is to say that anybody who uses Rohypnol \nor any other drug as a weapon, becomes a predator against someone, who \ncreates a victim, will be subject to increased penalties of up to 20 \nyears. So this legislation, just as the Senator from Utah said, puts \nwould-be abusers of this drug and would-be predators of this drug on \nnotice. And, hopefully, as in the case of several other drugs in our \nhistory, we will be able to corral them through, in a sense, the \nwarning system that this legislation creates. It creates a new Federal \ncrime if you use a drug as a predator, as a weapon, against a victim.\n  So I rise in support of this amendment and urge our colleagues to \npass it. I think that the quicker we make it clear how tough we are \ngoing to be on Rohypnol or the date rape drug--and it is a bipartisan \neffort; Senator Biden, from Delaware, has been working on this for some \ntime--the more likely we are to make it clear that it is a danger.\n  The packaging and other features of this drug have made some \nteenagers almost view it as a safe drug. This stuff is a clear \nknockout. Ten minutes and you do not know what hit you. Worse yet, you \ncannot remember anywhere from 24 to 72 hours what happened. All you \nhave to do is go to one hearing and hear one victim tell you what \ntranspired with this awful drug in the hands of a predator, and you not \nonly will be supporting this amendment, but you probably will be trying \nto think of how we can improve it and make it more effective than even \nthis.\n  So, Mr. President, I do rise in support of the amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5244\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I now ask that the Senate return to the \nKohl amendment No. 5244.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment. This \namendment basically makes the possession of a firearm in a school a \nFederal offense. I share the concern of my colleague from Wisconsin \nabout the growing problem we have about guns in schools, but I simply \nbelieve we cannot afford to start federalizing every offense that \nStates have traditionally been called upon to handle.\n  This is not only traditionally a State matter with regard to the law \nenforcement matter, it is also involving another traditional State \nmatter in terms of education. So you have law enforcement with regard \nto an educational institution, two matters traditionally handled by the \nState which we are now seeking to federalize.\n  One of the findings in the amendment is that States and localities in \nschool systems find it almost impossible to handle gun-related crimes \nby themselves. Even States, localities, and school systems that have \nmade strong efforts to prevent and punish gun-related crimes find their \nefforts unavailing, due in part to the failure or inability of other \nStates or localities to take strong measures.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that is a valid finding that this \nCongress ought to make. My understanding is that 48 States, I believe, \nhave passed legislation dealing in this very area. States should be \nleft to address this particular problem in ways that they see fit. They \nmay be more effective on a State and local level in determining how to \naddress this problem than we in Washington, DC, for example. There \nmight be some States that have had inducements to inform on violators. \nSome States have gone in the direction of voluntary surrender of guns, \nwith amnesty provided. Some States penalize parents for failure to \nsupervise children, as my State in Tennessee has done.\n  I do not believe that we should be taking an area which has \ntraditionally been under the auspice of State and local government, and \ntax people at that level, and then bring the money to Washington to put \nin the hands of Federal officials to enforce these laws.\n  Schools do have problems with guns. Part of it has to do with the \nbreakdown in discipline. Part of it has to do with regulations that \nhave been placed on schools and lawsuits that schools have been \nsubjected to, making it more difficult for schools to effectively \nhandle all kinds of disciplinary problems, including guns in schools. \nThey have not been suffering from a lack of FBI agents going around \nschools investigating these matters. They are serious enough offenses \nof a traditional Federal nature for FBI agents to be investigating. We \ndo not need this.\n  This bill is very similar to a bill that Congress passed by voice \nvote in 1990, the gun-free school zone law, which made it a Federal \noffense for any person to possess a gun in a school. The Supreme Court \nruled it unconstitutional and said it was beyond the power of Congress \nto regulate in regulating interstate commerce and held that gun \npossession is not an economic activity\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nthat substantially affected interstate commerce.\n  At a time when the Supreme Court is telling us that you cannot just \nhave some theoretical basis, some very attenuated basis for interstate \ncommerce, we once again are making an attempt at the Federal level. Of \ncourse, it is a very popular issue, but is an attempt at the Federal \nlevel to federalize another State and local matter.\n\n  I think Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion in that case is just as \ninstructive today as it was back then. He said were the Federal \nGovernment to take over the regulation of entire areas of traditional \nState concern, areas having nothing to do with the regulation of \ncommercial activities, the boundaries between the spheres of Federal \nand State authority would blur and political responsibility would \nbecome illusionary. I think he is absolutely right. I think that States \nand local governments need to know it is their responsibility. People \nin these communities need to know it is their responsibility and they \ncannot pass off any problem that comes down the pike to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This amendment would do nothing in terms of additional funding to \nrectify the problem. It would do nothing in terms of metal detectors or \nany other supervisory personnel or anything to assist any teachers, or \nanything of that nature. It would simply allow Federal agents to come \ninto these schools and make a Federal crime out of this traditional \nState area and further load up our Federal dockets, which are now \ntrying to stay afloat as it is.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I am very sympathetic with the problem. It \nis something that we are all dealing with in one way or another. As \nchairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, we certainly spent a lot \nof time in dealing with the problem that we have among our young people \ntoday. Part of that has to do with schools. Part of that has to do with \nguns. But keep the responsibility where it is. Do not get so caught up \nin trying to make a point, as popular as it might be, temporarily, that \nwe one by one by one federalize shoplifting or federalize illegal \nparking or whatever happens to be the rage at the moment, and we wind \nup with one system at the Federal level, Federal agents handling \neverything, and as soon as we perceive a new problem, everybody in the \nState and local level thinks of the Federal Government first.\n  That is not the way we have traditionally handled these matters in \nthis country. That is not the way we need to proceed in order to make \nsure we keep that separation between State and local and Federal \nGovernment. So at a time when so many of us are trying to move more and \nmore responsibility back to the States and closer to the people who \nknow how to handle it more effectively, I think it would be indeed \nironic for us to be taking this matter, which for 200 years has been \nthe responsibility of State and local government, and federalize it.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are far many more disparities than the \ndisparities that just relate to health insurance. As a matter of fact, \nconditions of employment are substantially different for individuals in \nthe Federal Government from individuals in the private sector who do \nbusiness with the Federal Government.\n  One of the most substantial areas in which there are significant \ndifferences between those who work for the Federal Government and those \nwho are in the private sector who contract with or provide services to \nthe Federal Government is in the area of the opportunity for employees \nand employers to cooperate for work schedules which are helpful to \nfamilies or for employees to opt to take compensatory time instead of \nto take time and a half in terms of overtime pay.\n  One of the serious tensions that exists in the workplace today is the \ntension between the demands of the home environment and the demands of \nthe work environment. The Federal Government addressed this a long time \nago. We began in the late forties by having compensatory time available \nto Federal workers, and then in the 1980's, or in the late 1970's and \ninto the 1980's, we began experimenting with allowing\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\ncooperation between Federal workers and their employers to provide for \nflexible time arrangements for work, so that in the Federal Government, \nat the option of the worker, you can work a little more than 40 hours \nin 1 week in order to take some time off the next week, or vice versa.\n  The idea is that if your daughter, for example, is getting an award \nat the high school sometime on a Friday afternoon, you can say to your \nemployer, ``If I can make up the time on Monday, will that be \nallowable?'' And with that 80-hour work frame instead of the 40-hour \nwork frame, that is something that can be done. It is achievable.\n  The Daschle amendment really seeks to provide an equity between those \nwho work in the Federal Government and those who do Federal-type \nresponsibilities but are working in the private area. It does so in the \narea of health care. My second-degree amendment is to take that \nphilosophy and extend it to other benefits, benefits that help both the \nworker and the employer in a special way.\n  The GAO, for example, has studied the situation at the Federal level \nand found that the flex time opportunities and the compensatory time \nopportunities that are available to workers under the Federal system \nhave resulted in substantial work satisfaction among Federal workers in \nthis respect. The satisfaction was attendant by higher productivity, \nand the satisfaction resulted in a greater return on the resource that \nwas devoted; on the tax dollars that were being spent, we received more \nfor our money.\n  If that works for Federal workers in the setting of their Federal \nemployment, I think it should work for the private workers who are \nworking side by side frequently with the Federal employees on jobs, \ndoing contracts frequently in the same work setting and the same work \nenvironment. Yet, we have a different set of work rules. And if the \nthrust and effect of the Daschle amendment would be to extend benefits \nthat are consistent with the Federal job site to those who are working \nin conjunction with the Federal job site vis-a-vis health, it seems to \nme it is more than reasonable to say those things that would enhance \nthe productivity, those things that would increase the capacity of the \ncontractor to work effectively to fulfill his or her contract with the \nFederal Government is important, as well.\n\n  In my office recently I received a letter from a contractor who works \nwith the Federal Government, and he complains that his employees work \nside by side with Federal Government employees and there is an ability \non the part of the Federal employees to accumulate comp time and to use \ncomp time instead of overtime because they want to spend time with \ntheir families rather than increase their earnings, for example, and \nthat there are flex time opportunities for the Federal employees, but \nhis employees who work right alongside them in the same work \nenvironment are subjected to a different set of work rules, a different \nset of benefits.\n  It simply does not make sense to have this duplicity in the \nworkplace, especially when we have had the transition in the way people \naccommodate work and home life. If you will look, 35 years ago when the \nlabor relations laws of this country were created, only 18.6 percent of \nmarried women with a spouse present and children under 6 years of age \nwere in the labor force. By 1990, nearly 60 percent of such women were \nin the labor force.\n  A 1985 survey of the Federal employees participating with Federal \nwork schedules found 72 percent said they had more flexibility to spend \ntime with their families; 74 percent said the schedules improved their \nmorale. It seems to me that if these are benefits to being involved in \nthe workplace and the thrust of the amendment is to extend the benefits \nsimilar to those that would have been earned in the Federal workplace \nto those who are contracting with the Federal Government, we ought to \nextend these flexible work time benefits, these compensatory time \nbenefits, the potential of compressed workweek benefits that have been \na part of the Federal Government for years now.\n  It is not that these are just something new to the Federal \nGovernment. In the late 1970's an experiment was begun and that \nexperiment, or pilot project, was renewed over and over again until the \nmid-1980's, when it was decided that the program was simply so \nsuccessful that it should be extended to Federal employees generally. \nSo that in the mid-1980's, the Federal Government employees were \naccorded, on a broad scale, this benefit. Some in the executive branch \nwere not accorded the benefit. And just 2 or 3 years ago, President \nClinton, in an Executive order, extended these benefits to other \nFederal employees, recognizing their value to the employees in terms of \nthe ability of employees to work effectively on their jobs and \naccommodate the needs of their families and recognizing the value of \nthese rules to the Government.\n  It occurs to me the extension of these rules to those who contract \nwith the Government, both the executive and legislative branches, is \nthe better part of wisdom. We have seen these rules work very \neffectively for the achievement of governmental objectives. And when we \nare talking about individuals who are licensed or contracting with the \nFederal Government, it seems to me, in the achievement of those \nobjectives for the Federal Government, these work rules ought to apply. \nIt is in that respect that I have submitted this amendment and I \nbelieve it ought to be acted upon favorably by the Senate.\n  Favorable action here says to the work force of America: We respect \nthe kind of tension you feel between work and home. We will help you \naccommodate those tensions as well as you can. And that will result in \ngreater productivity, in more being done because the workers have \nhigher morale and better capacity under this kind of situation. It is \nwith that in mind I offer this second-degree amendment to the Daschle \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield? If my colleague will yield, I \njust got the amendment. I have been trying to get the amendment. Does \nthis apply to Federal workers only or does this apply to the entire \nwork force?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. As I think my colleague from Illinois knows, I would \nlike to apply this to the work force generally, but this applies to \ncompanies doing business with the U.S. Government, in a sense as a part \nof being consistent with the underlying amendment which sought to \nextend benefits, in the Daschle amendment, to those who are doing \nbusiness with the Federal Government and had a relationship that \nprovided a basis for a comparison of health care benefits.\n  Mr. SIMON. I do not know whether I am for or against his amendment \nnow. If we can avoid voting for a little while, while we consult with \nsome people on this, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I asked for the yeas and nays, but I have no objection \nto the vote not being taken immediately. I have no objection to a pause \nbetween the yeas and nays being ordered and the vote being taken.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in line with what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri just said, I ask unanimous consent this temporarily be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The amendment to the \namendment will be temporarily set aside.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I support the Regulatory Accounting \namendment offered by Senator Stevens. Senator Levin and I have worked \nwith our Governmental Affairs Committee chairman, Senator Stevens, to \nrefine the language since it was initially added to the Treasury, \nPostal appropriations bill. While I have reservations about legislating \non appropriations, the result of our collaborative effort is a bi-\npartisan amendment that should be supported. It will provide one \nsignificant step towards regulatory reform, a goal to which I continue \nto be committed.\n  Government regulation has proven an important element in our Nation's \neffort to protect public health and safety, restore our natural \nenvironment, and provide for the welfare of the American people. I \nbelieve, however, that our Government often relies too\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\nheavily on regulation, for example, without considering costs that can \nsignificantly burden businesses, State and local governments, or \nindividuals.\n  Our task in regulatory reform is to address the excesses and \nweaknesses of our regulatory system without undermining the protections \nit has provided. As I said many times during the regulatory reform \ndebate of this Congress, true regulatory reform must strike a balance \nbetween the public's concern over too much government and the public's \nstrong support for regulations to protect the environment, public \nhealth and safety.\n  A necessary element of true regulatory reform is the development of \nobjective information on which to base and question regulatory \ndecisions. The amendment before us today should assist in this regard.\n  The proposal for an estimate of the costs and benefits of all Federal \nregulation was first made this Congress in our bipartisan Governmental \nAffairs Committee regulatory reform bill (S. 291). It was also in \nsubsequent bills. A modified version was most recently added to the \nTreasury, Postal appropriations bill (H.R. 3756) during the Senate \nAppropriations Committee markup. Senator Stevens' floor amendment--\namendment No. 5226--refines that language, revising section 645 of H.R. \n3756. The revised language reflects a collaborative effort by Senator \nStevens, Senator Levin, and me to craft a practical requirement for a \nuseful report on Federal regulation.\n  Under the amendment, OMB will compile in a one-time report existing \nanalyses and estimates of regulatory costs and benefits, both in terms \nof estimates of the total annual costs and benefits of all Federal \nregulation and in terms of specific major rules--these would be the \nsignificant rules that have gone through OMB regulatory review with a \ncost/benefit analysis. OMB will also provide a discussion of those \ncosts and benefits as direct and indirect impacts on sectors of our \nNation. This assessment should encompass not only various estimates of \nimpacts, but also alternative approaches to making such estimates.\n  In each of these steps, OMB will not have to engage in extensive \nanalyses of its own, but rather is expected to use existing \ninformation. The sponsors of this amendment are aware of OMB's resource \nconstraints and intend that the report be based on a compilation of \nexisting information, rather than new analysis. OMB should insure, of \ncourse, that all considerations of costs and benefits take into account \nrelevant quantifiable and nonquantifiable impacts. For example, \nvisibility over the Grand Canyon is important to our country, yet is \ndifficult to value as an economic benefit. Thus, to be useful in \nregulatory decisionmaking, cost/benefit analyses must be able to \naddress both quantifiable and nonquantifiable impacts.\n  Finally, the amendment requires OMB to provide recommendations for \nreforming existing regulatory programs along with a description of \nsignificant public comments made on its report before submission to \nCongress. The recommendations for reform should include programs that \nshould be eliminated or altered because, for example, they are too \nburdensome or are obsolete, as well as programs that should be \nstrengthened to more effectively implement public policy.\n  While the study of regulatory costs and benefits is far from an exact \nscience, and definitely does not provide the detail or accuracy of \nfinancial accounting, it is an area of study in which we do need to \ndevelop more widely accepted measures and methodologies. The OMB report \nshould highlight areas in which analysis is clear and productive and \nthose areas in which more work is needed to refine analytic techniques. \nIt should also suggest approaches for analyzing non-quantitative \nimpacts and for integrating them with economic analyses. In these ways, \nthe OMB report should provide an important service by informing \nagencies, Congress, and the public about evaluating the costs and \nbenefits of Federal regulation.\n\n\n                         regulatory accounting\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the managers of the bill have accepted an \namendment by Senator Stevens which would require the Office of \nManagement and Budget to submit, no later than September 30, 1997, a \nreport to Congress that provides estimates of the total costs of \nFederal regulatory programs currently in place. I have agreed to \nsupport this amendment because of a number of changes Senator Stevens \nwas willing to make to the amendment.\n  As many of us know, there are several figures that are routinely used \nto decry the cost of regulation. Some reference a study that say \nregulation costs each of us $6,000 a year. Others reference studies \nthat say the total cost of regulation is some $600 billion. These \nnumbers are bandied about in an effort to drive home the message that \nregulation is expensive and to push for legislation to limit \nregulation.\n  Senator Glenn recently had GAO look at one of these studies to \ndetermine whether it used appropriate and reasonable methods. The GAO \nanalysis was critical of the private study and highlighted several \npoints at which the assumptions used were inappropriate or highly \nquestionable.\n  Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, \nissued a report earlier this year in which he attempted to ascertain \nwhether Federal regulation results in net benefits. Mr. Hahn concluded \nthat, taken in aggregate, the net benefits from Federal environmental, \nhealth and safety regulations from 1990-1995 are $280 billion. This \nfigure is calculated as total benefits minus total costs.\n  However, when Mr. Hahn examined individual regulations, he found that \nless than 50 percent do not pass a cost-benefit test (total benefits \nless total costs). But since most of those regulations giving net costs \nwere in the $0-10 billion dollar range, while most of those giving net \nbenefits were in the $10-100 billion range, in the aggregate the \nregulations give a large net benefit.\n  This finding suggests that any aggregate number may not be as useful \nin understanding the quality of our Federal regulatory programs as \nanalysis of each individual program. For example, Mr. Hahn found that \nsafety regulations pass cost-benefit analyses more often than health \nregulations and that the Clean Air Act regulations give significantly \nlarger benefits than any other program.\n  This amendment would ask the Office of Management and Budget to come \nup with its best estimate of not only the costs of our Federal \nregulatory programs, but also the benefits of such programs. It would \nput to use the best information the Federal agencies have about the \nimpact of the various Federal regulatory programs.\n\n  The amendment does not, and this is why I am able to support it, does \nnot require OMB to conduct new studies or analyses or develop new data \nor information. That would be a time-consuming, and expensive use of \ntaxpayer money. Better that the OMB staff use its time and money to \nhelp make new regulations follow the dictates of common sense and be \ncost-effective regulations.\n  No, this amendment simply directs OMB to put together the already \navailable information that it has on existing Federal regulatory \nprograms and use that to estimate the total annual costs and benefits \nof each. If information is unavailable, or such estimates are not \npossible, then the OMB should tell us in the report what is not \navailable and why and describe the extent to which the OMB estimates \nare or are not reliable.\n  In doing his analysis, Mr. Hahn found that if cost-benefit analysis \nis to play a greater role in agency rule making, the quality of the \nanalysis should be improved dramatically. Changes that he thinks would \nimprove the quality of analysis include: standardizing and summarizing \nkey economic assumptions; using best estimates and appropriate ranges \nto reflect uncertainty; and introducing peer review of the analyses and \nputting more weight on peer-reviewed scholarship. He recommends that \nOMB develop a standard format for presenting results in a clear and \nsuccinct manner. The report required by this amendment could be helpful \nin achieving that goal.\n  Mr. President, in a way, this is an experiment to see what we already \nhave available to us, if it were put together in a useable format. It \nis a one-time only report which we can then use to determine the \nutility of continuing the requirement.\n  The report by OMB is also to include the estimates of the costs and \nbenefits of the major rules that are in effect, an\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\nassessment of the direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules on both \nthe public and private sector, and any recommendations from OMB about \nrevising a Federal regulatory program to make it more effective or \nefficient. Reporting on the costs and benefits of major rules is \nexpected to require no more than reporting, in an organized and \nreadable manner, the cost-benefit analyses of the major rules in effect \nthat were already done prior to promulgation. To the extent there is \nup-dated information that would change the estimates in those analyses, \nsuch updates should be included in this part of the report if it is \navailable.\n  The assessment of impacts is intended to be a narrative discussion of \nOMB's opinion on this subject. It does not require additional \ninformation gathering; rather, the intent, here, is that the Director \nuse the information contained in the report on the costs and benefits \nof Federal regulatory programs and describe the expected impacts of \nsuch programs on State and local governments, business, and \nindividuals. Flowing from this assessment would be any recommendations \nthe Director may have to improve the existing regulatory programs.\n\n  Mr. President, cost-benefit analysis has been at the heart of the \nregulatory reform debate for the past decade. Those who are \nknowledgeable in the field will agree that it is more art than science.\n  Mr. Hahn, in the report I earlier mentioned stated, ``Despite my \nenthusiasm for cost-benefit analysis, I am leery about proposals that \nrequire the agency head to implement regulations solely on the basis of \nwhether benefits exceed costs. Given the uncertainties in the analysis, \nwe should not ask too much of the tool.''\n  Precision in these analyses and assessments is far from achievable. \nBut that doesn't mean they aren't useful. We shouldn't be bound by \nthem, but we also shouldn't ignore them. Use of cost-benefit analysis \nin developing regulatory programs goes back to President Nixon. Each \nadministration has expanded on its use. Today, such analysis is \ncommonplace with respect to regulatory proposals that have a \nsignificant impact.\n  We tried to place a requirement for cost-benefit analysis for all \nsignificant rules in law last year. We failed, in part, because some \nMembers wanted to make the requirements for using cost-benefit analysis \nmore exacting than experience has shown us they can be. I remain \nhopeful that next Congress we can reach agreement and develop a \nreasonable proposal that guarantees that solid cost-benefit analysis of \nimportant regulations will always be done, and that such analysis will \nbe used appropriately.\n\n\n                  High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, like many citizens across the country, the \nresidents of Washington State have witnessed a dramatic increase in \ndrug smuggling and drug abuse throughout Washington State in recent \nyears. Unfortunately, these negative trends are continuing to rise, and \nfor that reason, I believe that Washington State is an excellent \ncandidate for designation as a high-intensity drug trafficking area \n[HIDTA].\n  For example, drug addiction and abuse is a major public health \nproblem. Overall, according to the latest available statistics, drug-\nrelated emergency room visits in Washington State per 100,000 persons \nare running over 50 percent higher than the national average. Local \nauthorities are also concerned by both the increased level of drug \nusage, trafficking, and gang violence associated with illicit drug \ntrafficking.\n  Moreover, the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, the Blaine border \ncrossing at the international border between the United States and \nCanada, and the Yakima Valley in central Washington are gateways for \nthe introduction of illegal drugs into the United States. The threats \nposed by heroin, marijuana, cocaine, hashish and methamphetamine merit \nspecial attention as the volume of these drugs passing through the area \nhas a direct impact on other areas of the country.\n  Mr. President, because I believe that Washington State should be \ndesignated as a high-intensity drug trafficking area does not \nautomatically qualify me as an expert on national drug control policy. \nIn fact, I would submit that Gen. Barry McCaffery, the new Director of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy, probably has a much better \nunderstanding of how different programs should be implemented to \ncontrol drug trafficking and drug abuse in different regions throughout \nthe country.\n  Accordingly, the Senate version of the fiscal year 1997 Treasury, \nPostal Service, and General Government appropriations bill provides $13 \nmillion in additional funds for the designation of new high-intensity \ndrug trafficking areas. It also directs the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy to review all of the pending applications for high-\nintensity drug trafficking area designations including the gulf coast, \nthe Northeast, the Northwest, the Great Plains, and the Rocky Mountain \nregions. I commend the chairman and the ranking member for their \nefforts in drafting this bill in such a manner. It allows the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, not Congress, to designate new high-\nintensity drug trafficking Areas in the United States, which I believe \nis entirely appropriate.\n  In the House version of the fiscal year 1997 Treasury, Postal \nService, and General Government Appropriations bill, the bill provides \nan additional $10 million for new high-intensity drug trafficking areas \nprograms. Unfortunately, the accompanying Report designates three new \nhigh-intensity drug trafficking areas, which completely circumvents the \ncurrent designation process formulated by the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy. I believe this is an inappropriate way to do business. \nThe Office of National Drug Control Policy, not the Congress, should \nhave the authority to designate new high-intensity drug trafficking \nAreas.\n  I appreciate Senator Shelby's and Senator Kerry's attention to this \nmatter, and I would encourage the Senate conferees to maintain the \nSenate's position when this issue comes before the conference.\n\n\n                              post-fts2000\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it should be noted that the report \naccompanying the Treasury appropriations bill contains language \ndirecting the release of the solicitation for the Post-FTS2000 Program \nby the Government no earlier than May of 1997. I want to make clear \nthat we do not seek to delay the transition to the Post-FTS2000 Program \nin delaying the release of the solicitation.\n  As many of us know, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was designed \nto open the entire telecommunications industry to competitive market \nforces. This landmark legislation will put local exchange carriers, \ncable companies and utilities in fierce competition in their respective \nmarkets. With proper implementation by the Federal Communications \nCommission [FCC] and State public service commission, the long-term \nimpact of telecommunications reform undoubtedly will be new technology, \nbetter services, and new market entrants available to our citizens.\n  By calling for a release date for the Post-FTS2000 solicitation in \nthe Spring of 1997, we are manifesting our view that the Federal \nGovernment customers and American taxpayers will be best served if the \nPost-FTS2000 Program were designed to take advantage of the benefits of \nincreased competition which is intended to result from the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act and which we believe most certainly will take \nplace. Currently, the FCC and State public service commissions are in \nthe process of implementing the act's provisions, and thus, it seems \nwasteful and premature for the Government to initiate the Post-FTS2000 \nenterprise sooner than next May.\n  We owe it to our constituents to ensure the GSA pursues a Post-\nFTS2000 strategy that can guarantee the best quality service at a price \nthat makes sense. However, as chairman of the subcommittee responsible \nfor funding the GSA's activities, I have asked GSA a series of detailed \nquestions that are intended to ensure that the Post-FTS2000 Program is \nthe best possible strategy for meeting the Government's communications \nneeds well into the next millennium. However, the GSA cannot address \nthe issues I raised, and I do not believe GSA can begin its solutions \nwith the original schedule of October, 1996.\n  For instance, I envision some of the largest savings in the Post-\nFTS2000 contract from integrating local services acquisition as that \nmarket faces\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\ncompetition. Yet, the current reported scope of the Post-FTS2000 \ncontract does not provide for local services competition, or a \ncomparison of end-to-end service cost versus a piecemeal acquisition of \ntelecommunication services. Instead, GSA seeks competition in only a \nfew cities under a separate acquisition. This strategy fails to address \nthe disparity between urban and rural government locations with respect \nto end-to-end communications and fails to bring the benefit of \ncompetition for all telecommunications services to the Federal \nGovernment. We also want to see a business plan and requirements that \nreflect the Telecommunications Act, as well as the Government's plan \nfor addressing security and interoperability.\n  I also point out, Mr. President, that I have consulted with my friend \nand colleague, Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, which has oversight jurisdiction over this program, \nand he agrees with our approach. In addition, my friend and colleague, \nthe ranking minority member, Senator Kerrey, is intimately aware and \nknowledgeable in this matter and also endorses the direction set forth \ntoday.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3756, \nthe Treasury, Postal Service, and general Government appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1997.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $23.3 billion and new \noutlays of $20.5 billion to finance operations of the Department of the \nTreasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service, \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Financial Management \nService; as well as the Executive Office of the President, the Office \nof Personnel Management, the General Services Administration, and other \nagencies that perform central Government functions.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. When outlays from \nprior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $23.7 billion in budget authority and $23.5 \nbillion in outlays. The total bill is at the Senate subcommittee's \n602(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority and under its \nallocation for outlays by $133 million. The subcommittee is also at its \nViolent Crime Reduction Trust Fund allocation for budget authority and \nunder its allocation for outlays by $4 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of H.R. 3756, as \nreported by the Senate.\n  I urge Members to support the bill and to refrain from offering \namendments that would cause the subcommittee to exceed its 602(b) \nallocation.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   TREASURY-POSTAL SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL   \n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Budget           \n                                                     authority   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................  .........     2,381\n  H.R. 3756, as reported to the Senate.............     11,081     8,498\n  Scorekeeping adjustment..........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary............     11,081    10,879\n                                                    ====================\nViolent crime reduction trust fund:                                     \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................  .........         9\n  H.R. 3756, as reported to the Senate.............        120        93\n  Scorekeeping adjustment..........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal violent crime reduction trust fund..        120       102\n                                                    ====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................        129       128\n  H.R. 3756, as reported to the Senate.............     12,081    11,936\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions...................        301       445\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory...........................     12,511    12,509\n                                                    ====================\n      Adjusted bill total..........................     23,712    23,490\n                                                    ====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary............................  .........  ........\n  Nondefense discretionary.........................     11,081    11,012\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund...............        120       106\n  Mandatory........................................     12,511    12,509\n                                                    --------------------\n      Total allocation.............................     23,712    23,627\n                                                    ====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n  Defense discretionary............................  .........  ........\n  Nondefense discretionary.........................  .........      -133\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund...............  .........        -4\n  Mandatory........................................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Total allocation.............................  .........      -137\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

A lot of effort has gone into the Treasury-postal bill. We \nhave dealt with a number of issues. We have been on this bill 25 hours \nand 38 minutes. I think perhaps we are tired and we need to see if we \ncan go on to something else. I encourage the managers to continue \nworking. If they can come back with a list of amendments we could get \ndone in 4 hours, we would consult, try to get the Treasury-postal bill \ndone. We have put a lot of effort into it. I think in view of \neverything that has gone on here and recognizing where we are now, with \nsecond-degree amendments and an amendment pending by the leader, I just \ndo not see how we can get through extended debate tonight and a lot of \nvotes.\n  What we would like to do now is to pull down the Treasury bill, and \ngo to the Interior appropriations bill in the morning at 9:30. If we \ncould get an agreement on taking that up, then there would not be any \nvotes tomorrow as we try to be cooperative with our Members that have a \nholiday that is very important to them tomorrow.\n  We will be working on other issues. We would like to get the Magnuson \nfisheries bill through. There is an interest on both sides in getting \nthat done. If we could get in touch with the interested players and get \nthat done in the morning we would do that and not go to the Interior \nappropriations.\n  With regard to Monday, we would like to continue working on the \nInterior appropriations bill. The managers have indicated we can make \nprogress on that. I understand, perhaps, even amendments dealing with \ngrazing could be considered on Monday, or perhaps we could go to the \naviation authorization, the FAA authorization bill. A lot of good work \nhas been done on that by Senator McCain, Senator Ford, Senator Stevens, \na number of Senators. So if we can get a time agreement on that we \nwould take that up and then go to the Interior appropriations bill and \nwe would have votes, then, on Tuesday morning.\n  We announced earlier that an amendment by the Senator from California \nwould not be taken up before Tuesday. We have one other amendment that \nwe would want to say would not be taken up before Tuesday on the \nInterior appropriations bill. I do not think there is a problem with \nthat. I do not like setting a precedent of saying, ``OK, this Senator's \namendment will not be considered until a day certain.'' These are both \nin recognition of the Jewish holiday, and the fact that we will be on \nInterior a good bit next week, I do not see that any damage is done by \ndoing it that way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10400-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10400-S10401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. In view of that, I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, \nthat the Treasury bill be placed on the calendar and the Senate proceed \nto the Interior appropriations bill at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, September \n13, and if we can get an agreement on the Magnuson fishery bill we may \ngo to that instead.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nlet me just say we have worked on this side on the Treasury-postal bill \nto narrow the list of amendments. We began this morning with 45, \ntonight we are down to 6. So we have made good progress. I thank all of \nmy colleagues on this side of the aisle for their cooperation. \nHopefully, we can work out the remaining questions relating to the \nadditional short list of amendments. I think the majority leader's \nrecommendation is a\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\ngood one. I hope we could begin the debate on the Interior bill \ntomorrow, perhaps taking up the Federal aviation bill on Monday, but we \nwill work with the majority to see that we have a full schedule and \nprotect Senators who have plans for religious purposes tomorrow.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Democratic leader for his cooperation. I ask \nunanimous consent that during the consideration of H.R. 3662, the \nInterior appropriations bill, that no amendments relative to Boundary \nWaters Canoe Area Wilderness or Voyageur's National Park be in order \nprior to Tuesday, September 17, 1996.\n  Madam President, let me withhold that request.\n  Madam President, we do want to make sure that is cleared by a Senator \nthat has a direct interest in it, and we will make a call right now. It \nwould be my intent to honor this, but I will try to get a unanimous-\nconsent agreement locked in while we are making calls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10400-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I wish them and their family all \nthe best as they celebrate this substantial marker on their journey \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10401-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10401-S10402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION BOARD\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee yield for a question?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Farm Credit System is the vital backbone of \nAmerican agriculture providing needed financing for many components of \nagriculture. The FCS is regulated by the Farm Credit Administration. \nThere has been a vacancy on the FCA Board since the resignation of \nBoard member Gary Byrne on March 31, 1995. Under previous agreement \nwith the President, the name of a highly qualified Iowan, Ann \nJorgenson, was referred in August 1995 to the White House with the \nunderstanding that the President would send her name to the Senate for \nconfirmation. To date, the White House has neglected to act on the \nnomination. This Senator feels that the lack of a full Board is very \ndisruptive to the smooth operation of the Farm Credit System.\n  Can the Chairman share with the Senate any information which he may \nhave on the nomination and whether or not the Senate will be able to \nact on it this Congress?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct that a vacancy has existed on the \nthree-member Farm Credit Administration Board since March 31, 1995. The \nSenate majority leader, Bob Dole, sent the name of Ann Jorgenson to the \nPresident in June 1995 to fill a Republican vacancy at the Farm Credit \nAdministration. The Committee has not received any notification from \nthe White House regarding Ann Jorgenson's nomination. If the President \ndoes not formally nominate Ms. Jorgenson, the Committee and the Senate \nwill be unable to act on the appointment this Congress and the Board \nwill continue without its full complement of members.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have personally known Ann Jorgenson for many years \nand I am very impressed with her accomplishments, her commitment to \nAmerican agriculture, and her work and knowledge in the business world. \nShe has developed business plans and goals, written software for farm \naccounting, spoken numerous times at agricultural seminars on various \nagriculture topics, and has authored a book on putting paperwork in its \nplace. She also serves on board of the Farm Bureau Mutual Fund. She has \nan admirable record of public service to the State of Iowa, having \nserved as a member of the board of regents, which oversees Iowa's three \nState universities. Currently, Ann is a board member of the Iowa \nDepartment of Economic Development. The list goes on extensively.\n  Once the administration formally nominates Ms. Jorgenson and the \nAgriculture Committee has an opportunity to review her record and \nqualifications, I am convinced that the Senator will conclude that she \nis a highly qualified person for the position.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I look forward to having the opportunity to examine her \nqualifications. Her reputation is an excellent one.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the Senator, chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, join with me in urging the President to fill the vacancy on \nthe Board of the Farm Credit System so that we may complete the \nconfirmation process this Congress?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I join the Sentor in urging the President to fill the \nvacancy on the FCS Board. The vacancy on the Board has existed for over \na year now and the Board's daily oversight of the safety and soundness \nof the farm credit system would be greatly enhanced with a full Board.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of Ann \nJorgenson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                        Washington, June 28, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Nearly one year ago, then Majority \n     Leader Senator Bob Dole sent to you the name of Ann Jorgensen \n     to fill a\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\n     Republican vacancy at the Farm Credit Administration. Her \n     name has yet to be sent to the Senate for confirmation. I \n     strongly support her nomination and ask that you send her \n     name to the Senate as soon as possible.\n       The Farm Credit Administration is facing significant issues \n     with regard to the Farm Credit System. It can best address \n     these issues with a full complement of members on its Board. \n     Ann Jorgensen has the background and experience to deal with \n     these issues knowledgeably and thoroughly. As a former member \n     of the Iowa Board of Regents, business owner, current member \n     of the Iowa Department of Economic Development Board, author, \n     and farm wife, she would bring a wealth of much needed \n     experience to the Farm Credit Administration.\n       I stand ready to assist you with this nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                  Des Moines, Iowa, July 18, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to highly recommend Ann \n     Jorgensen of Vinton, Iowa, for a Republican position on the \n     board of the Farm Credit Administration. It is my \n     understanding that former Majority Leader Bob Dole sent you \n     her name last year.\n       Ann Jorgensen is an individual I have called on many times \n     to serve the State of Iowa. She is currently on one of our \n     most important state boards, the Iowa Department of Economic \n     Development board. She has also served on the Interstate \n     Agricultural Grain Marketing Commission, the Iowa Alcoholic \n     Beverages Commission, the State Board of Regents, and the \n     Iowa Arts Council. Her service in all of these capacities has \n     been exemplary.\n       I am confident that Ann Jorgensen would be a fine addition \n     to the board of the Farm Credit Administration as she has an \n     extensive background in agriculture and agribusiness.\n       The Farm Credit Administration has a very important role in \n     overseeing the Farm Credit System, which is a significant \n     source of capital for rural America. As this board deals with \n     some critical issues in the years ahead, it is important that \n     the board have a full slate of members.\n       Ann Jorgensen has my highest recommendation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Terry E. Branstad,\n     Governor of Iowa.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            National Corn Growers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the farmer members of the \n     National Corn Growers Association, I urge you to send to the \n     Senate the nomination of Ann Jorgensen of Iowa to serve on \n     the Farm Credit Administration Board. The Board has been \n     without a third member for more than a year. If the \n     nomination does not proceed soon, it will not be possible to \n     complete Senate confirmation before this Congress adjourns.\n       The Farm Credit Administration Board serves a critical role \n     in regulating the Farm Credit System and ensuring an adequate \n     and flexible flow of money into rural areas. This statutory \n     responsibility will be ever more important as farmers and \n     their lenders refine the skills necessary to manage both \n     production and price risk.\n       Ann Jorgensen is especially qualified to make certain that \n     the Farm Credit System achieves its statutory goal of making \n     credit available to farmers and ranchers and their \n     cooperatives and for rural residences. Her impressive resume \n     includes a strong, personal background in production \n     agriculture, business development, and trade, as well as, \n     extensive experience in rural economic development. This \n     unique combination is exactly the mix rural America needs to \n     continue to share in the country's economic recovery.\n       We strongly urge you to nominate Ann Jorgensen as soon as \n     possible, to restore the Farm Credit Administration Board to \n     its full complement of three members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Northey,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Soybean Association,\n\n                                     St. Louis, MO, July 15, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The American Soybean Association \n     respectfully urges you to nominate Ann Jorgensen of Iowa to \n     fill the vacant position on the Farm Credit Administration \n     Board. Unless this nomination is sent to the Senate soon, it \n     will be impossible to complete the confirmation process \n     before Congress adjourns.\n       The Farm Credit Administration Board plays a critical role \n     in regulating the Farm Credit System and in ensuring adequate \n     credit is available to production agriculture and other \n     borrowers in rural America. These functions are particularly \n     important during the current period of volatile commodity \n     prices, as farmers, ranchers, and their lenders manage \n     increased risk and finance future production costs.\n       We know Ann Jorgensen to be a highly qualified individual \n     who would be a valuable member of the Farm Credit \n     Administration Board. Her extensive background in production \n     agriculture and rural economic development is ideally suited \n     to the task of overseeing the Farm Credit System. Her \n     experience and perspective would perfectly complement the \n     qualifications of the other members of the Board.\n       The American Soybean Association strongly urges you to \n     nominate Ann Jorgensen, and to bring the Farm Credit \n     Administration Board up to its full complement of three \n     members.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                        John Long,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     Iowa Soybean Association,\n\n                               West Des Moines, IA, July 15, 1996.\n     Hon.

Her many credentials include membership \n     on the Board of Regents for the State of Iowa and numerous \n     Iowa economic development boards. She is a community leader \n     and a recognized volunteer. Additionally, Senators Grassley \n     and Harkin support her nomination and are confident that she \n     would be a credible candidate for Senate confirmation \n     hearings.\n       ISA reaffirms its support for Mrs. Jorgensen, but would \n     also like to communicate the need to have all positions \n     filled on the Farm Credit Administration's Board. These are \n     extremely volatile times for farmers and it is important \n     financial institutions that are a part of the Farm Credit \n     System have the direction to keep agriculture a successful \n     industry.\n       Again, thank you for the opportunity to offer ISA's support \n     for the appointment of Ann Jorgensen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Douglas P.

Whatever the \n     reason for this position not being filled it is more \n     important than ever, because of the new farm bill and the \n     environment that it will create, that a full board be in \n     place.\n       Ann Jorgensen is an extremely talented and articulate \n     person who has a broad experience base that would be helpful \n     in this position. Number one, she is a successful farmer but \n     also has served on many state boards that needed her \n     excellent judgment abilities. Ann also has what I consider a \n     critical skill needed in any form of business or government \n     institution and that is common sense judgment.\n       I sincerely ask that you consider Ann for the board \n     position. This position needs to be filled and the \n     agriculture community will be well served to have Ann fill \n     that position.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ed Wiederstein,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Norwest Bank Iowa, N.A.,\n\n                                   Des Moines, IA, August 8, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: As you review the candidates to \n     nominate for the Republican vacancy at the Farm Credit \n     Administration, there is one name that should rise to the top \n     of the nomination list. Ann Jorgensen, whose name was \n     submitted to you a year ago by former Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole, is one of Iowa's foremost agricultural leasers; she is \n     a woman who has devoted her life to championing farm issues \n     on the local, state and national levels.\n       Ann's credentials for this position speak for themselves. \n     She is a farm owner, an agri-business owner, an economic \n     development leader, a renowned consultant and an author and \n     columnist for agricultural publications. Ann is a true \n     visionary who relies on her extensive experience in the ag \n     industry to articulate, anticipate and analyze farm issues. \n     Her established contacts, solid reputation and first-hand \n     knowledge would make her an exceptional addition to the board \n     of the Farm Credit Administration.\n       The Farm Credit Administration only stands to benefit from \n     the addition of a member of Ann's caliber. Thank you for your \n     consideration in this matter.\n           Warm regards,\n     H.

Madam President, I rise to submit for the Record an \nintergovernmental mandates statement, as prepared by the Congressional \nBudget Office [CBO], for the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act of 1996 (S. 1994). The Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation ordered S. 1994 reported on June 13, 1996. \nThe CBO already has provided a Federal cost estimate and a private \nsector mandates statement for this bill on July 16, 1996, and both are \nincluded in Senate Report 104-333 on S. 1994.\n  Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the CBO statement \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1996.\n     Hon.

CBO \n     provided a federal cost estimate and a private-sector \n     mandates statement for this bill on July 16, 1996.\n       The bill would impose mandates on state, local, and tribal \n     governments as defined in Public Law 104-4.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

Bill number: Not yet assigned.\n       2. Bill title: Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of \n     1996.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on June 13, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would authorize 1997 \n     appropriations or provide contract authority for a number of \n     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) programs, including the \n     state block grant, research and development, and airport \n     improvement programs. The bill would modify the funding for \n     essential air service and the apportionment of airport \n     improvement funds. In addition, it would make it more \n     difficult for the FAA Administrator to issue regulations that \n     result in substantial economic burdens to state, local, or \n     tribal governments. The bill would also establish new \n     requirements pertaining to pilot records and hiring.\n       5. Intergovernmental mandates contained in the bill: The \n     bill contains one mandate on state, local, and tribal \n     governments, and one provision that could be a mandate.\n       Pilot Records. The bill would increase the amount of \n     background information an air carrier must obtain before \n     hiring an individual as a pilot. In doing so, it would impose \n     a mandate on employers, including state, local, and tribal \n     governments, that have employed the prospective pilot within \n     the previous five years. The bill would require that \n     employers provide to air carriers, upon their request and \n     within 30 days, information on the work record of these \n     individuals. Employers would have to obtain written consent \n     from such individuals prior to releasing the information as \n     well as notify them of the request and of their right to \n     receive a copy of the records.\n       State Taxing Authority. The bill contains a provision \n     intended as a technical correction to the section of Title 49 \n     of the U.S. Code establishing the authority of states to levy \n     certain aviation-related taxes. When that section of the code \n     was recodified in 1994, it appeared to broaden the power of \n     states to tax airlines. The correction is intended to return \n     state taxing authority to the status quo as it existed before \n     the recodification.\n       The impact of this provision, however, is unclear. A simple \n     correction would impose no new mandates. There is concern \n     among some tax experts, however, that the proposed change \n     goes beyond the intended fix and would impose new preemptions \n     on states' taxing authority. A number of state tax officials \n     assert that the proposed correction would increase the \n     ambiguities in the statute and could lead to an \n     interpretation of the law that would prohibit states from \n     imposing certain aviation-related property, income, and other \n     taxes. This issue is unlikely to be resolved without \n     litigation. If the provision is interpreted as the states \n     fear it will be, it would constitute a mandate on state \n     governments as defined by Public Law 104-4 because it would \n     prohibit states from raising certain revenues.\n       6. Estimated direct costs to State, local, and tribal \n     governments: (a) Is the $50 Million Annual Threshold \n     Exceeded? Because of the uncertainty surrounding the \n     interpretation of section 402, dealing with state taxing \n     authority, CBO is uncertain whether the threshold established \n     in Public Law 104-4 would be exceeded.\n       (b) Total Direct Costs of Mandates. Depending upon the \n     interpretation of section 402, the bill's mandate costs could \n     exceed the $50 million annual threshold established in Public \n     Law 104-4. The state tax provision alone, if interpreted \n     broadly, would have a potentially significant revenue impact \n     that could approach or exceed the $50 million threshold. CBO \n     cannot estimate its exact magnitude at this time. CBO \n     estimates that the costs to state, local, and tribal \n     governments of the requirement to provide background records \n     on prospective pilots would be negligible.\n       (c) Estimate of Necessary Budget Authority: Not applicable.\n       7. Basis of estimate: Pilot Records. Based on information \n     from industry representatives and the Departments of \n     Transportation and Labor, CBO estimates that state, local, \n     and tribal governments, in aggregate, would have to respond \n     to fewer than 5,000 requests for work records of prospective \n     pilots every year. This assumes that many of the 10,000 \n     pilots hired annually have held four or more jobs within the \n     previous five years (because seasonal and part-time work is \n     common) and that fewer than 10 percent of those positions \n     were with state, local, or tribal governments.\n       CBO estimates that the costs of this mandate on state, \n     local, and tribal employers would be insignificant. Such \n     requests for work records would be spread across numerous \n     state, local, and tribal government offices; thus, the \n     additional administrative burden on any individual entity \n     would be negligible. The bill would also allow employers to \n     charge air carriers and prospective pilots a fee for the cost \n     of processing the request and furnishing the records.\n       State Taxing Authority. Based on information from several \n     states, CBO believes that, if amended by this bill, certain \n     subsections of 49 U.S.C. 40116 could be read together to \n     limit states to taxing only those aviation-related goods and \n     services for which a direct nexus to flights taking off or \n     landing in the state could be established. Current law does \n     not require that states show such a flight connection when \n     levying property, income, sales, use, and other taxes on air \n     carriers or other providers of aviation services. Many states \n     use apportionment formulas to calculate these taxes, and it \n     is possible that the proposed change could preclude this \n     practice.\n       Based on a survey of state tax officials and information \n     from the Multistate Tax Commission, CBO estimates that the \n     bill could result in tax preemptions in as many as half of \n     the states. Depending upon the interpretation of the proposed \n     change, some states could face annual revenue losses in the \n     millions of dollars. Ambiguities in both the existing \n     recodified statute and the proposed change, however, make it \n     difficult to predict the extent of the possible preemption, \n     if any, and to quantify the revenue losses that might result \n     from it. CBO estimates that, if interpreted broadly, the \n     provision would have a potentially significant revenue impact \n     that could approach or exceed the $50 million threshold.\n       8. Appropriation or other Federal financial assistance \n     provided in bill to cover mandate costs: None.\n       9. Other impacts on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     Pilot Records and State Department of Motor Vehicles. The \n     bill would require air carriers to obtain information on a \n     prospective pilot's motor vehicle driving record. State \n     departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) would have to provide \n     information from the National Driver Register within 30 days \n     of receiving such a request from an air carrier. The bill \n     would require DMV officials to obtain written consent from \n     individuals prior to releasing such information and to notify \n     them of the request and of their right to receive a copy of \n     records.\n       Because the National Driver Register program is a voluntary \n     federal program, these requirements would not constitute \n     mandates as defined by Public Law 104-4. They would, however, \n     result in some costs to states. The bill would allow states \n     to charge the air carriers and prospective pilots a fee for \n     the cost of processing the request and furnishing the \n     records. Based on information from the Department of \n     Transportation, state DMVs, and airline industry \n     representatives, CBO estimates that the administrative costs \n     to states of complying with this requirement would be \n     insignificant.\n       Essential Air Service. The bill would benefit approximately \n     100 rural communities across the United States that are \n     served by the essential air service program. The bill would \n     replace the provision in current law that requires \n     reauthorization of funding for the program after 1998 with a \n     new and increased source of funding. The bill would raise the \n     authorization to $50 million annually for the program (almost \n     twice the fiscal year 1996 authorization) to be paid out of \n     new fees on foreign air service. Spending on the program \n     would, however, continue to be subject to appropriation. The \n     bill would also allow the Secretary, not earlier than two \n     years and 30 days after enactment of the bill, to require \n     that state and local governments provide matching funds of up \n     to 10 percent for payments they receive under the program.\n       FAA Regulations. The bill would prohibit the FAA \n     Administration from issuing regulations that would cost \n     state, local, and tribal governments, in aggregate, more than \n     $50 million a year without the approval of the Secretary of \n     Transportation. In addition, the bill would require periodic \n     reviews of all regulations issued after enactment of the bill \n     that result in aggregate costs of state, local,\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\n     and tribal governments of $25 million or more a year.\n       Alaskan Aviation. The bill would provide FAA a new, one-\n     year authorization of $10 million to be spend on improving \n     aviation safety in Alaska. The bill would also direct the \n     Administrator to take Alaska's unique transportation needs \n     into consideration when amending aviation regulations.\n       10. Previous CBO estimates: CBO provided a preliminary \n     analysis of the bill's mandates on state, local, and tribal \n     governments as part of the federal cost estimate dated July \n     16, 1996. The initial conclusions presented in that estimate \n     have not changed.\n       On July 22, 1996, CBO transmitted an intergovernmental \n     mandates statement on H.R. 3539, the Federal Aviation \n     Authorization Act of 1996, as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 6, \n     1996. Both bills would reauthorize major FAA programs and \n     amend the section of Title 49 of the U.S. Code dealing with \n     state taxation, but they differ in several other respects. \n     The two estimates reflect those differences.\n       On July 11, 1996, CBO transmitted a cost estimate and \n     mandates statement on H.R. 3536, the Airline Pilot Hiring and \n     Safety Act of 1996, as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 6, \n     1996. H.R. 3536 is similar to the title in this bill \n     pertaining to background information on prospective pilots. \n     H.R. 3536 would not, however, require state, local, and \n     tribal government employers to provide information on the \n     work records of prospective pilots.\n       11.

Madam President, the theater that is the annual China MFN \ndebate has once again--predictably--fully run its course. The President \nrecommended extension, United States business and our Asian trading \npartners held their collective breath, there was a lot of rhetoric on \nthe floor of the House condemning China for a variety of serious \nmisdeeds, and in the end a vast majority of the House voted to renew \nMFN yet again. In the wake of the debate, I believe that we should take \na serious look at scrapping this annual drama and replacing it with a \nmore pragmatic and workable solution.\n  That the yearly MFN debate should be scrapped seems evident from an \nexamination of its relative pros and cons. What is gained by the annual \ndebate? Aside from an opportunity for some in Congress to air their \ngrievances with the PRC, not much. What is lost, on the other hand? \nQuite a bit.\n  First, the debate regularly disrupts our bilateral relationship by \nmaking the Chinese feel unfairly singled out, and not without reason. \nMost favored nation is a misnomer. Although the phrase implies some \nspecial treatment that the Uunited States passes out discriminately, it \nis actually the normal trading status with all our trade partners. Only \nseven countries, the majority of which we consider pariah states, are \nnot accorded that status: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cuba, Laos, North \nKorea, Vietnam, and Serbia. In addition, one of the main reasons given \nby proponents of revoking China's MFN status is that country's arguably \nabysmal human rights record. But while other countries have equally \ndisturbing human rights records, no one has moved to revoke their MFN \nstatus. Turkey has long persecuted its Kurdish minority; Russia has \nkilled hundreds of civilians in Chechnya; Indonesia invaded East Timor \nand continues to occupy the island illegally, jailing and killing \nTimorese dissidents; Nigeria jails and executes opponents of the \nGovernment-- yet all four enjoy most favored nation trading status.\n\n  Second, the annual debate is damaging to the interests of U.S. \ncompanies doing business in the PRC. Companies find it very difficult \nto make long-term investment plans when they have to worry every year \nthat the MFN rug might be yanked out from under them. From the Chinese \nside, the annual MFN renewal requirement raises the risk of doing \nbusiness with U.S. firms; so instead, they have a strong incentive to \ndo business with our European competitors who have no such constraints.\n  Third, the threat of revoking China's MFN--an empty threat in my \nview--is not an effective foreign policy tool. Revoking China's MFN \nstatus would hurt us more than the Chinese--the economic equivalent of \ncutting off your nose to spite your face. In 1995, United States \nexports to China directly supported around 200,000 American jobs. \nRevoking MFN, and the Chinese retaliation that would surely follow, \nwould only serve to deprive us of a rapidly growing market. China is \nperfectly capable of shopping elsewhere for its needs, and our allies \nare more than happy to fill any void we leave. We recently saw a prime \nexample of that willingness; last month Premier Li Peng traveled to \nFrance where he signed a $2 billion contract to buy 33 Airbuses--a \ncontract that Boeing thought it was going to get.\n  Fourth, instead of using MFN as a carrot-and-stick with the PRC, I \nbelieve the best way to influence the growth of democratic ideals, \nhuman rights, and the rule of law in China is through continued and \nreliable economic contacts. I think anybody who has been to China, \nespecially over the course of the last 15 years, has seen that for \nthemselves--most dramatically in southern and eastern China. It is \nclear that economic development and contact with the West through trade \nhas let a genie out of the bottle that the regime in Beijing will never \nbe able to put back. We must continue to encourage that trend as we \nturn the corner to a new century.\n  The whole MFN renewal issue is an outdated relic of the cold war--a \nwar that's over. The Jackson-Vanik amendment, the basis for the yearly \nMFN renewal requirement, was not designed with China in mind and was \nnot created as a way to better a country's overall human rights record \nor its adherence to international or bilateral trade or nuclear \nproliferation agreements. Rather, it was originally designed to \npressure the Soviet Union to allow the free emigration of Soviet Jews \nto Israel and other countries. Over the years, its application has \nmoved from covering freedom of emigration from any country with a \ncommand or nonmarket economy to a tool for expressing United States \ndispleasure with a variety of China's sins. It is somewhat ironic that \nof all the different issues raised by Members of Congress arguing to \nrevoke the PRC's MFN status, I have never heard China's emigration \npolicies mentioned even once.\n  With the demise of the cold war, and changing world realities, we \nwould do better to repeal Jackson-Vanik and replace it with a more \nworkable and pragmatic alternative. We should extend permanent MFN \nstatus to China, retaining of course the option of revoking that status \nshould the need truly arise. That extension would remove a series of \nirritants from our relationship, but would not adversely affect our \nability to address China's various transgressions.\n  We retain a whole series of options to deal with the many areas of \nfriction in our bilateral relationship that are more narrowly \ntailored--and therefore more effective--than the overkill method of MFN \nrevocation. For example, a wide variety of unfair trade practices can \nbe addressed through provisions of the Trade Act of 1974--commonly \ncalled the Special 301 provision--as with the recent intellectual \nproperty rights dispute. Similar legislation is in place to deal with \nnuclear or other weapons proliferation.\n  I am not an apologist for the PRC--far from it. The Chinese are \nfailing to honor many of their commitments to us, such as intellectual \nproperty rights and nuclear proliferation--note the recent well-founded \nallegations that the PRC has assisted Pakistan in building a missile \nproduction facility. They want to gain entry to the WTO on their own, \nnot the WTO's terms. Their progress on the human rights front has been \nnegligible at best, as evidenced by a rash of recent crackdowns in \nTibet and Xinjiang. They are actively pursuing the purchase of Russian \nSS-18 ICBMs and MIRV technology. They have laid claim to the vast \nmajority of the South China Sea, to the consternation of five other \nclaimant countries. They have conducted a series of aggressive and \ninflammatory military exercises this year off the coast of Taiwan.\n\n  But despite all these issues, the revocation of China's MFN status is \nnot a constructive remedy. It is high time that scrap this annual \nritual, and replace it with a more thoughtful and pragmatic approach \nthat builds on our efforts, rather than tears at this important \nrelationship. I was glad to see during the latest debate that \nacceptance of this position seems to be growing among Members of \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\n  Madam President, while it is too late in this legislative year to \ntake up the issue in the Congress, I hope that before we go through \nthis dance again next year that Members from both sides of the aisle, \nfrom all the relevant committees, can sit down and formulate an \nalternative. The upcoming period after our sine die adjournment would \nbe a perfect time to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10404-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HURRICANE FRAN\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, a week ago today, hurricane Fran \ndevastated my home State of North Carolina.\n  Last Thursday, after the last Senate vote, I drove down to North \nCarolina and was there for the storm. I have viewed first hand much of \nthe damage to my State.\n  The damage has been far worse and more widespread than anyone would \nhave imagined.\n  Madam President, first, I want to congratulate the people of North \nCarolina for their handling of this storm.\n  I have found that in times of crisis, the American people, like no \nother people in the world, rise to the occasion to tackle their own \nproblems.\n  The people deserved to be congratulated first and foremost.\n  Second, Madam President, I want to thank the thousands of volunteers, \nnational guardsmans and those from other States who are helping with \nour clean-up effort. And, I want to thank the public employees who are \non the scene helping our State cope with this disaster.\n  The storm has been devastating in the fact that it has left hundreds \nof thousands of people without electricity. Today, over 100,000 people \nare still without power. Electricity is a modern convenience that we \noften take for granted, but the power outages have been the most \ndifficult of all the problems.\n  I have urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency to allow two key \npower plants to resume operations as soon as possible. I am told that \nthey have granted this authority. I think this will help the situation \nimmensely.\n  Madam President, the storm has also left, maybe a billion dollars in \nproperty and agriculture damage. North Carolinians are proud of the \nfact that they can solve their own problems.\n  But, the damage may be insurmountable without the Federal \nGovernment's help.\n  Madam President, in recent years, we have had a number of natural \ndisasters in the United States. This has lead to a sharp increase in \nthe amount of disaster costs to the Federal Government. Madam \nPresident, I think it is fair to say that the Government's money should \nbe spent wisely, therefore, I would hope that the private sector, \ninsurance companies, and our lending institutions, will do all that \nthey can so that we can limit the cost of the clean-up burden that will \nbe placed on the taxpayer.\n  Estimates are being drawn now of how much disaster assistance will be \nneeded. I am hopeful that money we have already appropriated will cover \nthe damage, however, the damages may be so great, particularly with \nrespect to crop damage, that more could be needed.\n  I thank Majority Leader Lott for his commitment to move any \nlegislation that would provide for additional funding.\n  Also, I have spoken with James Lee Witt and with Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman, and both have assured me that they will be as \nhelpful as possible.\n  Finally, Madam President, my office and I am sure all the North \nCarolina delegation offices stand ready to help our citizens. I have \ndispatched more staff to Raleigh to deal with the influx of citizens \nthat will need our help. If they need help, my office stands ready to \nassist the clean-up effort.\n  Madam President, again, I want to praise the people of North Carolina \nfor their determination in this crisis. And, I want to extend my \npersonal sorrow, and I am sure the Senate's sorrow for the families of \nthe 21 North Carolinians who died as a result of this storm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10405-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10405-S10420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, pursuant to section 304(d) of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1384(d)), a \nnotice of issuance of final regulations was submitted by the Office of \nCompliance, U.S. Congress. The notice contains final regulations \nrelated to Federal service labor-management relations (Regulations \nunder section 220(d) of the Congressional Accountability Act.)\n  The Congressional Accountability Act requires this notice be printed \nin the Congressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous consent that the \nnotice be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the notice was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \nExtension of Rights, Protections and Responsibilities Under Chapter 71 \n   of Title 5, United States Code, Relating to Federal Service Labor-\n     Management Relations (Regulations Under Section 220(d) of the \n                   Congressional Accountability Act)\n\n\n                notice of issuance of final regulations\n\n       On July 9, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance adopted and submitted for publication in the \n     Congressional Record final regulations implementing section \n     220(d) of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), \n     which extends to the Congress certain rights, protections, \n     and responsibilities under chapter 71 of title 5, United \n     States Code, relating to Federal service labor-management \n     relations. On August 2, 1996, the House agreed both to H. \n     Res. 504, to provide for the approval of final regulations \n     that are applicable to the employing offices and covered \n     employees of the House, and to H. Con. Res. 207, to provide \n     for approval of final regulations that are applicable to \n     employing offices and employees other than those offices and \n     employees of the House and the Senate. As of the date of this \n     Notice, the Senate has yet to approve the 220(d) regulations \n     for itself or to act on H. Con. Res. 207.\n       The Board understands passage of H. Res. 504 to constitute \n     approval under section 304(c) of the CAA of the Board's \n     section 220(d) regulations as applicable to employing offices \n     and covered employees of the House (other than those House \n     offices expressly listed in section 220(e)(2)). Accordingly, \n     pursuant to section 304(d) of the CAA, the Board submits \n     these regulations to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     for issuance by publication in the Congressional Record.\n       Pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 304(d) of the CAA, the \n     Board finds good cause for advancing the effective date of \n     the House regulations from 60 days after their issuance to \n     October 1, 1996. That date corresponds with the effective \n     date of application of CAA section 220 to the Congress. The \n     Board finds that the effective implementation of the CAA is \n     furthered by making these regulations effective for the House \n     on that effective date rather than allowing the default \n     provisions of the CAA contained in section 411 and the \n     derivative regulations of the executive branch to control the \n     administration of the statute during the sixty day period \n     otherwise required by section 304(d)(3) of the CAA.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 10th day of September, \n     1996.\n                                                    Glen D.

Cross-petitions must be filed in \n     accordance with this subpart.\n       (b) Intervention requests and cross-petitions. A request to \n     intervene and a cross-petition, accompanied by any necessary \n     showing of interest, must be submitted in writing and filed \n     with the Executive Director before the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing opens, unless good cause is shown for \n     granting an extension. If no pre-election investigatory \n     hearing is held, a request to intervene and a cross-petition \n     must be filed prior to action being taken pursuant to \n     Sec. 2422.30.\n       (c) Labor organization intervention requests. Except for \n     incumbent intervenors, a labor organization seeking to \n     intervene shall submit a statement that it has complied with \n     5 U.S.C. 7111(e), as applied by the CAA, and one of the \n     following:\n       (1) A showing of interest of ten percent (10%) or more of \n     the employees in the unit covered by a petition seeking an \n     election, with an alphabetical list of the names of the \n     employees constituting the showing of interest; or\n       (2) A current or recently expired collective bargaining \n     agreement covering any of the employees in the unit affected \n     by issues raised in the petition; or\n       (3) Evidence that it is or was, prior to a reorganization, \n     the certified exclusive representative of any of the \n     employees affected by issues raised in the petition.\n       (d) Incumbent. An incumbent exclusive representative, \n     without regard to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this \n     section, will be considered a party in any representation \n     proceeding raising issues that affect employees the incumbent \n     represents, unless it serves the Board, through the Executive \n     Director, with a written disclaimer of any representation \n     interest in the claimed unit.\n       (e) Employing office. An employing office or activity will \n     be considered a party if any of its employees are affected by \n     issues raised in the petition.\n       (f) Employing office or activity intervention. An employing \n     office or activity seeking to intervene in any representation \n     proceeding must submit evidence that one or more employees of \n     the employing office or activity may be affected by issues \n     raised in the petition.\n     Sec. 2422.9 Adequacy of showing of interest\n       (a) Adequacy. Adequacy of a showing of interest refers to \n     the percentage of employees in the unit involved as required \n     by Sec. Sec. 2422.3(c) and (d) and 2422.8(c)(1).\n       (b) Executive Director investigation and action. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, will conduct such \n     investigation as deemed appropriate. The Executive Director's \n     determination, on behalf of the Board, that the showing of \n     interest is adequate is final and binding and not subject to \n     collateral attack at a representation hearing or on appeal to \n     the Board. If the Executive Director determines, on behalf of \n     the Board, that a showing of interest is inadequate, the \n     Executive Director will dismiss the petition, or deny a \n     request for intervention.\n     Sec. 2422.10 Validity of showing of interest\n       (a) Validity. Validity questions are raised by challenges \n     to a showing of interest on grounds other than adequacy.\n       (b) Validity challenge.

The Executive Director's \n     determination, on behalf of the Board, that a showing of \n     interest is valid is final and binding and is not subject to \n     collateral attack or appeal to the Board. If the Executive \n     Director finds, on behalf of the Board, that the showing of \n     interest is not valid, the Executive Director will dismiss \n     the petition or deny the request to intervene.\n     Sec. 2422.11 Challenge to the status of a labor organization\n       (a) Basis of challenge to labor organization status. The \n     only basis on which a challenge to the status of a labor \n     organization may be made is compliance with 5 U.S.C. \n     7103(a)(4), as applied by the CAA.\n       (b) Format and time for filing a challenge. Any party \n     filing a challenge to the status of a labor organization \n     involved in the processing of a petition must do so in \n     writing to the Executive Director before the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing opens, unless good cause is shown for \n     granting an extension. If no hearing is held, challenges must \n     be filed prior to action being taken pursuant to \n     Sec. 2422.30.\n     Sec. 2422.12 Timeliness of petitions seeking an election\n       (a) Election bar. Where there is no certified exclusive \n     representative, a petition seeking an election will not be \n     considered timely if filed within twelve (12) months of a \n     valid election involving the same unit or a subdivision of \n     the same unit.\n       (b) Certification bar. Where there is a certified exclusive \n     representative of employees, a petition seeking an election \n     will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) \n     months after the certification of the exclusive \n     representative of the employees in an appropriate unit. If a \n     collective bargaining agreement covering the claimed unit is \n     pending employing office head review under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c), \n     as applied by the CAA, or is in effect, paragraphs (c), (d), \n     or (e) of this section apply.\n       (c) Bar during employing office head review. A petition \n     seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed \n     during the period of employing office head review under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7114(c), as applied by the CAA. This bar expires upon \n     either the passage of thirty (30) days absent employing \n     office head action, or upon the date of any timely employing \n     office head action.\n       (d) Contract bar where the contract is for three (3) years \n     or less. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect \n     covering the claimed unit and has a term of three (3) years \n     or less from the date it became effective, a petition seeking \n     an election will be considered timely if filed not more than \n     one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty (60) days \n     prior to the expiration of the agreement.\n       (e) Contract bar where the contract is for more than three \n     (3) years. Where a collective bargaining agreement is in \n     effect covering the claimed unit and has a term of more than \n     three (3) years from the date it became effective, a petition \n     seeking an election will be considered timely if filed not \n     more than one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty \n     (60) days prior to the expiration of the initial three (3) \n     year period, and any time after the expiration of the initial \n     three (3) year period.\n       (f) Unusual circumstances. A petition seeking an election \n     or a determination relating to representation matters may be \n     filed at any time when unusual circumstances exist that \n     substantially affect the unit or majority representation.\n       (g) Premature extension. Where a collective bargaining \n     agreement with a term of three (3) years or less has been \n     extended prior to sixty (60) days before its expiration date, \n     the extension will not serve as a basis for dismissal of a \n     petition seeking an election filed in accordance with this \n     section.\n       (h) Contract requirements. Collective bargaining \n     agreements, including agreements that go into effect under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7114(c), as applied by the CAA, and those that \n     automatically renew without further action by the parties, do \n     not constitute a bar to a petition seeking an election under \n     this section unless a clear and unambiguous effective date, \n     renewal date where applicable, duration, and termination date \n     are ascertainable from the agreement and relevant \n     accompanying documentation.\n     Sec. 2422.13 Resolution of issues raised by a petition\n       (a) Meetings prior to filing a representation petition. All \n     parties affected by the representation issues that may be \n     raised in a petition are encouraged to meet prior to the \n     filing of the petition to discuss their interests and narrow \n     and resolve the issues. If requested by all parties a \n     representative of the Office will participate in these \n     meetings.\n       (b) Meetings to narrow and resolve the issues after the \n     petition is filed. After a petition is\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\n     filed, the Executive Director may require all affected \n     parties to meet to narrow and resolve the issues raised in \n     the petition.\n     Sec. 2422.14 Effect of withdrawal/dismissal\n       (a) Withdrawal/dismissal less than sixty (60) days before \n     contract expiration. When a petition seeking an election that \n     has been timely filed is withdrawn by the petitioner or \n     dismissed by the Executive Director or the Board less than \n     sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of an existing \n     agreement between the incumbent exclusive representative and \n     the employing office or activity or any time after the \n     expiration of the agreement, another petition seeking an \n     election will not be considered timely if filed within a \n     ninety (90) day period from either:\n       (1) The date the withdrawal is approved; or\n       (2) The date the petition is dismissed by the Executive \n     Director when no application for review is filed with the \n     Board; or\n       (3) The date the Board rules on an application for review; \n     or\n       (4) The date the Board issues a Decision and Order \n     dismissing the petition.\n       Other pending petitions that have been timely filed under \n     this Part will continue to be processed.\n       (b) Withdrawal by petitioner. A petitioner who submits a \n     withdrawal request for a petition seeking an election that is \n     received by the Executive Director after the notice of pre-\n     election investigatory hearing issues or after approval of an \n     election agreement, whichever occurs first, will be barred \n     from filing another petition seeking an election for the same \n     unit or any subdivision of the unit for six (6) months from \n     the date of the approval of the withdrawal by the Executive \n     Director.\n       (c) Withdrawal by incumbent. When an election is not held \n     because the incumbent disclaims any representation interest \n     in a unit, a petition by the incumbent seeking an election \n     involving the same unit or a subdivision of the same unit \n     will not be considered timely if filed within six (6) months \n     of cancellation of the election.\n     Sec. 2422.15 Duty to furnish information and cooperate\n       (a) Relevant information. After a petition is filed, all \n     parties must, upon request of the Executive Director, furnish \n     the Executive Director and serve all parties affected by \n     issues raised in the petition with information concerning \n     parties, issues, and agreements raised in or affected by the \n     petition.\n       (b) Inclusions and exclusions. After a petition seeking an \n     election is filed, the Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, may direct the employing office or activity to furnish \n     the Executive Director and all parties affected by issues \n     raised in the petition with a current alphabetized list of \n     employees and job classifications included in and/or excluded \n     from the existing or claimed unit affected by issues raised \n     in the petition.\n       (c) Cooperation. All parties are required to cooperate in \n     every aspect of the representation process. This obligation \n     includes cooperating fully with the Executive Director, \n     submitting all required and requested information, and \n     participating in prehearing conferences and pre-election \n     investigatory hearings. The failure to cooperate in the \n     representation process may result in the Executive Director \n     or the Board taking appropriate action, including dismissal \n     of the petition or denial of intervention.\n     Sec. 2422.16 Election agreements or directed elections\n       (a) Election agreements. Parties are encouraged to enter \n     into election agreements.\n       (b) Executive Director directed election. If the parties \n     are unable to agree on procedural matters, specifically, the \n     eligibility period, method of election, dates, hours, or \n     locations of the election, the Executive Director, on behalf \n     of the Board, will decide election procedures and issue a \n     Direction of Election, without prejudice to the rights of a \n     party to file objections to the procedural conduct of the \n     election.\n       (c) Opportunity for an investigatory hearing. Before \n     directing an election, the Executive Director shall provide \n     affected parties an opportunity for a pre-election \n     investigatory hearing on other than procedural matters.\n        (d) Challenges or objections to a directed election. A \n     Direction of Election issued under this section will be \n     issued without prejudice to the right of a party to file a \n     challenge to the eligibility of any person participating in \n     the election and/or objections to the election.\n     Sec. 2422.17 Notice of pre-election investigatory hearing and \n         prehearing conference\n       (a) Purpose of notice of an investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, may issue a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing involving any \n     issues raised in the petition.\n       (b) Contents. The notice of hearing will advise affected \n     parties about the pre-election investigatory hearing. The \n     Executive Director will also notify affected parties of the \n     issues raised in the petition and establish a date for the \n     prehearing conference.\n       (c) Prehearing conference. A prehearing conference will be \n     conducted by the Executive Director or her designee, either \n     by meeting or teleconference. All parties must participate in \n     a prehearing conference and be prepared to fully discuss, \n     narrow and resolve the issues set forth in the notification \n     of the prehearing conference.\n       (d) No interlocutory appeal of investigatory hearing \n     determination. The Executive Director's determination of \n     whether to issue a notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing is not appealable to the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.18  Pre-election investigatory hearing procedures\n       (a) Purpose of a pre-election investigatory hearing. \n     Representation hearings are considered investigatory and not \n     adversarial. The purpose of the hearing is to develop a full \n     and complete record of relevant and material facts.\n       (b) Conduct of hearing. Pre-election investigatory hearings \n     will be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the \n     Executive Director or her designee. There is no burden of \n     proof, with the exception of proceedings on objections to \n     elections as provided for in Sec. 2422.27(b). Formal rules of \n     evidence do not apply.\n       (c) Pre-election investigatory hearing. Pre-election \n     investigatory hearings will be conducted by the Executive \n     Director or her designee.\n       (d) Production of evidence. Parties have the obligation to \n     produce existing documents and witnesses for the \n     investigatory hearing in accordance with the instructions of \n     the Executive Director or her designee. If a party willfully \n     fails to comply with such instructions, the Board may draw an \n     inference adverse to that party on the issue related to the \n     evidence sought.\n       (e) Transcript. An official reporter will make the official \n     transcript of the pre-election investigatory hearing. Copies \n     of the official transcript may be examined in the Office \n     during normal working hours. Requests by parties to purchase \n     copies of the official transcript should be made to the \n     official hearing reporter.\n     Sec. 2422.19  Motions\n       (a) Purpose of a motion. Subsequent to the issuance of a \n     notice of pre-election investigatory hearing in a \n     representation proceeding, a party seeking a ruling, an \n     order, or relief must do so by filing or raising a motion \n     stating the order or relief sought and the grounds therefor. \n     Challenges and other filings referenced in other sections of \n     this subpart may, in the discretion of the Executive Director \n     or her designee, be treated as a motion.\n       (b) Prehearing motions. Prehearing motions must be filed in \n     writing with the Executive Director. Any response must be \n     filed with the Executive Director within five (5) days after \n     service of the motion. The Executive Director shall rule on \n     the motion .\n       (c) Motions made at the investigatory hearing. During the \n     pre-election investigatory hearing, motions will be made to \n     the Executive Director or her designee, and may be oral on \n     the record, unless otherwise required in this subpart to be \n     in writing.

The \n     Executive Director or her designee will rule on motions made \n     at the hearing.\n       (d) Posthearing motions. Motions made after the hearing \n     closes must be filed in writing with the Board.

A party at a pre-election investigatory hearing \n     will have the right:\n       (1) To appear in person or by a representative;\n       (2) To examine and cross-examine witnesses; and\n       (3) To introduce into the record relevant evidence.\n       (b) Documentary evidence and stipulations. Parties must \n     submit two (2) copies of documentary evidence to the \n     Executive Director or her designee and copies to all other \n     parties. Stipulations of fact between/among the parties may \n     be introduced into evidence.\n       (c) Oral argument. Parties will be entitled to a reasonable \n     period prior to the close of the hearing for oral argument. \n     Presentation of a closing oral argument does not preclude a \n     party from filing a brief under paragraph (d) of this \n     section.\n       (d) Briefs. A party will be afforded an opportunity to file \n     a brief with the Board.\n       (1) An original and two (2) copies of a brief must be filed \n     with the Board within thirty (30) days from the close of the \n     hearing.\n       (2) A written request for an extension of time to file a \n     brief must be filed with and received by the Board no later \n     than five (5) days before the date the brief is due.\n       (3) No reply brief may be filed without permission of the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.21 Duties and powers of the Executive Director in \n         the conduct of the pre-election investigatory hearing\n       (a) Duties. The Executive Director or her designee, on \n     behalf of the Board, will receive evidence and inquire fully \n     into the relevant and material facts concerning the matters \n     that are the subject of the investigatory hearing, and may \n     make recommendations on the record to the Board.\n       (b) Powers. During the period a case is assigned to the \n     Executive Director or her designee for pre-election \n     investigatory hearing and prior to the close of the hearing, \n     the Executive Director or her designee may take any action \n     necessary to schedule, conduct, continue, control, and \n     regulate the pre-election investigatory hearing, including \n     ruling on motions when appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.22 Objections to the conduct of the pre-election \n         investigatory hearing\n       (a) Objections. Objections are oral or written complaints \n     concerning the conduct of a pre-election investigatory \n     hearing.\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\n       (b) Exceptions to rulings. There are automatic exceptions \n     to all adverse rulings.\n     Sec. 2422.23 Election procedures\n       (a) Executive Director conducts or supervises election. The \n     Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, will decide to \n     conduct or supervise the election. In supervised elections, \n     employing offices or activities will perform all acts as \n     specified in the Election Agreement or Direction of Election.\n       (b) Notice of election. Prior to the election a notice of \n     election, prepared by the Executive Director, will be posted \n     by the employing office or activity in places where notices \n     to employees are customarily posted and/or distributed in a \n     manner by which notices are normally distributed. The notice \n     of election will contain the details and procedures of the \n     election, including the appropriate unit, the eligibility \n     period, the date(s), hour(s) and location(s) of the election, \n     a sample ballot, and the effect of the vote.\n       (c) Sample ballot. The reproduction of any document \n     purporting to be a copy of the official ballot that suggests \n     either directly or indirectly to employees that the Board \n     endorses a particular choice in the election may constitute \n     grounds for setting aside an election if objections are filed \n     under Sec. 2422.26.\n       (d) Secret ballot. All elections will be by secret ballot.\n       (e) Intervenor withdrawal from ballot. When two or more \n     labor organizations are included as choices in an election, \n     an intervening labor organization may, prior to the approval \n     of an election agreement or before the direction of an \n     election, file a written request with the Executive Director \n     to remove its name from the ballot. If the request is not \n     received prior to the approval of an election agreement or \n     before the direction of an election, unless the parties and \n     the Executive Director, on behalf of the Board, agree \n     otherwise, the intervening labor organization will remain on \n     the ballot. The Executive Director's decision on the request \n     is final and not subject to the filing of an application for \n     review with the Board.\n       (f) Incumbent withdrawal from ballot in an election to \n     decertify an incumbent representative. When there is no \n     intervening labor organization, an election to decertify an \n     incumbent exclusive representative will not be held if the \n     incumbent provides the Executive Director with a written \n     disclaimer of any representation interest in the unit. When \n     there is an intervenor, an election will be held if the \n     intervening labor organization proffers a thirty percent \n     (30%) showing of interest within the time period established \n     by the Executive Director.\n       (g) Petitioner withdraws from ballot in an election. When \n     there is no intervening labor organization, an election will \n     not be held if the petitioner provides the Executive Director \n     with a written request to withdraw the petition. When there \n     is an intervenor, an election will be held if the intervening \n     labor organization proffers a thirty percent (30%) showing of \n     interest within the time period established by the Executive \n     Director.\n       (h) Observers. All parties are entitled to representation \n     at the polling location(s) by observers of their own \n     selection subject to the Executive Director's approval.\n       (1) Parties desiring to name observers must file in writing \n     with the Executive Director a request for specifically named \n     observers at least fifteen (15) days prior to an election. \n     The Executive Director may grant an extension of time for \n     filing a request for specifically named observers for good \n     cause where a party requests such an extension or on the \n     Executive Director's own motion. The request must name and \n     identify the observers requested.\n       (2) An employing office or activity may use as its \n     observers any employees who are not eligible to vote in the \n     election, except:\n       (i) Supervisors or management officials;\n       (ii) Employees who have any official connection with any of \n     the labor organizations involved; or\n       (iii) Non-employees of the legislative branch.\n       (3) A labor organization may use as its observers any \n     employees eligible to vote in the election, except:\n       (i) Employees on leave without pay status who are working \n     for the labor organization involved; or\n       (ii) Employees who hold an elected office in the union.\n       (4) Objections to a request for specific observers must be \n     filed with the Executive Director stating the reasons in \n     support within five (5) days after service of the request.\n       (5) The Executive Director's ruling on requests for and \n     objections to observers is final and binding and is not \n     subject to the filing of an application for review with the \n     Board.\n     Sec. 2422.24 Challenged ballots\n       (a) Filing challenges. A party or the Executive Director \n     may, for good cause, challenge the eligibility of any person \n     to participate in the election prior to the employee voting.\n       (b) Challenged ballot procedure. An individual whose \n     eligibility to vote is in dispute will be given the \n     opportunity to vote a challenged ballot. If the parties and \n     the Region are unable to resolve the challenged ballot(s) \n     prior to the tally of ballots, the unresolved challenged \n     ballot(s) will be impounded and preserved until a \n     determination can be made, if necessary, by the Executive \n     Director or the Board.\n     Sec. 2422.25 Tally of ballots\n       (a) Tallying the ballots. When the election is concluded, \n     the Executive Director or her designee will tally the \n     ballots.\n       (b) Service of the tally. When the tally is completed, the \n     Executive Director will serve the tally of ballots on the \n     parties in accordance with the election agreement or \n     direction of election.\n       (c) Valid ballots cast. Representation will be determined \n     by the majority of the valid ballots cast.\n     Sec. 2422.26 Objections to the election\n       (a) Filing objections to the election. Objections to the \n     procedural conduct of the election or to conduct that may \n     have improperly affected the results of the election may be \n     filed by any party. Objections must be filed and received by \n     the Executive Director within five (5) days after the tally \n     of ballots has been served. Any objections must be timely \n     regardless of whether the challenged ballots are sufficient \n     in number to affect the results of the election. The \n     objections must be supported by clear and concise reasons. An \n     original and two (2) copies of the objections must be \n     received by the Executive Director.\n       (b) Supporting evidence. The objecting party must file with \n     the Executive Director evidence, including signed statements, \n     documents and other materials supporting the objections \n     within ten (10) days after the objections are filed.\n     Sec. 2422.27 Determinative challenged ballots and objections\n       (a) Investigation. The Executive Director, on behalf of the \n     Board, will investigate objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots that are sufficient in number to affect \n     the results of the election.\n       (b) Burden of proof. A party filing objections to the \n     election bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the \n     evidence concerning those objections. However, no party bears \n     the burden of proof on challenged ballots.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation, the \n     Executive Director will take appropriate action consistent \n     with Sec. 2422.30.\n       (d) Consolidated hearing on objections and/or determinative \n     challenged ballots and an unfair labor practice hearing. When \n     appropriate, and in accordance with Sec. 2422.33, objections \n     and/or determinative challenged ballots may be consolidated \n     with an unfair labor practice hearing. Such consolidated \n     hearings will be conducted by a Hearing Officer. Exceptions \n     and related submissions must be filed with the Board and the \n     Board will issue a decision in accordance with Part 2423 of \n     this chapter and section 406 of the CAA, except for the \n     following:\n       (1) Section 2423.18 of this Subchapter concerning the \n     burden of proof is not applicable;\n       (2) The Hearing Officer may not recommend remedial action \n     to be taken or notices to be posted; and,\n       (3) References to ``charge'' and ``complaint'' in Part 2423 \n     of this chapter will be omitted.\n     Sec. 2422.28 Runoff elections\n       (a) When a runoff may be held. A runoff election is \n     required in an election involving at least three (3) choices, \n     one of which is ``no union'' or ``neither,'' when no choice \n     receives a majority of the valid ballots cast. However, a \n     runoff may not be held until the objections to the election \n     and determinative challenged ballots have been resolved.\n       (b) Eligibility. Employees who were eligible to vote in the \n     original election and who are also eligible on the date of \n     the runoff election may vote in the runoff election.\n       (c) Ballot. The ballot in the runoff election will provide \n     for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest \n     and second largest number of votes in the election.\n     Sec. 2422.29 Inconclusive elections\n       (a) Inconclusive elections. An inconclusive election is one \n     where challenged ballots are not sufficient to affect the \n     outcome of the election and one of the following occurs:\n       (1) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, one \n     of which is ``no union'' or ``neither'' and the votes are \n     equally divided; or\n       (2) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, the \n     choice receiving the highest number of votes does not receive \n     a majority, and at least two other choices receive the next \n     highest and same number of votes; or\n       (3) When a runoff ballot provides for a choice between two \n     labor organizations and results in the votes being equally \n     divided; or\n       (4) When the Board determines that there have been \n     significant procedural irregularities.\n       (b) Eligibility to vote in a rerun election. A current \n     payroll period will be used to determine eligibility to vote \n     in a rerun election.\n       (c) Ballot. If a determination is made that the election is \n     inconclusive, the election will be rerun with all the choices \n     that appeared on the original ballot.\n       (d) Number of reruns. There will be only one rerun of an \n     inconclusive election. If the rerun results in another \n     inconclusive election, the tally of ballots will indicate a \n     majority of valid ballots has not been cast for any choice \n     and a certification of results will be issued. If necessary, \n     a runoff may be held when an original election is rerun.\n     Sec. 2422.30 Executive director investigations, notices of \n         pre-election investigatory hearings, and actions; board \n         decisions and orders\n       (a) Executive Director investigation. The Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will make such \n     investigation of the petition and any other matter as the \n     Executive Director deems necessary.\n       (b) Executive Director notice of pre-election investigatory \n     hearing. On behalf of the Board, the Executive Director will \n     issue a notice of pre-election investigatory hearing to \n     inquire into any matter about which a material issue of fact \n     exists, where there is an issue as\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\n     to whether a question concerning representation exists, and \n     any time there is reasonable cause to believe a question \n     exists regarding unit appropriateness.\n       (c) Executive Director action. After investigation and/or \n     hearing, when a pre-election investigatory hearing has been \n     ordered, the Executive Director may, on behalf of the Board, \n     approve an election agreement, dismiss a petition or deny \n     intervention where there is an inadequate or invalid showing \n     of interest, or dismiss a petition where there is an \n     undisputed bar to further processing of the petition under \n     law, rule or regulation.\n       (d) Appeal of Executive Director action. A party may file \n     with the Board an application for review of an Executive \n     Director action taken pursuant to section (c) above.\n       (e) Contents of the Record. When no pre-election \n     investigatory hearing has been conducted all material \n     submitted to and considered by the Executive Director during \n     the investigation becomes a part of the record. When a pre-\n     election investigatory hearing has been conducted, the \n     transcript and all material entered into evidence, including \n     any posthearing briefs, become a part of the record.\n       (f) Transfer of record to Board; Board Decisions and \n     Orders. In cases that are submitted to the Board for decision \n     in the first instance, the Board shall decide the issues \n     presented based upon the record developed by the Executive \n     Director, including the transcript of the pre-election \n     investigatory hearing, if any, documents admitted into the \n     record and briefs and other approved submissions from the \n     parties. The Board may direct that a secret ballot election \n     be held, issue an order dismissing the petition, or make such \n     other disposition of the matter as it deems appropriate.\n     Sec. 2422.31 Application for review of an executive director \n         action\n       (a) Filing an application for review. A party must file an \n     application for review with the Board within sixty (60) days \n     of the Executive Director's action. The sixty (60) day time \n     limit provided for in 5 U.S.C. 7105(f), as applied by the \n     CAA, may not be extended or waived.\n       (b) Contents. An application for review must be sufficient \n     to enable the Board to rule on the application without \n     recourse to the record; however, the Board may, in its \n     discretion, examine the record in evaluating the application. \n     An application must specify the matters and rulings to which \n     exception(s) is taken, include a summary of evidence relating \n     to any issue raised in the application, and make specific \n     reference to page citations in the transcript if a hearing \n     was held. An application may not raise any issue or rely on \n     any facts not timely presented to the Executive Director.\n       (c) Review. The Board may, in its discretion, grant an \n     application for review when the application demonstrates that \n     review is warranted on one or more of the following grounds:\n       (1) The decision raises an issue for which there is an \n     absence of precedent;\n       (2) Established law or policy warrants reconsideration; or,\n       (3) There is a genuine issue over whether the Executive \n     Director has:\n       (i) Failed to apply established law;\n       (ii) Committed a prejudicial procedural error;\n       (iii) Committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a \n     substantial factual matter.\n       (d) Opposition. A party may file with the Board an \n     opposition to an application for review within ten (10) days \n     after the party is served with the application. A copy must \n     be served on the Executive Director and all other parties and \n     a statement of service must be filed with the Board.\n       (e) Executive Director action becomes the Board's action. \n     An action of the Executive Director becomes the action of the \n     Board when:\n       (1) No application for review is filed with the Board \n     within sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive \n     Director's action; or\n       (2) A timely application for review is filed with the Board \n     and the Board does not undertake to grant review of the \n     Executive Director's action within sixty (60) days of the \n     filing of the application; or\n       (3) The Board denies an application for review of the \n     Executive Director's action.\n       (f) Board grant of review and stay. The Board may rule on \n     the issue(s) in an application for review in its order \n     granting the application for review. Neither filing nor \n     granting an application for review shall stay any action \n     ordered by the Executive Director unless specifically ordered \n     by the Board.\n       (g) Briefs if review is granted. If the Board does not rule \n     on the issue(s) in the application for review in its order \n     granting review, the Board may, in its discretion, afford the \n     parties an opportunity to file briefs. The briefs will be \n     limited to the issue(s) referenced in the Board's order \n     granting review.\n     Sec. 2422.32 Certifications and revocations\n       (a) Certifications. The Executive Director, on behalf of \n     the Board, will issue an appropriate certification when:\n       (1) After an election, runoff, or rerun,\n       (i) No objections are filed or challenged ballots are not \n     determinative, or\n       (ii) Objections and determinative challenged ballots are \n     decided and resolved; or\n       (2) The Executive Director takes an action requiring a \n     certification and that action becomes the action of the Board \n     under Sec. 2422.31(e) or the Board otherwise directs the \n     issuance of a certification.\n       (b) Revocations. Without prejudice to any rights and \n     obligations which may exist under the CAA, the Executive \n     Director, on behalf of the Board, will revoke a recognition \n     or certification, as appropriate, and provide a written \n     statement of reasons when an incumbent exclusive \n     representative files, during a representation proceeding, a \n     disclaimer of any representational interest in the unit.\n     Sec. 2422.33 Relief obtainable under Part 2423\n       Remedial relief that was or could have been obtained as a \n     result of a motion, objection, or challenge filed or raised \n     under this subpart, may not be the basis for similar relief \n     if filed or raised as an unfair labor practice under Part \n     2423 of this Chapter: provided, however, that related matters \n     may be consolidated for hearing as noted in Sec. 2422.27(d) \n     of this subpart.\n     Sec. 2422.34 Rights and obligations during the pendency of \n         representation proceedings\n       (a) Existing recognitions, agreements, and obligations \n     under the CAA. During the pendency of any representation \n     proceeding, parties are obligated to maintain existing \n     recognitions, adhere to the terms and conditions of existing \n     collective bargaining agreements, and fulfill all other \n     representational and bargaining responsibilities under the \n     CAA.\n       (b) Unit status of individual employees. Notwithstanding \n     paragraph (a) of this section and except as otherwise \n     prohibited by law, a party may take action based on its \n     position regarding the bargaining unit status of individual \n     employees, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(2), 7112(b) and (c), \n     as applied by the CAA: provided, however, that its actions \n     may be challenged, reviewed, and remedied where appropriate.\n\n              Part 2423--Unfair Labor Practice Proceedings\n\n     Sec.\n     2423.1  Applicability of this part.\n     2423.2  Informal proceedings.\n     2423.3  Who may file charges.\n     2423.4  Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n           documents.\n     2423.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or \n           the negotiability procedure.\n     2423.6  Filing and service of copies.\n     2423.7  Investigation of charges.\n     2423.8  Amendment of charges.\n     2423.9  Action by the General Counsel.\n     2423.10  Determination not to file complaint.\n     2423.11  Settlement or adjustment of issues.\n     2423.12  Filing and contents of the complaint.\n     2423.13  Answer to the complaint.\n     2423.14  Prehearing disclosure; conduct of hearing.\n     2423.15  Intervention.\n     2423.16  [Reserved]\n     2423.17  [Reserved]\n     2423.18  Burden of proof before the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.19  Duties and powers of the Hearing Officer.\n     2423.20  [Reserved]\n     2423.21  [Reserved]\n     2423.22  [Reserved]\n     2423.23  [Reserved]\n     2423.24  [Reserved]\n     2423.25  [Reserved]\n     2423.26  Hearing Officer decisions; entry in records of the \n           Office.\n     2423.27  Appeal to the Board.\n     2423.28  [Reserved]\n     2423.29  Action by the Board.\n     2423.30  Compliance with decisions and orders of the Board.\n     2423.31  Backpay proceedings.\n     Sec. 2423.1 Applicability of this part\n       This part is applicable to any charge of alleged unfair \n     labor practices occurring on or after October 1, 1996.\n     Sec. 2423.2  Informal proceedings\n       (a) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the cooperative efforts of \n     all persons covered by the program. To this end, it shall be \n     the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to encourage \n     all persons alleging unfair labor practices and persons \n     against whom such allegations are made to meet and, in good \n     faith, attempt to resolve such matters prior to the filing of \n     unfair labor practice charges.\n       (b) In furtherance of the policy referred to in paragraph \n     (a) of this section, and noting the 180 day period of \n     limitation set forth in section 220(c)(2) of the CAA, it \n     shall be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to \n     encourage the informal resolution of unfair labor practice \n     allegations subsequent to the filing of a charge and prior to \n     the filing of a complaint by the General Counsel.\n       (c) In order to afford the parties an opportunity to \n     implement the policy referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of \n     this section, the investigation of an unfair labor practice \n     charge by the General Counsel will normally not commence \n     until the parties have been afforded a reasonable amount of \n     time, not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the filing of the \n     charge, during which period the parties are urged to attempt \n     to informally resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n     Sec. 2423.3  Who may file charges\n       An employing office, employing activity, or labor \n     organization may be charged by any person with having engaged \n     in or engaging in any unfair labor practice prohibited under \n     5 U.S.C. 7116, as applied by the CAA.\n     Sec. 2423.4  Contents of the charge; supporting evidence and \n         documents\n       (a) A charge alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. 7116, as \n     applied by the CAA, shall be submitted on forms prescribed by \n     the General Counsel and shall contain the following:\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\n       (1) The name, address and telephone number of the person(s) \n     making the charge;\n       (2) The name, address and telephone number of the employing \n     office or activity, or labor organization against whom the \n     charge is made;\n       (3) A clear and concise statement of the facts constituting \n     the alleged unfair labor practice, a statement of the \n     section(s) and subsection(s) of chapter 71 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code made applicable by the CAA alleged to have \n     been violated, and the date and place of occurrence of the \n     particular acts; and\n       (4) A statement of any other procedure invoked involving \n     the subject matter of the charge and the results, if any, \n     including whether the subject matter raised in the charge (i) \n     has been raised previously in a grievance procedure; (ii) has \n     been referred to the Board under Part 2471 of these \n     regulations, or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation \n     Service, or (iii) involves a negotiability issue raised by \n     the charging party in a petition pending before the Board \n     pursuant to Part 2424 of this subchapter.\n       (b) Such charge shall be in writing and signed and shall \n     contain a declaration by the person signing the charge, under \n     the penalties of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), that its \n     contents are true and correct to the best of that person's \n     knowledge and belief.\n       (c) When filing a charge, the charging party shall submit \n     to the General Counsel any supporting evidence and documents.\n     Sec. 2423.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to this part which involves a negotiability \n     issue, and the labor organization also files pursuant to part \n     2424 of this subchapter a petition for review of the same \n     negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first. Notification of this \n     selection must be made in writing at the time that both \n     procedures have been invoked, and must be served on the \n     Board, the General Counsel and all parties to both the unfair \n     labor practice case and the negotiability case. Cases which \n     solely involve an employing office's allegation that the duty \n     to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter \n     proposed to be bargained and which do not involve actual or \n     contemplated changes in conditions of employment may only be \n     filed under part 2424 of this subchapter.\n     Sec. 2423.6  Filing and service of copies\n       (a) An original and four (4) copies of the charge together \n     with one copy for each additional charged party named shall \n     be filed with the General Counsel.\n       (b) Upon the filing of a charge, the charging party shall \n     be responsible for the service of a copy of the charge \n     (without the supporting evidence and documents) upon the \n     person(s) against whom the charge is made, and for filing a \n     written statement of such service with the General Counsel. \n     The General Counsel will, as a matter of course, cause a copy \n     of such charge to be served on the person(s) against whom the \n     charge is made, but shall not be deemed to assume \n     responsibility for such service.\n       (c) A charge will be deemed to be filed when it is received \n     by the General Counsel in accordance with the requirements in \n     paragraph (a) of this section.\n     Sec. 2423.7  Investigation of charges\n       (a) The General Counsel shall conduct such investigation of \n     the charge as the General Counsel deems necessary. Consistent \n     with the policy set forth in Sec. 2423.2, the investigation \n     will normally not commence until the parties have been \n     afforded a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed fifteen \n     (15) days from the filing of the charge, to informally \n     resolve the unfair labor practice allegation.\n       (b) During the course of the investigation all parties \n     involved will have an opportunity to present their evidence \n     and views to the General Counsel.\n       (c) In connection with the investigation of charges, all \n     persons are expected to cooperate fully with the General \n     Counsel.\n       (d) The purposes and policies of chapter 71, as applied by \n     the CAA, can best be achieved by the full cooperation of all \n     parties involved and the voluntary submission of all \n     potentially relevant information from all potential sources \n     during the course of the investigation. To this end, it shall \n     be the policy of the Board and the General Counsel to protect \n     the identity of individuals and the substance of the \n     statements and information they submit or which is obtained \n     during the investigation as a means of assuring the Board's \n     and the General Counsel's continuing ability to obtain all \n     relevant information.\n     Sec. 2423.8  Amendment of charges\n       Prior to the issuance of a complaint, the charging party \n     may amend the charge in accordance with the requirements set \n     forth in Sec. 2423.6.\n     Sec. 2423.9 Action by the general counsel\n       (a) The General Counsel shall take action which may consist \n     of the following, as appropriate:\n       (1) Approve a request to withdraw a charge;\n       (2) Refuse to file a complaint;\n       (3) Approve a written settlement and recommend that the \n     Executive Director approve a written settlement agreement in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 414 of the CAA;\n       (4) File a complaint;\n       (5) Upon agreement of all parties, transfer to the Board \n     for decision, after filing of a complaint, a stipulation of \n     facts in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2429.1(a) of \n     this subchapter; or\n       (6) Withdraw a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.10 Determination not to file complaint\n       (a) If the General Counsel determines that the charge has \n     not been timely filed, that the charge fails to state an \n     unfair labor practice, or for other appropriate reasons, the \n     General Counsel may request the charging party to withdraw \n     the charge, and in the absence of such withdrawal within a \n     reasonable time, decline to file a complaint.\n       (b) The charging party may not obtain a review of the \n     General Counsel's decision not to file a complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.11 Settlement or adjustment of issues\n        (a) At any stage of a proceeding prior to hearing, where \n     time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest \n     permit, all interested parties shall have the opportunity to \n     submit to the Executive Director or General Counsel, as \n     appropriate, for consideration, all facts and arguments \n     concerning offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment.\n\n                        Precomplaint settlements\n\n       (b)(1) Prior to the filing of any complaint or the taking \n     of other formal action, the General Counsel will afford the \n     charging party and the respondent a reasonable period of time \n     in which to enter into a settlement agreement to be submitted \n     to and approved by the General Counsel and the Executive \n     Director. Upon approval by the General Counsel and Executive \n     Director and compliance with the terms of the settlement \n     agreement, no further action shall be taken in the case. If \n     the respondent fails to perform its obligations under the \n     settlement agreement, the General Counsel may determine to \n     institute further proceedings.\n       (2) In the event that the charging party fails or refuses \n     to become a party to a settlement agreement offered by the \n     respondent, if the General Counsel concludes that the offered \n     settlement will effectuate the policies of chapter 71, as \n     applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be between the \n     respondent and the General Counsel and the latter shall \n     decline to file a complaint.\n\n                    Post complaint settlement policy\n\n       (c) Consistent with the policy reflected in paragraph (a) \n     of this section, even after the filing of a complaint, the \n     Board favors the settlement of issues. Such settlements may \n     be accomplished as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. \n     The parties may, as part of the settlement, agree to waive \n     their right to a hearing and agree further that the Board may \n     issue an order requiring the respondent to take action \n     appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily such a \n     settlement agreement will also contain the respondent's \n     consent to the Board's application for the entry of a decree \n     by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     enforcing the Board's order.\n\n                 Post complaint prehearing settlements\n\n       (d)(1) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging \n     party and the respondent enter into a settlement agreement, \n     and such agreement is accepted by the General Counsel, the \n     settlement agreement shall be submitted to the Executive \n     Director for approval.\n       (2) If, after the filing of a complaint, the charging party \n     fails or refuses to become a party to a settlement agreement \n     offered by the respondent, and the General Counsel concludes \n     that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of \n     chapter 71, as applied by the CAA, the agreement shall be \n     between the respondent and the General Counsel. The charging \n     party will be so informed and provided a brief written \n     statement by the General Counsel of the reasons therefor. The \n     settlement agreement together with the charging party's \n     objections, if any, and the General Counsel's written \n     statements, shall be submitted to the Executive Director for \n     approval. The Executive Director may approve or disapprove \n     any settlement agreement.\n       (3) After the filing of a complaint, if the General Counsel \n     concludes that it will effectuate the policies of chapter 71, \n     as applied by the CAA, the General Counsel may withdraw the \n     complaint.\n\n              Settlements after the opening of the hearing\n\n        (e)(1) After filing of a complaint and after opening of \n     the hearing, if the General Counsel concludes that it will \n     effectuate the policies of chapter 71, as applied by the CAA, \n     the General Counsel may request the Hearing Officer for \n     permission to withdraw the complaint and, having been granted \n     such permission to withdraw the complaint, may approve a \n     settlement and recommend that the Executive Director approve \n     the settlement pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.\n       (2) If, after filing of a complaint and after opening of \n     the hearing, the parties enter into a settlement agreement \n     that contains the respondent's consent to the Board's \n     application for the entry of a decree by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit enforcing the \n     Board's order, the General Counsel may request the Hearing \n     Officer and the Executive Director to approve such settlement \n     agreement, and upon such approval,\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\n     to transmit the agreement to the Board for approval.\n       (3) If the charging party fails or refuses to become a \n     party to a settlement agreement, offered by the respondent, \n     that contains the respondent's consent to the Board's \n     application for the entry of a decree by the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit enforcing the \n     Board's order, and the General Counsel concludes that the \n     offered settlement will effectuate the policies of chapter \n     71, as applied to the CAA, the agreement shall be between the \n     respondent and the General Counsel. After the charging party \n     is given an opportunity to state on the record or in writing \n     the reasons for opposing the settlement, the General Counsel \n     may request the Hearing Officer and the Executive Director to \n     approve such settlement agreement, and upon such approval, to \n     transmit the agreement to the Board for approval. The Board \n     may approve or disapprove any such settlement agreement or \n     return the case to the Hearing Officer for other appropriate \n     action.\n     Sec. 2423.12 Filing and contents of the complaint\n       (a) After a charge is filed, if it appears to the General \n     Counsel that formal proceedings in respect thereto should be \n     instituted, the General Counsel shall file a formal \n     complaint: provided, however, that a determination by the \n     General Counsel to file a complaint shall not be subject to \n     review.\n       (b) The complaint shall include:\n       (1) Notice of the charge;\n       (2) Any information required pursuant to the Procedural \n     Rules of the Office.\n       (c) Any such complaint may be withdrawn before the hearing \n     by the General Counsel.\n     Sec. 2423.13 Answer to the complaint\n       A respondent shall file an answer to a complaint in \n     accordance with the requirements of the Procedural Rules of \n     the Office.\n     Sec. 2423.14 Prehearing disclosure; conduct of hearing\n       The procedures for prehearing discovery and the conduct of \n     the hearing are set forth in the Procedural Rules of the \n     Office.\n     Sec. 2423.15 Intervention\n       Any person involved and desiring to intervene in any \n     proceeding pursuant to this part shall file a motion in \n     accordance with the procedures set forth in the Procedural \n     Rules of the Office. The motion shall state the grounds upon \n     which such person claims involvement.\n     Sec. 2423.16 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.17 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.18 Burden of proof before the hearing officer\n       The General Counsel shall have the responsibility of \n     presenting the evidence in support of the complaint and shall \n     have the burden of proving the allegations of the complaint \n     by a preponderance of the evidence.\n     2423.19 Duties and powers of the hearing officer\n       It shall be the duty of the Hearing Officer to inquire \n     fully into the facts as they relate to the matter before such \n     Hearing Officer, subject to the rules and regulations of the \n     Office and the Board.\n     Sec. 2423.20 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.21 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.22 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.23 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.24 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.25 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.26 Hearing officer decisions; entry in records of \n         the office\n       In accordance with the Procedural Rules of the Office, the \n     Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision and that \n     decision will be entered into the records of the Office.\n     Sec. 2423.27 Appeal to the Board\n       An aggrieved party may seek review of a decision and order \n     of the Hearing Officer in accordance with the Procedural \n     Rules of the Office.\n     Sec. 2423.28 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 2423.29 Action by the Board\n       (a) If an appeal is filed, the Board shall review the \n     decision of the Hearing Officer in accordance with section \n     406 of the CAA, and the Procedural Rules of the Office.\n       (b) Upon finding a violation, the Board shall issue an \n     order:\n       (1) To cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice \n     in which the employing office or labor organization is \n     engaged;\n       (2) Requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective \n     bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the \n     Board and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given \n     retroactive effect;\n       (3) Requiring reinstatement of an employee with backpay in \n     accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5596; or\n       (4) Including any combination of the actions described in \n     paragraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph (b), or such \n     other action as will carry out the purpose of the chapter 71, \n     as applied by the CAA.\n       (c) Upon finding no violation, the Board shall dismiss the \n     complaint.\n     Sec. 2423.30 Compliance with decisions and orders of the \n         Board\n       When remedial action is ordered, the respondent shall \n     report to the Office within a specified period that the \n     required remedial action has been effected. When the General \n     Counsel or the Executive Director finds that the required \n     remedial action has not been effected, the General Counsel or \n     the Executive Director shall take such action as may be \n     appropriate, including referral to the Board for enforcement.\n     Sec. 2423.31 Backpay proceedings\n       After the entry of a Board order directing payment of \n     backpay, or the entry of a court decree enforcing such order, \n     if it appears to the General Counsel that a controversy \n     exists which cannot be resolved without a formal proceeding, \n     the General Counsel may issue and serve on all parties a \n     backpay specification accompanied by a request for hearing or \n     a request for hearing without a specification. Upon receipt \n     of the request for hearing, the Executive Director will \n     appoint an independent Hearing Officer. The respondent shall, \n     within twenty (20) days after the service of a backpay \n     specification, file an answer thereto in accordance with the \n     Office's Procedural Rules. No answer need be filed by the \n     respondent to a notice of hearing issued without a \n     specification. After the issuance of a notice of hearing, \n     with or without a backpay specification, the hearing \n     procedures provided in the Procedural Rules of the Office \n     shall be followed insofar as applicable.\n\n           Part 2424 Expedited Review of Negotiability Issues\n\n                    Subpart A--Instituting an Appeal\n\n     Sec.\n     2424.1  Conditions governing review.\n     2424.2  Who may file a petition.\n     2424.3  Time limits for filing.\n     2424.4  Content of petition; service.\n     2424.5  Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure or \n           the negotiability procedure.\n     2424.6  Position of the employing office; time limits for \n           filing; service.\n     2424.7  Response of the exclusive representative; time limits \n           for filing; service.\n     2424.8  Additional submissions to the Board.\n     2424.9  Hearing.\n     2424.10  Board decision and order; compliance.\n\n   Subpart B--Criteria for Determining Compelling Need for Employing \n                      Office Rules and Regulations\n\n     2424.11  Illustrative criteria.\n\n\n                    subpart a--instituting an appeal\n\n     Sec. 2424.1 Conditions governing review\n       The Board will consider a negotiability issue under the \n     conditions prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 7117 (b) and (c), as \n     applied by the CAA, namely: If an employing office involved \n     in collective bargaining with an exclusive representative \n     alleges that the duty to bargain in good faith does not \n     extend to any matter proposed to be bargained because, as \n     proposed, the matter is inconsistent with law, rule or \n     regulation, the exclusive representative may appeal the \n     allegation to the Board when--\n       (a) It disagrees with the employing office's allegation \n     that the matter as proposed to be bargained is inconsistent \n     with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or \n     regulation; or\n       (b) It alleges, with regard to any employing office rule or \n     regulation asserted by the employing office as a bar to \n     negotiations on the matter, as proposed, that:\n       (1) The rule or regulation violates applicable law, or rule \n     or regulation of appropriate authority outside the employing \n     office;\n       (2) The rule or regulation was not issued by the employing \n     office or by any primary national subdivision of the \n     employing office, or otherwise is not applicable to bar \n     negotiations with the exclusive representative, under 5 \n     U.S.C. 7117(a)(3), as applied by the CAA; or\n       (3) No compelling need exists for the rule or regulation to \n     bar negotiations on the matter, as proposed, because the rule \n     or regulation does not meet the criteria established in \n     subpart B of this part.\n     Sec. 2424.2 Who may file a petition\n       A petition for review of a negotiability issue may be filed \n     by an exclusive representative which is a party to the \n     negotiations.\n     Sec. 2424.3 Time limits for filing\n       The time limit for filing a petition for review is fifteen \n     (15) days after the date the employing office's allegation \n     that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to the \n     matter proposed to be bargained is served on the exclusive \n     representative. The exclusive representative shall request \n     such allegation in writing and the employing office shall \n     make the allegation in writing and serve a copy on the \n     exclusive representative: provided, however, that review of a \n     negotiability issue may be requested by an exclusive \n     representative under this subpart without a prior written \n     allegation by the employing office if the employing office \n     has not served such allegation upon the exclusive \n     representative within ten (10) days after the date of the \n     receipt by any employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations of a written request for such allegation.\n     Sec. 2424.4 Content of petition; service\n       (a) A petition for review shall be dated and shall contain \n     the following:\n       (1) A statement setting forth the express language of the \n     proposal sought to be negotiated as submitted to the \n     employing office;\n       (2) An explicit statement of the meaning attributed to the \n     proposal by the exclusive representative including:\n       (i) Explanation of terms of art, acronyms, technical \n     language, or any other aspect of the language of the proposal \n     which is not in common usage; and\n       (ii) Where the proposal is concerned with a particular work \n     situation, or other particular circumstances, a description \n     of the situation or circumstances which will enable the Board \n     to understand the context in which the proposal is intended \n     to apply;\n       (3) A copy of all pertinent material, including the \n     employing office's allegation in writing that the matter, as \n     proposed, is not within the duty to bargain in good faith, \n     and other relevant documentary material; and\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\n       (4) Notification by the petitioning labor organization \n     whether the negotiability issue is also involved in an unfair \n     labor practice charge filed by such labor organization under \n     part 2423 of this subchapter and pending before the General \n     Counsel.\n       (b) A copy of the petition including all attachments \n     thereto shall be served on the employing office head and on \n     the principal employing office bargaining representative at \n     the negotiations.\n       (c)(1) Filing an incomplete petition for review will result \n     in the exclusive representative being asked to provide the \n     missing or incomplete information. Noncompliance with a \n     request to complete the record may result in dismissal of the \n     petition.\n       (2) The processing priority accorded to an incomplete \n     petition, relative to other pending negotiability appeals, \n     will be based upon the date when the petition is completed--\n     not the date it was originally filed.\n     Sec. 2424.5 Selection of the unfair labor practice procedure \n         or the negotiability procedure\n       Where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice \n     charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter which \n     involves a negotiability issue, and the labor organization \n     also files pursuant to this part a petition for review of the \n     same negotiability issue, the Board and the General Counsel \n     ordinarily will not process the unfair labor practice charge \n     and the petition for review simultaneously. Under such \n     circumstances, the labor organization must select under which \n     procedure to proceed. Upon selection of one procedure, \n     further action under the other procedure will ordinarily be \n     suspended. Such selection must be made regardless of whether \n     the unfair labor practice charge or the petition for review \n     of a negotiability issue is filed first.

Madam President, the recent shooting of two young Greek \nCypriots and a Turkish Cypriot soldier have raised tension on Cyprus to \na higher level than has been experienced in many years. These events \ndemonstrate that the status quo of foreign occupation and forcible \ndivision of the island is unacceptable and dangerous to peace and \nstability in the area.\n  Above all, the recent killings highlight the need to demilitarize \nCyprus as a first step toward achieving a just and lasting solution to \nthe Cyprus problem. Last fall, the U.S. House of Representatives \nadopted a resolution calling for demilitarization and it was \nsubsequently approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The \nneed for demilitarization is even greater now than it was last year.\n  Neither demilitarization nor a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus \nproblem will occur, however, unless Turkey demonstrates the political \nwill and flexibility to arrive at a compromise solution to the division \nof Cyprus. In order for that to happen, the United States and its \nEuropean allies must make a concerted effort to convince Turkey that an \nend to the division of Cyprus is in everyone's security interest.\n  The Ambassador of Cyprus in Washington, Andrew J. Jacovides, has very \npersuasively laid out the case for such an effort in a letter to the \neditor of the Washington Post that was published on September 9. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of his letter be printed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                    Cyprus: The Problem Is Solvable\n\n       The editorial ``Cyprus: Try Everything'' [Aug. 26], though \n     well intended and timely, particularly in the wake of the \n     recent brutal murders of two unarmed young Greek Cypriots who \n     were peacefully demonstrating their justifiable feelings \n     against Turkish occupation, miscasts some of the main \n     relevant issues.\n       The recent events demonstrate that the status quo of \n     occupation and forcible division is unacceptable and is \n     indeed a source of tension and instability as well as the \n     cause of grave injustice and much human suffering. In fact, \n     there is much more in common that can unite Greek and Turkish \n     Cypriots than the differences that at present divide them \n     (though, of course, this does not hold true for the Anatolian \n     settlers or the ``Grey Wolves'' imported from Turkey).\n       The Cyprus problem is solvable, and the basis for its \n     solution lies within the parameters defined by U.N. \n     resolutions, voted for also by the United States. In addition \n     to the prospect of Cyprus's accession to the European Union \n     highlighted in The Post's editorial, the demilitarization of \n     Cyprus is a key element. In a resolution overwhelmingly \n     adopted by the House of Representatives last September, \n     Congress ``considers that ultimate, total demilitarization of \n     the Republic of Cyprus would meet the security concerns of \n     all parties involved, would enhance prospects for a peaceful \n     and lasting resolution of the dispute regarding Cyprus, would \n     benefit all of the people of Cyprus, and merits international \n     support.''\n       There has been no lack of prominent diplomats engaged in \n     the search for a Cyprus settlement, including Richard \n     Holbrooke, Richard Beattie and, most recently, U.N. \n     Ambassador Madeleine Albright. We certainly welcome such \n     engagement. What is lacking, however, is the political will \n     and the flexibility necessary to make a breakthrough toward a \n     compromise solution on the part of Ankara, which has long \n     held the key to such a solution through its military, \n     economic and political dominance of the occupied northern \n     part of Cyprus since 1974. Regrettably, the current regime in \n     Turkey does not hold much promise that this will happen soon, \n     unless there is a concerted international effort directed \n     toward Ankara.\n       A just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem is to the \n     benefit of all parties concerned and is in fact crucial to \n     improved relations between Greece and Turkey. For the United \n     States, which has excellent relations with Cyprus as \n     highlighted during the recent visit of President Glafcos \n     Clerides to Washington, such a solution enjoys bipartisan \n     support and is in the national interest. It can be achieved \n     with active U.S. engagement and will be a foreign policy \n     success for the United States and indeed for any \n     administration.\n       The issue is not to just ``try everything'' but to take all \n     appropriate and effective steps to end the division of the \n     island and safeguard the security and human rights of all its \n     people in a demilitarized, federal Cyprus within the European \n     Union.\n                                              Andrew J. Jacovides,\n     Ambassador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10420-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10420-S10424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEFERRAL OF ACTION ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, earlier today the majority and minority \ncooperated in the vitiation of a unanimous-consent agreement under \nwhich a landmark international agreement, the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, was to have been considered. I hope very much that the \nSenate will be able to return to that treaty under more favorable \ncircumstances.\n  It is important to understand that the treaty had been subjected to a \nbarrage of criticism in recent weeks--some of it apparently motivated \nby a simple desire to kill the treaty. As a result the treaty's merits \nwere somewhat obscured.\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\n  The Senate's former majority leader, former Senator Robert Dole, the \nRepublican Party's current candidate for President, expressed certain \nreservations yesterday. Mr. Dole indicated that he would only support \nthe treaty if we had high confidence that our intelligence community \nwould detect violations and that the treaty will be truly global and \ninclude such parties as Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and North Korea.\n  In the context of the Dole comments it became clear that the Senate \nwould probably have to consider two amendments offered by the majority \nas provided for in the unanimous-consent agreement. The first amendment \nappeared likely to prohibit the President from depositing the U.S. \ninstrument of ratification unless the Director of Central Intelligence \ncertified to the Senate that the intelligence community could monitor \nthe treaty with high confidence. The second amendment would have \nprevented the President from depositing the instrument of ratification \nuntil he certified that such so-called rogue states as Iran, Iraq, \nLibya, North Korea, and Syria had ratified the treaty.\n  The first amendment would have established an impossible standard, \nsince no Director of Central Intelligence could ever make such a \ncertification with regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  It is the very nature of chemical weapons that they can be made with \nvery simple equipment and in small spaces. Nations or terrorist groups \ncould certainly succeed in manufacturing quantities of lethal \nchemicals. Certainly no Director of Central Intelligence could ever \nexpress high confidence about abilities to detect all such activities.\n  Most of those familiar with the treaty understand that it represents \na departure from the high confidence of detection that could be applied \nin earlier accords dealing with strategic offensive arms, for instance. \nSilos can be counted and so can submarines and their missiles. Bombers \nat airfields are clearly visible.\n  We must understand now that we are entering new fields of arms \ncontrol and that there are going to be fewer absolute certainties.\n  The important standard to be met with regard to verification of arms \ncontrol agreements is that we would be able to detect any militarily \nsignificant illegal activity under the treaty and be able to respond to \nthat activity before any damage to our national security interests \ncould occur.\n  Mr. Dole tied the impossible demand for high confidence in \nverification to insistence that the convention be effectively \nverifiable. Effective verification alone is a standard most experts \nbelieve this convention should meet and has met. The need for effective \nverification has been a commonly accepted standard for years. \nInsistence on high confidence of the detection of myriad violations \nmoves the standard to the realm of impossibility, as Mr. Dole and \ntreaty opponents know fully.\n  President George Bush concluded that the treaty was indeed \neffectively verifiable. In a July 18, 1994, letter to me, former \nPresident Bush wrote:\n\n       The United States worked hard to ensure that the Convention \n     could be effectively verified. At the same time, we sought \n     the means to protect both United States security interests \n     and commercial capabilities. I am convinced that the \n     Convention we signed served both objectives, effectively \n     banning chemical weapons without creating an unnecessary \n     burden on legitimate activities.\n\n  Our highest current military authority, General John Shalikashvili, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in testimony prepared for \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n       While no treaty is 100 percent verifiable, the CWC is \n     effectively verifiable. It provides for complementary and \n     overlapping verification requirements that help deter CW \n     violations. The CWC does this through the most intrusive \n     verification provisions of any arms control regime to date. \n     This verification regime consists of declarations, routine \n     inspections of declared facilities, and short notice \n     challenge inspection of any facility. Of note, some of the \n     convention's imperfection was intentional in order to protect \n     our military interests. The regime allows military commanders \n     to protect classified information, equipment, and facilities \n     unrelated to the Convention.\n\n  In response to concerns regarding clandestine programs, Secretary of \nDefense William J. Perry argued,\n\n       While we recognize that detecting illicit production of \n     small quantities of chemical weapons will be extremely \n     difficult, we also recognize that that would be even more \n     difficult without a Chemical Weapons Convention. In fact, the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention verification regime, through its \n     declaration, routine inspection, fact-finding, consultation \n     and challenge inspections, should prove effective in \n     providing a wealth of information on possible chemical \n     weapons programs that simply would not be available without \n     the convention.\n\n  Mr. John Holum, Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency stated:\n\n       While no treaty is 100 percent verifiable, the CWC will \n     increase the risk of detection and therefore help deter \n     illicit chemical weapons activities. Its declaration and \n     inspection provisions will help build a web of deterrence, \n     detection, and possible sanctions that reduces the incentives \n     for states to build chemical weapons.\n\n  The then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. R. James \nWoolsey stated:\n\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention provides the intelligence \n     community with a new tool to add to our collection tool kit. \n     It is an instrument with broad applicability, which can help \n     resolve a wide variety of problems. Moreover, it is a \n     universal tool which can be used by diplomats and \n     politicians, as well as intelligence specialists, to further \n     a common goal: elimination of the threat of chemical weapons.\n\n  Mr. Woolsey also added:\n\n       The isolation and adverse attention that nonsignatories \n     will draw upon themselves may spur greater multinational \n     cooperation in attempting to halt offensive chemical weapons \n     programs.\n\n  Secretary of State Christopher argued:\n\n       No treaty is 100 percent verifiable, but the Convention is \n     carefully structured so that Parties tempted to cheat will \n     never be sure they can evade detection and sanctions. The \n     sooner the Convention enters into force, the sooner those \n     countries possessing or seeking chemical weapons will have to \n     make a choice: abide by its provisions or suffer the weight \n     of penalties and sanctions imposed by the international \n     community.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Perry stated:\n\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention contains the most extensive \n     verification provisions of any arms control regime. It \n     consists of detailed declarations, routine inspections of \n     declared sites and short notice challenge inspections. With \n     its complementary and overlapping verification requirements, \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention's regime provides the means \n     to help deter a state party from violating the provisions of \n     the Convention. Therefore, we are confident that activities \n     such as the destruction of declared chemical weapons stocks \n     and production facilities can be verified. We are confident \n     that we will be able to detect large-scale production, \n     filling and stockpiling of chemical weapons.\n\n  With regard to the desire that the convention be truly global, I \nwould point out that history demonstrates that well-conceived treaties, \nsuch as the Chemical Weapons Convention is, pick up parties over time \nand become worldwide in scope. That was certainly true of the Limited \nTest Ban Treaty and the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If we were to \nwait to join until all nations that caused us concern had joined, there \nis no question in my mind that the convention would be hobbled by our \nabsence over a number of years.\n  It is no threat to Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and North Korea to say \nthat we will not join the treaty until they do. Rather than our \napplying pressure on them, it is more likely that such a stance would \nbe used by the rogue states to apply pressure to us. It makes far more \nsense to start out, as envisaged by the treaty, with a minimum of 65 \nstates parties and build from that point and be in a position to apply \neffective international pressure upon rogue states to behave themselves \nand get into the treaty.\n  Madam President, The Chemical Weapons Convention, if successful, will \nban the production, acquisition, stockpiling, and use of chemical \nweapons.\n  In it each State Party undertakes never, under any circumstances, to \ndevelop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical \nweapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to \nanyone;\n  Use chemical weapons;\n  Engage in any military preparations to use chemical weapons; and\n  Assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any \nactivity prohibited to a State Party under this convention.\n  In addition each State Party undertakes, all in accordance with the \nprovisions of the convention to destroy the chemical weapons it owns or \npossesses or that are located in any place under\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\nits jurisdiction or control;\n\n  Destroy all chemical weapons it abandoned on the territory of another \nState Party; and\n  Destroy any chemical weapons production facilities it owns or \npossesses or that are located in any place under its jurisdiction or \ncontrol.\n  Finally, each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents \nas a method of warfare.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention provides for both routine and \nchallenge inspections to assist in the verification of compliance with \nthe convention.\n  Madam President, as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, I \nheld six public hearings and three closed sessions of the committee in \n1994. In those hearings, witnesses included Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John \nShalikashvili; the Director of the United States Arms Control \nAssociation, John D. Holum; the U.S. negotiator for the convention, \nAmbassador Stephen J. Ledogar; the Director of Central Intelligence, R. \nJames Woolsey; and other senior officers of the national security and \nforeign policy agencies of the executive branch. In addition, the \ncommittee received extensive testimony from a number of nongovernmental \nwitnesses. We were very careful to receive testimony from critics, as \nwell as supporters, of the treaty so that the committee and the Senate \nwould be assured the opportunity to receive a balanced and reasoned \njudgment on the merits of the convention.\n  Earlier this year, the committee held wrap-up hearings on the \nconvention before marking up the treaty this spring. Both critics and \nsupporters were heard. I and other supporters concluded following these \nfinal hearings that the United States would clearly benefit and could \nnot suffer significant harm through joining the treaty and helping to \nensure its success.\n  On April 25, the committee voted by a 2-to-1 margin, 12 to 6, to \napprove a substitute resolution of ratification I offered with the \nSenator from Indiana, [Mr. Lugar] we were joined as co-sponsors in this \nventure by Senators Kassebaum, Biden, Dodd, and Kerry.\n  In our resolution, which was fully supported by the executive branch, \nwe made every effort to identify areas of legitimate concern and to \ndeal effectively with them.\n  Madam President, I would hope that the resolution adopted by the \ncommittee with strong bipartisan support will help the Senate when it \nreturns to consideration of this vitally important venture.\n  Madam President, a number of concerns have been expressed regarding \nthe possible effects on business of the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nSome fear that the convention would pose a new and onerous burden on \nbusinesses throughout the country. It is important to understand that \nindustry representatives were involved throughout the course of the \nnegotiation and worked carefully to ensure that the chemical weapons \nban would be effective and that it would be quite manageable from the \nstandpoint of business. Government officials also have been involved in \nefforts to ensure that implementation of the convention would \nconstitute the smallest inconveniences possible.\n  In that connection, I received a very informative letter today from \nthe Honorable Michael Kantor, Secretary of Commerce, and Mr. Philip \nLauder, the Administrator of the Small Business administration dealing \nwith a number of misconceptions regarding the impact of the convention \non small business. Also today, I received additional information in a \nletter from Mr. Frederick L. Webber, president and chief executive \nofficer of the Chemical Manufacturers Association. I ask that the \nletter be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PELL. Earlier I drew to my fellow Senators, attention a letter \nsigned by 53 senior executives of the chemical industry in support of \nthe convention. I ask unanimous consent that that August 29 letter be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PELL. Lastly, I would like to make a matter of public record the \nwidespread support the convention enjoys in the arms control community. \nI ask unanimous consent that a September 3 letter to me and my fellow \nMembers urging approval of the Chemical Weapons Convention also be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. PELL. We cannot ignore now the fact that the Chemical Weapons \nConvention is an integral part of a continuum of arms control \nagreements that developed in the period since the Second World War. In \nthat period we have embarked on undertakings that ban nuclear weapons \nin outer space, on the ocean floor, that limit nuclear weapons \nelsewhere in the world and have resulted in the removal, following \ndeployment, of a whole class of nuclear missiles from Europe. The \nnations of the world have joined together in a truly global effort to \nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and they took advantage of \nthe opportunity last year to extend the non-proliferation treaty \nindefinitely, without condition. We and the former Soviet Union forged \nahead with a series of agreements limiting strategic offensive and \ndefensive missiles and those agreements have now been broadened to \ninclude other successor states of the former Soviet Union. More than 2 \ndecades ago the nations of the world agreed to ban biological weapons. \nWith this agreement we are attempting to ban chemical weapons.\n  The result of all this is certainly not a perfect world and all of \nour efforts are not completely successful. We know, for instance, that \nthere are biological weapons in the world. We know that there will be \nchemical weapons in the world--even under this convention when \nratified. We know that we cannot solve the world's woes immediately \nthrough such accords, but we can change the goals of the world and we \ncan change the direction of the body of nations. With the Chemical \nWeapons Convention we will move away from a situation which those who \nwish to have chemical weapons are free to have them, if not to use \nthem, to a new situation in which the responsible nations of the world \nwill be doing their best to banish this class of weapons from the face \nof the Earth.\n  The failure to take this could prove most unfortunate. A U.S. \ndecision not to join the Chemical Weapons Convention would not stop it \nfrom entering into force, but would surely undermine the effectiveness \nof the treaty and would be harmful to critically important U.S. \ninterests in identifying and dealing with chemical weapons threats in \nvarious parts of the world. It is not in our interest to be on the \noutside looking in as the Chemical Weapons Convention is set up.\n  Madam President, this convention enjoys the support of a number of \nRepublican Senators and has virtually unanimous Senate Democratic \nsupport. I hope that the Senate will wisely return to consideration of \nthis convention at an opportune and early moment. There is no question \nin my mind that we will pay a price for today's regrettably necessary \ndecision. We can hope that the opportunity will return to get the \nUnited States back on track with regard to a chemical weapons ban.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                    The Secretary of Commerce,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pell: We are writing to clarify a number of \n     misconceptions regarding the impact of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention (CWC) on small business. Contrary to a number of \n     allegations, the CWC will not impose a burdensome reporting \n     requirement on small businesses nor will it subject them to a \n     frequent and intrusive regime of international inspections.\n       The Administration estimates that about 2000 firms will be \n     required to submit a data declaration. The reporting burden \n     on smaller chemical companies will focus mainly on producers \n     of ``Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals'' (carbon \n     compounds). The vast majority of these--some 1800-1900--\n     firms, many of which are smaller companies, will only be \n     required to submit annual reports that identify aggregate \n     production ranges (e.g., this plant site produced over 10,000 \n     metric tons of Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals last \n     year.) They will not be required to identify the specific \n     chemicals that were produced.\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\n       Previously, the Administration had estimated that more \n     companies would be required to submit a data declaration. \n     However, additional analysis indicated that many did not \n     cross the CWC production threshold for reporting. Further, \n     administrative exemptions at the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] will be crafted to \n     exclude entire industries from reporting--biomediated \n     processes (such as certain beverages) and polymers (such as \n     plastics used in football helmets). In addition, plant sites \n     that exclusively produce hydrocarbons (e.g. propane and \n     ethylene) are completely excluded from any reporting \n     requirements.\n       This ``Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals'' data \n     declaration does not require any information regarding \n     imports, exports, usage or processing. We estimate that it \n     will take a few hours to complete this ``Unscheduled Discrete \n     Organic Chemical'' form the first time. Subsequent annual \n     reporting should be much more simple and take less time.\n       No manufacturer of ``Unscheduled Discrete Organic \n     Chemicals'' will be subject to a routine inspection during \n     the first three years. After three years, OPCW will address \n     the issue of inspections for manufacturers of ``Unscheduled \n     Discrete Organic Chemicals''. It is unlikely that many of \n     these producers would ever be inspected.\n       We anticipate that there will be very few challenge \n     inspections and the prospect for a challenge inspection of a \n     small producer of ``Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals'' \n     is remote indeed. It is likely that whatever challenge \n     inspection requests are issued will be directed at military \n     facilities. These facilities are well prepared to protect \n     classified and other sensitive information.\n       In this regard, we want to make it clear that the Synthetic \n     Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA) and its \n     260 members support ratification of the CWC. SOCMA's member \n     companies are typically small businesses with fewer than 50 \n     employees and less than $50 million in annual sales. Further, \n     in a joint statement issued on September 10, 1996, SOCMA, the \n     Chemical Manufacturers Association [CMA] and the \n     Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers Association [PHARMA] \n     noted that ``We urge the Senate to support this historic arms \n     control agreement, and the prompt passage of the accompanying \n     implementing legislation.''\n       In short, the industry that will be affected by the CWC has \n     taken a strong position in support of Senate ratification. We \n     urge you to listen to their advice and ratify this important \n     treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Kantor,\n       Secretary of Commerce.\n     Philip Lader,\n       Administrator, Small Business Administration.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                          Chemical\n\n\n                                    Manufacturers Association,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, September 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pell: As the Senate prepares to consider the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), questions have been raised \n     about the impact of the treaty on the commercial chemical \n     industry in the United States. I want to reassure you that \n     the U.S. chemical industry unequivocally supports this \n     Convention.\n       As I stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \n     on numerous occasions, the Chemical Manufacturers Association \n     [CMA] has carefully reviewed the impact of the CWC on \n     industry. We tested the CWC's reporting and inspections \n     obligations. We balanced the costs and benefits of this \n     treaty, and found that the benefits far outweigh the costs.\n       The CWC will require approximately 2,000 commercial \n     facilities in the United States to report on their \n     activities. More than 90 percent of those facilities will \n     only need to file a simple two-page form, once a year with \n     the government. A second, smaller group of 200 facilites will \n     have more detailed reporting requirements, and may be subject \n     to on-site inspections. CMA's members worked closely with the \n     government in drafting the reporting forms, and in two \n     separate ``road tests'' of the reporting system, reported \n     that the system was indeed reasonable. CMA members also \n     helped craft the inspection procedures under the Convention. \n     Those procedures have been tested in commercial facilities in \n     the United States, to favorable reviews.\n       The second category of affected facilities are those that \n     produce commercial chemicals that can be diverted into \n     weapons production. It is important to note that even these \n     facilities have significant protections under the CWC, such \n     as the ability to negotiate how inspections are conducted, \n     and the ability to protect sensitive trade secrets. Companies \n     affected by these provisions have tested the draft U.S. \n     reporting forms, and even offered their facilities to test \n     inspection procedures. They reported to CMA that the CWC's \n     benefits far out-weighed the comparatively smaller cost of \n     implementation.\n       We are confident that between CMA and the other national \n     trade associations with whom we have worked (including the \n     Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association and the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, among \n     others), the overwhelming majority of companies that have \n     possible CWC-related obligations know and understand their \n     responsibilities.\n       The Senate should not learn belatedly about the \n     implications of the Convention for business, and business \n     should not learn belatedly about its obligations under the \n     Convention. That is why education and outreach has been one \n     of our major goals on the CWC. That is why we have worked \n     cosely with the U.S. and other governments to focus the \n     Convention on those facilities that may pose a risk to the \n     goal of a world free from chemical weapons.\n       For your further information, I have enclosed a copy of my \n     May 9, 1996 letter that was sent to all senators, which \n     details the commercial impact of the CWC.\n       The American chemical industry fully supports this treaty. \n     Senator, I urge you to vote in favor of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n       If you have any questions concerning the chemical \n     industry's support for the CWC, please have your staff \n     contact me or Claude Boudrias, Legislative Representative for \n     Trade & Tax at 703/741-5915\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Frederick L. Webber,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                                                  August 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pell: The undersigned senior executives of \n     chemical companies urge your vote in support of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention [CWC], and quick Senate action on \n     legislation to implement this important treaty.\n       The chemical industry has long supported the CWC. Our \n     industry participated in negotiating the agreement, and in \n     U.S. and international implementation efforts. The treaty \n     contains substantial protections for confidential business \n     information [CBI]. We know, because industry helped to draft \n     the CBI provisions. Chemical companies also help test the \n     draft CWC reporting system, and we tested the on-site \n     inspection procedures that will help verify compliance with \n     the treaty. In short, our industry has thoroughly examined \n     and tested this Convention. We have concluded that the \n     benefits of the CWC far outweigh the costs.\n       Indeed, the real price to pay would come from not ratifying \n     the CWC. The treaty calls for strict restrictions on trade \n     with nations which are not party to the Convention. The \n     chemical industry is America's largest export industry, \n     posting $60 billion in export sales last year. But our \n     industry's status as the world's preferred supplier of \n     chemical products may be jeopardized if the U.S. does not \n     ratify the Convention. If the Senate does not vote in favor \n     of the CWC, we stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in overseas sales, putting at risk thousands of good-paying \n     American jobs.\n       The U.S. chemical industry has spent more than 15 years \n     working on this agreement, and we long ago decided that \n     ratifying the CWC is the right thing to do.\n       We urge you to vote in support of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n           Sincerely,\n       J.

It will ban an entire class of \n     weapons of mass destruction, including production, \n     possession, transfer or use of chemical weapons. It will \n     require all parties to destroy their chemical weapons \n     stockpiles and production facilities and to open their \n     chemical industries to international inspection.\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention is a valuable instrument \n     for combating the spread of weapons of terror and mass \n     destruction. The treaty's destruction and verification \n     provision can build confidence among potential rivals that \n     they can avoid a chemical arms race. It will also help keep \n     these weapons out of the hands of terrorists.\n       The United States chemical industry strongly supports the \n     Convention. The Pentagon strongly supports the agreement as \n     well. It is most certainly in both the national and \n     international interest to achieve the global elimination of a \n     class of weapons that have proved more dangerous to innocent \n     civilians than to military forces.\n       By its terms, the Convention enters into force 180 days \n     after the 65th state has deposited its instruments of \n     ratification with the U.N. Secretary General. Sixty-one \n     countries have ratified the Convention at this point. Timely \n     action by the Senate will send a clear signal of strong U.S. \n     support, allowing the United States to exert its full \n     leadership in persuading other countries to ratify.\n       We urge the Senate to approve as quickly as possible the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, to oppose crippling reservations \n     or amendments, and at the same time move ahead with \n     elimination of these heinous weapons from our arsenal.\n           Yours sincerely,\n       John B.

A bill to extend certain Medicare community nursing \norganization demonstration projects; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              Community Nursing Organizations Legislation\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will permit \na three-year reauthorization of certain Medicare Community Nursing \nOrganization [CNO] demonstration projects within the Health Care \nFinancing Administration [HCFA].\n  In 1987, in response to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1987, Congress authorized the Community Nursing Organization \ndemonstration projects to test capitated payment under the Medicare \nProgram for community nursing and ambulatory care services furnished to \nbeneficiaries. The demonstration projects are structured to answer two \nquestions: First, is it feasible to have a capitated, case-managed, \nnurse service delivery model for home health and ambulatory care; and \nsecond, What is the impact on enrollees, providers, and the larger \nhealth care system?\n  These CNO programs are intended to reduce the breakup in the delivery \nof health care services, to reduce the use of costly emergency care \nservices, and to improve the continuity of home health and ambulatory \ncare for Medicare beneficiaries. CNO's are responsible with providing \nhome health care, case management, outpatient physical and speech \ntherapy, ambulance services, prosthetic devices, durable medical \nequipment, and any optional, HCFA-approved services appropriate to \nprevent the need to institutionalize Medicare enrollees.\n  HCFA awarded four CNO sites in September 1992 through the competitive \nprocurement process: First, Visiting Nurse Service in New York, NY--a \nnot-for-profit Medicare certified home health agency; second, Carle \nClinic in Mahomet, IL--a multispecialty group practice; third, \nCarondelet Health Care in Tuscon, AZ--a hospital-based organization; \nand fourth, Living at Home/Block Nurse Program in St. Paul, MN--a not-\nfor-profit nursing organization replicating the Block Nurse Program \nmodel. These CNO's operate under full financial risk to themselves and \nare financially responsible for the provision of all mandatory \ncommunity nursing and ambulatory care services available to Medicare \nenrollees.\n  Mr. President, these CNO projects are consistent with congressional \nefforts to\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\nintroduce a wider range of managed care options to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Their authorization needs to be extended in order to \nensure a fair testing of the CNO managed care concept. We need the \nextention of this demonstration authority to continue to provide an \nimportant example of how coordinated care can provide additional \nbenefits without increasing Medicare costs. In addition, further time \nis necessary to evaluate the impact of the CNO contribution to Medicare \npatients and to assess their capacity for operating under a fixed \nbudget.\n  Most importantly, this demonstration extension will not increase \nMedicare expenditures. CNO's actually save Medicare dollars by \nproviding better and more accessible health care in homes and in \ncommunity settings, thereby allowing enrollees to avoid unnecessary \nhospitalizations and nursing home admissions. By demonstrating what a \nprimary care-oriented nursing practice can accomplish with elderly or \ndisabled patients, CNO's help illuminate methods for increasing \nbenefits, saving funding dollars, and most importantly, improving the \nquality of life for patients.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider this bill carefully \nand join me in seeking to extend these cost-savings and patient-\noriented CNO demonstrations for another 3 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF CERTAIN MEDICARE COMMUNITY NURSING \n                   ORGANIZATION DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, demonstration \n     projects conducted under section 4079 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1987 my be conducted for an additional \n     period of 3 years, and the deadline for any report required \n     relating to the results of such projects shall be not later \n     than 6 months after the end of such additional period.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2068. A bill to provide for a study of the recommendations of the \nJoint Federal-State Commission on Policies and Programs Affecting \nAlaska Natives, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n             the alaska native commission study act of 1996\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the \nAlaska Native Commission Study bill. I am pleased that my colleague \nSenator Stevens of Alaska is joining me as a cosponsor. This \nlegislation is the product of years of study and candid self-appraisal \nby Alaska Natives about their standard-of-living problems and the need \nto address these problems. It is also the product of a congressional \nact that called for the study of the problems.\n  Public Law 101-379 established the Joint Federal-State Commission on \nPolicies and Programs Affecting Alaska Natives, better known as the \nAlaska Natives Commission. Among its many recommendations, the \nCommission called for Federal funding to examine how best to implement \nthe recommendations of the Commission. The purpose of this bill is to \nestablish the funding for such a study.\n  The need for this study is well documented. In 1989, I and \nRepresentative Don Young of Alaska introduced a bill creating the \nAlaska Natives Commission, a publish commission jointly funded by the \nState and Federal Governments. The creation of the commission followed \nthe publication in 1989 of the ``Report on the Status of Alaska \nNatives: A Call for Action'' by the Alaska Federation of Natives and \nwas also spurred by extensive congressional hearings which focussed on \nthe need for the first comprehensive assessment of the social, \ncultural, and economic condition of Alaska's 90,000 Natives since the \nenactment of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Public Law 92-\n203.\n  Here are but some of the findings of the Alaska Natives Commission \nregarding the condition of Alaska Natives:\n  Alcohol problems are one of the key reasons why Alaska Natives \ncomprise 36-40 percent of the statewide prison population, even though \nthey total only 16 percent of the population of Alaska.\n  Alaska Native families need help: In 1988, one out of every eleven \nAlaska Native children received child protection services from the \nState of Alaska.\n  Alaska Natives need to have opportunities and training for jobs: In \n1990, 20 percent of the Native work force was unemployed, and for \nAlaska Natives living in villages, the rate can be as high as 50-80 \npercent, depending on the season and location.\n  Alaska Natives need more opportunities for an education: 12-15 \npercent of Alaska Native high school students drop out from village/\nrural schools; 60 percent of Native students entering urban high \nschools do not graduate.\n  This bill calls for the authorization of $350,000 in Federal funds to \nbe spent by the Alaska Federation of Natives to study how to implement \nthe recommendations of the Alaska Native Commission. This investment is \nneeded to create realistic solutions to serious problems. I would note \nthat Congressman Young has introduced a companion bill in the \nHouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 2069. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on specialized glass \nfor use in glass-ceramic stovetops; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 temporary duty suspension legislation\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \npreserve jobs in South Carolina. The bill temporarily suspends the duty \non specialized glass for use in glass-ceramic stove tops. Corning \nCompany has made an investment in Fountain Inn, SC to revive a factory \nthat has been struggling. The temporary suspension of the duty on \nglass-ceramic stove tops will enable Corning to keep jobs in the United \nStates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2070. A bill to ensure that homeowners receive adequate notice of \nand opportunity to comment on activities likely to adversely affect the \nvalue of their homes; and to create procedures for homeowners to \nreceive financial compensation for development which produces pollution \nand other impacts adversely affecting the value of their homes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n             THE HOMEOWNERS PROTECTION AND EMPOWERMENT ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in this Congress, there has been \nconsiderable debate on the issue of property rights. But the debate so \nfar has essentially ignored the interests of the largest group of \nproperty owners in America--the 60 million homeowners.\n  Until today, property rights legislation has tended to protect only a \nlimited group of property owners, those whose use or development of \ntheir property is regulated by the Federal Government. The typical \nhomeowners who we all represent live in already constructed homes; they \nare not developing their property. When they use their property in a \ntypical fashion, they are not regulated under the wetlands law, the \nendangered species law, or any other Federal status.\n  The typical homeowner is helped, not hurt, by many government \npolicies that keep our air clean and our water health and pure. When \nthese homeowners' property rights and property values are threatened, \nthe threat is more likely to come from pollution from neighboring \nfactories than from government actions to protect the environment.\n  Today, along with Senator Warner, I am introducing the Homeowners \nProtection and Empowerment Act to make sure the interests of America's \nhomeowners are protected. Our legislation provides homeowners with the \nright to sue for compensation whenever their property values are \ndiminished by an action regulated by the Federal Government. It \nprovides homeowners with a Federal right of action against anyone \nresponsible for decreasing a private party homeowner's property value \nby $10,000 or more, whether it's a Federal agency or a private party \nacting under authority of Federal law.\n  For example, if a developer fills in federally regulated wetlands, \nthe result may be increased flooding on downstream homeowners' \nproperties, because undeveloped wetlands help to control flooding. This \nincreased risk of\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\nflooding diminishes the value of downstream homeowners' properties. \nUnder the Homeowners Protection and Empowerment Act, any affected \nhomeowner whose property value declined by at least $10,000 because of \nthe developer's wetland filling would have the right to sue the \ndeveloper for compensation.\n  The legislation also requires anyone conducting an activity that both \nrequires a permit or other authorization under Federal law and \ngenerates pollution or has other property damaging impacts to give \nwritten notice about the activity and its potential impact to each \nhomeowner living within a quarter mile of the activity.\n  I want to thank Senator Warner for working with me on this \nlegislation and for helping to clarify that the intent of the \nlegislation is to protect typical homeowners. I look forward to working \nwith him to move the legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2071. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nestablish provisions with respect to religious accommodation in \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                  the workplace religious freedom act\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act of 1996. This bill would protect \nworkers from on-the-job discrimination. It represents a milestone in \nthe protection of religious liberty, assuring that all workers have \nequal employment opportunities.\n  In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require \nemployers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or \nobservance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the \nemployer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has \nbeen interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint \non an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act will restore to the religious \naccommodation provision the weight that Congress originally intended \nand help assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to \nreasonably accommodate their employees' religious practices.\n  The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many \nreligiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to \ncarry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from \nemployers. I have heard examples from around the country about a small \nminority of employers who will not make reasonable accommodation for \nobservance of the Sabbath and other holy days; for employees who must \nwear religiously required garb, such as a yarmulke; or for clothing \nthat meets modesty requirements.\n  The refusal of an employer, absent undue hardship, to provide \nreasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a \nform of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in \n1972. And religious discrimination should be treated fully as seriously \nas any other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and \nequal employment opportunities. Enactment of the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act will constitute an important step toward ensuring that all \nmembers of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, \nwill be protected from an invidious form of discrimination.\n  It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the \nreligious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers \nfrom an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only \nif their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for \nthe employer. This commonsense definition of undue hardship is used in \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and has worked well in that \ncontext.\n  I believe this bill should receive bipartisan support. It has been \nendorsed by a wide range of organizations including the American Jewish \nCommittee, the Baptist Joint Committee, the Christian Legal Society, \nand the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston.\n  As the Jewish high holidays and eventually Christmas approach, I feel \nstrongly that workers should not have to worry that they will be \nprohibited from choosing to take time off from work to observe a \nreligious holiday. I urge this body to pass this legislation so that \nall workers can have equal employment opportunities and practice their \nreligion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10426-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 863\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Hatch] was added as a cosponsor of S. 863, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for increased medicare \nreimbursement for physician assistants, to increase the delivery of \nhealth services in health professional shortage areas, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 905\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, the name of the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Frist] was added as a cosponsor of S. 905, a bill to provide for \nthe management of the airplane over units of the National Park System, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n  At the request of Mr. Ashcroft, the name of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1129, a bill to amend the \nFair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to permit employers to provide for \nflexible and compressed schedules, to permit employers to give priority \ntreatment in hiring decisions to former employees after periods of \nfamily care responsibility, to maintain the minimum wage and overtime \nexemption for employees subject to certain leave policies, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1963\n\n  At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the names of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina [Mr. Hollings], the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], \nthe Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], the Senator from Maryland [Ms. \nMikulski], and the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1963, a bill to establish a demonstration project to \nstudy and provide coverage of routine patient care costs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries with cancer who are enrolled in an approved clinical \ntrial program.\n\n\n                                S. 1967\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1967, a bill to provide \nthat members of the Armed Forces who performed services for the \npeacekeeping efforts in Somalia shall be entitled to tax benefits in \nthe same manner as if such services were performed in a combat zone, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1968\n\n  At the request of Mr. Faircloth, the name of the Senator from \nOklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1968, a bill to \nreorder United States budget priorities with respect to United States \nassistance to foreign countries and international organizations.\n\n\n                                S. 1969\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the names of the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Grassley], the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], the \nSenator from Virginia [Mr. Robb], and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson] were added as cosponsors of S. 1969, a bill to establish a \nCommission on Retirement Income Policy.\n\n\n                                S. 2018\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gorton, the name of the Senator from Washington \n[Mrs. Murray] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2018, a bill to approve a \nsettlement agreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the \nOroville-Tonasket Irrigation District.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5244\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kohl, the name of the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Biden] was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 5244 proposed to \nH.R. 3756, a bill making appropriations for the Treasury Department, \nthe United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and certain Independent Agencies, for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1997, and for other purposes.\n  At the request of Mr. Robb, his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 5244 proposed to H.R. 3756, supra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10428-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10429-S10430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION--290--RELATIVE TO MAJOR BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Nunn, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nCoats, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Byrd, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, \nand Mr. Hatch) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 290\n\n       Expressing the sense of the Senate that the major broadcast \n     television networks should revive their traditional ``Family \n     Hour'' and voluntarily reserve the first hour of prime time \n     broadcasting for family-oriented programming.\n       Whereas the major broadcast television networks once \n     adhered to a voluntary, self-enforced practice of setting \n     aside the first hour of prime time for programming suitable \n     for audiences of all ages, especially young children;\n       Whereas the major networks have recently abandoned this \n     practice and chosen to fill this hour with programs laden \n     with sexually suggestive language and behavior and mature \n     themes;\n       Whereas according to the most recent Nielsen ratings, \n     approximately 9,000,000 children between the ages of 2 and 11 \n     watch television during an average minute between 8:00 p.m. \n     and 9:00 p.m. e.s.t;\n       Whereas the clear majority of American parents are \n     concerned about the negative influence of television on \n     younger viewers, who watch on average 21 hours of television \n     a week;\n       Whereas that concern was recently demonstrated again in a \n     poll conducted by U.S. News & World Report which found that \n     76 percent of Americans believe that television contributes \n     to the problem of teenage pregnancy, 83 percent believe that \n     television contributes to casual sex, 90 percent believe that \n     television contributes to teenagers having sex too soon, and \n     92 percent believe that television contributes to violence on \n     our streets;\n       Whereas the Senate is comprised of elected representatives \n     who have a responsibility to give voice to the concerns of \n     their constituents; and\n       Whereas the Senate expresses public sentiment in this \n     resolution, and does not attempt to establish by law or \n     otherwise mandate or dictate any requirements regarding the \n     content of television programming: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the major \n     broadcast television networks should renew their commitment \n     to voluntarily reserving the first hour of prime time for \n     programming suitable for members of American families of all \n     ages.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to continue a dialog on an \nissue that many Americans, especially millions of parents, care deeply \nabout: the profound and often harmful influence that television is \nhaving on our children and our country.\n  As my colleagues know, the public's increasing anger about the \npervasive presence of sex, violence, and vulgarity on the small screen \nhas resulted in widespread criticism of the television industry. I \nbelieve that much of that criticism has been warranted. Just about a \nyear ago this week I came to the floor to take the major networks to \ntask for sponsoring what was widely reviled as the most lewd, crude, \nand rude prime-time lineup in television history, and for helping to \ndrag our societal standards down yet another notch.\n  So today, with the debut of the 1996 fall season upon us, I think it \nis only fair and right to focus on what I see as some truly positive \ndevelopments on this front, and to give praise to the television \nindustry where praise is due.\n  Over the last 18 months, we have seen industry leaders embrace the V-\nchip, which I was proud to cosponsor along with my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Conrad, and accept our challenge to create a self-\nenforced ratings system that will give parents more information about \nthe programs coming into their homes. We have seen the nation's \nbroadcasters acknowledge their obligation to promote more educational \nshows for children, and commit to airing every week at least 3 hours of \nprogramming that will enrich young minds and promote positive values.\n  And perhaps most encouraging of all, we have seen--quite literally \nseen--some modest yet significant changes in the quality of the product \nflowing over the airwaves. The deluge of perversity and degradation \ncoming out of the trash talk TV shows has receded, and Rosie O'Donnell \nhas shown with her quick wit and engaging personality that clean talk \ncan clean up in the ratings. Also, in response to the deep concern the \nAmerican people have expressed about the damage done by televised \nviolence, the major broadcast networks have made a real effort to \nreduce the number of graphic killings, assaults and rapes depicted \nduring prime time, and it has made a noticeable difference.\n  And, in terms of the new fall season, the reviews I've read indicate \nthat many of the shows premiering in the next few days turn away from \nthe smuttiness that characterized so many of the sitcoms that debuted \nlast year and offended and disgusted so many viewers. Even more \npromising, the networks seem more willing to take a chance on family-\noriented shows that seek to uplift as they entertain and to reinforce \nrather than tear down our common values. Programs such as ``Second \nNoah,'' which ABC chose to bring back this fall, and ``Touched By an \nAngel,'' which CBS stuck by when it struggled to gain an audience and \nis now one of the networks prized assets.\n\n  I think it's worth noting to my colleagues that the producer of \n``Touched by An Angel,'' Martha Williamson, will be honored at \nreception in the Capitol tonight for her commitment to creating \nentertainment that elevates us and appeals to our better rather than \nour baser natures. I am proud to be co-hosting this reception, at which \nMs. Williamson will premiere her new series, ``Promised Land,'' also on \nCBS this fall, and I would encourage Members to attend.\n  Mr. President, by calling attention to these positive signs I do not \nmean to suggest that television's problems have disappeared practically \novernight, or that the viewing public is suddenly satisfied. The \nreality is that there is still too much gratuitous and gruesome \nviolence not only available to but targeted at our children; there are \nstill too many shows that seek to shock and titillate, that add to the \ndegradation of our culture and fuel the ``anything-goes'' mentality \nthat I believe is at the root of the moral decline America is \nexperiencing today.\n  A survey released by the American Medical Association this week left \nlittle doubt that the public remains highly concerned, showing that 75 \npercent of parents are ``disgusted with media violence.'' In response, \nthe AMA took the significant step of sending out guidelines to 60,000 \ndoctors nationwide to help educate them and the parents they serve \nabout the negative effects of media violence on children.\n  But I firmly believe that television is making progress. I also \nbelieve that many of the people who run the television industry want us \nto know that they're not walking away from the responsibility that goes \nalong with their enormous power and influence. So as we continue to \ngive voice to the public's discontent, it is also important to \nencourage the responsiveness industry leaders have already shown, \nalbeit sometimes grudgingly, and to encourage them to keep moving \nforward.\n  That is why I am joining with 10 of my colleagues today to submit \nwhat we see as a very positive sense-of-the-Senate resolution, one that \nexpresses our support for the direction the television industry seems \nto be moving in. Quite simply, this resolution asks the major broadcast \nnetworks to help parents do their jobs by bringing back what was once \nknown as the ``Family Hour''. It urges the networks to once again set \naside the first hour of prime-time for programs that I can watch \ntogether with my wife and our 8-year-old daughter without fearing that \nI will be embarrassed or my values will be assaulted.\n\n  In recent years, that is something that most parents have been \nlegitimately fearful of. One of the most common complaints we hear \nabout television concerns the proliferation of lewd jokes and \ngratuitous sex scenes in the early hours of prime-time, when many young \nchildren are watching. Many parents feel that this kind of content goes \nfar beyond being inappropriate and offensive. They believe, as do we, \nthat these messages are harmful to their children's development and \nundercut the fundamental values that parents are trying to instill in \ntheir families.\n  Our resolution asks the networks to recognize the difficulties \nparents face in shielding their children from this kind of content, and \nto help meet them halfway. In effect, it asks them to do no more than \nto return to a practice they once adhered to willingly. This is a case \nwhere the networks for long\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\ntime acted quite responsibly and did a public service by creating a \nsafe haven for parents with young children. That is one rerun that most \nAmerican families want desperately to see again.\n  We do not want to pass any law or dictate what programs can or can't \nbe shown during the 8 o'clock hour. We just want to reiterate to the \npeople who run the networks that this an issue of grave concern to \nAmerican families, and that the family hour is a reasonable, \ncommonsense concept that has overwhelming support. A companion \nresolution in the House has attracted 97 cosponsors, and 20 Senators \nhave already endorsed the family hour movement, having signed a \npetition we sent to the network presidents in April.\n  Mr. President, the resonance of this issue was confirmed to me by a \nconversation I had with a leading network executive last year. He \nconfided in me that he regrets not being able to sit down with his \nchildren and watch television together as a family, much as he did with \nhis parents years ago, much as I did with my parents when I was young. \nThis is one of the great joys of the medium, and it is disappointing to \nmany parents today that they cannot share in it with their children.\n  It doesn't have to be that way, as CBS Entertainment has made clear \nthis fall, when its president pledged publicly that CBS would only air \nprograms at 8 o'clock that the whole family could watch together. \nCongress can help by adopting this resolution and encouraging--\nencouraging, not forcing--the television industry to follow CBS's lead \nand help restore the peace of mind that so many families are seeking. \nAlong with my original cosponsors, Senators Hutchison, Nunn, and \nDeWine, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport it, to make a strong statement on behalf of America's families, \nand I look forward to its adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10429-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10430-S10506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BYRD AMENDMENT NO. 5258\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BYRD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill (H.R. 3756) making appropriations for the Treasury Department, the \nUnited States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, \nand certain independent agencies, for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 1997, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 49, line 18, insert before the colon ``: Provided, \n     That of such amount provided for non-prospectus construction \n     projects $250,000 shall be available until expended for the \n     acquisition, lease, construction, and equipping of flexiplace \n     work telecommuting centers in the State of West Virginia''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 5259\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, H.R. 3756, surpa; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n       Sec.  .

SENSE OF THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF NEW BORDER STATION \n                   CONSTRUCTION IN LAREDO, TEXAS.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that:\n       (1) In 1995, over one-third (35%) of all U.S. exports to \n     Mexico were processed through the Port of Laredo;\n       (2) Nearly two-thirds of all U.S. exports to Mexico that \n     went through a south Texas port of entry went through the \n     Port of Laredo in 1995;\n       (3) The value of imports processed through the Port of \n     Laredo in 1995 exceeded $15 billion, and the value of all \n     exports was $14.7 billion for that year;\n       (4) The number of loaded, cross-border shipments, both \n     northbound and southbound, through the Port of Laredo is \n     projected to double from 1995 to the year 2000, from 851,745 \n     shipments to 1,703,490;\n       (5) The City of Laredo received on October 3, 1994 a \n     Presidential Permit from the U.S. State Department to \n     construct a third bridge in the city, and in February 1996 \n     the U.S. Coast Guard issued a permit for the bridge's \n     construction;\n       (6) Financing of the new bridge has been secured from both \n     sponsors, the cities of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, and in \n     February 1997 the City of Nuevo Laredo is scheduled to begin \n     construction of an access road connecting the bridge with the \n     loop around Nuevo Laredo;\n       (7) U.S. Customs revenue generated at the Port of Laredo \n     totaled $216 million in 1995, an increase of $13 million from \n     the previous year, while the U.S. Government's estimated cost \n     for operating border station facilities in Laredo is $10 \n     million, so that the Port generated over $200 million for the \n     U.S. Treasury in 1995; and\n       (8) The new bridge will greatly enhance safety in the \n     downtown area because it will allow the diversion of \n     commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges to \n     the new bridge, since the two downtown bridges will be \n     strictly passenger bridges, with the new bridge and the \n     Colombia Bridge (22 miles from Laredo) devoted to commercial \n     traffic.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The construction of a third bridge in Laredo is vitally \n     needed to accommodate increased trade with Mexico and to \n     relieve traffic congestion, road damage, and pollution in \n     downtown Laredo caused by commercial traffic; and\n       (2) The Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration should accelerate the timetable for design and \n     construction of a border station for the new Laredo bridge to \n     ensure that the bridge can be opened to international traffic \n     as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 KERRY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 5279\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Harkin) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. 3756, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 6, strike ``$395,597,000'' and insert \n     ``$416,897,000, of which $21,300,000, to remain available \n     until expended, shall be available to conduct the study under \n     section 732(a) of Public Law 104-132 (relating to marking, \n     rendering inert, and licensing of explosive materials) and to \n     conduct a study of threats to law enforcement officers from \n     the criminal use of firearms and ammunition; and''.\n       On page 22, line 14, strike ``$4,085,355,000'' and insert \n     ``$4,064,055,000''.\n       On page 25, between lines 21 and 22, insert:\n       Sec.   .

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Methamphetamine is a very dangerous and harmful drug. \n     It is highly addictive and is associated with permanent brain \n     damage in long-term users.\n       (2) The abuse of methamphetamine has increased dramatically \n     since 1990. This increased use has led to devastating effects \n     on individuals and the community, including--\n       (A) a dramatic increase in deaths associated with \n     methamphetamine ingestion;\n       (B) an increase in the number of violent crimes associated \n     with methamphetamine ingestion; and\n       (C) an increase in criminal activity associated with the \n     illegal importation of methamphetamine and precursor \n     compounds to support the growing appetite for this drug in \n     the United States.\n       (3) Illegal methamphetamine manufacture and abuse presents \n     an imminent public health threat that warrants aggressive law \n     enforcement action, increased research on methamphetamine and \n     other substance abuse, increased coordinated efforts to \n     prevent methamphetamine abuse, and increased monitoring of \n     the public health threat methamphetamine presents to the \n     communities of the United States.\n    TITLE I--IMPORTATION OF METHAMPHETAMINE AND PRECURSOR CHEMICALS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nextraordinary life of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin.\n  Cardinal Bernardin is one of America's most beloved and most \nrespected Catholics. He is the son of Italian immigrants and grew up in \nmy home State of South Carolina. I am proud to claim him as a product \nof the Palmetto State. He has had a tremendous impact on my life and \nthe lives of thousands of others.\n  Cardinal Bernardin was made a bishop in 1966, at 38, the youngest \nU.S. bishop of that time, and since then has held a wide range of \nleadership positions. As head of the archdiocese of Chicago, the \nNation's second-largest, for 14 years, he has built a reputation for \nreaching out to non-Catholics and for trying to bridge gaps within the \nchurch.\n  On September 9, Cardinal Bernardin was presented with the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor. In his \nremarks, President Clinton said, ``As the Archbishop of Chicago, \nCardinal Bernardin is one of our Nation's most beloved men and one of \nCatholicism's great leaders. When others have pulled people apart, \nCardinal Bernardin has sought common ground. In a time of transition in \nhis Church, his community, his Nation and the world, he has held fast \nto his mission to bring out the best in humanity and to bring people \ntogether. Throughout his career, he has fought tirelessly against \nsocial injustice, poverty, and ignorance. Without question, he is both \na remarkable man of God and a man of the people.''\n  In a column called ``Cardinal Virtues'' earlier this week, Washington \nPost columnist Mary McGrory also talked about the extraordinary life of \nCardinal Joseph Bernardin. She told of the grace with which confronting \nhis diagnosis of terminal cancer. He spoke of his diagnosis as a \n``gift,'' she said.\n  McGrory writes, ``Why? Before he knew he was going to die, he said he \nhad many fears.'' After the news, the Cardinal said, ``God has given me \nthe gift of peace and tranquility.''\n  McGrory went on to say that Cardinal Bernardin hopes to write a book \nto help other cancer victims who are terrified by the diagnosis and \nlose heart. ``I have spent 30 years as a bishop trying to teach people \nhow to live,'' he said during an interview. ``Now I will teach them how \nto die.''\n  Cardinal Bernardin is a remarkable man and I am honored to call him a \nfriend.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Mary McGrory's September 10 column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 10, 1996]\n\n                            Cardinal Virtues\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n       Under some pressure on the matter of the company he keeps, \n     President Clinton surrounded himself with some classy people \n     at the White House and gave the 11 of them the Medal of \n     Freedom, the highest civilian award. The star of the occasion \n     was a small, frail cardinal from Chicago, Joseph Bernardin, \n     who accepted the medal in the East Room and then went out on \n     the lawn to explain, gently, his differences with the donor.\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\n       His Eminence is totally pro-life: He is against abortion, \n     against capital punishment--both of which are favored by \n     Clinton. Some Catholics held that, given his fundamental \n     differences as well as on welfare reform, he should have \n     turned down the medal. But Bernardin explained that it comes \n     from the nation.\n       His updating of Saint Thomas More's famous self-\n     description, during a time of trouble with Henry VIII--``The \n     King's good servant, and God's first''--came on a day of \n     blazing heat and draining humidity. The cardinal, who was \n     recently told by doctors that he has inoperable liver cancer \n     and a limited time to live, went patiently from camera to \n     camera. ``I will take care of all of you,'' he promised \n     pastorally, and he did.\n       Some thought he might be asked to perform an exorcism at \n     the White House. As the scandal of the president's chosen \n     familiar, Dick Morris, widens and deepens, fumigation might \n     not be enough. Morris's sex life may be his own business, but \n     his arrogance is not. The most popular Catholic cleric was \n     the best possible counterpoint to the pond scum. After so \n     much of the profane, the sacred was welcome.\n       The cardinal startled many people when, recently in \n     Chicago, he announced that he is bound for the Promised Land. \n     He is in the midst of a project called ``Common Ground,'' \n     which he had hoped to be a forum where American Catholics can \n     discuss their differences on church matters. A mediator all \n     his life, he is concerned with the rise of incivility and \n     mean-spiritedness among the faithful. He was severely \n     criticized by three of his brother cardinals, who feared the \n     airing of unorthodoxy and possibly even heresy. He replied \n     imperturbably that the dissent of Cardinals Bernard Law of \n     Boston, James A. Hickey of Washington and Anthony Bevilacqua \n     of Philadelphia just pointed up the need for discourse.\n       As for being stricken at a time of such plans, he called it \n     ``a special gift from God.''\n       Why? Before he knew he was going to die, he said he had \n     many fears, among them being unjustly accused--he was by a \n     deranged young man who later recanted his story of sexual \n     harassment--and cancer. ``God has given me the gift of peace \n     and tranquility,'' he explained. He hopes to write a book to \n     help other cancer victims who are terrified by the diagnosis \n     and lose heart. ``I have spent 30 years as a bishop trying to \n     teach people how to live,'' he said during an interview. \n     ``Now I will try to teach them how to die.''\n       Conversations such as this rarely occur on the White House \n     lawn, where hustle and push are the rule. Doubtless talks \n     with the others who sat on the East Room stage would also \n     have been edifying.\n       The recipients had been carefully chosen not just for their \n     virtues and accomplishments but for their direct appeal to \n     various causes and ethnics. Rosa Parks, the woman who started \n     the Montgomery bus boycott by sitting down for her \n     principles, didn't make it in from Michigan in time for the \n     ceremony, but she is a black heroine. James Brady, the White \n     House press secretary who took a bullet for Ronald Reagan, \n     personifies the gun control legislation opposed by \n     Republicans; Millard Fuller is founder of Habitat for \n     Humanity, the universally admired organization that builds \n     homes for the poor and had Clinton hammering nails on his \n     birthday; David Hambur is a psychiatrist for children; John \n     H. Johnson is a black success story--he publishes Ebony and \n     Jet; Eugene Lang sends East Harlem children to college--Jack \n     Kemp, eat your heart out, Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, agent of the \n     Polish underground, speaks to Poles; Antonia Patoja to Puerto \n     Ricans; Ginetta Sagan, valiant young Italian resistance \n     courier who survived Fascist torture and devoted her life to \n     helping political prisoners; Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.), \n     former House environmentalist and wit, shows an appreciation \n     for House members.\n       Clinton needed to patch things up with Catholics. They grew \n     accustomed to choice--they took other social issues into \n     consideration--but were outraged by the president's failure \n     to sign the congressional ban on a late-term abortion \n     procedure. Honoring Bernardin, the most affecting U.S. \n     prelate, is a nice gesture. But Bernardin, in his mild way, \n     will continue to disagree on certain subjects in the most \n     public way possible. He intends to join a large protest \n     against later-term abortions on Thursday at the \n     Capitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10507-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID NOVAK\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Carter for 29 years of dedicated service to the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10508-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Tomorrow morning, at 9:30, it will be my intention to begin \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill, as we announced. We \nmay consider other bills if we can get an agreement. I hope that \nMembers will not feel compelled to offer nongermane amendments on the \nInterior appropriations bill, as we have just gone through. Again, we \nare aware that Senators have their rights. But it makes it awfully hard \non the leaders to try to get the work done. We spent 25\\1/2\\ hours on \nthis last bill. Hopefully, we can do the Interior appropriations bill \nwithout going through the same votes all over again.\n  Madam President, with regard to the earlier unanimous-consent \nrequest, we need to talk to the other Senator from Minnesota.\n  I want to make a commitment to the minority leader that we will not \ndo this before Tuesday. I will work with the Senators that are \ninvolved. I would rather not do a unanimous consent until I talk \ndirectly to that Senator. I will keep good faith with the minority\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\nleader on that. I think it is a reasonable request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. With that understanding, I will not have any objection. \nI hope we can work to resolve that relatively minor matter.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to confirm that there will be no recorded votes \ntomorrow. We will take up Interior or the Magnuson fisheries, if we can \nget an agreement. On Monday, we will take up the FAA authorization if \nwe can get an agreement on the time and amendments. Then we would go \nback to Interior. There will be no votes during the day on Monday. We \nwill have stacked votes on Tuesday morning at 9:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/12/senate-section/article/S10508-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
