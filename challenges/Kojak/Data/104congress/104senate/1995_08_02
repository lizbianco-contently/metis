Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of S. 1026, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1026) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1996 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, today the Senate begins consideration \nof S. 1026, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n1996. The bill we bring to the floor incorporates the Armed Services \nCommittee's best judgments on the Nation's defense requirements. It is \nbased on many long hours of testimony, analysis, debate, and \nconsideration of opposing views.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Nunn, for his outstanding leadership, and for his \nopen, fair, and bi-partisan manner. I would also like to thank the \nmembers of the committee and the professional staff for their \ndedication and hard work.\n  It has been a privilege to work with Senator Nunn to bring this bill \nto the Senate. Although it is a good bill, not every Member, including \nme, is happy with every part of it. Throughout the past 6 months the \ncommittee worked in its traditional bipartisan manner because the \nsecurity of the United States and the safety of our people are \nparamount. The bill reflects this cooperative effort, provides a clear \ndirection for national security, and maintains a solid foundation for \nthe defense of the Nation.\n  The committee's overarching intent was to revitalize the Armed Forces \nand enhance or preserve our national security capabilities. That is \nessential in this post-cold-war world in order to provide the \nleadership and stability which are critical to the growth of democracy. \nOur military must be capable and ready in order to provide our men and \nwomen in uniform the best possible chance to succeed and survive in \nevery demanding situation. We were reminded recently, with the \ndedication of the Korean War Memorial, that freedom is not free. We \nmust always remember that courage and sacrifice are the price of \nfreedom.\n  This bill would fund defense at $264.7 billion in budget authority \nfor fiscal year 1996. I have noted with interest some inaccurate \nreports in the press that the bill would increase defense spending, and \nI would like to set the record straight. The funding level in the bill \nwe bring to the floor today is nearly $6.2 billion lower in real terms \nthan last year's bill, and that represents a decline of 2 percent. \nAlthough it had been my hope to preserve funding at last year's level, \nthis is the best the committee could do, given the budgetary pressures \nfacing the Congress.\n  I have stated repeatedly that the administration is cutting defense \ntoo far, too fast. Most credible analysts conclude there is a shortfall \nof at least $150 billion in defense budget authority over the future \nyears defense plan. Although the proposal contained in this bill \nrepresents a decline in defense spending, I would note that the funding \nlevel is still $7 billion higher than the administration's budget \nrequest. The administration requested a defense budget 5 percent lower \nthan the fiscal year 1995 level, and that is simply unwise. \n\n[[Page S11128]]\n\n  Despite a decline in defense spending, the bill provides the \nresources to maintain substantial U.S. military power and the ability \nto project that power wherever our vital interests are at stake. An \nimplicit theme in our bill is that any aggressor or potential adversary \nshould know that our military services will remain the most effective \nand combat ready in the world.\n  National security is the most important responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment, and as we begin debate on this matter, I would like to \nexplain the priorities which the committee kept in mind in crafting the \nbill, and highlight a few key decisions. The first objective was to \nensure that forces remain viable, and manned at sufficient levels by \npeople of the highest quality. Well-motivated, well-trained, and well-\nled soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are the bedrock of national \nsecurity. Strong support for equitable pay and benefits, bachelor and \nfamily housing, and other quality of life measures are key elements in \nattracting and retaining high-quality people. Perhaps more importantly, \nthis bill expresses the commitment of the Senate to our\n men and women in uniform and attempts to uphold our part of the \nimplied contract.\n\n  Our second objective was to ensure the military effectiveness and \ncombat readiness of the Armed Forces. We believe the funding levels we \nhave recommended will be barely adequate to take care of current \nreadiness if the Department of Defense manages resources wisely and \ncarefully.\n  The quality of overall readiness essentially depends on adequate \nfunding for both current and future readiness. Although this funding \nallocation is often described in shorthand as a balance, I would \nsuggest it is a fundamental obligation of the Federal Government to \nprovide adequate resources for both current and future readiness. \nHowever, the mix is important because a disproportionate allocation of \nscarce resources to operation and maintenance accounts would limit \nfunds for the research, development, and procurement essential to \nmodernization. We sought to achieve a reasonable balance. We also \naddressed multiyear procurement to avoid creating bow waves of funding \nrequirements in subsequent years.\n  Department of Defense decisions to cancel or delay modernization \nprograms create unrealistic modernization requirements for the future. \nThe committee has addressed critical modernization needs by adding $5.3 \nbillion in procurement and $1.7 billion in research and development \naccounts to offset some of these problems. We believe the Department of \nDefense must continue to fund procurement, and research and \ndevelopment, at similar inflation-adjusted levels in future budget \nrequests.\n  Congress must also continue to provide sufficient funds for research \nand development to ensure the military's technological superiority in \nthe future. If we do not, future readiness will be jeopardized. Unless \nthe research and development, and procurement accounts are adequately \nfunded from year to year, the services will not have the right weapons, \nin sufficient quantity, to be able to fight and win in the next decade. \nWe must remember that the force we sent to war in Desert Storm was \nconceived in the 1970's and built in the 1980's. We must focus on the \nfuture.\n  Third, we addressed the proliferation of missile technology and \nweapons of mass destruction. We cannot stand by, idly watching, as an \nincreasing number of foreign states develop and acquire long-range \nballistic and cruise missiles. Many people do not realize that we \ncurrently have no defense whatsoever against any missile launched \nagainst the United States. None. Such missiles are capable of carrying \nnuclear, biological, and chemical payloads to any point in our country. \nWe, in the Congress, will richly deserve the harsh judgment of our \ncitizens if we fail to prepare for this clear eventuality.\n  It is our grave responsibility to ensure we develop the capability to \ndefend both our deployed forces and our homeland. The committee \nprovided direction and funds for both these requirements in the Missile \nDefense Act of 1995. This title of the bill initiates a new program for \ndefense against cruise missiles, while funding robust theater missile \ndefenses. It also mandates a national missile defense program which \nwill lead to the limited defense of the United States by the year 2003. \nI remind my colleagues that the largest single loss of life in the \nPersian Gulf war was from one, crude, Iraqi Scud missile that was not \neven targeted for the building it struck. It is entirely reasonable to \nspend less than 1\\1/2\\ percent of the defense budget to meet this \nserious security threat.\n  The bill's ballistic missile defense provisions also address the \nadministration's attempts to limit theater missile defenses by an \ninaccurate interpretation of the ABM Treaty. That treaty was intended \nto limit only defenses against strategic ballistic missiles, not \ntheater defenses. Unless this distinction is enforced, we will end up \nbuilding less-than-optimally capable systems which may not be effective \nagainst the highly capable missile threats emerging in the world's most \ntroubled regions.\n  Fourth, the committee was deeply concerned about maintaining the \nviability of the Nation's offensive strategic forces. According to the \nNuclear Posture Review, the United States will continue to depend on \nits nuclear forces for deterrence into the foreseeable future. Safe, \nreliable, and effective nuclear weapons are at the core of deterrence. \nIn this bill the committee directs the Department of Energy to meet its \nprimary responsibility of maintaining the Nation's nuclear capability. \nThis means the Energy Department must focus on a stockpile management \nprogram geared to the near-term refabrication and certification \nrequirements outlined in the NPR. If DOE cannot or will not shoulder \nthis responsibility, then another agency must be assigned the task. \nUnless steps are taken now to maintain a nuclear weapons manufacturing \ninfrastructure and a safe, reliable nuclear weapons stockpile, we face \nthe very real prospect of not being a first-rate nuclear power in 10 to \n15 years.\n  The committee addressed the role of long-range, heavy bombers in \nprojecting power. Although I regret the committee's vote not to fund \nthe B-2 program, I understand the concerns of Members on both sides \nabout the high cost of the program.\n  The committee is also concerned that the administration's budget \nrequest did not include funding for numerous operations which the Armed \nForces are currently conducting, even though the administration knew \nwhen it submitted its budget request that these operations would \ncontinue into fiscal year 1996. We authorized $125 million to pay for \nthese ongoing operations in order to avoid the kind of problems with \ncurtailed training which emerged last year.\n  I caution the administration that one consequence of paying for these \noperations on an unprogrammed, ad hoc basis is ultimately to deny the \nfunds necessary for readiness. Last year, the practice of paying for \npeacekeeping and other contingency operations without budgetary or \nsupplemental funding was directly responsible for lower readiness \nratings and curtailed training in some units. Unless the Department of \nDefense includes the funds for such operations in the budget request, \nit will be difficult if not impossible for Congress to assess the \nimpact these operations will have on other accounts. The oversight \nresponsibilities of Congress are hindered, if not usurped, when the \nDepartment does not budget for known requirements.\n  While I remain confident that this is a good defense bill under the \npresent circumstances, I remain troubled. The defense budget trend over \nthe past 10 years has been in constant decline, principally in response \nto budget pressures. The administration's request for procurement this \nyear is at the lowest level since 1950, declining more than 71 percent \nin real terms since 1985. The defense budget is at its lowest level as \na percentage of gross domestic product since 1940, just before a \ngrossly unprepared United States entered World War II. Each successive \nbudget since 1993 has continued to push\n recapitalization farther into the future. As a result, the Services \nhave been forced to delay the fielding of critical modern systems while \nmaintaining aging equipment at ever-increasing operating and \nmaintenance costs.\n\n  The prospects of not having adequate defense funds in the coming \nyears \n\n[[Page S11129]]\nshould alarm us all. Despite the recommended fiscal year 1996 funding \nincrease of $7.1 billion above the administration request, proposed \nfuture year budgets do not adequately fund the administration's Bottom-\nUp Review Force, which is itself barely adequate. These funding levels \ncannot meet known modernization needs and they do not even cover \ninflation. Shortfalls of the magnitude projected by the GAO and others \nwill seriously impair the ability of the Department of Defense to field \nthe combat-ready, modern forces essential to our national security. The \nlimited progress reflected in this bill cannot be maintained unless \nfuture funding is increased.\n  As the Senate takes up this defense bill, some Members will no doubt \nargue that my concerns about steadily declining defense spending and \nemerging threats are misplaced. They will point out that the cold war \nis over and provide long lists of other programs that could absorb the \nmoney. Such criticisms always surface after a major victory, and just \nbefore the emergence of the next major threat. They are always shown in \nthe long run to have been naive and shortsighted. They consistently \nfail to realize the usefulness of effective military power in shaping \nfuture events in ways that are favorable to us. They fail to recognize \nthe instability and uncertainty of the times, and they fail to consider \nthe future.\n  We cannot predict what challenges and dangers we will face in the \nfuture. We do not know with any certainty who will be our next peer \ncompetitor. I assure you, however, that a peer competitor will emerge \nand if such competitor believes there is an advantage because our \nmilitary has been weakened, he will become bold and our challenge will \nbe more significant. I encourage every Senator to keep this in mind as \nwe debate this bill over the next few days.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, as we begin debate on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1996, I first want to congratulate \nSenator Thurmond and his staff on reporting together the first defense \nauthorization bill that has been reported with Senator Thurmond as \ncommittee chairman. Although he has been a stalwart for many years on \nthe committee and has helped prepare the bills in the past, this is his \nfirst bill as the official chairman of the committee.\n  The major themes of this bill reflect Senator Thurmond's longstanding \nand strong and effective support for our national security. It has been \nmy great privilege and honor to have worked with Senator Thurmond in \nthe Senate and on the Armed Services Committee for all of my 22 years, \nand for at least maybe slightly more than half of his time here in the \nU.S. Senate. His career--and his decorated service in World War II and \nunwavering support for strong national defense, and his devotion to the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces--has served as a model and an \ninspiration to me, and to, I believe, his fellow members of the Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate.\n  The 18 to 3 vote in favor of the bill in the Armed Services Committee \nreflects the fact that the bill continues many bipartisan efforts \ninitiated by our committee in recent years, such as improvements in \nmilitary pay and benefits, modernization of weapons systems, and \nprotecting, as Senator Thurmond laid out, military readiness and \npersonnel quality. This bipartisan support also reflects the actions \ntaken by the committee to address concerns raised by Secretary of \nDefense Bill Perry about a number of the provisions in the House bill. \nIn contrast to the action taken by the House, for example, our bill \nprovides full funding for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram,\n the program that is aimed at trying to prevent proliferation of \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons all over the globe. It also \navoids micromanaging the Office of Secretary of Defense, as was done in \nthe House bill, and we do not have unworkable restrictions on military \noperations as the Secretary of Defense specified very clearly he feared \nwas being done in the House bill.\n  The bill before us provides $264.7 billion in budget authority, the \namount specified in the budget resolution. This amount, which is $7 \nbillion above the budget request, will enable us to fund the types of \ninitiatives that have received bipartisan support in the past. This \nincludes personnel programs such as the 2.4-percent pay raise for \nmembers of the Armed Forces and modernization programs from fighter \naircraft such as the F-22 to unglamorous but essential items such as \nArmy trucks. Most of the programs authorized by the committee reflect \nthe administration's priorities as set forth in the current year budget \nrequest or in the future years defense program which covers the next 5 \nyears. Dr. Perry, in his discussions with the committee, urged us to \nfocus any additions to the budget on acquisition programs that are in \nDOD's future years defense program. The bill before us largely follows \nthis recommendation.\n  And I believe as various Members may come to the floor and say that \nwe do not now need this program or that program which is funded with \nthe additional money that has been put in this bill that was provided \nin the budget resolution, I think it is very important for Members to \nkeep in mind that these programs--most of them, not every, but most of \nthem--that have been added are in the 5-year defense plan that \nSecretary Perry favors. And I think that is important for people to \nkeep that in mind. That was the request that Dr. Perry made of this \ncommittee, and I think we have largely honored that request.\n  Madam President, this bill contains important legislative initiatives \nsuch as the authority to use innovative programs to finance military \nhousing and housing for unaccompanied troops. This was a strong request \nand initiative by Dr. Perry and the Defense Department.\n  In addition, we establish a defense modernization account, which I \nsponsored and our committee supported, which for the first time that I \nhave any knowledge about will provide incentives for savings in defense \nprograms for use of those savings to modernize the equipment for our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  In other words, Madam President, if the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarine Corps can find savings, we will let them put those savings in a \ncarefully monitored account that will have to be, of course, monitored \nby the Congress and will have to follow our normal procedures. But \nthose savings will be able to be used for the most critical \ndeficiencies we face in modernization. And modernization in the \noutyears, the years ahead, is the biggest challenge we face.\n  I think everyone would acknowledge that we are, even with the \nincreases in this budget, underfunding the outyear modernization. When \nour equipment starts to wear out, which much of it will toward the end \nof this century, we are not going to have sufficient funding even with \nthe increases in this bill to cover that.\n  So what we want to do in this defense modernization account--I know \nsome Members will have some suggestions and concerns which we will \ncertainly listen carefully to--but this account will be controlled by \nthe Congress. It will be subject to the normal reprogramming and \nauthorization and appropriation procedures which we have now.\n  There is a limit on how much can be accumulated. But for the first \ntime we will be saying to each of the services, ``You will now have an \nincentive. If you figure out how to save money, it can go into an \naccount. We are not going to grab that money and take it away from you \nas your punishment for saving it. We are going to let you spend it \nsubject to the congressional oversight as outlined on the critical \nprograms you need in the future.''\n  I believe this kind of initiative has real potential and promise in \nterms of giving people throughout the military services a real \nincentive to try to save money. We all know the horror stories of what \nwe have heard for years, not just in the military but in all areas of \nGovernment where, when you get down toward the last couple of months of \nthe fiscal year, there is money that has not been spent, and the people \ninvolved in those decisions decide that if the money is not spent, not \nonly will it lapse but also they will have the budget cut the next \nyear. \n\n[[Page S11130]]\n\n  So there is almost a perverse incentive throughout Government now to \ntake whatever is not spent and spend it so that you do not have your \nbudget cut the next year. We want to reverse that psychology. This is \nat least a beginning along that line.\n  My outline of the bill's highlights should not, however, be viewed as \nrepresenting unqualified support for all the provisions of this bill. \nThe numerous rollcall votes during our committee markup reflect the \nserious concerns of many Members about inadequate funding of important \nprograms as well as questions about some of the priorities reflected in \nthis bill.\n  There is much in this bill that I support, and I do support the \noverall bill. But I do have serious reservations about those aspects of \nthe bill that appear to head back without very much thought given to \nthe period of the cold war.\n  For example, the proposed new Missile Defense Act of 1995 sets forth \na commitment to the deployment of missile defenses without regard, \nwithout any regard for the legal requirements of the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty which we are a party to and which we signed and which is \nan international obligation of the United States of America, until \nchanged or until we withdraw from the treaty under the terms of the \ntreaty. That is our obligation. That is a law. That is a treaty. It is \nbinding.\n  The same provision contains legally binding timetables in our bill \nfor deployment of missile defense systems. For example, section 235 \nrequires a multiple site national defense system to reach the initial \noperational capacity in 2003. These timetables are though exempt from \nadequate testing. I hope we can have a system by then. I hope we can \nhave one that really works, and I hope it will be calibrated to meet \nthe threat that we may have in those outyears. But since the applicable \nmissile testing statutes that were in previous laws are repealed in \nthis National Defense Act we have before us, what we have is a \ntimetable for actual deployment stated as a part of the law and \nrepealing the testing that would be required to determine if the \nsystems are ready to deploy or whether they are going to be effective \nwhen they are deployed.\n  I do not think that is a good combination. Finally, there is an \narbitrary--and possibly unconstitutional--restriction on the obligation \nof funds by the executive branch to enforce the terms of the ABM \nTreaty.\n  I invite all of our colleagues to look at those aspects where there \nis a demarcation definition between the theater ballistic missile and \nthe national missile defense that is precluded except under certain \nconditions in the ABM Treaty. I have no quarrel with those definitions. \nI think they are sensible definitions, and I think we do have to have a \ndemarcation point because clearly theater missile defenses are not \nintended to be covered under the ABM Treaty. They never were covered. \nThey should not be covered now.\n  The problem is once this definition is set forth, the executive \nbranch is barred from doing anything at all regarding the ABM Treaty in \nterms of its own negotiations, and I think that that goes way too far. \nIn fact, the wording of the proposal we have before us is so broad that \nany Federal official including Members of Congress would be precluded, \nas that statute now would read, from doing anything contrary to that \ndefinition. I think that goes too far, and I do not think that is what \nwe want. I hope we can work in a cooperative way to iron out some of \nthose difficulties, which I believe can be done, while continuing the \nstrong goal and endorsement of moving forward with defenses without \ndoing so in a way that is counterproductive.\n  The Department of Energy portions of the bill contain provisions that \ndirect the creation of new capabilities for the remanufacture of \nnuclear weapons.\n  Madam President, I have serious questions about whether this is a \npremature judgment at this time. The Department of Energy ``Stockpile \nStewardship'' plan is only now under review by the Department of \nDefense. I know that Mr. Domenici, the Senator from New Mexico, and \nothers have been in discussion with Senator Thurmond and his staff and \nSenator Lott and his staff, Senator Kempthorne, on these energy \nquestions, and I hope we can work something out here that makes sense, \nthat moves us in the right direction without making premature judgments \nthat are not ripe for decision.\n  Madam President, these are important issues for discussion and \ndebate. There are questions about the potential international \nimplications of a number of these provisions. For instance, the Russian \nleadership and their Parliament have stressed repeatedly, both to this \nadministration and to various Members of the Senate and House, both \nparties, the importance they attach to continued compliance with the \nABM Treaty. They have indicated that should they judge the United \nStates no longer intends to adhere to that treaty, then they would \nabandon their efforts to ratify the START II Treaty, which is now \npending in the Russian Duma.\n  Further, they warned that they would stop further compliance with \nother existing treaties including the drawdowns mandated by START I. In \nmy judgment, there is a real danger that the provisions of the Missile \nDefense Act will be considered by the Russians as what is known as \n``anticipatory breach'' of the ABM Treaty.\n  Madam President, if this bill leads to that outcome, it will not \nenhance our national security. It will be adverse to our national \nsecurity. Under START I and START II, the arms control treaties which \nhave been entered into by Republican Presidents and adhered to by \nDemocratic Presidents, the Russians are obliged under the terms of \nthese treaties to remove more than 6,000 ballistic missile warheads \nfrom atop their arsenal of ICBM's and submarine-launched ballistic \nmissiles. This includes the very formidable MIRV'd SS-18 ICBM's, the \nvery ones that threaten our land-based Minuteman and MX missiles with \nfirst-strike possibilities.\n  These are not insignificant treaties, Madam President. They basically \nremove much of the first-strike capability that we spent 10, 15 years \nbeing concerned about and spending hundreds of billions of dollars \ntrying to defend against.\n  They will also have to remove all of their MIRV'd SS-24 missiles and \ncompletely refit their ICBM force with single warhead missiles. These \nare goals that were worked on in a bipartisan fashion for several \ndecades by both Democrats and Republicans with a lot of the leadership \ncoming from Republican Presidents in the White House.\n  This removal of 6,000 warheads by treaty is a far more cost effective \nform of missile defense than any ABM system that the SDI Program has \never envisioned. I am not one of those who believes we ought to be so \nlocked into every provision of the ABM Treaty that we do not believe it \nis a document that has to be improved, that has to be amended. I think \nit does. I do not think it is completely up to date. I think we need to \ntake another look at it. I think we need to review it. I think there \nare changes that can be made and should be made in accordance with the \nprovisions of the treaty.\n  Yet, this bill, if enacted, would create a very high risk of throwing \naway both the START II reductions which have not yet taken place, and \nthe START I reductions which are taking place now. Because this bill, \nNo. 1, acts as if the ABM Treaty does not exist; it does not even \nreally acknowledge that there are any concerns. No. 2, it ignores the \nopportunity to negotiate sensible amendments with the Russians. And I \nthink it is premature to believe that that effort cannot succeed. I do \nnot think we have even started real serious efforts, and I think that \nthose efforts at least have a strong possibility of success. And No. 3, \nthis bill does not acknowledge that we can get out of that treaty. We \ncan exit the treaty under its own terms if our national security is \nthreatened.\n  If we are going to get out from under the ABM Treaty, if we are going \nto basically decide it no longer is in our national security interests, \nthen we ought to get out of the treaty the way the treaty itself \nprovides, which is our obligation under international law and our \nobligation under the treaty itself. We can serve 6 months' notice and \nexit the treaty if the Russians are not willing to make changes which \nwe believe are necessary for our national security. That is the way to \nget out of the treaty. We should not get out of the treaty \n\n[[Page S11131]]\nby anticipatory breach with provisions of the law that we have not \ncarefully thought through.\n  Indeed, Madam President, in this respect the actions proposed in the \nbill could be self-fulfilling. They could provoke Russia to stop its \nadherence to the START Treaties which would leave a huge arsenal of \nRussian missiles in place and we would then have to move from a thin \nmissile defense to protect against accidental launch or to protect some \nkind of small nation, radical nation, or terrorist group launch, we \nwould then have to start worrying about the SS-18's again.\n  Now, do we really want to do that? Do we want a self-fulfilling \ncircle? We take action without regard to the ABM Treaty in this bill. \nThe Russians react by not basically going through with START II. Then \nthey decide they are not going to comply with START I. Then they decide \nthey are not going to comply with the conventional forces reduction in \nEurope causing all sorts of problems there.\n  Then, of course, we have to increase our defense. We have to go from \nthe kind of system that President Bush wanted, which is an accidental \nlaunch type thin system that does not cost hundreds of billions of \ndollars, is achievable, that we can do. We could go to a much different \nkind of system. We are back in a spiral of action and reaction between \nthe United States and Russia. I do not think we really want to go back \ninto that atmosphere. That is one of the accomplishments we have had in \nthe last 10 years. I do not think that is what the authors of these \nprovisions in the bill really intend. But I think it has got to be \nthought about because those are the implications of where this bill \nwill head.\n  Madam President, this leads me to pose several questions. Are we as a \nnation better off if the START I and START II treaties are abandoned \nthan if they remain in force? If somebody thinks we ought to abandon \nthem and we are better off without them, why do we not say so? Why do \nwe not say so? We have got to stop legislating as if there are no \nconsequences to what we legislate. Other people in the world react. I \nthink that is the way we have legislated too many times on foreign \npolicy. I see it increasingly taking place. We act as if we can take \npart of a cake, legislate, forget the consequences, and not even own up \nto what is likely to happen based on what we ourselves are doing.\n  The second question. Are we and our NATO allies better off if the \nRussians decline to be bound by the limits on deployments of \nconventional forces contained in the Conventional Forces in Europe \nTreaty? We have already drawn down our forces to 100,000. The allies \nare reducing significantly, in many cases more than we are. We are \ndrawing down based on the CFE Treaty and based on the Russians' \nbehavior because they have indeed dramatically reduced their forces. Do \nwe really want to reverse that?\n  Of course, someone can say, well, the Russians cannot afford it now. \nThey are not going to be able to build up. That is probably true. I \nthink for the next 5 to 6 to 7 years, they will not be able to afford a \nconventional buildup. What they can do is start relying on their early \nuse of nuclear weapons very quickly, like tomorrow morning. If they are \ngoing to decide they are going to give their battlefield commanders \ntactical nuclear weapons again, we are going to go right back to a hair \ntrigger situation. That is what they can do. That is cheap. That is the \ncheap way. I do not think that is what we want. I do not think that is \nwhat the Russian leadership wants at this stage. But are we thinking \nabout what we are doing?\n  Next question. What will be the effect on Russian cooperation with us \nin forums such as the U.N. Security Council if arms control agreements \nare abandoned, even if it is an inadvertent abandonment on our part?\n  Fourth question. What is the ballistic missile threat to U.S. \nterritory that requires us to abandon compliance with the ABM Treaty \nand to abandon the pursuit of possible amendments to that treaty even \nwhen there is nothing whatsoever in that treaty that prevents us from \ntaking every step we would otherwise take in the next fiscal year? Why \nare we doing this at this point in time? I think that is the question. \nIf we were at a point where we had to make a decision, then I could \nunderstand some of the pressure in this regard. But there is nothing, \naccording to all the testimony, there is nothing whatsoever in the ABM \nTreaty, even as now interpreted, that prevents us from taking every \nstep we need to take in the next fiscal year. So why are we doing this? \nI do not have an answer to that.\n  Finally, what is the nature of the theater missile threat? And that \nis what I believe everyone would acknowledge is the greatest priority, \nthe greatest threat we have now. It is not a future threat. It is a \npresent threat, theater ballistic missiles. We already face those. As \nSenator Thurmond outlined in his opening statement, we faced those in \nthe Persian Gulf war.\n  What is the change that has taken place? That basically would have \nus, as we are doing in this bill, have the money for developing and \ndeploying no less than four overlapping-coverage missile defense \nsystems to protect the rear area of the theater while leaving our U.S. \nforward-deployed ground troops totally unprotected from attack by \nexisting enemy short-range missiles.\n  Madam President, I will have an amendment later in this process that \nwill add back in the only program we have to protect our frontline \ntroops from short-range missiles. Those are the threats we face right \nnow. We have a program called Corps SAM that is aimed at making those \nsystems that can protect frontline troops. That system has been totally \nzeroed out in this bill; $35 million has been taken out. I assume that \nwas part of the money that went into the beef-up of $300 million for \nnational missile defense. I think that is a reverse priority. We ought \nthe deal with the most imminent threats first. The most imminent threat \nwe face now is the theater ballistic missile threat, particularly the \nfrontline effect on our troops from short-range missiles. So I will \nhave an amendment that I hope we can get some attention to in adding \nback that program at a later point in this debate.\n  Madam President, I have a number of other concerns about the bill. \nFirst, our ability to monitor and control treaty-mandated strategic \nweapons reductions could be affected by the failure of the bill to \nfully fund the Department of Energy's arms control and nonproliferation \nactivities. I am not certain whether that provision is part of the \nnegotiation that is ongoing now with the Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, and Senator Bingaman who has taken a great lead in \nthis, but I am sure that will be the subject of some debate here on the \nfloor.\n  The other provisions, I think there are questionable priorities, as \nmentioned for the missile defense programs. While the bill provides an \nadditional $300 million in funding for the national defense program and \n$470 million for other missile defense programs which were not \nrequested by the administration, the Corps SAM missile defense system, \nwhich is strongly supported by the war-fighting commanders. That \nprogram is terminating. We will have a letter from our war-fighting \ncommanders showing that is one of their top priorities. It makes no \nsense to provide vast increases for long-range speculative programs \nthat will require billions in expenditure before their validity can be \nassessed while denying funds for specific theater missile defense \ninitiatives designed to protect our frontline troops which we have the \npossibility of securing in the very short-range distant future--in the \nvery next few years.\n  Madam President, also, I am concerned that the bill fails to fund \ncertain ongoing Department of Defense programs on the theory that the \nprograms should be funded by other agencies, even though neither the \nbudget resolution nor the committee bill makes any provision for any \nother agency to assume DOD's responsibilities. These include programs \nthat have received bipartisan support for many years, such as \nhumanitarian assistance, which was initiated by our former colleague, \nRepublican Senator Gordon Humphrey; foreign disaster relief, which was \ninitiated by another former colleague, Republican Senator Jeremiah \nDenton; and the civil-military cooperative action program, which was \ndeveloped on a completely bipartisan basis by the Armed Services \nCommittee. \n\n[[Page S11132]]\n\n  Madam President, there are many good features in this bill, but there \nare a number of key areas where this bill can be improved during the \nconsideration by the Senate. I look forward to working with Senator \nThurmond, the other members of the committee, and the Senate in a \ncooperative fashion to move this bill along so we can complete our work \nin a timely fashion, and so that we can come out with a solid bill that \nwill move our national security in the right direction.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina, the President \npro tempore.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I wish to thank the able ranking \nmember for his kind remarks and also thank him for his fine cooperation \nin getting this bill to the floor.\n  Madam President, I will now ask that the able Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe] be recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do have an opening statement.\n  Madam President, before presenting my opening statement, I would like \nto yield momentarily to Senator Kyl for the purpose of proposing an \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2077\n\n  (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate on protecting the United \n                 States from ballistic missile attack)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 2077.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 371, below line 21, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1062. SENSE OF SENATE ON PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES \n                   FROM BALLISTIC MISSILE ATTACK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles presents a threat to the entire World.\n       (2) This threat was recognized by Secretary of Defense \n     William J. Perry in February 1995 in the Annual Report to the \n     President and the Congress which states that ``[b]eyond the \n     five declared nuclear weapons states, at least 20 other \n     nations have acquired or are attempting to acquire weapons of \n     mass destruction--nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons--\n     and the means to deliver them. In fact, in most areas where \n     United States forces could potentially be engaged on a large \n     scale, many of the most likely adversaries already possess \n     chemical and biological weapons. Moreover, some of these same \n     states appear determined to acquire nuclear weapons.''.\n       (3) At a summit in Moscow in May 1995, President Clinton \n     and President Yeltsin commented on this threat in a Joint \n     Statement which recognizes ``.  .  . the threat posed by \n     worldwide proliferation of missiles and missile technology \n     and the necessity of counteracting this threat .  .  . ''.\n       (4) At least 25 countries may be developing weapons of mass \n     destruction and the delivery systems for such weapons.\n       (5) At least 24 countries have chemical weapons programs in \n     various stages of research and development.\n       (6) Approximately 10 countries are believed to have \n     biological weapons programs in various stages of development.\n       (7) At least 10 countries are reportedly interested in the \n     development of nuclear weapons.\n       (8) Several countries recognize that weapons of mass \n     destruction and missiles increase their ability to deter, \n     coerce, or otherwise threaten the United States. Saddam \n     Hussein recognized this when he stated, on May 8, 1990, that \n     ``[o]ur missiles cannot reach Washington. If they could reach \n     Washington, we would strike it if the need arose.''.\n       (9) International regimes like the Non-Pro-liferation \n     Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, while effective, cannot by \n     themselves halt the spread of weapons and technology. On \n     January 10, 1995, Director of Central Intelligence, James \n     Woolsey, said with regard to Russia that ``.  .  . we are \n     particularly concerned with the safety of nuclear, chemical, \n     and biological materials as well as highly enriched uranium \n     or plutonium, although I want to stress that this is global \n     problem. For example, highly enriched uranium was recently \n     stolen from South Africa, and last month Czech authorities \n     recovered three kilograms of 87.8 percent-enriched HEU in the \n     Czech Republic--the largest seizure of near-weapons grade \n     material to date outside the Former Soviet Union.''.\n       (10) The possession of weapons of mass destruction and \n     missiles by developing countries threatens our friends, \n     allies, and forces abroad and will ultimately threaten the \n     United States directly. On August 11, 1994, Deputy Secretary \n     of Defense John Deutch said that ``[i]f the North Koreans \n     field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, Alaska, and parts of \n     Hawaii would potentially be at risk.''.\n       (11) The end of Cold War has changed the strategic \n     environmental facing and between the United States and \n     Russia. That the Clinton Administration believes the \n     environment to have changed was made clear by Secretary of \n     Defense William J. Perry on September 20, 1994, when he \n     stated that ``[w]e now have the opportunity to create a new \n     relationship, based not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured \n     Destruction, but rather on another acronym, MAS, or Mutural \n     Assured Safety.''.\n       (12) The United States and Russia have the opportunity to \n     create a relationship based on trust rather than fear.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     all Americans should be protected from accidental, \n     intentional, or limited ballstic missile attack.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I just wanted to propose this amendment \nnow, since the Senator from Oklahoma, the coauthor of this amendment, \nis making his opening statement now because perhaps some of the remarks \nhe will make in his opening statement will also reflect on the \namendment, which we want to be considered next.\n  So I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Madam President, I am pleased today to speak on behalf of the Fiscal \nYear 1996 Defense Department Authorization Act. I urge my colleagues to \npreserve it in its somewhat inadequate but present form.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Since the 1991----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would be glad to yield after the statement.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nSenator's statement, I be permitted to make an inquiry of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I made a unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Does he yield for that request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma indicated he \nhad a statement. I merely ask unanimous consent that I be recognized \nfor the purposes of that inquiry at the conclusion of the remarks of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to ask the Senator to repeat his unanimous-\nconsent request, please.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nSenator's remarks, I be recognized for the purposes of making an \ninquiry of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for that request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do not yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am advised by the Parliamentarian that the \nSenator from Oklahoma has the floor. If he does not yield, there is no \nability to request a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Does the Senator from Oklahoma yield the floor?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do not yield until the conclusion of my opening \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, does the Senator object to my \nunanimous-consent request? I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of his remarks I be recognized for purposes of making a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor. If he \n\n\n[[Page S11133]]\nyields for a unanimous-consent request, it is his prerogative to do so. \nDoes the Senator from Oklahoma yield the floor?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Not at this time, Madam President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Senator indicated he would not object to my simply \ntaking the floor to make a unanimous-consent request of the type I \nindicated. That is all I am asking at this time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me continue my opening statement \nfrom the top again.\n  I am pleased to speak on behalf of this fiscal 1996 defense \nauthorization bill. Although I believe it is still inadequate, I think \nit is as good as we could pass at this time.\n  Since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the military has been cut, misused, \nneglected, and otherwise distracted from its ultimate purposes--\nprotecting and preserving America's vital interests. This bill, with \nits House counterpart, represents a first step towards strengthening \nAmerica's Armed Forces.\n  One of the most important messages which voters delivered in 1994 was \nthe need to restore the strength of America's defenses. With this bill, \nthe Senate has clearly had enough of the Clinton administration's weak \nhand in the national security arena. We have added $7 billion to the \nadministration's request.\n  It has become fashionable in some circles to assert that now that the \ncold war is over, there is no longer a threat out there. But history \nhas told us that most wars come with little or no warning. From the \nattack on Pearl Harbor to the invasion of Korea to the invasion of \nKuwait, few could have predicted the size and scope of American \nmilitary involvement which became necessary in the wake of these \nunexpected events. The lesson learned the hard way in Pearl Harbor \nremains true today: We must always be prepared.\n  President Reagan reminded us many times that we, as Americans, never \nhave the luxury of taking our security for granted. It is up to each \ngeneration to take the steps necessary to preserve and pass on the \nlegacy of freedom to the next. With this bill, we are beginning to take \nup that challenge.\n  As we look to the future, all we can predict with certainty is that \nthere will be more surprises. What there will be we cannot be sure, but \nwe can make some educated guesses. For instance, the gulf war taught us \nthe growing importance of stealth, of space, and of ballistic missiles. \nAs we look to the future, it is clear that technology will be playing a \nkey role, both in shaping the threats we will be facing and the \ndefenses that we will need.\n  Madam President, it was not long ago that the former CIA Director \nWoolsey estimated that there are somewhere between 20 and 25 nations \nthat currently have or are developing weapons of mass destruction, \neither nuclear, chemical, or biological, and they are also developing \nthe means with which to deliver those.\n  Today, we are going to have an amendment, the Kyl-Inhofe amendment, \nwhich will be addressing that, so I will not elaborate on that at this \ntime but will seek time during the consideration of that amendment.\n  This is a good bill, but I must express my deep concern with the \nSenate's failure to support further funding of the B-2 bomber. The \nHouse, in its bill, had $553 million. America is reducing her military \npresence around the world. Budget constraints and the end of the cold \nwar are naturally causing us to pull back our forward deployed forces \noverseas. But as a world leader, our continuing ability to project \npower around the world will be critical. Unfortunately, our ability to \nimmediately respond in a crisis is going to be diminished unless we are \nable to use our technological advantages wisely.\n  This is why the revolutionary B-2 Stealth bomber is so important for \nour future arsenal. From bases within our own country, these aircraft \ncan quickly deliver devastating payloads to virtually any target on \nEarth without refueling. They can penetrate the toughest air defenses \nwith minimal risk to our pilots.\n  The B-2 multiplies mission cost-effectiveness. Today, the standard \nbombing run package using escorts, air defense suppression aircraft, \nrefueling tankers, and bombers requires up to 67 aircraft and 132 crew \nmembers. The same mission can be completed with only two B-2's and four \ncrew members.\n  Many Americans have been persuaded that sophisticated weaponry, such \nas the B-2, are relics of the cold war. They have been told that we can \neasily discard such systems without diminishing our security in the \ncurrent world environment. They have been told that there are more \nimportant and immediate priorities. It is an easy argument to sell, but \nI do not buy it, and I plan to make my support for more B-2's clear as \nthe deliberations go on.\n  For 8 years, Ronald Reagan gave us a policy of ``peace through \nstrength,'' a policy which invested wisely in defense needs with a \nspecial emphasis on America's inherent leadership in advanced \ntechnology. I believe proven success of that policy should continue to \nguide our defense posture. This is why, despite my reservations \nregarding the B-2, I support this bill. It will help save lives and \nprotect our vital interests in the future.\n  I congratulate Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn for the solid \neffort, united effort they put forth. I urge my colleagues to support \nit. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would like to begin by complimenting both \nthe chairman, Senator Thurmond, and Senator Nunn, for their work, and \nall the members of the Armed Services Committee for presenting a very \ngood bill to the Senate this year. I do not have the honor of serving \non the Senate Armed Services Committee. I did serve on the House Armed \nServices Committee for 8 years. Frankly, I am very pleased with the \nproduct that has come out of the committee this year.\n  I, second, want to associate myself with the remarks the Senator from \nOklahoma just made. I believe they help to set the stage for a good \ndebate on what we need to do to provide for the defense of the United \nStates.\n  Third, Madam President, I want to begin a discussion of the amendment \nwhich Senator Inhofe and I have laid down and which I think deals with \none of the key parts of the bill that has been presented this year. It \nis the issue of missile proliferation, and the question of what the \nUnited States ought to do about it.\n  Given the fact that there is some difference of opinion about exactly \nwhat the nature of the threat is and when we ought to begin to deal \nwith that threat, it seemed to Senator Inhofe and me that we should add \nsomething to the bill in the way of findings and a sense of the Senate \nwhich expresses our belief that the American people should be defended \nfrom ballistic missile attack.\n  There are very fine findings currently in the bill. We all agree that \nthose findings are a proper predicate for what follows in the bill. But \nwe also believe that there are some other things that should be added \nas findings and that the Senate should go on record expressing its \nsense that Americans should be protected from either accidental, \nintentional, or limited ballistic missile attack.\n  Madam President, let me read the portions of the findings of the \namendment which we believe help to lay the predicate for further action \nthe Senate will be taking with respect to the protection of American \npeople from ballistic missile attack.\n We say, first of all, that the Senate finds the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles present a threat to \nthe entire world.\n\n  This threat was recognized by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry \nin February of this year in the annual report to the President and the \nCongress, which states:\n\n       Beyond the five declared nuclear weapon states, at least 20 \n     other nations have acquired, or are attempting to acquire, \n     weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, biological, or chemical \n     weapons, and the means to deliver them. In fact, in most \n     areas where the United States forces could potentially be \n     engaged on a large scale, many of the most likely adversaries \n     already possess chemical and biological weapons. Moreover, \n     some of these same states appear determined to acquire \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  We think this is an important finding because of this question that \nhas been posed: Why should we be preparing some of the things that we \nare preparing now? Why should we be testing and \n\n[[Page S11134]]\ndeveloping capable theater missile defenses and beginning to plan for \nthe day when we would develop and eventually deploy a national missile \ndefense system? It is because of the concern that has been expressed in \nthis year's report to the President and Congress by the Secretary of \nDefense, among others.\n  Also, recently, in May of this year, at the summit in Moscow, \nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin commented on this threat in a \njoint statement which recognizes:\n\n     . . . The threat posed by worldwide proliferation of missiles \n     and missile technology and the necessity of counteracting \n     this threat.\n\n  At least 25 countries may be developing weapons of mass destruction \nand the delivery systems for such weapons. We further find that at \nleast 24 countries have chemical weapons programs in various stages of \nresearch and development. Approximately 10 countries are believed to \nhave biological weapons programs in various stages of development. And, \nfinally, at least 10 countries are reportedly interested in the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons.\n  Several countries recognize that weapons of mass destruction and \nmissiles increase their ability to deter, coerce or threaten the United \nStates Saddam Hussein recognized this when he stated on May 8, 1990:\n\n       Our missiles cannot reach Washington. If they could reach \n     Washington, we would strike it if the need arose.\n\n  Madam President, we further find in the preliminary findings to the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that international regimes like the \nnonproliferation treaty, biological weapons convention and the missile \ntechnology control regime, while effective, cannot by themselves halt \nthe spread of weapons and technology.\n  On January 10, 1995, Director of the CIA, James Woolsey, said, with \nregard to Russia:\n\n       We are particularly concerned with the safety of nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons, as well as highly enriched \n     uranium or plutonium, although I want to stress this is a \n     global problem. For example, highly enriched uranium was \n     recently stolen from South Africa, and last month Czech \n     authorities recovered 3 kilograms of 87.8 percent-enriched \n     uranium in the Czech Republic--the larger seizure of near-\n     weapons-grade material to date outside the former Soviet \n     Union.\n\n  That is former CIA Director James Woolsey.\n  We further find in this resolution that the possession of weapons of \nmass destruction and missiles by developing countries threatens our \nfriends, allies, and forces abroad, and will ultimately threaten the \nUnited States directly. On August 11, 1994, Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, John Deutch, now Director of the CIA said:\n\n       If the North Koreans field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, \n     Alaska, and parts of Hawaii would potentially be at risk.\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, these are not hypotheticals for other \ncountries, other places in the world. This is the United States and our \nterritory. The former Deputy Secretary of Defense says that they would \npotentially be at risk.\n  We further find, in finding 11, that the end of the cold war has \nchanged the strategic environment facing and between the United States \nand Russia. That the Clinton administration believes the environment to \nhave changed was made clear by Secretary of Defense William Perry on \nSeptember 20, 1994, when he stated:\n\n       We now have the opportunity to create a new relationship, \n     based not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but \n     rather on another acronym, MAS, Mutual Assured Safety.\n\n  The United States and Russia have the opportunity to create a \nrelationship based on trust rather than fear.\n  That is the final finding in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. As \na result of all of these findings, these factors, of these statements \nmade by the key representatives of this administration, it is the sense \nof the Senate that all Americans should be protected from accidental, \nintentional, or limited ballistic missile attack.\n  Let me focus a moment on that simple one-sentence statement of what \nthe sense of the Senate would be. We should be protected from \naccidental launch of ballistic missiles. I cannot think of anyone who \nwould disagree with that sentiment. It does not take a star wars or a \nstrategic defense initiative to protect against such an attack. We have \nthe capability to develop, and ultimately deploy, a system which would \nprovide that protection. Inherent within this bill is the beginnings of \nthe development and deployment of such a system.\n  It is the sense of the Senate that all Americans should be protected \nfrom intentional ballistic missile attack. Obviously, if there is an \nintentional attack, we want to be protected from that. We mentioned the \nTaepo Dong 2 missile under development by the North Koreans. Should \nthey decide to launch an attack against Alaska, for example, who among \nus would argue that we should not be prepared to meet that threat? \nIndeed, the mere threat that such an attack could be launched inhibits \nthe conduct of our foreign policy because of the potential of blackmail \nby a country like North Korea.\n  To digress a moment to further elaborate on this point, one of the \nreasons that we have such a difficult time dealing with North Korea \ntoday is that North Korea does pose an offensive threat to millions of \nSouth Koreans and thousands of American troops against which we have no \nreal defense, because of the proximity of Seoul, Korea to the long-\nrange artillery of North Korea, and because of the deployment of North \nKorean forces. It is very clear that if there were a North Korean \nattack or bombardment from their artillery, literally millions of South \nKoreans and thousands of Americans would be killed before the United \nStates had an opportunity to respond. We simply do not have a defense \nagainst that kind of an attack, unless everybody from Seoul, Korea \ncould move back about 30 miles. That is obviously not going to happen.\n  Because of the nature of this threat, we are in a position to be \nblackmailed by North Korea. We cannot go in and deal with North Korea \nas we would like to because they do have a means of inflicting great \nharm and damage on us and on the people of South Korea. We literally \nhave no way to stop it. The only way to respond to that is by some kind \nof massive military action that would hopefully roll them back. But the \ndamage would already be done.\n  That is the same thing with respect to missiles. A missile can be \neither used for blackmail in the conduct of one country's foreign \npolicy, to push its weight around, or to actually launch against \nanother country in a time of war, in order to either create chaos and \ninflict damage on civilian populations, or to be launched against \nmilitary targets. And in order to prohibit that from inhibiting the \nconduct of our foreign policy, we have to have a way of defending \nagainst it. If you do have a way of defending against it, you can \nessentially say you can build the missiles if you want, deploy them if \nyou want, but you cannot be effective in using them, so we are not \ngoing to be bullied.\n  If you do not have an effective missile defense--and as I quoted, we \ndo not--then we are susceptible to that negative influence of bullying \nby a country like North Korea. That is why it is important for us to \nhave the means of defending ourselves and our allies, whether troops \nare deployed abroad, or whether it is the defense of the American \nhomeland--in this case, Alaska--by a threat from the North Koreans.\n  Finally, it would be the sense of the Senate that all Americans \nshould be protected from limited ballistic missile attack.\n  The reason we state it that way, Mr. President, is because we are \nconcerned here about a limited attack. We do not believe that there is \ncurrently existing a threat of massive, strategic attack of \nintercontinental ballistic missiles by a country such as Russia, and \npossibly China, which are the only countries today that could pose that \nkind of threat to the United States. We do not believe that \ncircumstances warrant the development of a system that would provide a \nprotection against such an attack.\n  That is why there is no longer an effort to develop a strategic \ndefense, such as was contemplated during the Reagan administration when \nthe cold war was a very real threat to the United States, and when the \nSoviet Union then was quite belligerent with the United States, and \nwhen such a threat actually existed. That is what not we are trying to \ndo. \n\n[[Page S11135]]\n\n  Now, that is why all we are saying here is that it is the sense of \nthe Senate that all Americans should be protected from accidental, \nintentional, or limited ballistic missile attack.\n  That is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Those are the findings. \nLet me finish my presentation with a couple of other quotations that I \nthink would not necessarily be properly included within the findings, \nbut which I think help to make the case that this is not some \nhypothetical, this is not something that only paranoid people are \nconcerned about,\n it is something that at the highest councils in our Government, our \nintelligence, and the Defense Department, there is concern.\n\n  The first reason is because it is not necessarily the development of \nan indigenous capability by a country that is of concern here. We are \nconcerned about North Korea developing the missiles that could \neventually reach the United States. As a matter of fact, the missile \nthat could reach the United States is not even shown on this chart here \nwhich illustrates some of the other missiles that are in development, \nor already developed, and their capabilities.\n  The CSS-2, for example, is a Chinese missile that has been sold to \nthe Saudi Arabians. It has a range of about 3,000 kilometers. That \nobviously poses a threat to countries in the Middle East, as well as \nsome European countries.\n  It is not just the indigenous threat, but the possibility of a sale \nof one of these missiles to another country. I mention this missile, \nbecause this missile was sold by the Chinese to the Saudi Arabians. \nSaudi Arabians are obviously allies of the United States, and we do not \nfear that missile would be launched against us by this regime. We also \ndid not fear during the regime of the Shah of Iran that Iran would \nultimately be unfriendly to the United States. Of course, that is the \nsituation that exists today.\n  A country that acquires a weapon like this today, if there should be \nsome instability or other circumstance that changes its government, \nobviously, it could effectively, and perhaps not in the long-distance \nfuture, pose a threat to the United States.\n  We are first concerned about the indigenous threat, but second, we \nare concerned about a purchase. That is where the time element comes \nin. We can give an estimate of how long it takes a country like North \nKorea to develop a No Dong. It could be another 5 years to develop \nthat. But they could sell a country with great capability in a matter \nof days or weeks, and the deployment could be a threat to us in a very \nshort period of time.\n  A third aspect, in addition to the indigenous development and the \nsale of missiles to be used for military purposes, is, of course, the \nsale of satellite launch capable missiles. This has been done \nthroughout the world, as well. There is absolutely nothing to prevent \nthe interchange of a satellite to be launched into space for weather \nprediction, for example, and a warhead of mass destruction, a chemical \nor biological warhead, or even a nuclear warhead in such a missile.\n  These missiles are proliferating around the world. Even though they \nhave a peaceful purpose, they can very quickly be used for military \npurposes, and therefore, for us to base predictions on the fact that an \nadversary of ours will take a long time to indigenously develop a \nweapon, again does not adequately and accurately state the intelligence \nthreat to the United States.\n  We have to be prepared to accept the fact that nations will buy \neither weapons or buy space launch capable missiles for use as weapons, \nand that can be done in a very short period of time. We only have to \nlook at previous examples to know it has been done.\n  As a matter of fact, Iraqi Scuds were purchased from another country \nand then modified by the Iraqis.\n  It is not just the indigenous development but the purchase of the \nweapons and the purchase of satellite delivery missiles that also \ncreate part of the problem here.\n  Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent that other material be \nprinted in the Record at this point, and allow me to reach a conclusion \nof my statement in support of this amendment for a sense-of-the-Senate \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Threat Amendment\n\n       Proliferation is a real concern:\n       (A) At their summit in Moscow in May of 1995, President \n     Clinton and President Yeltsin commented on the threat posed \n     by proliferation when they released a Joint Statement \n     recognizing ``. . . the threat posed by worldwide \n     proliferation of missiles and missile technology and the \n     necessity of counteracting this threat. . . .''\n       (1) In a March 1995 report, The Weapons Proliferation \n     Threat, the Central Intelligence Agency's Nonproliferation \n     Center observed that at least 20 countries-nearly half of \n     them in the Middle East and South Asia-already have or may be \n     developing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile \n     delivery systems. Five countries--North Korea, Iran, Iraq, \n     Libya, and Syria--pose the greatest threat because of the \n     aggressive nature of their regimes and status of their \n     weapons of mass destruction programs. All five already have \n     or are developing ballistic missiles that could threaten U.S. \n     interests.\n       (2) The missile proliferation threat, even to the U.S. \n     homeland with long-range missiles, is real and growing. Third \n     World nations are advancing their missile programs through \n     indigenous development, the purchase of missile components, \n     and the purchase of space launch vehicles for reportedly \n     peaceful purposes.\n       (3) While space launch vehicles can be used for peaceful \n     purposes, such as launching communications satellites, they \n     also give would-be proliferants an inherent missile \n     capability. Every four years another country develops space \n     launch capability.\n       (4) The Clinton Administration is overestimating how long \n     it could take for Third World countries to develop nuclear \n     missiles that could hit the American homeland. The Clinton \n     Administration claims that missile attack threats from \n     potentially dangerous Third World nations to the U.S. \n     homeland will not arise for at least ten years. No one can \n     possibly know that--much less depend on such a guess.\n       (5) This estimate is based on the assumption that the \n     states acquiring missiles will develop them indigenously. \n     While it is questionable whether it will take ten years for \n     Third World countries to develop missiles on their own, it is \n     clear that proliferants could purchase long-range missiles \n     and nuclear warheads at any time, with little or no advance \n     warning.\n       (6) Indeed, Saudi Arabia purchased the 2,000-mile range \n     CSS-2 missile from China several years ago. Others, such as \n     Iran and Syria, have purchased shorter range ballistic \n     missiles from North Korea. There is evidence, including from \n     Russian General Victor Samoilov, who was charged with \n     maintaining control over nuclear weapons, that nuclear \n     warheads have disappeared from former Soviet sites.\n       (7) There are also reports that nuclear weapons have been \n     sold abroad covertly, particularly to Iran.\n       (8) The key to estimating how long the United States has to \n     respond to a missile threat is not, as is currently the \n     practice, to determine how long it takes a rogue state to \n     produce ICBMs once it has decided to do so. Rather, U.S. \n     planning should be based on how long a rogue state needs to \n     field missiles once the intelligence community has convincing \n     evidence that either their development or purchase is under \n     way.\n       (9) The evidence, as reported by the Heritage foundation, \n     thus far is troubling indeed. For example:\n       ``(a) Iraq tested a booster with potential intercontinental \n     range in 1990, only months after the U.S. intelligence \n     community discovered what it was doing. After the Gulf War, \n     it was discovered that Iraq had been pursuing an extensive, \n     undetected, and covert program to develop nuclear warheads \n     for its ballistic missiles. By authoritative accounts the \n     Iraqis were within 18 months of having the bomb.\n       ``(b) U.S. intelligence in early 1994 discovered that the \n     North Koreans were developing a long range missile dubbed the \n     Taepo Dong 2. Then Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch \n     testified on August 11, 1994, that the Taepo Dong 2 may be \n     able to strike U.S. territory by the end of this decade. If \n     so, this capability will have arisen only five years after \n     its discovery.''\n       (10) Once the basics of missile technology are mastered, \n     adding more range to the missile is not a great technical \n     challenge. It can be accomplished by adding more thrust and \n     rocket stages. Further, it can be accomplished under the \n     guise of developing space launchers. Every booster capable of \n     placing satellites in orbit can deliver a warhead of the same \n     weight to intercontinental range. And missile sales can \n     create a new missile threat very quickly.\n       (III) Others will argue that if the United States were \n     threatened by a nuclear weapon, it would be in the form of a \n     suitcase bomb, or errant aircraft, or fashioned like the \n     Oklahoma City bombing.\n       (A) Each scenario represents a possible method of attack. \n     But, why is that an argument against BMD? We make great \n     strides to cope with these and other kinds of threats. We \n     have anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down hostile aircraft. We \n     suspend commercial flights from potentially dangerous \n     countries. The immigration and customs services monitor \n     people and goods coming to the United States. Law enforcement \n     agencies seek to identify terrorist groups before they act. \n     Our tools may be woefully inadequate, \n\n[[Page S11136]]\n     but we make considerable efforts. Not so in defending the country \n     against ballistic missile attack.\n       (IV) Moreover, the ballistic missile is the weapon of \n     choice in the Third World. Ballistic missiles signify \n     technological advancement, and are thus a source of prestige \n     in the developing world. Missiles have become symbols of \n     power, acquiring a mystique unrelated to their capabilities. \n     Regional powers that have acquired these weapons can threaten \n     the security of global powers and extend influence throughout \n     the region.\n       (A) Jasit Singh, Director of the Indian Institute for \n     Defense Studies and Analysis, has pointed out that ``the \n     element which is tending to rapidly enhance the strategic \n     value of ballistic missiles . . . is there is yet no credible \n     defense against them.''\n       (V) Others may argue that the arms control regimes will \n     protect us from threat from ballistic missiles. Not so.\n       (A) The Non-Proliferation Threaty (NPT), provides a useful \n     barrier to discourage the transfer of technology concerning \n     weapons of mass destruction. It is not, however, leak proof, \n     and should not be relied upon as a primary element of \n     American and allied security. The NPT, for example, failed to \n     prevent Iraq or North Korea from developing their nuclear \n     weapons programs.\n       (B) The Missile Technology Control regime (MTCR), founded \n     by Ronald Reagan in 1987, again, has admirable goals, but can \n     only slow the transfer of missile technology until more \n     effective measures can be developed. The MTCR is a weak \n     agreement that has no monitoring agency or enforcement \n     mechanism, does not incorporate all the world's missile \n     producers (most notably China), and cannot forbid \n     technologies that have civil uses.\n       (C) Former CIA Director James Woolsey said on January 10, \n     1995, that, with regard to Russia, ``. . . we are \n     particularly concerned with the safety of nuclear, chemical, \n     and biological materials, as well as highly enriched uranium \n     or plutonium, although I want to stress that this is a global \n     problem.\n       (D) We simply cannot rely on arms control to do the job.\n       (VI) The Kyl/Inhofe amendment expresses the Sense of the \n     Senate that Americans should be defended--whether in foreign \n     lands or here at home.\n       We can argue about how to do it: but we should not begin \n     this debate without at least agreeing on the basic premise \n     that Americans should be protected. Surely we can all agree \n     with that.\n       There is nothing threatening about defenses. Missile \n     defense destroys only offensive missiles.\n\n  Mr. KYL. These missiles are, unfortunately, becoming the weapon of \nchoice of bullies in the world. Because they are relatively \ninexpensive, they can be used to great effect for blackmail purposes. \nThe Iraqis demonstrated how even an errant launch, as the chairman of \nthe committee noted in his eloquent opening statement, can cause great \ndamage.\n  Mr. President, 20 percent of all United States casualties in the \nIraqi war were from one Scud missile attack, which killed 28 Americans \nwith one missile, because we did not have the capability of defending \nagainst that.\n  A question has been asked here, why now? Why are we so concerned \nabout this now? Well, I did not realize until this morning, when radio \nreports carried the story, that it was 5 years ago today that Kuwait \nwas invaded by Iraq. I think it is an anniversary worth reflecting on \nfor a moment.\n  One could easily ask what has changed, knowing that this kind of \nthreat can materialize almost overnight; knowing that we need to be \nprepared to deal with it; knowing that 28 Americans at one time died \nfrom a Scud missile attack--20 percent of all of our casualties came \nfrom that--knowing of the destruction that the Scuds directed on the \nState of Israel; and knowing of our great concern about that, because \nwe could not locate the missile.\n  The only way we had to deal with it was to try to shoot it down, and \nfinally, knowing after the fact that our Patriot missiles, designed to \nshoot down aircraft, not missiles, though pressed into action for that \npurpose, were really only effective to interdict about 30 percent of \nthe Scuds that came their way.\n  Knowing all of these things, one would imagine that 5 years later, we \nwould have made great strides to protect ourselves against the threats \nthat are posed. The fact of the matter is that virtually nothing has \nchanged. Other than a slightly upgraded investigation of the Patriot \nmissile, we do not have a missile defense. This is 5 years later, a \nperiod of time in which we should have been able to develop and deploy \nan effective missile defense against a weapon like the Scud. We have \nnot done so.\n  Just taking the theater context and forgetting for a moment the \npotential threat to the United States, it is clear that we have not \nadequately pursued a defense against this weapon of choice by the \ntroublemaker nations of the world.\n  We have not developed and deployed a new sensor. We have not \ndeveloped and deployed a new missile. We have made some strides in the \nresearch, but part of the reason we have not done this is because there \nhas been no clear national mandate, no clear national instruction, to \nget about the business of doing this. There are all kinds of reasons \nwhy.\n  The fact of the matter is, we need to get on with the business of \ngetting this done. That is why I compliment Senator Nunn and Senator \nThurmond for much of what they have included in the bill this year.\n  We have some small differences we will perhaps need to work on. One \nthing on which we can all agree at this beginning point of the debate \nis that there is a threat to be concerned about, and that we do need, \nas we begin this debate, to at least express the sense of this body \nthat Americans need to be protected against an accidental or a limited \nballistic missile attack.\n  Mr. President, if we cannot agree on that, I suspect the American \npeople would rightly question whether we are the body in which to \nrepose confidence about their future security. I am confident that we \ncan agree to this. Based upon that, we can make some sensible decisions \nabout both the policy embodied in this year's defense bill and the \nexpenditures inherent in the authorization bill.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman, Senator Nunn, and other \nmembers of the committee, and other Members of this body, in working \nthrough this bill based on an understanding there is a threat to the \nUnited States from ballistic missile attack, and to our forces abroad, \nand our allies, and it is against this threat we should be protected.\n  I hope when the time comes, Mr. President, my colleagues here will \nsee fit to support the Kyl-Inhofe amendment, which expresses the sense \nof the Senate.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2078 to Amendment No. 2077\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2078 to amendment No. 2077.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, beginning with ``attack,'' strike out all down \n     through the end of the amendment and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following: ``attack. It is the further sense of the \n     Senate that front-line troops of the United States armed \n     forces should be protected from missile attacks.\n       ``(c) Funding for Corps SAM and Boost-Phase Interceptor \n     Programs.--\n       ``(1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, of \n     the funds authorized to be appropriated by section 201(4), \n     $35.0 million shall be available for the Corps SAM/MEADS \n     program.\n       ``(2) With a portion of the funds authorized in paragraph \n     (1) for the Corps SAM/MEADS program, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall conduct a study to determine whether a Theater Missile \n     Defense system derived from Patriot technologies could \n     fulfill the Corps SAM/MEADS requirements at a lower estimated \n     life-cycle cost than is estimated for the cost of the U.S. \n     portion of the Corps SAM/MEADS program.\n       ``(3) The Secretary shall provide a report on the study \n     required under paragraph (3) to the congressional defense \n     committees not later than March 1, 1996.\n       ``(4) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(4), not more than $3,403,413,000 shall be available for \n     missile defense programs within the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Organization.\n       ``(d) Section 234(c)(1) of this Act shall have no force or \n     effect.''\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, very briefly, this adds back $35 million to \nwhat is the Corps SAM program. I know other people want to speak on the \nKyl first-degree amendment. That is a good amendment. I support it.\n  This amendment does not in any way strike or in any way change the \nfirst-degree amendment, but is directly relevant because this gives \nstrong emphasis to the Corps SAM program, which is \n\n[[Page S11137]]\nat the heart of our forward theater missile defense.\n  I will explain this in more detail later. I know there are others who \nwould like to speak, including the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just have a little concern about the \nprocedural step we started off with on the bill. At one point the \nmanager of the bill on the majority side was properly recognized, as \nmanager of the bill, for purposes of speaking. But during the process \nit appeared that the Senator sought to have another Senator recognized \nfor purposes of offering an amendment. There was no unanimous consent \nrequested for that purpose. I am sure this was inadvertent, but it \nbecomes very, very difficult to have what we would like to call here a \n``jump ball'' on recognition if one Senator can sort of call on another \nSenator, in effect.\n  I again say I do not think that was the intent, but I am concerned \nabout the way we got started on this.\n  Mr. President, I therefore ask unanimous consent that upon the \ndisposition of the Kyl amendment that I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not think I can add a lot to what the \nvery eloquent Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, said about this sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment.\n  I do support the amendment and offer this with Senator Kyl. One of \nthe reasons I came to the Senate in the first place, and one of the \nreasons I sought to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, is a \nvery deep concern over what has been happening to our Nation's ability \nto defend itself.\n  I have watched the cold war leave us and many people, when I was \nserving in the other body, would stand up and say, ``There is no longer \na necessity to have a very strong defense system. The cold war is over \nand the threat is not out there.'' I honestly believe, in looking at \nthis, through my service on the Intelligence Committee as well as on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and formerly on the House Armed \nServices Committee, that there is a threat to our country out there \nthat is even more severe, more serious today than there was during the \ncold war, because in the cold war we could identify who the enemy was. \nAs Jim Woolsey said, there are 20 to 25 countries, not two or three, 20 \nto 25, that are working on or have weapons of mass destruction. That is \nnot something that might happen in the future. That is something that \nis imminent and that is taking place today.\n  It is interesting that the administration downplays another \nconclusion by the intelligence analysts; namely, that there are \nnumerous ways for hostile countries to acquire intercontinental \nballistic missiles far more quickly. We have watched this. We have \nwatched the discussions take place. I think we can come to some \nconclusions, and those conclusions are that there is a multiple threat \nout there.\n  The Senator from Georgia mentioned briefly the ABM Treaty. I think it \nis worth at least discussing in context with our need for a national \nmissile defense system. I think at the time that the ABM Treaty went \ninto effect, perhaps there was justification for that. There were two \nsuperpowers in the world--this was 1972--and the feeling was at that \ntime, if neither of the superpowers were in a position to defend \nthemselves from a missile attack, then there would not be any threat \nout there for the rest of the world. Maybe there was justification for \nthat.\n  I had a conversation with the architect of the ABM Treaty just the \nother day, Dr. Kissinger. He said, and I will quote him now, he said:\n\n       There is something nuts about making a virtue out of our \n     vulnerability.\n\n  That is exactly what we are saying when we say, by policy and by \ntreaty, that we can defend our troops who might be stationed overseas, \nthat we can pursue a theater missile defense system, but we cannot \ndefend our Nation against a missile attack. There is something nuts \nabout that. So we are going to have to address this.\n  In the meantime, what can we do to put a national missile defense \ninto effect in the next 5 years? We can do exactly what we are doing \nwith this bill. I would like to move even quicker than we can move \nright now, but we feel what we are doing in this bill that we are \nlooking at today is all we can do to prepare ourselves for what can \nhappen in the next 5 years. So, when we are able to change this \nnational policy, we will be in a position to not lose any time and do \nit in the next 5 years. I think the issue here is: Is it 10 years when \nthe threat could be facing us or is it 5 years? I think it is \nincontrovertible it is closer to 5 years.\n  Even if we were certain there is no new threat that would materialize \nfor 10 years, there are two compelling reasons to develop and deploy a \nnational missile defense system. First, it will take more than 5 years \nto develop and deploy the limited system, even when the Missile Defense \nAct of 1995 is passed. By then, we will most certainly be facing new \nballistic missile threats to the United States.\n  Second, deploying the national missile defense system would deter \ncountries from seeking their own ICBM capabilities. A vulnerable United \nStates invites proliferation, blackmail, and aggression.\n  We are going to hear, during the course of this debate, people who \nreally are not concerned about the threats that face the United States \nof America talking about the missile defense system as star wars. They \nhave always downgraded it by using that term. Star wars should not even \nbe used. We are talking about an investment that we have in this \ncountry, through the THAAD system, through the Aegis system that we \nhave--22 ships that are currently equipped--we have a $38 billion \ninvestment. That investment can be protected merely by putting \napproximately $5 billion over 5 years in, and being able to deploy a \nnational missile defense system.\n  I implore my Senate colleagues in the strongest possible terms to \nwake up and see the world as it is and not the way arms control \nadvocates in the Clinton administration would like it to be. The threat \nis clear. It is present. It is dangerous. That is why I strongly \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I urge swift adoption of the Kyl-Inhofe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arizona for a \nfine amendment. This provision makes it absolutely clear that the world \nis becoming increasingly dangerous with regard to missile proliferation \nand the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It also makes clear that \nthe United States cannot wait around for a bunch of rogue states and \npossibly terrorists to acquire ballistic missiles capable of attacking \nAmerican cities before we respond with a serious national missile \ndefense system. Lest we want to invite another Oklahoma City bombing \nmultiplied many times over, we must begin to take action to defend our \ncountry against this ever increasing threat.\n  In my view, the Kyl amendment simply states the obvious: that the \nUnited States should be defended against accidental, unauthorized, and \nlimited ballistic missile attacks, whatever their source. We have \nattempted to establish a path toward this end in the bill now pending \nbefore the Senate, so I am pleased to support this amendment.\n  It has been argued that there is no threat to justify deployment of a \nnational missile defense system to defend the United States. This view \nis strategically shortsighted and technically incorrect. Even if we get \nstarted today, by the time we develop and deploy an NMD system we will \nalmost certainly face new ballistic missile threats to the United \nStates. Unfortunately, it will take almost 10 years to develop and \ndeploy even a limited system.\n  As Senator Kyl's amendment so clearly establishes, the intelligence \ncommunity has confirmed that there are numerous ways for hostile \ncountries to acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in much less \nthan 10 years by means other than indigenous development. Basically any \ncountry that can deliver a payload into orbit can deliver the same \npayload at intercontinental distances. Space launch technology is \nfundamentally ballistic missile technology, and it is becoming more and \nmore available on the open \n\n[[Page S11138]]\nmarket. Russia has all but put the SS-25 ICBM on sale for purposes of \nspace launch. China has repeatedly demonstrated a\n willingness to market missile technology, even technology limited by \nthe missile technology control regime.\n\n  In his last appearance before Congress as Director of Central \nIntelligence, James Woolsey stated clearly that countries working on \nshorter range ballistic missiles could easily transition to developing \nlonger range systems. Saddam Hussein demonstrated that even countries \nwithout a high technology base could get into the missile modification \nand nuclear weapons business.\n  North Korea has also demonstrated to the world that an ICBM \ncapability can be developed with relatively little notice. The Taepo-\nDong II missile, which could become operational within 5 years, is an \nICBM. Each new development on this missile seems to catch the \nintelligence community by surprise. It certainly undermines the \nargument of those who downplay the threat and the intelligence \ncommunity's own 10-year estimate.\n  Even if we knew with certainty that no new threat would materialize \nfor 10 years there would still be a strong case for developing and \ndeploying a national missile defense system. Deploying an NMD system \nwould serve to deter countries that would otherwise seek to acquire an \nICBM capability. A vulnerable United States merely invites \nproliferation, blackmail, and even aggression.\n  For this reason, I strongly and enthusiastically support Senator \nKyl's amendment. It is a reasonable statement for the Senate to make. \nOnly those who believe that the American people should not be protected \nagainst the one military threat that holds at risk their homes and \ncountry should oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of comments \nabout the Kyl-Inhofe amendment, and then also about an amendment that I \nintend to offer during the consideration of this legislation. I intend \nto offer an amendment that eliminates the $300 million that was added \nto national missile defense in the Armed Services Committee's \ndeliberations.\n  There is, as I understand it, $371 billion for the national missile \ndefense research and development in the budget that was submitted by \nthe President and requested by the Pentagon. In other words, the \nPentagon said, Here is what we think is necessary for that program. The \nArmed Services Committee added $300 million above that for national \nmissile defense.\n  I listened to my friends from Arizona and Oklahoma, for whom I have \ngreat respect. We just disagree on this question. I intend to offer an \namendment to strip the $300 million out of the bill because I do not \nthink the national missile defense system described in this bill ought \nto be built or deployed, and I do not believe that the taxpayers should \nbe asked to provide $300 million that the Pentagon says it does not \nneed.\n  The Kyl-Inhofe amendment has four pages of findings. And on page 5, \nit says, ``It is the sense of the Senate that all Americans should be \nprotected from accidental, intentional, or limited ballistic missile \nattack.''\n  It is hard to find fault with the language unless one asks the \nquestion: What does one mean by this? Is someone who suggests this \nsaying that we should spend over $40 billion on a ballistic missile \ndefense system, or star wars? I know that we were admonished not to use \nthat term because that does not apply, we are told. This is in my \njudgment a star wars national missile defense proposal. It is that \nsimple.\n  The Congressional Budget Office in 1993 said the cost of building a \nnational missile defense system at Grand Forks, ND and five other sites \nwould be $34 billion. A March 1995 Congressional Budget Office review \npegs the cost of that same site plus five others at $48 billion.\n  If with this simple sense of the Senate on page 5 the Senate is \nsaying, Yes, let us develop a program that costs the American taxpayers \n$48 billion, I think people here in the Senate ought to think long and \nhard about this.\n  Sure everyone wants to be protected. Today, in the old Soviet Union, \nthey are crushing and busting up missiles under a program that we are \nhelping pay for. Missiles are being destroyed today as I speak in the \nold Soviet Union.\n  What is the threat? Well, the Soviet Union has now disappeared. But \nwe are not told that the threat is that some terrorist Third World \ncountry, perhaps Iraq, or Iran, maybe some would suggest Qadhafi, could \nget ahold of an ICBM and some weapons grade plutonium, build a nuclear \nbomb, put it on the tip of a intercontinental missile and shoot it \ntoward the West. Maybe that is the threat.\n  In my judgment, if the wrong people get ahold of enough weapons grade \nplutonium to build a nuclear bomb, it is far more likely that they will \nthreaten this country by putting it in the trunk of a rusty Yugo parked \non a dock of the New York City harbor. That is far more likely that the \ncase in which they would acquire or be able to build an \nintercontinental ballistic missile with which to threaten the West.\n  Frankly, this bill is interesting to me. People are saying that we do \nnot have enough money, that we are up to our neck in debt, and that we \nmust reduce the Federal deficit--and I agree with that. Then this bill \nsays the Pentagon does not know what it is talking about on ballistic \nmissile defense--$371 million, humbug. We want to add $300 million. And \nmore than that, we have not learned our lesson about advanced \ndeployment and emergency deployment. We also want to not only add $300 \nmillion, we want to say to the folks who are building this star wars \nproject that we want accelerated development for a limited deployment \nin 1999. And full deployment will follow in 2003. That is the scheme in \nthis legislation.\n  I thought maybe we learned something about those enhanced research \nschedules and accelerated deployment schedules with the B-1 bomber, and \nsome other weapons programs, but maybe not.\n  In any event, I think the question is not should we protect America. \nThe question is why should we decide to spend $300 million more on \nnational missile defense than the Defense Department says it needs? Why \nshould we decide that we are going to dump in extra money beyond what \nthe Secretary of Defense says he needs or wants?\n  We have direct testimony from the Secretary of Defense saying I do \nnot want this. This is not money that I am asking for. I do not need \nthis. You are proposing, he says, to defend against a threat that does \nnot exist. And you are proposing giving the Pentagon money it does not \nwant.\n  I just find it unusual that the same people who always tell us that \nthe big spenders are on this side of the aisle are saying the Pentagon \ndoes not know what it is talking about; they want to provide the \nPentagon $300 million more for this boondoggle, dollars they do not \nwant. But that is not what I guess is so important today. The fact is \nthat this extra $300 million is just lighting the fuse on a $40 to $50 \nbillion spending program that once underway will not be controlled, and \nall of us know that.\n  I recognize that part of this deals with my State. My State was the \nsite of the only antiballistic missile system in the free world. It was \nbuilt in northeast North Dakota 25 years ago. I said at the time I did \nnot think it should be built. It did not matter much what I said then; \nit was built. And after billions of dollars were spent and after the \nsystem was operational, within 30 days it was mothballed.\n  Now, some might say, well, it was useful to spend all of that because \nwe were creating bargaining chips with which to negotiate with the \nSoviets on an ABM Treaty. I do not know the veracity of that. But I do \nknow that we were the site of the only antiballistic missile system \nbuilt in the free world, the only one that has ever been built by the \nWest. And it was mothballed \n\n[[Page S11139]]\nwithin 30 days after being declared operational.\n  Now we have a constituency to build a new ballistic missile defense \nsystem. This starts from President Reagan's announcement in the 1980's \nof a shield, sort of a national astrodome--I guess it was a national \nastrodome he was talking about, putting an astrodome over this country \nof ours so that no one could attack it. If an incoming intercontinental \nballistic missile took aim on our country and took flight toward our \ncountry, we would have a system of defense, both ground based and space \nbased, with which we would knock out those incoming missiles and \nprotect our country forever.\n  The result was that an enormous amount of money has been spent all \naround this country on research, engaging academic institutions, \nengaging companies all over, virtually every State in the Union, and a \nconstituency has developed for this idea. It does not matter that times \nhave changed. It does not matter there is no longer a Soviet Union. It \ndoes not matter there is no Warsaw Pact, the Berlin Wall is gone, \nEastern Germany does not exist. It does not matter the world is \nchanged. The folks who want to build a star wars, ABM, national missile \ndefense program have not had their appetites satisfied. So they want to \ncontinue with this program, but they are not satisfied by the Defense \nDepartment doing research in this area. They will only be satisfied if \nthey require deployment--on an interim basis so that by 1999, less than \n4 years from now, somehow, some way, someone will deploy the first \ncontingent in any number of sites around the country of the national \nmissile defense system.\n  Again, I certainly respect the views of those who have great ardor \nand support for this program. I respectfully disagree however. We have \nso many needs that we must prioritize them. Do we care about education? \nIf we do, is not the need to build star schools more important than to \nbuild star wars? Do we care about hunger and nutrition? If we do, is it \nnot more important to make sure that we fund those programs so that \npeople in this country are not hungry instead of taking $300 million \nthat the Pentagon does not want and building a system the Pentagon says \nshould not be built at this point? It is a matter of priorities, and we \nmust begin choosing.\n  I think those who push not only this but several other things in this \nlegislation that go well beyond the funding request by the Pentagon are \nsaying we do not have to make choices. We are not interested in \nprioritizing. Or at least if they are not saying that, they are making \nchoices and prioritizing in kind of a burlesque way, saying, well, it \nis not important for a poor kid in school to have an entitlement to a \nhot lunch because we cannot afford it, and then changing suits, having \na good sleep and coming back the next day saying it is important, \nhowever, to give the Secretary of Defense $300 million he does not need \nfor a program he does not want to deploy at this point and for a \nprogram that he says is not going to be built to meet an existing \nthreat.\n  I am just saying to you that I think those priorities are wrong. If I \nread Senator Kyl's sense-of-the-Senate: ``It is the sense of the Senate \nthat all Americans should be protected from an accidental, intentional \nor limited ballistic missile attack,'' I would say, oh, sure, it is a \nsense of the Senate all Americans ought to be protected. I understand \nthat. That makes sense to me. If I change this and say it is the sense \nof the Senate that we begin embarking on a program that will eventually \ncost $40 billion to deploy in multiple sites around the country a \nballistic missile defense system with a ground-based and a space-based \ncomponent, have I changed the question? I think I have,\n because if I am asking the Senators in this room whether that is the \nway we ought to spend $40 billion in the coming years, they have to \nevaluate whether $40 billion spent for this versus $40 billion \nallocated for other competing needs in this country is the right \nchoice.\n\n  So, Mr. President, as I indicated when I began, I intend to offer an \namendment to strip the $300 million in additional funding that has been \nput in the legislation before us for the national missile defense \nsystem. There will still remain $371 million, a substantial amount of \nmoney. But if my amendment is accepted, there will not remain $300 \nmillion which the Secretary of Defense says he does not want, does not \nneed, and did not ask for. We will, I am sure, have a rather \nsubstantial debate about this when I offer my amendment. I shall not \npursue it further at the moment. But I could not help but comment on \nthis amendment, which is a sense of the Senate with language seemingly \nso innocent but consequences so substantial. The consequences of this \nare to say, yes, we believe that it is appropriate to embark on a $40 \nbillion program with enhanced deployment to build a shield over the \nUnited States to protect us against incoming intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Frankly, I think that is a misplaced priority. And I think we should \nhave learned something in recent years that we must make very tough \nchoices, all of us, very tough choices about what we spend money on. I \nthink two questions ought to be asked on all of these proposals. Do we \nneed it? And can we afford it? And with those two questions on the \nnational missile defense system, nicknamed star wars--which is \nappropriate, because this talks about the potential of a space-based \nsystem--when we ask those two questions: Do we need it? And can we \nafford it? The first answer is answered by the folks that run the \nPentagon. They have said, no, we do not need it. And they have not \nasked for it. The second answer ought to be answered by everybody who \nis in the U.S. Senate who is grappling with questions about can we feed \nour children through nutritional programs? Can we adequately educate \nour kids? And can we do all the things that are necessary? Can we \nadequately fund Medicare and Medicaid for the elderly and the poor?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The answer to my question is no. We cannot afford \nsomething we do not need when priorities require us to make a better \njudgment than this.\n  I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am sure you heard several times----\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yielded for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have quotes by Jim Woolsey and John Deutch and other \nexperts in this field. And in terms of the quote that was attributed to \nJim Woolsey, there are between 20 and 25 countries that have developed \nor are developing weapons of mass destruction and the ability to deploy \nthose.\n  Do you not believe that statement by Jim Woolsey?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I would say to the Senator from Oklahoma that the \nstatements that are made by--let me give you a statement by the head of \nthe DIA. ``We see no interest in or capability of any new country \nreaching the continental United States with a long-range missile for at \nleast the next decade,'' so on, so forth.\n  But I would say this, that the Secretary of Defense, having evaluated \nall of these conditions, including the potential of other developments \nof ICBM's, has concluded that this is not in our interest. I mean, what \nthe Secretary of Defense has said to you looking at all those things, \n``Don't do this. I don't want the money. I don't want the program as \nyou constructed it. It doesn't make sense for this country's national \nsecurity.''\n  I would be happy to yield further.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will allow me to read a statement--two \nstatements. One is by James Woolsey concerning what is out there today. \n``We can confirm that the North Koreans are developing two additional \nmissiles with ranges greater than 1,000 kilometers that it flew last \nyear. These new missiles could put at risk all of Northeast Asia, \nSoutheast Asia, and the Pacific area. And if we export, the Middle East \ncould threaten Europe as well.'' Then further John Deutch says, ``If \nthe North Koreans field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, Alaska, and \nparts of Hawaii would potentially be at risk.''\n  So it is a two-part question. First of all, do you believe this? And, \nsecond, and most significantly, Mr. President, what if the Senator is \nwrong?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, will someday some countries that we now consider \nterrorist countries or renegade countries have the capability of \ndeveloping \n\n[[Page S11140]]\nor buying intercontinental missiles? Maybe. Maybe.\n  But I would say this. I ask if it is not the case, the single, \nstrongest, best case that could ever have been made for a ballistic \nmissile defense program, putting a shield over our country, will not be \na case 5 years from now or 10 years from now or today. It would have \nbeen a case that you could have made 10 or 15 years previously when we \nhad the proliferation of Soviet Union missiles, all of which were aimed \nat the United States, all of which the President said, at that point, \nrequired an umbrella around this country for protection.\n  But what did protect our country? No, it was not an umbrella. It was \nnot a new ballistic missile program or a star wars program. What did \nprotect our country? Well, it was a triad, of ground-based \nintercontinental ballistic missiles with Mark-12A warheads that \npersuaded the Soviets--and I assume will now persuade any other country \nfoolish enough to think about this sort of thing--that they will exist \nabout a day or a two or three, beyond when they launch that kind of an \nattack.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point I make is this: We developed the triad, ground \nmissiles, sea-based missiles and air-launched nuclear capability, which \nhas for decades persuaded countries far better armed than the potential \nterrorists you suggest from not even thinking about attacking this \ncountry. And I am just saying this: When we start taking the potential \nof the North Koreans developing a missile and deciding the result is \nAmerica ought to consign itself to a $40 billion new program, at the \ntime we say to the American elderly that we have got to cut $270 \nbillion in Medicare because we do not have the money, or at the time we \nsay to American kids that we are sorry about student aid, we do not \nhave quite enough money, and quite enough money for nutrition programs, \nI am saying the priorities are out of whack.\n  Am I saying defense does not matter? No. I am saying that the \nSecretary of Defense, the folks that know this program, the folks that \nhave spent a long, long while concerned about and evaluating the need \nfor a ballistic missile defense system are saying it is wrong. It is \nwrong what is being proposed. The extra money should not be spent. This \nprogram should not be deployed. And it is not in this country's \nnational interest.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. They are the ones saying that, not me.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is the Senator aware or do you deny that the Taepo Dong 2 \nis being developed today?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say this again. Is the Senator aware that \nYugoslavia produced Yugos and they are shipped to the United States and \nsome terrorist could put a nuclear device in it and ship it to New York \nCity and terrorize New York and this country? Would that require a \nsophisticated ICBM for delivery? Of course not. Would it accomplish the \nsame result? Of course it would.\n  My point is, if you start taking a look at threats to this country, \ndo not just look at the potential for developing an intercontinental \nballistic missile. In fact, the Secretary of Defense and others are \nsaying there is no realistic prospect within the next decade of that \nhappening, No. 1. And No. 2, given all of the evaluations he and the \nfolks in the intelligence community have made, he thinks what the \nSenator is proposing is not in this country's defense interests.\n  So that is the way I would answer the question of the Senator. I \nunderstand the case both Senators have made. I think they made it very \nwell. It is just I do not agree with them. I think this is a case where \nyou say, if you have unlimited funds that you can take from the \ntaxpayer, you say, ``Just keep giving us your money, because we have \ngot plenty of opportunity and we have lots of needs.'' If you have \nunlimited funds, then build everything. That is fine. The problem is we \ndo not have unlimited funds. We are forced--literally forced--to start \nchoosing among wrenching, awful, agonizing priorities. I think when the \nSenator proposes this, what he is saying is, we do not intend to \nchoose, at least not in defense; we intend to build it all.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I know the Senator from Georgia is able to speak on his \namendment. I can respond to each of the points that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota made in detail. But rather than doing that, I want to pose \none quick question, because, frankly, it may not be necessary for us to \ndo that.\n  Is the Senator prepared to tell us whether he is going to vote \nagainst or for my amendment? If the Senator is going to vote for the \namendment, I will not bother to respond to some of the points.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have not read the entire amendment. I read the sense of \nthe Senate. It is hard to disagree with the sense of the Senate if you \nunderstand that the sense of the Senate says that ``It is the sense of \nthe Senate that all Americans should be protected from accidental, \nintentional, limited ballistic attack.'' Yes, they ought to be \nprotected.\n  I ask you this question: Are you saying with this that it is your \nsense that we should spend $300 million extra next year and go to \nenhanced deployment of a ballistic missile defense system; that it is \nyour intention with this amendment to put the Senate on record to go \nfor early deployment and $300 million extra and the tens of billions of \ndollars that will be required in the years ahead to fully deploy this \nsystem; is that your intention?\n  (Mr. CAMPBELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. In response to the Senator's question, it is as you have \nnoted. You are going to propose an amendment to strike $300 million \nthat is already in the bill. My amendment does not add any money to the \nbill. My amendment simply expresses the sense of the Senate that all \nAmericans deserve to be protected from missile attack. So when the \nSenator makes the argument about the $300 million, he is really making \nthe argument in support of his amendment that is going to be offered \nlater to the bill. That is why I said I could easily respond to some of \nthe things you said, but I do not want to take the time if the Senator \nis going to end up supporting my amendment. I think we can move on----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just say this. The committee brought us $671 \nmillion, as I understand it, in ballistic missile defense, $300 million \nof which the Pentagon said it does not want, does not need and did not \nask for.\n  My feeling is this country protects itself against nuclear threat, \naccidental, intentional, or ballistic missile attack by having \nintercontinental ballistic missiles in the ground, by having Trident \nsubmarines in the sea, and by having our bombers with nuclear \ncapability in the air. In my judgment, the current triad, as I have \nindicated to you, has done that for 20 or 30 years.\n  I have not read the rest of your findings. As soon as I read the \nfindings, I will determine whether it comports with what I think we \nought to go on record with in the Senate.\n  Again, I ask the Senator from Arizona whether his intention with this \nis to provide support and comfort for and to assist in the accelerated \ndeployment of a national missile defense system?\n  Mr. KYL. And I say to the Senator, absolutely, bingo.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If that is the Senator's intention, I will not want to be \nsupportive of that, because I do not think that happens to make sense \nfor this country.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator, obviously, has the right to vote for or against \nmy amendment. I was curious. There is a lot that can be said. Perhaps \nthe Senator could be thinking--I would like to hear from some of the \nother Senators--perhaps the Senator could be thinking how he will \nsubstantiate the claim he made repeatedly now that the Secretary of \nDefense does not want this, did not ask for it, and so on. If the \nSenator can find those statements, I would be curious because, of \ncourse, General O'Neill testified to the Armed Services Committee that \nhe could spend $450 million and he does not do that without getting the \nconcurrence of the administration.\n  The administration's initial budget request did not ask for the \nmoney, I agree, but in last year's budget, the Clinton administration, \nin the 5-year defense plan, called for more than what is being \nrequested----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I say it is good news \n\n[[Page S11141]]\n  for the Senator from Arizona. In a body where there are so few answers \nand so much debate, he is about 50 paces from the answer. I will give \nhim the telephone number. He can call the Secretary of Defense and ask \nthe Secretary of Defense in the next 4 minutes, ``Do you want this $300 \nmillion, did you ask for it, and do you think that it is necessary for \nthis country's security?''\n  His answer will be, ``No, I didn't ask for it; no, I don't want it; \nand I think it is a mistake.''\n  So the Senator is very close to an answer, physically and also with \nrespect to time. Maybe by the next time we have this spirited \ndiscussion, when I offer the amendment to strike the money, maybe the \nSenator will have spoken to the Secretary of Defense and will have that \nanswer.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be a happy to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator from North Dakota, in answer to the Senator \nfrom Arizona as to what he would prefer, in response to what the \nSenator from Arizona has announced in terms of deterrence, he would \nprefer the deterrent that was used successfully for a long, long time, \nnamely, we use the term ``mutually assured destruction.'' He said that \nour deterrence from submarines under the sea, missiles in the ground, \nand bombers in the air would be his proposed solution to a ballistic \nmissile attack on the United States.\n  My question to the Senator is, do you believe that mutually assured \ndestruction is the preferred solution to, say, an accidental launch?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well----\n  Mr. COATS. And do you believe that would be any kind of a deterrent \nor appropriate response to an accidental launch of a missile?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator understands, I would judge successful the \nstrategy that has been employed with the nuclear triad in order to \navoid nuclear war over some 25 or 30 years. Would the Senator agree \nwith that?\n  Mr. COATS. I do, but the world has changed significantly since then. \nWe are trying to deter something entirely different.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I may respond to that--I did not respond to the \nSenator's question about North Korea. I would like to add for the \nrecord something I will not read, a rather lengthy paragraph, about the \ncapabilities of North Korea written by two Nobel laureates, two \nveterans of the Manhattan project, a total of seven eminent physicists, \nwho are completely at odds with the Senator's representations about the \ncapabilities of the North Koreans at this point.\n  I guess the Senator from Indiana is standing up saying we need this \nsystem because it is the only way we can provide for an impregnable \ndefense against the renegades, against terrorist countries; is that \nwhat the Senator is saying?\n  Mr. COATS. I am saying the world has changed significantly since we \nemployed the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, and the \ndeterrent effect the Senator alluded to that would satisfy the concerns \nof the Senator from Arizona simply may not be applicable in today's \nworld.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is interesting, what has changed it is quite \nremarkable--it is almost breathtaking in its scope--is that the Soviet \nUnion does not exist any longer, and today we are cutting the tails off \nbombers, they are crushing their missiles, and we are taking warheads \napart. What has changed dramatically is that we have stepped back from \nthe brink, we have largely seen the cold war dissolve, we have a \ncircumstance in this world today for which all of us should rejoice.\n  The arms race is largely over, and the Senator raises the question, \nare there still not some other threats? Yes, there are. But you know \nwhat has not changed is the appetite for those who are parents of \nweapons programs, because those who have parentage of new weapons \nprograms just cannot give up. It does not matter what the world is \nlike, it does not matter what the need is; they have a weapons program, \nand they are going to build it.\n  Mr. COATS. That may or may not----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator at least acknowledge that the genesis of \nthis kind of program came from Ronald Reagan, I believe, in 1982 or \n1983, in which he described the holocaust from a devastating full-bore \nSoviet Union ICBM attack on the United States? That is the genesis of \nthe description of the umbrella with which to protect our country.\n  Mr. COATS. That is true----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Things have changed. The Senator makes a correct point. \nThings have changed. What has changed is that that threat has changed \ndramatically because it has lessened, a much lesser threat than existed \nbefore. In fact, we have Yeltsin over here, we are working with Yeltsin \non all these things, we have Russians and Americans cavorting in space \nin a spacelab. Adversaries? No, hardly. We are working together. We are \ndoing a lot of things together, including reducing the risk of an \naccidental nuclear attack.\n  What has changed? Has the change occurred among those who said we \nneed an umbrella for $40, $50 billion to protect America against a \nfull-scale nuclear attack from the Soviet Union? No, the Soviet Union \nis gone, but it has not deterred by one step those who want to spend \nmoney on this program. They simply find another threat--North Korea, \nand the Nobel laureates and others tell us about North Korea.\n  It is at odds, and I will put it in the Record because I do not want \nto read the whole thing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this portion of the \nphysicists' letter be inserted in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would say that if you do not want to use \nNorth Korea, then somebody else will come waltzing over here and say, \n``Well, maybe it's not Korea, maybe its Qadhafi.'' And the next person \ncomes over and says, ``Maybe it's not Qadhafi, maybe it's Iran.''\n  Do all of those prospects concern me? Sure; sure. Is the likelihood \nof nuclear attack or the nuclear threat from those kind of renegade \ncountries the likelihood of an ICBM pointed at Gary, IN? Of course not.\n The likelihood is a terrorist act that----\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator yield a minute to get somebody on the \nfloor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michael \nMatthes and Peter Simoncini, military fellows in Senator Warner's \noffice, be granted floor privileges for the duration of Senate debate \non S. 1026, the Defense Authorization Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be brief. I say that the likelihood \nof the nuclear threat coming from a renegade country is not them \ngetting hold of some sophisticated targeted intercontinental ballistic \nmissile; it is that they would get hold of some weapons grade plutonium \nand the know-how, which pretty readily exists, to turn that into a \nnuclear device, and then in some ingenious way to hold some country \nhostage with that device. It is unlikely that it is going to be on the \ntip of an ICBM in flight. It is much more likely that it is going to be \ndifferent circumstances, in which the $40 billion and the best star \nwars program ever conceived by man or woman will be irrelevant.\n  I will make one other point to the Senator. On page 52 of the bill \nbrought to us, on the bottom of the page, you are talking about \ndeploying a system--deploy as soon as possible a highly effective \nsystem, and so on. Then it says, ``That will be augmented over time to \nprovide a layered defense against larger, more sophisticated ballistic \nmissile threats.''\n  When you stand and say we are trying to respond to North Korea--which \nI think gives them far more credit than they deserve--your bill would \ndo much more than that. The legislation suggests that if you want to \nfund a program that will provide a layered defense against larger \nballistic missile defense threats over time. That goes back to the \nReagan star wars concept in the eighties.\n  My point is that nothing has changed with those that propose the \nprogram. They pull the wagon through here no matter what the climate \nis, whether \n\n[[Page S11142]]\nthe wind blows, or whether it rains, it is the same wagon. They just \nchange the debate a bit. In my judgment, the taxpayers ought not to \nfund something that the Secretary of Defense says he does not want, the \ncountry does not need, and he says putting in this bill--I have not \neven talked about the things we will talk about later, about abrogating \nthe ABM Treaty and other things; I have not even discussed that. But I \nthink you ought to listen to the Secretary of Defense on this issue. \nYou ought to listen to the taxpayers. I think they understand.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator will yield, I am going to get off the \nfloor. I just came over to ask a simple question. I got everything but \nthe answer to my question. I did not mean to prompt the opportunity for \nthe Senator from North Dakota to repeat what he already said earlier. I \nsimply asked the question as to how the Senator proposed that we would \ndeter an accidental launch of a ballistic missile toward the United \nStates. I got everything but the answer to that particular question.\n  The Senator from Arizona is more than capable of answering--and I \nbelieve he probably has already done it--the reasons why this program \nis significantly different from what Reagan or anybody else proposed in \nthe early eighties. It is not the so-called umbrella defense star wars \nsystem that has been debated on the floor here for a decade and a half. \nIt is much, much different from that. The threat is different from \nthat. I do not disagree with the Senator that the threat we face \nincludes options other than----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would like to ask a \nquestion, I will be happy to answer a question. If not, I would like to \nregain the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. How does the Senator propose to deal with an accidental \nballistic missile launch in the United States? The Senator suggested \nthat mutually assured destruction was the deterrent to that and the way \nto respond. I do not agree with the Senator. I wonder what his solution \nwas to that question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the query. The Senator from \nIndiana is now suggesting that the principal reason for spending $40 \nbillion is to protect against an accident. It occurred to me that the \nKoreans would not likely be involved in an accident, according to the \nSenator from Arizona. He is proposing that the Koreans might pose a \nthreat. I assume when we hear discussions about other countries--Libya, \nIran, or others --we are talking about a threat rather than an \naccident.\n  The question of an accidental nuclear launch, I suppose, is a \nquestion others could ask of us and we could ask of many in the world. \nWe have, it seems to me, very carefully, over many, many years, \ndecades, in fact, worked to prevent that sort of circumstance from \noccurring on any side, with respect to the nuclear powers. I again say \nthat I urge all of us to evaluate. When we start talking about the need \nnow, when the Soviet Union is gone, to build a star wars program to \nreact to North Korea and spend $40 billion we do not have, I urge \neveryone to understand that at the same time we are going to consign \nourselves to spend $40 billion, we are going to say we cannot really \nafford Medicare and Medicaid, and that the old folks should pay more \nand get less, and we will cut $270 billion out of Medicare.\n  We supposedly cannot afford all the other things we are talking about \nbecause we have to tighten our belts. It occurs to me that those that \npush this, especially in the year 1995, when the world has changed, but \nchanged in a way that would augur for less incentive to need this kind \nof a program, those who push this are making an illogical argument. It \nseems illogical to me to be saying we have to tighten our belts here at \nhome and have to worry about priorities, we have to make tough choices, \nand then pull a project like this to the floor and say, by the way, \nthis is true for everything else, but we have $300 million here that \nthat does not apply because this $300 million we will substitute our \njudgment for the judgment of the Secretary of Defense, and others, and \nsay that we must now embark on an accelerated deployment of a national \nmissile defense program, including star wars.\n  I am just telling you that we will probably have a long discussion on \nthe question of that $300 million. If I see the glint in the eye of the \nSenator from Arizona from across the room, I suspect he will have a \nspirited defense of spending that money. I will be here, as soon as it \nworks into the schedule, to see where we all stand on spending money we \ndo not have on something we do not need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that portions of a July 7, \n1995 letter from seven eminent physicists, including two Nobel Prize \nwinners and two veterans of the Manhattan project, who discuss \naccidental launch by Russia or China and the likelihood of a threat \nfrom a third country, particularly North Korea, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the excerpts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (I) Accidental launch of Russian or Chinese nuclear \n     missile:\n       According to US intelligence officials, an accidental or \n     unauthorized launch from Russia or China is extremely \n     unlikely. Moreover, it is in the interests of Russia and \n     China to ensure that such launches do not occur. Indeed, \n     Defense Intelligence Agency Director Gen. James Clapper \n     testified in 1994 that ``Russian strategic missile systems \n     are currently considered to have very good control \n     mechanisms'' to prevent such launches, and the United States \n     is currently discussing sharing similar systems with China. \n     National missile defenses are the wrong solution to this \n     problem in any event since cooperative measures could be \n     implemented more quickly and cheaply, and would be more \n     effective than NMD. These include installing destruct-after-\n     launch mechanisms on all missiles to abort an unauthorized \n     launch and separating nuclear warheads from delivery systems.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (3) Deliberate missile attack by other country in the \n     future:\n       Ballistic missiles are the least likely method a developing \n     country would use to deliver an attack. Long-range missiles \n     are more expensive and technically difficult to build and \n     deploy than other means of delivery, and are less accurate. \n     Since launches are readily detected by satellites, the United \n     States would pinpoint the origin of a missile attack and \n     could retaliate quickly with devastating force. Such \n     retaliation would have to be considered as certain by any \n     leader, and will always be a powerful deterrent to missile \n     attacks.\n       Currently, no country hostile to the United States \n     possesses ballistic missiles that can reach US territory. \n     Even if such threats begin to emerge in the future, the \n     United States will have considerable warning since missile \n     development requires flight testing that can be monitored by \n     satellite. Although some 20 countries in the developing world \n     possess some type of short-range missile or space-launch \n     vehicle, only countries friendly to the United States--\n     Israel, India, and Saudi Arabia--have deployable systems with \n     a range greater than 600 kilometers.\n       North Korea, perhaps the most discussed threat, has \n     conducted one partial-range test of the 1000 kilometer range \n     Nodong missile, but does not have an operational version \n     after six to seven years of development. North Korea is \n     reported to be working on new missiles with ranges up to \n     3,500 kilometers, but such missiles would require new \n     technologies, such as staging and more powerful engines. \n     Judging from the long development time of past North Korean \n     missiles, deployment of such an intermediate-range missile is \n     many years off at least, and progress can be monitored \n     closely by satellite. In any event, none of these missiles \n     would have the range to strike the US homeland.\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Rather than devoting resources to national missile \n     defenses, the United States should instead focus on programs \n     to combat existing, more pressing threats. For example, a \n     higher priority should be placed on bringing military and \n     civil weapon-usable fissile material in the former Soviet \n     republics under better control and accelerating safe, \n     verified dismantlement of Russian nuclear warheads and \n     delivery vehicles.\n       In sum, proposals to deploy NMD are misguided and \n     irresponsible. National missile defenses do not address the \n     existing and most likely future threats to the U.S. homeland \n     and are diverting valuable resources. Instead, NMD will \n     destroy much of one of the United States' primary tools for \n     maintaining and increasing national security: arms control. \n     We urge you to weigh carefully the negligible benefits and \n     substantial costs of deploying NMD. Thank you for your \n     attention to our views and please call on us if we can be of \n     assistance as you deliberate on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hans Bethe,\n       Professor of Physics Emeritus, Cornell University.\n     Richard Garwin,\n       Adjunct Professor of Physics, Columbia University and IBM \n     Fellow Emeritus, IBM Research Division.\n     Kurt Gottfried,\n       Professor of Physics, Cornell University.\n       \n[[Page S11143]]\n\n     Frank von Hippel,\n       Professor of Public and International Affairs, Princeton \n     University.\n     Henry W.

Panofsky,\n       Professor and Director Emeritus, Stanford Linear \n     Accelerator Center, Stanford University.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the dialog on this subject. I \nthink this is a good way to begin the defense debate. I inform all of \nmy colleagues that the biggest challenges we have in this bill, in \nmanaging the bill--the chairman, Senator Thurmond and myself--is the \nwhole theory of ballistic missile defense, theater missile defense, and \nthe ABM Treaty. We are off on the subject that I think is going to be \nthe toughest subject. It will take the most time for debate. I consider \nthis a good dialog with which to begin the debate and get the views out \non both sides of this issue.\n  I am sure there will be other views as we go along. I would like to \nexplain, in just a few minutes, the amendment I have offered, which is \nnow the pending second-degree amendment to the Kyl first-degree \namendment.\n  This amendment is intended to restore funds for the program known as \nthe Corps SAM program, which is also a cooperative program called \nMEADS. They are one and the same program, but the MEADS program is the \nname given for SAM that is designated as a cooperative program and \nsupported by the Governments of Germany, France, and Italy, where they \nwill be paying approximately 50 percent of the cost of the program, \nwhich is what we have been encouraging for the last several years in \nterms of allied participation.\n  Corps SAM is a highly mobile theater missile defense system which is \ndesigned to defend our most vulnerable military forces, that is, our \nMarine and Army troops amassed at the very edge of the battle area. It \nis the only system under development that can meet this requirement. In \naddition to defending our forward troops from attack by short-range \nballistic missiles, the Corps SAM/MEADS system will also replace the \naging and outmoded and, in many cases, HAWK batteries that are now the \nMarines only defense against ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as \nenemy aircraft.\n  Notwithstanding the importance of the requirement to defend these \nforward deployed troops, the committee bill before us, unless it is \nchanged, will cancel the Corps SAM/MEADS program that was done during \nthe committee markup. That is the provision of the bill now. The bill \ndoes not just zero funding in the report; it directs the Secretary of \nDefense, in permanent bill language, to terminate this international \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, in my view, this is a shortsighted action and defies \nrational explanation. The Senate Armed Services Committee majority \nargued in their report accompanying our bill that 80 percent of the \ntotal ballistic missile defense funding goes to theater missile defense \nsystems. And the majority of the report complains about both the number \nof the theater missile defense systems under development and their \ncost.\n  This bill has shifted more funds to the national missile defense, \nwhich is the overall, rather than the theater defense. But what the \nmajority report does not set forth, Mr. President, is the following set \nof important facts:\n  First, the bill as it now exists, enshrines as the core theater \nmissile defense program four programs to the exclusion of all the other \nprograms.\n  Second, the bill does not recognize that these four core theater \nmissile defense programs provide overlapping coverage of the rear area \nin the theater but often no coverage for our front line troops.\n  That is graphically shown on this chart, Mr. President. This is the \nforward battle area. These are various forms of attack coming from the \nenemy on a theoretical battlefield.\n  This unprotected zone, this area right here in red, is the area where \nour forward troops are, usually Marine forces or Army forces. The white \nzone is the theater zone that is the support area, not on the forward \narea.\n  The only system that is being designed now to protect these forces in \nthe forward battle area is the Corps SAM system, which has been \ncanceled in this bill and which I am seeking to add back in this \namendment.\n  The programs that are left in the bill are all designed to protect in \nthis zone. We have the Patriot intercept zone in white. The Patriot \nsystem is designed to protect in that area. We have the Navy upper \ntier--very difficult to read here--but it is the outlined pink area in \nthe outline here.\n  That is the upper tier engagement. We have the THAAD intercept zone, \nthe light green zone here. Then we have the Navy lower tier, which is a \npossible program, which is below here.\n  These are overlapping programs. We want some overlap. We did not know \nwhich programs will end up being the best programs. I am not \ncomplaining about the overlap. What I am complaining about is leaving \nthis area completely--not only unprotected except for HAWK batteries, \nwhich are limited in their effectiveness--but we do not have any \nprogram, even with all this money that is being complained about that \nis being added, to protect the troops on the forward battle area.\n  There is a reference in the majority report to making the PAC-3 \nmobile. There is no money to do that. We do not know whether that can \nbe done. In my amendment, what I provide is $4.6 million to test that \nview. Can we make the PAC-3 program apply to this area?\n  Right now the incoming missiles for this zone are only not protected \nnow, if we have this bill without being changed, as it now exists, we \nwill have no program being designed for that. We will cut out the only \nprogram that our international allies--at least three of them--have \nsigned up for: Germany, France, and Italy.\n  That is what our Congress has asked, for our allies to get involved \nin this. They finally get involved, it is the very beginning of the \nprogram, and what did we do? We cancel the program. I do not understand \nit. Perhaps someone can explain it.\n  The third point I make is that the bill now makes the theater missile \ndefense funding problem that is being complained about--that is, the \nmajority report complains we are spending 80 percent of our money on \noverall defenses in the theater, but in this bill we add $215 million \nto the theater programs in this area while we cut out $30 million from \nthe Corps SAM/MEADS program, which I seek to add back.\n  If there is a problem--and I am happen to be one that believes \ntheater missile defense should be the priority because that is where \nthe immediate threat is and where we have a chance to get programs in \nthe field in the next few years that can be effective--if there is a \nproblem with 80 percent of the overall funding going to theater, what \nis done in this bill as it now stands, those programs are being added \nto what the program that goes to the heart of the forward battle area \nis cut out.\n  The fourth point is that the bill argues that instead of pursuing \nCorps SAM, the ballistic missile defense office should begin \ndevelopment of a system based on making the Patriot PAC-3 technologies \nhighly mobile to meet the Corps SAM requirement.\n  I do not have a quarrel with that. Perhaps PAC-3 would be better than \nCorps SAM. We do not have money in the bill to test that. Right now it \ncannot protect in this area. It is not being worked on. I do not mind \nseeking an answer to that question, but no one knows the answer now.\n  Why should we cancel the only program that is designed to protect \nthis, and try the PAC-3, give them no money to try PAC-3, and in the \nmeantime cancel the only program we have designed in that direction. I \ndo not understand any logic in that.\n  The fifth point, the bill right now, unless it is changed, rejects \nthe cooperation with our allies on the MEADS program. That is the \nprogram that three of our allies have signed up for, saying they are \nwilling to put some of their money into it. For the first time we have \nsome of our allies willing to put money into these programs. They will \npay 50 percent of the MEADS program. \n\n[[Page S11144]]\n\n  Now, that is puzzling to me, because every Congress--and I do not \nknow of any objection we have ever had from this on either side of the \naisle--has requested that the administration, the Bush administration \nand the Clinton administration, and even the Reagan administration in \nthe early 1980's, push hard for greater involvement of our allies in \nmissile defenses.\n  The allies finally, after a lot of urging, have voluntarily--we did \nnot tell them which program to get involved in; they voluntarily chose \nthis program. What do we do? The first thing we do after years of \nurging, we say, OK, you have signed up for this program, we will cancel \nit. We want you to now look at other programs, I assume. I do not think \nthat makes any sense.\n  Mr. President, the bill's decision to terminate the Corps SAM/MEADS \nprogram leaves our forward-deployed Marine and Army troops virtually \nunprotected for the foreseeable future from attacks by short-range \nballistic missiles.\n  I want no one to misunderstand. We are not talking about what the \ndialog was a little while ago, when we have a threat in 10 years \nagainst the Holy Land, the United States, or whether we have a threat \nin 12 years or 8 years, or a present threat. This is a present threat. \nIt is today's threat. It is one in which the next time we have a \nconflict, we may well have a chemical weapon dropped on our forward \nbattle troops by a delivery system, that the Corps SAM--which has been \ncanceled under this bill--is designed to protect against.\n  I emphasize the point about today's threat. This is a Defense Daily \nreport dated July 6, and it is reporting on the Roving Sands exercise, \nwhich the caption says ``Roving Sands Exercise Reinforced Need for \nCorps SAM, the Army Says.''\n  From the report, ``In a June paper, officials of the Army's Air \nDefense Artillery Center say that recently completed Roving Sands air \ndefense exercise `reinforced the Army's need to field the Corps SAM \n[surface-to-air missile]'''--that is what SAM stands for, surface-to-\nair missile--```to fill a void that exists as a result of emerging \nthreats' from tactical ballistic missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, \nand cruise missiles.''\n  ``During the Army's live Theater Missile Defense Advance Warfighting \nExperiment, which was conducted as a part of Roving Sands, SS-21 short-\nrange missiles employed by enemy red forces presented a particular \nproblem for the friendly blue forces.''\n  Mr. President, getting away from the quote, this is an exercise. We \nhave enemy forces, we have friendly forces. They test the various enemy \nsystems against our present capability. SS-21 has been produced by the \nSoviet Union for years and have been sold to numerous countries around \nthe world. These are widely distributed missile systems that exist in \nmany countries.\n  ``The largest problem for the blue forces,'' that is, the friendly \nforces, ``came from the red Alpha Battery 1st Battalion, 914 SSM \nBrigade, which `successfully fired all missiles, many with chemical \nwarheads, against some 20 Corps and Division targets.' The battery was \nnot detected during a single mission, and they were not engaged by \nfixed wing aircraft, rotary aircraft,'' or the Army Tactical Missile \nSystem.\n  In other words, they had 100 percent success rate in the shots that \nwere postulated with existing technology against forward battle troops. \nAny one of those in a real battlefield would have contained chemical \nweapons.\n  Continuing the quotation from this report:\n\n       For the exercise, four Scud brigades--of which two were \n     simulated and two combined live and simulated equipment--and \n     one SS-21 brigade formed the theater ballistic missile \n     threat.\n       Surrogates for cruise missiles formed during Roving Sands \n     ``also attacked Corps targets at will'' despite the \n     deployment of blue forces of an advanced technology sensor to \n     detect them.\n       This inability to deal with the major elements of the \n     emerging threat during Roving Sands highlights a deficiency \n     in corps missile defense capabilities, air defense officials \n     conclude in the paper. The Army must field the Corps SAM \n     system to ensure protection of friendly forces and allow the \n     corps commander to accomplish his mission.\n\n  Mr. President, there is much more that can be said about those \ntestings, but I think those paragraphs pretty much capture the essence \nof what we are faced with.\n  I am not going to get into a detailed comparison of the programs \nwhich are funded versus this program which is not funded. Suffice it to \nsay, though, in my opinion we are pouring money into programs that are \ngoing to take a long time to develop, that are speculative in terms of \nwhether they will work or not. I think some of them are worth some \nmoney. Some of them are worth putting money in, to see whether they \nwill work or not. I do not disagree with that. But we are pouring in \nlarge sums of money, above the requests in those areas, and we are \ncanceling the very program that our allies are working on with us, \nfinally, that is designed to protect the frontline troops against \ntoday's threat. That does not make sense.\n  Finally, the termination of the Corps SAM program in this bill is \nbound to have a chilling effect on further cooperation with our NATO \nallies on all defense programs, not just missile defenses. The actions \nin this bill are a complete reversal of the previous policy of \ncooperation. The Congress has been urging cooperation by the allies. \nFrankly, we want them to put some of their money into these programs, \ntoo. We do not want to be the only ones who ever put any money up. We \nwant them to put some money up, because we are going to be fighting, in \nmost conflicts, certainly in the European theater, side by side with \nour allies.\n  Quoting from the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n1994, and I give this as the exact quote from that bill--I know of no \nSenator or Congressman who opposed this provision in any way:\n\n       Congress encourages Allies of the United States, and \n     particularly those Allies that would benefit most from \n     deployment of Theater Missile Defense systems, to participate \n     in, or to increase participation in, cooperative Theater \n     Missile Defense programs of the United States.\n\n  We have urged them to get involved. They have finally gotten involved \nand we are canceling the program. We are talking about $35 million in \nthis amendment and we are talking about, not an add-on to this bill, \nthis amendment would shift the money from the big pot of money, over $3 \nbillion that is provided in the overall missile defense area, and we \nleave it up to the Secretary of Defense, in this amendment, to \ndetermine how to shift those funds. But there is in my opinion \nsufficient funds for this purpose.\n  Let me briefly summarize. My amendment restores the $30.4 million \nrequested by the ballistic missile defense office for the Corps SAM/\nMEADS program. We add another $4.6 million for the ballistic missile \ndefense office to study the view of the majority that the PAC-3 system \ncan also be made applicable to this. We say, ``OK, good idea. Take a \nlook-see. But do not cancel this program while you are doing it because \nwe do not know the answer.'' Thus, my amendment adds back a total of \n$35 million. Since the grand total of $770 million the majority has \nalready added to the request for ballistic missile defense in my \nopinion is adequate, my amendment thus offsets the $35 million increase \nby an undistributed reduction of $35 million to the total BMD funding \nof $3.4 billion.\n  We have $3.4 billion in this bill. Of that $3.4 billion, we would \nshift $35 million to restructure, repay, and reinsert this program.\n  Mr. President, I should close by quoting from a number of letters of \nsupport for the restoration of the Corps SAM funding which I received \nboth from the Pentagon and from our commanders in the field.\n  The first letter is a letter from Secretary of Defense Bill Perry. I \nwill just quote selectively from that. It is a 2\\1/2\\ page letter \naddressed to Senator Thurmond.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you continue your consideration of \n     the Fiscal Year 1996 National Defense Authorization Bill, I \n     strongly urge you and your colleagues to reconsider the \n     termination of the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) \n     program. The MEADS is a high priority advanced capability \n     tactical ballistic missile defense system that merits your \n     full support.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       The MEADS [program] represents an appropriate form of \n     allied cooperation in the development of a missile defense \n     system for which the United States and our allies share a \n     valid military requirement.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n\n[[Page S11145]]\n\n       The outcome of the internationally structured MEADS program \n     will be viewed on both sides of the Atlantic as one of the \n     most important tests of future trans-Atlantic defense \n     cooperation. At a time when both sides of the Atlantic are \n     experiencing declining defense budgets and smaller \n     procurements, we should welcome collaborative ventures where \n     there are compatible requirements. Failure to follow through \n     with this collaborative effort could significantly impact \n     prospects for future defense cooperation within the alliance, \n     jeopardize U.S. efforts to forge an alliance policy on \n     theater missile defense, and may hamper the ability of U.S. \n     defense industry to solicit joint programs with the allies in \n     other areas.\n       The Senate report language specifies the United States \n     would be best served to work with the allies on theater \n     missile defense systems that would provide wide areas of \n     coverage, such as the Navy wide area or Army THAAD systems. \n     While future cooperative efforts in those programs may have \n     merit, I firmly believe that MEADS uniquely offers the best \n     opportunity for allied cooperation at this time. In a future \n     conflict, as in Operation Desert Storm, the United States and \n     our allies will likely be operating together in a theater of \n     operations as a coalition force. In this manner, our maneuver \n     forces will be vulnerable to attack by tactical ballistic \n     missiles, cruise missiles and other air-breathing threat. The \n     MEADS would allow the United States, French, German and \n     Italian forces operating the system to provide protection for \n     all coalition partners.\n\n  Mr. President, next I will read from a letter from Gen. George \nJoulwan who heads up our European command. Quoting from General \nJoulwan:\n       The recent Senate Armed Services Committee mark-up \n     concerning the MEADS/Corps SAM program directly impacts \n     USEUCOM and NATO's ability to fight and win on the future \n     battlefield. USEUCOM and NATO have a critical need for MEADS.\n       Missile defense is one of my very top priorities. While the \n     ``Core'' US Theater Missile Defense (TMD) systems (PAC-III, \n     Navy lower-tier and THAAD) play a central role in defending \n     US interests and forces, they do not provide the mobility and \n     force protection required to defend against emerging air and \n     cruise missile threats. These limitations provide our \n     potential enemies a window of opportunity to attack perceived \n     vulnerabilities in protection of our forces and/or national \n     interests. Core TMD programs alone simply do not provide \n     sufficient operational capability to meet our security \n     requirements.\n       The MEADS/Corps SAM program will enable the US to protect \n     its regional interests against a wide spectrum of threats. \n     Excepting long range strategic missiles currently deployed by \n     only a few countries, there is no direct missile threat to \n     the continental United States today. Conversely, this theater \n     faces a range of systems that could directly threaten US \n     interests and US/Allied forces. Many nations in and around \n     the European Theater (especially in our Southern Region) are \n     developing and employing short range Theater Ballistic \n     Missiles (TBM), cruise missiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles \n     (UAV) to exploit perceived US and Allied vulnerabilities.\n       In the European Theater, interoperability is absolutely \n     vital. Further, NATO is the enabler for coalition operations \n     elsewhere. The MEADS program improves both US and NATO \n     operational capability through total interoperability. Having \n     MEADS deployed with our allies would mean less reliance on \n     strictly US assets to defend US and Allied forces and \n     interests.\n\n  Mr. President, next I would like to read a letter from General Luck, \ncommander in chief, U.S. Army in Korea.\n\n       This situation, especially on the Korean peninsula, \n     requires that we develop and field TMD systems that are \n     highly flexible, extremely mobile, capable of 360 degree \n     coverage and able to counter the full threat spectrum. Though \n     there is no system that can currently do this job for us, I \n     strongly believe the US Army has clearly articulated the need \n     for such a system through the Corps SAM program.\n       I understand that recent action by the HNSC and the SASC \n     have essentially terminated the Corps SAM program. I would \n     think that the demise of that program should not be \n     mistakenly linked to the vital Corps SAM requirement. The \n     capability provided by Corps SAM represents one of our more \n     important needs in protecting the force on the peninsula \n     today and in the future.\n\n  Mr. President, he goes on to say:\n\n       While we do have Patriot PAC-2 assets in theater, we remain \n     at risk given the growing and rapidly improving nature of the \n     threat. The termination of Corps SAM continues and increases \n     that risk. I would strongly recommend that Congress \n     reconsider the Corps SAM requirement and restore appropriate \n     funding to protect our forces.\n\n  Mr. President, I also would like to read a letter from Gen. Dennis \nReimer, head of the U.S. Army:\n\n       The predominant threats to Army and Marine Corps maneuver \n     forces are very short/short range tactical ballistic missiles \n     (VS/SRTBMs), cruise missiles (CMs) and unmanned aerial \n     vehicles (UAVs). Defense against these threats well forward \n     of our forces is clearly one of the greatest concerns facing \n     our Commanders-in-Chief (CINCs). The Corps SAM Operational \n     Requirements Document (ORD) specifies countering these \n     threats with a strategically deployable, tactically mobile \n     system providing 360 degree coverage. Existing/proposed \n     system configurations (PAC-3, THAAD, Navy Upper/Lower tier) \n     fail to provide the required protection due to deployability \n     and mobility limitations, lack of 360 degree coverage, and \n     lack of growth potential to meet these essential \n     requirements.\n       This is a compelling requirement. Army and Marine Corps \n     forces are currently at risk, and will remain at risk with no \n     defense against VS/SRTBMs and only limited capability against \n     CM attacks.\n\n  Mr. President, finally a letter from Robin Beard. Many of you know \nRobin Beard. He was a Congressman from Tennessee, a Republican \nCongressman, and now is the Assistant Secretary General, NATO. He \nwrites the following letter. This letter is addressed to Senator Ted \nStevens:\n\n       Dear Senator Stevens:\n       I am writing to express extreme concern with the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee's decision to terminate the Medium \n     Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) program and to urge you \n     and your colleagues to support the President's budget request \n     of $30.4 million for MEADS in the FY 1996 Defense \n     Appropriations Bill.\n       While others have spoken to the U.S. military requirements \n     for MEADS/Corps SAM, I would like to offer a broader NATO \n     perspective on the matter. Canceling MEADS would send a \n     horrible message to the Allies. It would confirm their worst \n     fears regarding the lack of U.S. interest in cooperative \n     armaments projects and would seriously jeopardize on-going \n     efforts to develop a cooperative approach for meeting the \n     challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and their delivery systems.\n\n  Mr. President, continuing to quote from Robin Beard who is now the \nAssistant Secretary General, NATO:\n\n       In addition to the political track, NATO Military \n     Authorities have prepared a draft Military Operational \n     Requirement for Theater Missile Defense that calls for the \n     protection of NATO territory, forces and populations against \n     ballistic missiles. And efforts are also underway under the \n     auspices of the Conference of National Armaments Director \n     (CNAD)--where NATO's material development is focused--to \n     define future opportunities and mentors of collaboration in \n     the area of TMD.\n       All of these efforts will lead, in the next couple of \n     years, to the development of an Alliance policy framework on \n     TMD cooperation endorsed by the North Atlantic Council. The \n     termination of MEADS, the first significant TMD collaborative \n     efforts, would be a serious setback for U.S. leadership in \n     this area.\n\n  Mr. President, I also have a letter from General Shalikashvili, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But I think I have probably \ngiven enough so that my colleagues have gotten the drift of the \npriorities for this program.\n  I hope that the Senate will consider this carefully. I hope that this \namendment could possibly be accepted. But, if it is not accepted, I \nurge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  I think this is a very important program. A lot is at stake here. The \nlives of the battlefield troops at the front line are at stake, and the \nfuture of cooperative efforts in our alliance in terms of theater \nmissile defense I think also will be very significantly affected by how \nwe handle this matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all of the complete \nletters that I have read excerpts from be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: As you well know, our combined forces in \n     Korea face a significant threat from DPRK tactical ballistic \n     missiles, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. The \n     growing quantity and capability of this particular threat and \n     the restricted nature of Korean terrain amplify the risk to \n     our forces. This situation, especially on the Korean \n     peninsula, requires that we develop and field TMD systems \n     that are highly flexible, extremely mobile, capable of 360 \n     degree coverage and able to counter the full threat spectrum. \n     Though there is no system that can currently do this job for \n     us, I strongly believe the US Army has clearly articulated \n     the need for such a system through the Corps SAM program.\n       I understand that recent action by the HNSC and the SASC \n     have essentially terminated the Corps SAM program.

The \n     capability provided by Corps SAM represents one of our more \n     important needs in protecting the force on the peninsula \n     today and in the future. In fact, TMD as a whole is a high \n     priority in our theater and has the support of USCINCPAC as \n\n[[Page S11146]]\n     one of the top ten priorities within our FY96 integrated priority list.\n       While we do have Patriot PAC-2 assets in theater, we remain \n     at risk given the growing and rapidly improving nature of the \n     threat. The termination of Corps SAM continues and increases \n     that risk. I would strongly recommend that Congress \n     reconsider the Corps SAM requirement and restore appropriate \n     funding to protect our forces.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Gary E.

Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Senate Armed Services Committee \n     (SASC) voted to terminate the Corps Surface-to-Air Missile \n     (Corps SAM) program, after the House National Security \n     Committee (HNSC) voted a $10 million decrement. However, the \n     critical warfighting requirement that Corps SAM intends to \n     fill remains completely valid.\n       The predominant threats to Army and Marine Corps maneuver \n     forces are very short/short range tactical ballistic missiles \n     (VS/SRTBMs), cruise missiles (CMs) and unmanned aerial \n     vehicles (UAVs). Defense against these threats well forward \n     of our forces is clearly one of the greatest concerns facing \n     our Commanders-in-Chief (CINCs). The Corps SAM Operational \n     Requirements Document (ORD) specifies countering these \n     threats with a strategically deployable, tactically mobile \n     system providing 360 degree coverage. Existing/proposed \n     system configurations (PAC-3, THAAD, Navy Upper/Lower tier) \n     fail to provide the required protection due to deployability \n     and mobility limitations, lack of 360 degree coverage, and \n     lack of growth potential to meet these essential \n     requirements.\n       This is a compelling requirement. Army and Marine Corps \n     forces are currently at risk, and will remain at risk with no \n     defense against AS/SRTBMs and only limited capability against \n     CM attacks. We strongly feel that development actions must \n     continue, and welcome the opportunity to work with the \n     Committee to demonstrate how we can leverage current \n     capabilities in order to meet this critical need in a rapid, \n     cost-effective manner.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Dennis J. Reimer,\n\n                                               General, U.S. Army,\n     Chief of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                        U.S. Army,\n\n\n                                           The Chief of Staff,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1995.\n     Memorandum for Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and \n         Technology).\n     Subject: Army Position for Corps Surface-to-Air Missile \n         (Corps SAM)/Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS).\n       1. The Army fully supports the current proposed Corps SAM/\n     MEADS program. We need to proceed as rapidly as possible with \n     the Corps SAM program under any circumstances. The Army and \n     the Marine Corps have a compelling need for the only system \n     that can provide air and missile defense for maneuver forces \n     as well as serve as an effective lower tier Theater Missile \n     Defense (TMD) system under the Theater High Altitude Area \n     Defense (THAAD) umbrella.\n       2. We have reviewed the current status of the Corps SAM/\n     MEADS program with respect to the ongoing debate in Congress \n     and the mid and long-term funding of DoD's TMD programs. We \n     believe that the potential development cost savings and the \n     prospects of allied interoperability and operational burden \n     sharing in TMD fully justify pursuing the Project \n     Definition--Validation phase of MEADS. The initial phase will \n     define the program in terms of costs and other benefits to \n     the participating nations and allow for an informed decision \n     by all the countries involved regarding continuation of a \n     cooperative program. The Army has the mechanisms in place to \n     adequately address Congressional concerns with respect to \n     leveraging current TMD and cruise missile defense programs \n     while protecting our interests with respect to technology \n     transfer. The industry proposals currently being evaluated \n     reflect a high degree of leveraging of other programs and \n     will serve as a sound foundation for entering into the MEADS \n     program. We will provide full support to insure that MEADS is \n     begun expeditiously and in a manner that protects the best \n     interests of the United States. If efforts at a cooperative \n     program are unsuccessful, the Request For Proposal (RFP) \n     allows for a transition back to a U.S. only program.\n       3. I appreciate your continued support of this critical \n     program for our warfighters.\n\n                                             Dennis J. Reimer,\n\n                                               General, U.S. Army,\n     Chief of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           North Atlantic Treaty Organization,\n\n                                                    July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: I am writing to express extreme concern with the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee's decision to terminate the \n     Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) program, and to \n     urge you and your colleagues to support the President's \n     budget request of $30.4 million for MEADS in the FY 1996 \n     Defense Appropriations Bill.\n       While others have spoken to the U.S. military requirement \n     for MEADS/Corps SAM, I would like to offer a broader NATO \n     perspective on the matter. Cancelling MEADS would send a \n     horrible message to the Allies. It would confirm their worst \n     fears regarding the lack of U.S. interest in cooperative \n     armaments projects and would seriously jeopardize on-going \n     efforts to develop a cooperative approach for meeting the \n     challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and their delivery systems.\n       NATO is now closer than ever to formulating an Alliance \n     approach to theater missile defense. At the January 1994 NATO \n     Summit, Ministers recognized the dangers posed by \n     proliferation and directed that work begin on developing a \n     policy framework to reduce the proliferation threat and \n     protect against it. Supporting this effort is NATO's Senior \n     Defense Group on Proliferation, which recently concluded that \n     preventing the proliferation of WMD and their missile \n     delivery systems remains NATO's top counter proliferation \n     priority. Additionally, the June 1994 Alliance Policy \n     Framework on Proliferation and Weapons of Mass Destruction \n     recognizes the growing proliferation risks, especially with \n     regard to states on NATO's periphery, and called on the \n     Alliance to address the military capabilities needed to \n     discourage WMD proliferation and use, and if necessary, to \n     protect NATO territory, populations and forces.\n       In addition to the political track, NATO Military \n     Authorities have prepared a draft Military Operational \n     Requirement for Theater Missile Defense that calls for the \n     protection of NATO territory, forces and populations against \n     ballistic missiles. And efforts are also underway under the \n     auspices of the Conference of National Armaments Directors \n     (CNAD)--where NATO's materiel development is focused--to \n     define future opportunities and methods of collaboration in \n     the area of TMD.\n       All of these efforts will lead, in the next couple of \n     years, to the development of an Alliance policy framework on \n     TMD cooperation endorsed by the North Atlantic Council. The \n     termination of MEADS, the first significant TMD collaborative \n     efforts, would be a serious setback for U.S. leadership in \n     this area. The need to respond to the growing proliferation \n     threat, coupled with the high cost of new defensive systems, \n     means that we can't go it alone. We need Allied participation \n     and MEADS is a good place to start because it responds to \n     French, German and Italian requirements to develop a new \n     defensive capable of addressing the threat posed by aircraft, \n     ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. And, as it has been \n     noted by U.S. military authorities, it fulfills the \n     requirement for a highly mobile TMD/cruise missile defense \n     system capable of protecting Army and Marine Corps maneuver \n     forces.\n       The implications of canceling MEADS go well beyond NATO TMD \n     cooperation. As the centerpiece of the U.S. ``renaissance'' \n     in trans-Atlantic cooperation. MEADS is an experiment that is \n     being closely watched on both sides of the Atlantic. Failure \n     of the U.S. to follow through will stifle prospects for \n     future cooperation--such as with JSTARS--and play into the \n     hand of those advocating a strong European defense industry \n     at the expense of trans-Atlantic cooperation. U.S. industry \n     will then find it increasingly difficult to solicit European \n     cooperation across a broad spectrum of projects. It may well \n     spell the difference between trans-Atlantic cooperation and \n     competition.\n       In closing, I would again urge you and your colleagues to \n     consider the broader geopolitical implications of this \n     cooperative program and support the President's budget \n     request. MEADS will pay dividends in the future both in terms \n     of its contribution to trans-Atlantic armaments collaboration \n     and as a military capability in support of out-of-area \n     operations--a central tenet of the Alliance's new Strategic \n     Concept.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                      Robin Beard,\n     Assistant Secretary General, NATO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Chairman of the Joint\n\n\n                                              Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee of the Armed Forces, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: Thank you for your letter of 11 July \n     regarding your concerns about theater missile defense (TMD) \n     priorities.\n       The President's Budget submit represents a balanced \n     approach to satisfying our theater missile defense \n     requirements. In that document, CORPS SAM/MEADS research and \n     development was supported as a part of the integrated TMD \n     architecture. It will fill a critical need for mobile, self-\n     defensive capability for maneuver forces, both Army and \n     Marine Corps. We support funding of this program at $30.4 \n     million for FY 1996. In response to your questions, I support \n     funding Corps SAM/MEADS at this level since none of the \n     programs in the letter offer an alternative better than the \n     President's Budget.\n       Current development efforts, new efforts in sophisticated \n     strike operations against mobile launchers, and the Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Organization-led TMD Cost and Operational \n     Effectiveness Analysis will enable the Department to make \n     critical TMD acquisition decisions in the FY 1998 budget \n     process consistent with funding constraints and \n\n[[Page S11147]]\n     the CINCs' warfighting requirements. For now, I believe the DoD Budget \n     submit appropriately represents our TBMD warfighting \n     priorities.\n       I discussed the above position with the Joint Chiefs and \n     our CINCs, and all are in agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you continue your consideration of \n     the Fiscal Year 1996 National Defense Authorization Bill, I \n     strongly urge you and your colleagues to reconsider the \n     termination of the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) \n     program. The MEADS is a high priority advanced capability \n     tactical ballistic missile defense system that merits your \n     full support.\n       The Department's approach to the MEADS program has its \n     direct legacy in past Congressional direction that the United \n     States seek cooperation with our allies on the development of \n     tactical and theater missile defenses. I would cite the \n     provision from the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization \n     Conference Report that expressed the following sense of the \n     Congress:\n       ``Congress encourages allies of the United States, and \n     particularly those allies that would benefit most from \n     deployment of Theater Missile Defense systems, to participate \n     in, or to increase participation in, cooperative Theater \n     Missile Defense programs of the United States. Congress also \n     encourages participation by the United States in cooperative \n     theater missile defense efforts of allied nations as such \n     programs emerge.''\n       The MEADS represents an appropriate form of allied \n     cooperation in the development of a missile defense system \n     for which the United States and our allies share a valid \n     military requirement. As you are aware, MEADS will fulfill an \n     existing U.S. operational requirement for a rapidly \n     deployable, highly mobile, robust air defense system designed \n     to protect maneuver forces and expeditionary forces of the \n     U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Both Services are in strong \n     agreement on the need for protection against short- to \n     medium-range ballistic missiles and the full spectrum of air-\n     breathing threats-aircraft, cruise missiles and unmanned \n     aerial vehicles. This is also a military requirement shared \n     by our European allies. In short, this is a valid \n     requirement.\n       To satisfy this requirement and reduce costs, the committee \n     recommends a restructured program that would merge ongoing \n     efforts in PAC-3 and Theater High Altitude Area Defense \n     (THAAD) to produce a mobile, hybrid system. The acquisition \n     strategy for the current MEADS program does, in fact, \n     leverage off existing ballistic and cruise missile defense \n     programs as the committee suggests. During the MEADS program \n     definition phase, we have planned to evaluate all viable \n     options including hybrid solutions. Each approach will be \n     assessed and its advantages in terms of costs and commonality \n     will be compared to other system concepts. At least one of \n     our partners, Germany, which already has PATRIOT, would most \n     likely respond eagerly to any PAC-3 option which would \n     provide part of a cost and operationally effective MEADS \n     architecture. Additionally, any potential cost saving derived \n     from unilateral development are more than offset by the \n     political, operational and diplomatic benefits of \n     international collaboration.\n       The outcome of the internationally structured MEADS program \n     will be viewed on both sides of the Atlantic as one of the \n     most important tests of future trans-Atlantic defense \n     cooperation. At a time when both sides of the Atlantic are \n     experiencing declining defense budgets and smaller \n     procurements, we should welcome collaborative ventures where \n     there are compatible requirements. Failure to follow through \n     with this collaborative effort could significantly impact \n     prospects for future defense cooperation within the alliance, \n     jeopardize U.S. efforts to forge an alliance policy on \n     theater missile defense, and may hamper the ability of U.S. \n     defense industry to solicit joint programs with the allies in \n     other areas.\n       The Senate report language specifies that the United States \n     would be best served to work with the allies on theater \n     missile defense systems that would provide wide areas of \n     coverage, such as Navy wide area or Army THAAD systems. While \n     future cooperative efforts in those programs may have merit, \n     I firmly believe that MEADS uniquely offers the best \n     opportunity for allied cooperation at this time. In a future \n     conflict, as in Operation Desert Storm, the United States and \n     our allies will likely be operating together in a theater of \n     operations as a coalition force. In this manner, our maneuver \n     forces will be vulnerable to attack by tactical ballistic \n     missiles, cruise missiles and other air-breathing threats. \n     The MEADS would allow United States, French, German and \n     Italian forces operating the system to provide protection for \n     all coalition partners. At the same time, THAAD and Navy Wide \n     Area Defenses could provide a defensive overlay. Hence, MEADS \n     supports coalition efforts, joint operations and \n     interoperability of tactical ballistic missile defenses. \n     These could be critical features in a future conflict.\n       I urge you to support the full budget request for MEADS, \n     our centerpiece of Theater Missile Defense cooperation with \n     our European allies.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Commander in Chief,\n\n\n                                        U.S. European Command,\n\n                                                    July 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: The recent Senate Armed Services \n     Committee mark-up concerning the MEADS/Corps SAM program \n     directly impacts USEUCOM and NATO's ability to fight and win \n     on the future battlefield, USEUCOM and NATO have a critical \n     need for MEADS.\n       Missile defense is one of my very top priorities. While the \n     ``Core'' US Theater Missile Defense (TMD) systems (PAC-III, \n     Navy lower-tier and THAAD) play a central role in defending \n     US interests and forces, they do not provide the mobility and \n     force protection required to defend against emerging air and \n     cruise missile threats. These limitations provide our \n     potential enemies a window of opportunity to attack perceived \n     vulnerabilities in protection of our forces and/or national \n     interests. Core TMD programs alone simply do not provide \n     sufficient operational capability to meet our security \n     requirements.\n       The MEADS/Corps SAM program will enable the US to protect \n     its regional interests against a wide spectrum of threats. \n     Excepting long range strategic missiles currently deployed by \n     only a few countries, there is no direct missile threat to \n     the continental United States today. Conversely this theater \n     faces a range of systems that could directly threaten US \n     interests and US/Allied forces. Many nations in and around \n     the European Theater (especially in our Southern Region) are \n     developing and employing short range Theater Ballistic \n     Missiles (TBM), cruise missiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles \n     (UAV) to exploit perceived US and Allied vulnerabilities.\n       In the European Theater, interoperability is absolutely \n     vital. Further, NATO is the enabler for coalition operations \n     elsewhere. The MEADS program improves both US and NATO \n     operational capability through total interoperability. Having \n     MEADS deployed with our allies would mean less reliance on \n     strictly US assets to defend US and Allied Forces and \n     interests.\n       MEADS has potentially significant economic and political \n     benefits, as well. New TMD systems are so expensive that \n     unilateral development and fielding often makes them \n     unaffordable. Yet, with the Germans, French and Italians \n     picking up 50% of the MEADS program costs, it appears that we \n     can protect our forces and interests while realizing \n     potentially large savings.\n       Politically, MEADS is a visible and important illustration \n     of the US commitment to missile defense, to NATO, and to \n     Europe. MEADS is a model for future transatlantic cooperation \n     efforts. Terminating MEADS now would have serious \n     ramifications in other ongoing cooperative ventures and raise \n     yet another round of poignant questions about US intentions \n     regarding leadership in NATO. Consequently, to protect US \n     forces and our national interests, we must maintain the \n     leadership and momentum for MEADS. Congressional support is \n     critical. With it, MEADS can protect US interests and US/\n     Allied forces from adversaries equipped with short range \n     TBMs, cruise missiles and UAVs. Without MEADS, we will place \n     future US and Allied forces at a serious risk. I urge \n     continued development of MEADS.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                George A. Joulwan,\n                                               General, U.S. Army.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of this very important \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. I think outstanding work has \nbeen done on this bill, and I commend the very distinguished chairman \nof the full committee, the Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond, who really provided true leadership on this bill. He allowed \nthe subcommittees to do their work. We had a lot of very good hearings. \nAll of the Members were engaged and involved. And I think we have \nproduced a good bill. Obviously, there are some points we disagree on. \nBut I think we can work out some of those disagreements, and we will \nhave votes on others and move forward.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia, who has \nalways done good work on the important defense of our country, and I \nlook forward to working with him on a number of issues that are still \noutstanding that I think we can resolve.\n  I want to make the point at the beginning that we have already had a \nlot of negotiations and addressed a number of concerns in the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. I believe we are going to be \nable to make a number of changes in the Department of Energy portion of \nthe DOD authorization bill that will address concerns of Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, and from States as divergent at South \n\n[[Page S11148]]\nCarolina, Idaho, New Mexico, and Tennessee.\n  We have tried to list all of the various concerns. We have resolved \nall of these issues except maybe one or two where we just need to have \na good debate and have a vote and see how it turns out.\n  So I am pleased with the bill that we have produced. I think we \nshould not lose sight of the fact that we need to move it on through in \na reasonable time, get it into conference where we will continue to \nwork out differences, and produce a bill that I feel confident that \nhopefully the President will be able to sign.\n  Also I would like to urge my colleagues to try to limit the number of \namendments. Let us get right down to the basic issues and vote so we \ncan finish up the authorization bill in the next 3 days and move on to \nthe appropriations bill.\n  From an authorization standpoint, I think we need to remember that we \nare right on top of the appropriations process now. If we dally along \nvery much, we will wind up on a side track, and the appropriators move \nforward. So let us work together and resolve these issues the best way \nwe can.\n  But I would like to address the issue that has been discussed a lot \nhere today--a couple of the issues that will be debated later on, and \nwe will have amendments on it. That is the Missile Defense Act of 1995. \nSince there have been a number of assertions that I think are not \ntrue--I think they are false--concerning the content and the intent of \nthis legislation, I would like to explain actually what it does and \ndoes not do in my opinion,\n  The Missile Defense Act of 1995 would replace the Missile Defense Act \nof 1991 which was a bipartisan effort that was developed in 1991 with \nmore up-to-date legislation intended to respond more completely to the \nchallenges and opportunities of the post-cold-war era--times have \nchanged--and establish a more focused course for theater and national \nmissile defenses.\n  The new legislation also addresses the growing cruise missile threat \nthat we have around the world, for the first time establishing an \nintegrated approach to ballistic and cruise missile defense.\n  Programmatically, the Missile Defense Act of 1995 has three pieces: \nOne that focuses our efforts in the area of theater missile defense; \none that establishes a clear policy to develop and deploy a limited \nnational missile defense system; and, one that establishes the cruise \nmissile defense initiative.\n  With regard to TMD, the legislation establishes a top priority corps \nprogram consisting of the Patriot PAC-3 system, the theater high \naltitude area defense system, or THAAD, the Navy lower tier system, and \nthe Navy upper tier system. To allow us to maintain this high priority \nprogram and to make room for programs to defend American territory, the \nlegislation also proposes to terminate two unfocused and relatively low \npriority programs--although its value or priority has already been \ndiscussed, and we will talk more about it in a moment--that is, the \nairborne boost-phase interceptor, and the Corps SAM system.\n  Each year, several of our colleagues say that, well, you never cancel \nany defense programs even when they have had problems or when their \nfuture is not clear, or regardless of what the cost is. Well here is a \ncase where we are trying to terminate one that has been unfocused and \nhas some problems.\n  We want to work with Senator Nunn on the Corps SAM issue and I think \nmaybe we can find a way to work through this. But keep in mind, this is \nnot some $30 million program or $35 million program. This is a program \nthat leads us to over $10 billion now. If it is an international \nprogram that involves some of our allies in Europe, presumably they \nwould take up some half of the costs of that Corps SAM program. But \nthis is potentially a big dollar program.\n  So what I would like to see us do is let us look at the problems it \nhas had, let us ask some questions about why it has moved on into the \ninternational arena without us I think directly acting on that, and see \nif we can understand where we want to go before we get started toward a \nprogram that could cost a lot.\n  I am impressed, we are all impressed, when the frontline commanders \nsay we need this. We listen to that. But here is a case where we said \nwe just do not feel we can afford this one in view of the way it has \nbeen developed and some of the problems it has had.\n  With regard to the national defense, I am amazed at what I hear on \nthis. Listen to what I said: ``National defense.'' The Missile Defense \nAct would establish a policy to deploy a multiple-site ground-based \nsystem by the year 2003. This is not star wars but a modest and \nresponsible answer to a growing threat.\n  After considering all the alternatives, the Armed Services Committee \nfelt that the United States should move directly to a multiple-site \nsystem, since a single-site system would just not be capable of \ndefending all Americans. We are thinking about a system that is going \nto allow some Americans to be defended and not others? Somebody want to \ndefend that?\n  We felt it was inappropriate morally and strategically to select a \nsubset of the American population for defensive coverage while leaving \nsome undefended. You better check and see if you would be undefended or \nnot. We are talking about national defense of our country and by one \nthat could have more than one site so that everybody could be covered. \nThis decision seems even more correct given that the most unpredictable \nand dangerous new ballistic missile threats will be capable of reaching \nStates like Alaska and Hawaii before the continent itself becomes \nvulnerable. I am referring to the North Korean intercontinental \nballistic missile program which the intelligence community believes \ncould become operational within the next 5 years.\n  This is not some far-off potential threat. This is very close. An NMD \nsystem consisting of the only site in the middle of the United States \nsimply cannot defend Alaska and Hawaii and would not do a very good job \nof protecting the coastal regions where most Americans live, including \nthis Senator. I live on the Gulf of Mexico. I look at the areas \ncovered. We probably would not be covered. I am uncomfortable with \nthat.\n  In the area of cruise missile defense, the legislation would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to focus U.S. activities and coordinate the \nvarious efforts within the Department of Defense. It would require the \nSecretary to integrate U.S. programs for ballistic missile defense with \ncruise missile defense to ensure that we leverage our efforts and do \nnot waste resources through unnecessary duplication. It also requires \nthe Secretary to study the current organization for managing cruise \nmissile defense and recommend changes that would strengthen and \ncoordinate these efforts.\n  There have been a number of other statements I just do not agree with \nraised against this legislation, most of them having to do with the ABM \nTreaty. Let me set the record straight. Nothing in this bill advocates \nor would require violation of the ABM Treaty. Every policy and goal \nestablished in this bill can be achieved through means contained in the \nABM Treaty itself. The argument this bill would force us to violate the \nABM Treaty is like arguing that one must drive off a cliff just because \nthere is a bend in the road where the cliff is.\n  This bill recommends that we gradually and responsibly turn the \nwheel. Can we improve on it? Let us work at it. Maybe we can. I think \nwe have got some scare tactics here with regard to what we are trying \nto do, and that is not what we want to do.\n  Let me also say that it is not this bill first and foremost that \nforces us to reconsider the ABM Treaty. Such a reexamination is \nwarranted, indeed required, as a result of the end of the cold war and \nthe growing multifaceted ballistic missile threat characterizations of \nthis new era. The ABM Treaty with its underlying philosophy of mutually \nassured destruction, MAD, practically defined the cold war \nconfrontation. Why would anybody argue that we should now reexamine \nthat agreement? Times are different.\n  Let us be clear about what this bill in fact calls for. It recommends \nthat the Senate undertake a comprehensive review of the continuing \nvalue and validity of the ABM Treaty. It suggests that the Senate \nconsider creating a select committee to undertake a 1-year assessment. \nLet us not run up to the point where in the year 2002 or 2003 we \n\n[[Page S11149]]\nmay actually want to move toward deployment.\n  Let us think about it. Let us have a group, and if this is not the \nway to set it up, set it up somewhere else. Get the various committees \nthat would have jurisdiction involved. Let us start thinking about and \ntalking about what we want to do with the ABM Treaty. So what we are \nrecommending is a careful examination of all issues before making a \nspecific recommendation to the President on how to modify our current \nABM Treaty obligations.\n  By establishing a policy to deploy a multiple-site NMD, national \nmissile defense system, this bill does assume that eventually we will \nneed to amend or otherwise modify the ABM Treaty, but let me repeat \nthat the means to achieve this are contained in the ABM Treaty itself. \nThe treaty in no way limits the establishment of policies. It limits \nthe deployment of ABM systems.\n  In the case of ground-based systems, the treaty in no way limits \ndeployment or development or testing. Therefore, we can proceed \nsimultaneously to develop the system called for in this bill while we \nfigure out the best approach dealing in the future with the treaty.\n  We should remember that the ABM Treaty was meant to be a living \ndocument that can be changed as circumstances change. Anyone who argues \nthat the strategic and political circumstances have not changed since \n1972 is living on another planet.\n  Article XIII of the treaty envisioned possible changes in the \nstrategic situation which have a bearing on the provisions of this \ntreaty. So I wish to just emphasize again as I move forward that there \nare various treaty compliant ways to modify our current obligations \nunder the treaty and we would like to work toward.\n  For those who are upset by the fact that this bill would establish a \npolicy to deploy a multiple-site NMD system, I would point out that the \nABM Treaty signed and ratified in 1972 did permit development and \ndeployment of multiple sites. I would also remind my colleagues who \nseem to fear the prospect of amending the treaty that in 1974 the \nSenate approved a major amendment to the treaty. So we are not \nsuggesting something happened that has not already happened before and \nwe would not suggest doing it for quite some time.\n  Let me also briefly address another provision in the Missile Defense \nAct of 1995 which relates to the ABM Treaty. Section 238, which is \nbased on legislation introduced earlier this year by Senator Warner, \nwould establish a clear demarcation line between TMD systems which are \nnot covered by the treaty and the ABM systems which are explicitly \nlimited. This provision is also consistent with the letter and the \nspirit of the treaty, and I know we will talk more about that later on.\n  Now, with regard to this specific amendment that is pending, I wish \nto commend Senator Kyl for his amendment. How could anybody disagree \nwith it? It says the purpose of this amendment is to state the sense of \nthe Senate on protecting the United States from ballistic missile \nattack. That seemed like a very worthwhile proposal to me. The Senator \nfrom Arizona has clearly demonstrated that there is a real and growing \nthreat to the security of the United States posed by ballistic missiles \nof all ranges. I fully conquer with his sense-of-the-Senate language \nthat all Americans should be defended against this potential limited \nballistic missile attack.\n  This week we will have a lot of debate on this subject and others \nrelated to it. One argument that will surface over and over is that \nthere is no threat to justify the deployment decision of the national \nmissile defense program. The Kyl amendment clearly establishes that \nthis is an erroneous assumption. The United States currently faces \nballistic missile threats from Russia and China, if only the threat of \naccidental or unauthorized attack.\n  Just as important, the missile technologies that these two countries \npossess have ended up or are likely to end up in the hands of countries \nthat would like nothing more than to blackmail, if not attack, the \nUnited States. North Korea has also demonstrated that any country that \nhas a basic technology infrastructure can develop long-range ballistic \nmissiles without providing significant warning.\n  Saddam Hussein, I heard earlier today some Senators kind of seeming \nto brush off Saddam Hussein or what he might do. But he proved to the \nworld that modifying existing missiles is not, you know, something we \nshould take lightly. It can happen. High technology is not needed if \nthe intent is to terrorize, if not directly act.\n  Since we will debate this issue at length, I will limit my remarks at \nthis point. But I do think that the Kyl amendment is a good amendment \nto sort of lay out the parameters of this debate. I hope it will pass. \nI understand there has been a second-degree amendment by the Senator \nfrom Georgia that would put back in the Corps SAM funding at the $35 \nmillion level, as I understand it, which is $5 million more than what \nthe administration asked for. Now, I understand that extra $5 million \nis so we can have a study of the potential problems and where we are \nheaded.\n  My only suggestion would be here that maybe we are kind of getting \nthe cart before the horse. Let us take a look at it and see where the \nproblems are. Let us see how it is developing internationally.\n  Again, I sympathize with what the Senator from Georgia says on the \nfront-line need for this. But I just have to ask if there is not a \nbetter way we can do it. Have we looked at the problems it has? And \nhave we evaluated the fact that this could wind up costing $10 billion? \nI think we will talk about that some more. But again, my disposition on \nthat is let us try to find a way to work it out, if we can. Let us go \nahead and agree to the Kyl basic language and then get to some of the \nspecifics. I think that, generally speaking, Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle in the committee are comfortable with the dollar amounts, but \nwe are still--and I know there will be some amendments to change the \ndollar amounts, but the big question is the policy we are establishing \nhere. We could work on the language. That will allow us to move forward \nwith the agreed-to policy.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Kyl amendment. The \nSenator from Arizona has clearly demonstrated that there is a real and \ngrowing threat to the security of the United States posed by ballistic \nmissiles of all ranges. I fully concur with his Sense of the Senate \nlanguage which states that all Americans should be defended against \nlimited ballistic attack, whatever its origin and whatever its cause.\n  This week we will have extensive debate on this subject and a variety \nof related matters. One argument that will surface over and over is \nthat there is no threat to justify a deployment decision on national \nmissile defense. The Kyle amendment clearly establishes that this is an \nerroneous assumption. The United States currently faces ballistic \nmissile threats from Russia and China, if only the threat of accidental \nor unauthorized attack. Just as important, the missile technologies \nthat these two countries possess have ended up or are likely to end up \nin the hands of countries who would like nothing more than to \nblackmail, if not attack, the United States.\n  North Korea has also demonstrated that any country that has a basic \ntechnology infrastructure can develop long-range ballistic missiles \nwithout providing significant warning. Saddam Hussein proved to the \nworld that modifying existing missiles is not a serious challenge. High \ntechnology is not needed if the intent is to terrorize.\n  Since we will debate this issue at length, I will limit my remarks at \nthis point. Later in the debate I will present a detailed rational for \nthe missile defense provisions in the Defense authorization bill and \nrespond to the many red herring arguments that have been made in \nopposition. Let me close by saying that the Kyl amendment is warranted \nand long overdue. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.\n  This is not star wars but a modest and responsible answer to a \ngrowing threat. After considering all alternatives, the Armed Services \nCommittee felt that the United States should move directly to a \nmultiple-site system, since a single site system would just not be \ncapable of defending all Americans. We felt that it would be \ninappropriate morally and strategically, to select a subset of the \nAmerican population for defensive coverage while leaving some \nundefended.\n  This decision seems even more correct given that the most \nunpredictable and dangerous new ballistic missile \n\n[[Page S11150]]\nthreats will be capable of reaching States like Alaska and Hawaii \nbefore the continent itself becomes vulnerable. I am referring to the \nNorth Korean intercontinental ballistic missile program, the so-called \nTaepo-Dong, which the intelligence community believes could become \noperational within the next 5 years. An NMD system consisting of only \none site in the middle of the United States simply cannot defend Alaska \nand Hawaii, and would not do a very good job of protecting the coastal \nregions where most Americans live.\n  In the area of cruise missile defense, the legislation would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to focus U.S. activities and to coordinate the \nvarious efforts within the Department of Defense. It would require the \nSecretary to integrate U.S. programs for ballistic missile defense with \ncruise missile defense to ensure that we leverage our efforts and do \nnot waste resources through unnecessary duplication. It also requires \nthe Secretary to study the current organization for managing cruise \nmissile defense and recommend any changes that would strengthen and \ncoordinate these efforts.\n  There have been a number of other false arguments raised against this \nlegislation, most having to do with the ABM Treaty. Let me set the \nrecord straight: nothing in this bill advocates or would require a \nviolation of the ABM Treaty. Every policy and goal established in this \nbill can be achieved through means contained in the ABM Treaty itself. \nThe argument that this bill will force us to violate the ABM Treaty is \nlike arguing that one must drive off a cliff just because there is a \nbend in the road. This bill recommends that we gradually, and \nresponsibly, turn the wheel.\n  Let me also say that it is not this bill, first and foremost, that \nforces us to reconsider the ABM Treaty. Such a reexamination is \nwarranted, indeed required, as a result of the end of the cold war, and \nthe growing multifaceted ballistic missile threat characterizes this \nnew era. The ABM Treaty, with its underlying philosophy of mutual \nassured destruction, practically defined the cold war confrontation. \nWhy would anybody argue that we should not reexamine such an agreement.\n  Let us be clear about what this bill in fact calls for. It recommends \nthat the Senate undertake a comprehensive review of the continuing \nvalue and validity of the ABM Treaty. It suggests that the Senate \nconsider creating a select committee to undertake a 1-year assessment. \nWhat we are recommending is a careful examination of all issues before \nmaking a specific recommendation\n to the President on how to modify our current ABM Treaty obligations.\n\n  By establishing a policy to deploy a multiple-site NMD system, this \nbill does assume that eventually we will need to amend or otherwise \nmodify the ABM Treaty. But let me repeat, the means to achieve this are \ncontained in the ABM Treaty itself. The treaty in no way limits the \nestablishment of policies, it limits the deployment of ABM systems. In \nthe case of ground-based systems, the treaty in no way limits \ndevelopment or testing. Therefore, we can proceed simultaneously to \ndevelop the system called for in this bill while we figure out the best \napproach to dealing with the treaty.\n  We should remember that the ABM Treaty was meant to be a living \ndocument that could be changed as circumstances changed. Anyone who \nargues that the strategic and political circumstances have not changed \nsince 1972 is living on another planet. Article XIII of the treaty \nenvisioned ``possible changes in the strategic situation which have a \nbearing on the provisions of this treaty.'' Article XVI specifies \nprocedures for amending the treaty. Article XV specifies procedures for \nwithdrawal from the treaty. As we debate the Missile Defense Act of \n1995, therefore, we must bear in mind that there are various treaty-\ncompliant ways to modify our current obligations under the treaty, \nincluding withdrawal if we are unable to achieve satisfactory \namendments. Talk of violation or abrogation at this time is nothing \nmore than hyperbole.\n  For those who are upset by the fact that this bill would establish a \npolicy to deploy a multiple-site NMD system, I would point out that the \nABM Treaty, as signed and ratified in 1972, did permit deployment of \nmultiple sites. I would also remind my colleagues who seem to fear the \nprospect of amending the treaty that in 1974, the Senate approved a \nmajor amendment of the treaty.\n  Let me also briefly address another provision in the Missile Defense \nAct of 1995, which relates to the ABM Treaty. Section 238, which is \nbased on legislation introduced earlier this year by Senator Warner, \nwould establish a clear demarcation line between TMD systems, which are \nnot covered by the treaty, and ABM systems which are explicitly \nlimited. This provision is also consistent with the letter and spirit \nof the treaty. It simply codifies what the administration itself has \nidentified as the appropriate standard. This provision is required to \nensure that the ABM Treaty is not inappropriately expanded or applied \nin ways and in areas outside the scope of the treaty. In essence, it \nwould prevent the ABM Treaty from being transformed, without Senate \nconcurrence, into a TMD treaty.\n  Mr. President, before yielding let me briefly address one \nparticularly flawed argument that is commonly used against this bill \nand missile defense programs in general. It has been asserted that this \nbill would undermine START II and perhaps even damage broader United \nStates-Russian relations. There is no substantive basis to this \nargument. It is a red herring that has been used by some Russians and \nrepeated by more than a few Americans including the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Fundamentally, this argument is rooted in the cold war. It assumes an \nadversarial and bipolar relationship between the United States and \nRussia. Rather than repeat stale arguments, the Russians and the \nClinton administration, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, should be seeking to change the basis of our strategic \nrelationship to one based on mutual security rather than mutual assured \ndestruction. I would agree with Defense Secretary Perry's recent \nstatement that ``the bad news is that in this era, deterrence may not \nprovide even the cold comfort it did during the cold war.''\n  If we look closely at the argument that this bill undermines START \nII, we see no substantive content. The type of defense envisioned in \nthe Missile Defense Act of 1995 should in no way undermine Russian \nconfidence in strategic deterrence. We must remember that President \nYeltsin himself proposed a Global Defense System and that, in the early \n1990's, the United States and Russia had tentatively agreed to \namendments to the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of five or six ground-\nbased sites. According to\n testimony the Armed Services Committee received earlier this year from \nMr. Sidney Graybeal, who was a senior United States ABM Treaty \nnegotiator, the Russians were not opposed to permitting five or six \nsites in the original ABM Treaty. How is it, then, that today such \ndeployments will upset stability and arms control? It simply will not.\n\n  Of course, we should seek to cooperate with Russia and take into \naccount legitimate security concerns. But this is what START II is all \nabout. That agreement is manifestly in both countries' interest and \nshould not be held hostage to any other issue. Unfortunately, the \nRussians have linked it to a variety of issues including expansion of \nNATO. We must reject this linkage, lest we encourage the Russians to \nbelieve that they possess a veto over a wide range of United States \nnational security policies.\n  Admittedly, START II is in trouble in the Russian Duma, but this has \nnothing substantively to do with the United States missile defense \nprogram. Stated simply, Russian hard-liners are intent on undoing START \nII so they can retain some or all of their multiple-warhead ICBM force. \nThe United States should strongly oppose this effort to undo START II. \nBut legitimizing the false argument about ABM Treaty linkage only \nobfuscates the issue. The United States should not participate in a \nclouding of the issue by repeating Russian arguments about ABM Treaty \nlinkage. This is simply a distraction from the central problem.\n  As we proceed to debate the various aspects of the Missile Defense \nAct of 1995 and consider implications for START II, we should bear in \nmind that \n\n[[Page S11151]]\ntoday the United States has no defense against ballistic missiles. \nRussia, on the other hand, has an operational ABM system deployed \naround Moscow, which has been modernized and upgraded over the years. \nWe should not feel threatened by the existence of this system. Indeed, \nwe should encourage the Russians to invest in this system instead of \ntheir destabilizing strategic offensive forces. Likewise, the United \nStates should develop and deploy a national missile defense system. \nSuch a system would provide greater security for all Americans than an \noutdated theory of deterrence that does not even apply other countries. \nThe Missile Defense Act of 1995 clears the way for a world that is \nsafer and more stable for the United States and Russia.\n  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Georgia if he would like \nto respond.\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes. First, I appreciate all his good work on this bill. He \nhas done a yeoman's job in helping the chairman and all of us on this \nlegislation. I do not think the Senator from Mississippi was here when \nI mentioned we have a total of four systems that are in the bill. Of \nall of those, as the Senator noted, this one could cost a good bit of \nmoney before it is over. The allies hope to pay about half of it. But \nthis is the only system that is designed to protect the front-line \ntroops. The rest of these systems are in the theater support area.\n  We have the Navy upper tier program, which is in this envelope. We \nhave the THAAD intercept program, which is in this green envelope. We \nhave the PAC-3 right in this envelope, and then a possibility of maybe \na Navy lower tier in this envelope.\n  So my point is, this system should not be canceled unless we can find \none of these systems that could also cover this. Now, I believe the \nmajority report indicated that perhaps the PAC-3 system could. I am \nperfectly willing to have that study. That is what the extra $5 million \nis for, is to see if that idea really will be proven to be workable. I \nwould also be willing to have this study take place and hold back some \nof this money. I think that has been suggested by the staff of the \nSenator from Mississippi. We could work on some fencing amendment so we \nmake sure we are getting the best program. I certainly share that, but \nI do not think we should cancel this program when it is the only one, \nuntil we get some affirmative answer, which we do not have now, on \nsomething that could take its place.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator's comments \nthere, I do think there is a possibility that we could do that PAC-3 \nmodification. But we do not know yet that it could provide that \nadditional coverage. We should look into that to see if it can be done. \nPerhaps we can work out a way not to completely cancel the Corps SAM \nwhile we take a look at that. But again, my argument is before we start \ndown this trail that could lead to $10 billion, I think we need to look \nand see if there are other options.\n  I would like some clarification of how we got into this international \nagreement. What is that international agreement? What extent of \ncommitments do we have from our allies about being willing to pay up to \n$5 billion of the cost of this program? There are just a number of \nquestions in that area that I think we need to get clarified.\n  But we will work with the Senator from Georgia as the day progresses, \nand hopefully we can work something out.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Mississippi, each of these other \nprograms is going to involve billions and billions of dollars, also. We \nknow we will not be able to afford them all. We know that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Which one do we not want to afford?\n  Mr. NUNN. Well, right now we have four programs that cover the same \narea, and they are fully beefed up and funded, while the only program \nthat covers the forward battlefield is being canceled. So we have \ntremendous redundancy here. I do not mind some redundancy, because we \ndo not know which of these programs is going to work and be the most \ncost-effective program.\n  But we do not have any redundancy here and no coverage here. The \nproblem is the majority suggestion about PAC-3 possibly covering this \narea. We need to get some funding into a study for that, if that is \ngoing to be done. Perhaps we can work on something while we are \ncontinuing the debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before we went to a vote on any of the \namendments, I just wanted to ask the Senator from Georgia a few \nquestions about his understanding primarily of the Kyl amendment. I \ncertainly support his perfecting amendment as I understand it, and \nbelieve it is well considered. But I have some concerns about the Kyl \namendment, which it is an amendment to. And I wanted to just clarify \nthe thinking of the ranking manager on this bill as to what his \nthoughts were on the import of the Kyl amendment.\n  It seems harmless enough in some respects. When you read it, it says \nit is a sense of the Senate that all Americans should be protected from \naccidental, intentional, limited ballistic attack. I agree with that. \nBut I add to that that we also ought to protect all Americans from \ncruise missile attack, terrorism, and from a variety of other potential \nhazards.\n  I guess my concern is that, as the Senator from Georgia knows very \nwell, and all of us on the Armed Services Committee know, there is \nconsiderable controversy about the provisions in the bill that we are \nnow beginning to debate regarding ballistic missile defense.\n  We have a letter from Secretary Perry to Senator Nunn, and I am sure \nto the chairman of the committee as well, dated the 28th of July, where \nSecretary Perry makes a variety of points or a series of points about \nthis. He says he wants to register strong opposition to the missile \ndefense provisions of the Senate Armed Services Committee defense \nauthorization bill. In his view, they would institute congressional \nmicromanagement of the administration's missile defense program and put \nus on a pathway to abrogating the ABM treaty.\n  I am concerned that I do not want to support the Kyl amendment if it \nputs us on a pathway to abrogating the ABM Treaty. I would be \ninterested in the Senator from Georgia giving me his perspective on \nthat as to whether I could vote for the Kyl amendment with confidence \nthat it was not an endorsement of the various ballistic missile \nprovisions in this bill, many of which I intend to join with Senator \nExon and others to strike here when the opportunity arises.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for an additional question before \nthe----\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from the State of \nGeorgia, I have the same concern about this, basically, as posed in the \nquestion by the Senator from New Mexico. I am for and wish to make a \nshort statement in support of the Nunn underlying amendment.\n  But if I understand the procedures, the Kyl amendment is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution that I would strongly oppose because of its \nimplications, even though it is only a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  What would be the situation if the Nunn amendment in the second \ndegree to the Kyl amendment passes, and then the Kyl amendment itself \nfalls? Obviously, it would take the amendment that I support, offered \nby the Senator from Georgia, along with it, would it not?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I guess we have six or eight questions \nposed to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I am sorry. I must ask the Senator from Nebraska, and I \napologize, if he will repeat that question. He has gotten to be such a \ngood--almost like a lawyer since he has been here. I am sure he can \nreframe that question.\n  Mr. EXON. I resent that statement.\n  Mr. NUNN. I knew the Senator would resent that statement. I said \n``almost,'' not quite. Does the Senator mind repeating that, if he \nwould?\n  Mr. EXON. I was simply saying to the Senator from Georgia, I was \nasking the same basic question just a little differently than the \nSenator from New Mexico. I am strongly in support of the \n\n[[Page S11152]]\namendment by the Senator from Georgia, and would like to make a \nstatement in support of that amendment.\n  As I understand the procedure, though, it is attached as a second-\ndegree amendment to a sense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arizona. I am questioning what the situation would be if \nwe vote on the second-degree amendment, which I support, then vote on \nthe Kyl amendment, which is a sense of the Senate. If the Kyl amendment \nfails, that would take along with it the amendment that I support \noffered by the Senator from Georgia. I am wondering if I properly \nunderstand the procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield for a response from the Senator from Georgia, \nbecause I have two or three other questions I want to ask.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will say first to my friend from New \nMexico, his question was, does the amendment breach the ABM Treaty. We \nare talking about the Kyl amendment now.\n  As I outlined in my opening statement, I feel that the provisions of \nthe underlying bill create what I would call a very high risk that it \nwould be perceived as an anticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty. That is \nthe underlying bill. I do not think there is anything in the Kyl \namendment, and the Senator from Arizona is not on the floor now, but I \ndo not read anything in the Kyl amendment that would either breach the \nABM Treaty or suggest breaching the ABM Treaty.\n  The operative paragraph in the Kyl amendment is the one at the end \nthat says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that all Americans should be \n     protected from accidental, intentional, or limited ballistic \n     missile attack.\n\n  Like the Senator from New Mexico, if I were drafting this, I would \ncertainly add cruise missile in there, perhaps some other threats. I \nsee nothing wrong with the way it is worded in terms of in any way \ncreating the impression that the ABM Treaty would be breached by this \namendment.\n  I also note the paragraph just before the sense-of-the-Senate \noperative paragraph, paragraph 12, page 5 of this amendment says, \nexplicitly:\n\n       The United States and Russia have the opportunity to create \n     a relationship based on trust rather than fear.\n\n  So it seems to me there is nothing in this amendment that would in \nany way breach the ABM Treaty or that would in any way violate the \nconditions that the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Perry, has laid \ndown in his letter.\n  I made a lengthy statement about what my fears were about the course \nthis bill takes, and we will have amendments dealing with that on the \nABM Treaty. So I do have very similar concerns as the Senator from New \nMexico on the underlying bill, but I do not have such concerns on this \namendment.\n  I will also say, if you look at the findings in paragraphs 1 through \n12, I think the findings I generally agree with. Everyone will have to \nread them to see if they agree with them. But the findings I personally \nagree with.\n  I say to my friend from Nebraska, he is correct. If my amendment, the \nsecond-degree amendment, were adopted and became part of this Kyl \namendment, then if the Kyl amendment were defeated, it would take down \nthe second-degree amendment. In that case, what I would do is propose \nit again, and I hope that will not happen. I really believe careful \nreading of the Kyl amendment will not have many people taking exception \nto it. Everyone will have to judge some of the findings.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, can I pose one additional question to \nthe Senator from Georgia? Senator Exon, Senator Glenn, Senator Levin, \nand myself intend to offer an amendment at some stage to strike various \nof the provisions that are contained in this bill at the present time, \nparticularly the ones under subtitle C on missile defense. I think that \nstriking those is totally consistent with the letter we have received \nfrom Secretary Perry.\n  As the Senator from Georgia sees this Kyl amendment, it would not be \ninconsistent for a person to support the Kyl amendment and still vote \nto strike those provisions relative to missile defense when that \namendment comes up?\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from New Mexico, I do not see any \ninconsistency there. As long as the Senator from New Mexico really \nagrees with the bottom paragraph, that it is the sense of the Senate \nthat all Americans should be protected from accidental, intentional, or \nlimited ballistic missile attack, this Kyl amendment does not say how \nthat should be done. It does not refer to the ABM Treaty. It does not \nset up any kind of anticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty. It does not \nsay anything should be done in terms of deployment or testing that \nwould violate the ABM Treaty. It simply states that we would like to \nprotect Americans. So I do not see any inconsistency.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me clarify one more time. My own \nposition is that I do support the existing law with regard to the ABM \nTreaty, which I gather was adopted by us in 1991. And as the Senator \nfrom Georgia reads the Kyl amendment, the adoption of that amendment \nwould be consistent with existing law and with the 1991 language which \nwe put on the books; is that correct?\n  Mr. NUNN. As I read it--I will not pretend to the Senator from New \nMexico that I have made a detailed sentence-by-sentence analysis of \nthis amendment--I read it hastily, I read it again, my staff has read \nit. I see nothing in here that would contravene--in fact, the basic \npremise of this amendment is also the basic premise on which the 1991 \nMissile Defense Act passed, which I coauthored.\n  I see nothing inconsistent in that. Most of the findings in the Kyl \namendment reference various statements Secretary Perry has made or that \nvarious military witnesses have made or simply statements that, for \ninstance, the head of CIA has made and the statements that have been \nadopted, some in conference between the President of the United States \nand the President of Russia. I do not see that it contradicts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate those responses, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nunn amendment, \nthat I just referenced, to make $35 million available to continue the \nfunding on the Corps SAM Program, also known as the MEADS or Medium \nExtended Air Defense System.\n  This program will provide a rapidly deployable, highly mobile 360-\ndegree coverage defense system to protect our maneuver forces against \nshort- to medium-range ballistic missiles.\n  Corps SAM will also defend against a full spectrum of air breathing \nthreats against our troops, including advanced cruise missiles. The \ncommittee decision to terminate this joint NATO program is a mistake. \nCorps SAM will provide missile defense for our troops that other \nsystems, such as the Patriot or the THAAD will not. Corps SAM will have \nthe mobility necessary to advance with U.S. and allied ground forces in \nthe field of battle. Sometimes Patriot's protective umbrella cannot \nprovide this, and certainly not against short-range missiles that would \notherwise underfly the THAAD Missile Defense System, as important as \nthat system might be.\n  Corps SAM is what the Congress has been pushing for for many years, a \ncooperative trans-Atlantic defense program. Pulling out the program now \nwill harm ongoing, as well as future, cooperative ventures with our \nallies. More important, it will deny--I emphasize, Mr. President--it \nwill deny our forces in the field of battle an important layer of \ndefense against missile attack that does not otherwise exist.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this modest addition. At a \ntime when we are unwisely throwing billions of dollars, in my opinion, \non unnecessary full-blown national missile defense systems, I believe \nwe can afford this small investment in the protection of our troops \noverseas in battle conditions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOtt addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wonder if we are perhaps ready to go with \na modification and perhaps a couple of votes on the pending amendments?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have asked the staff to check with the \nleadership. I recommend that we go ahead \n\n[[Page S11153]]\nwith the modification and have a rollcall vote on the second-degree and \non the first-degree amendment.\n  I have talked to the Senators from Mississippi and South Carolina \nabout modifying the pending second-degree amendment which is related to \nCorps SAM.\n  I will soon send a modification of the amendment to the desk. It \nbasically says that we will defer $10 million of the $35 million until \nsuch time as we have the report referred to in subsection (c)(2). That \nis the report, as I explained in my remarks, to determine whether the \nPAC-3 system could basically also cover that unprotected forward area \nthat the Corps SAM system is designed to. This is acceptable to me.\n  Mr. NUNN. Assuming the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina concurs, I will send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2078), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, beginning with ``attack,'' strike out all down \n     through the end of the amendment and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following: ``attack. It is the further Sense of the \n     Senate that front-line troops of the United States armed \n     forces should be protected from missile attacks.\n       ``(c) Funding for Corps SAM and Boost-Phase Interceptor \n     Programs--\n       ``(1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, of \n     the funds authorized to be appropriated by section 201(4), \n     $35.0 million shall be available for the Corps SAM/MEADS \n     program.\n       ``(2) With a portion of the funds authorized in paragraph \n     (1) for the Corps SAM/MEADS program, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall conduct a study to determine whether a Theater Missile \n     Defense system derived from Patriot technologies could \n     fulfill the Corps SAM/MEADS requirements at a lower estimated \n     life-cycle cost than is estimated for the cost of the US \n     portion of the Corps SAM/MEADS program.\n       ``(3) The Secretary shall provide a report on the study \n     required under paragraph (2) to the congressional defense \n     committees not later than March 1, 1996.\n       ``(4) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(4), not more than $3,403,413,000 shall be available for \n     missile defense programs within the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Organization.\n       ``(d) Section 234(c)(1) of this Act shall have no force or \n     effect.\n       ``(e) Of the amounts referred to in section (c)(1), $10 \n     million may not be obligated until the report referred to in \n     subsection (c)(2) is submitted to the Congressional defense \n     committees.''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could comment briefly, our staffs--\nSenator Thurmond's, mine, and Senator Nunn's--have discussed this, and \nI think this is acceptable, from my viewpoint. If the chairman is \ncomfortable with that, it makes the amendment acceptable.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after we \ntake the vote on Senator Nunn's amendment that we take the vote on \nSenator Kyl's amendment, back to back, to save time.\n  Mr. NUNN. Reserving the right to object, I will ask the leadership to \nrespond. I propose that we vote on both of those. I would like to \naccommodate the Senator.\n  I have received word, so I will not object.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the second degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I think we have worked out an agreement that might not \nrequire the introduction of an amendment and second-degreeing it, and \nthat is in the process of being typed, so if we could just have a brief \nquorum call, I think it would be a matter of 2 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to offer the amendment at some point, but \nif \n\n[[Page S11154]]\nthere is an agreement, I can hold off and offer this particular \namendment later in the process.\n  Mr. DOLE. This would not prejudice the Senator's right to offer the \namendment as far as I am concerned immediately after disposition of the \nother two amendments.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would clarify, upon the disposition of the unanimous-\nconsent agreement, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for the \npurposes of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in reference to the pending bill, let me \nencourage my colleagues--I know we have lost a little time here, but we \nstarted on the bill at 9 o'clock. We have had two rather, I guess, \nimportant votes, but one was a sense of the Senate; one was concerning \n$35 million. So this is a big, big piece of legislation. We are going \nto shut her down on Friday night. I hope that we can accept some of \nthese amendments, and others who feel--we are not going to shut down \nthe Senate Friday night; we are going to shut down this bill on Friday \nnight.\n  I hope we can get time agreements on amendments. It seems to me that \nmost have been argued every year for the past 10, 15 years. If we can \nget time agreements, I think it is the hope of the managers, Senators \nThurmond and Nunn, that they can complete action by Friday evening, and \nthen we can go to either Treasury Department appropriations bill or \nInterior. And then, Saturday, we will start on the welfare reform \npackage. Later next week, we will take up the DOD appropriations bill, \nalong with the legislative appropriations conference report, I guess, \nand maybe--depending on Bosnia--maybe a veto override.\n  In any event, I urge my colleagues that if we can cooperate with the \nmanagers, they are prepared to work late late this evening and late \nlate tomorrow night and late late Friday night and would really \nappreciate your cooperation.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be \nrecognized to offer an amendment regarding ethics and that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the Boxer amendment, and immediately \nfollowing that, her amendment be temporarily laid aside and Senator \nMcConnell be recognized to offer an amendment regarding ethics, and \nthat no amendments be in order to the McConnell amendment, and that the \ntime on both amendments be limited to a total of 4 hours, to be equally \ndivided between Senators McConnell and Boxer.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time on both amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on \nor in relation to the Boxer amendment to be followed immediately by a \nvote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object. Perhaps I did not hear it, \nbut is this the unanimous-consent request on the two amendments? May I \nask who will control time?\n  Mr. DOLE. You will control time on that side and Senator McConnell \nwill on this side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Two hours per side. We will debate those simultaneously?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, that is what the agreement says.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to consult \nwith a number of our colleagues, and we find that this unanimous-\nconsent agreement is agreeable, and we would like to proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object. I want to ask one more \nquestion of both leaders. Is a motion to table in order here?\n  Mr. DOLE. Just what the agreement says, ``on or in relation to.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not have a copy of the agreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. ``On or in relation to'' would include a motion to table \non each amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Democratic leader and the other people \ninvolved. I hope this will not take 4 hours. This is another half day \noff of the August recess, which we hope will start sometime in August.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry. Does the Parliamentarian have a \ncopy of the Boxer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a copy here at the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2079\n\n       (Purpose: To require hearings in the investigation stage of \n     ethics cases.)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2079.\n     SEC.   . ETHICS HEARINGS.\n\n       The Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate shall hold \n     hearings in any pending or future case in which the Select \n     Committee (1) has found, after a review of allegations of \n     wrongdoing by a Senator, that there is substantial credible \n     evidence which provides substantial cause to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has \n     occurred, and (2) has undertaken an investigation of such \n     allegations. The Select Committee may waive this requirement \n     by an affirmative record vote of a majority of the members of \n     the Committee.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \ntemporarily set aside, and the Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2080\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2080.\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert:\n       (A) The Senate finds that:\n       (1) the Senate Select Committee on Ethics has a thirty-one \n     year tradition of handling investigations of official \n     misconduct in a bipartisan, fair and professional manner;\n       (2) the Ethics Committee, to ensure fairness to all parties \n     in any investigation, must conduct its responsibilities \n     strictly according to established procedure and free from \n     outside interference;\n       (3) the rights of all parties to bring an ethics complaint \n     against a member, officer, or employee of the Senate are \n     protected by the official rules and precedents of the Senate \n     and the Ethics Committee;\n       (4) any Senator responding to a complaint before the Ethics \n     Committee deserves a fair and non-partisan hearing according \n     to the rules of the Ethics Committee;\n       (5) the rights of all parties in an investigation--both the \n     individuals who bring a complaint or testify against a \n     Senator, and any Senator charged with an ethics violation--\n     can only be protected by strict adherence to the established \n     rules and procedures of the ethics process;\n       (6) the integrity of the Senate and the integrity of the \n     Ethics Committee rest on the continued adherence to \n     precedents and rules, derived from the Constitution; and,\n       (7) the Senate as a whole has never intervened in any \n     ongoing Senate Ethics Committee investigation, and has \n     considered matters before that Committee only after the \n     Committee has submitted a report and recommendations to the \n     Senate;\n       (B) Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     Select Committee on Ethics should not, in the case of Senator \n     Robert Packwood of Oregon, deviate from its customary and \n     standard procedure, and should, prior to the Senate's final \n     resolution of the case, follow whatever procedures it deems \n     necessary and appropriate to provide a full and complete \n     public record of the relevant evidence in this case.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nhours of debate on the Boxer and McConnell amendments, 2 hours under \nthe control of the Senator from Kentucky and 2 hours under the control \nof the Senator from California.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is a big difference between these \ntwo \n\n[[Page S11155]]\namendments. The reason we took a little time on our side looking over \nthe amendment of the Senator from Kentucky is because, at first blush, \nyou think all this sounds good, but when you get to the end of it, you \nlearn quickly that it is essentially a ``feel good'' amendment, a \n``cover yourself\" amendment. It is the ``no public hearing'' amendment. \nIt is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which has no force of law, no \nrequirement.\n  On the other hand, the Boxer amendment, which I believe will have \nstrong support here today, will require that if the Ethics Committee \nwants to close the door on a case that has reached the investigative \nphase where there is credible, substantial evidence of wrongdoing \nagainst the Senator, they need a majority vote to close those doors.\n  I think that is very reasonable. I think the fact that we have a \ndeadlock in this case is very serious. It is the first time in history \nthis has happened. This matter deserves our attention.\n  I also think it is important to note that the amendment of the \nSenator from Kentucky deals with one specific case, the case pending \nbefore it, whereas the Boxer amendment talks to the issue in generic \nterms. In other words, what we are saying is that in every case that we \nvisit this stage, there should be public hearings, unless the committee \nvotes by majority vote to slam those doors shut.\n  Today, the Senate can break the deadlock. It is up to each and every \nSenator to decide that issue. I think the message that has been sent on \na deadlock vote by the Republicans on the Ethics Committee is a message \nthat does not sit well with the American people.\n  Let me read from just a few individuals today. Sometimes I think if \nwe would listen to the voices of America, we can learn a lot. The \nquestion in the USA Today poll of average people: Should the Packwood \nethics hearings be forced open?\n  I will read a couple of these responses. A young man aged 19, a \nstudent in Florida:\n\n       They definitely should be open. He is an elected official \n     and a public servant. People should know what is going on. \n     Government already has a bad name for being secretive.\n\n  A woman, a 32-year-old from Oregon:\n\n       Keep them open to take the mystery out of what is going on. \n     Women have a particular interest and may not be well \n     represented behind closed doors.\n\n  John Larson, 55, a financial planner in Bloomington, MN, says:\n\n       They should be open so the public would have more \n     information about what is going on in Government. Ethics \n     should be on a high level for everybody. Whatever happened to \n     honesty? If we are not honest at the top, what do we expect \n     our young people to do?\n\n  I think the people of America understand this. I just hope and pray \nthat Senators do.\n  As we debate this today, I think we are going to hear very reasoned \nvoices on this side of the aisle. So much for comments that if this was \na secret ballot, 98 Senators would vote against open hearings. That \nnotion will be dispelled here today when we see the kind of eloquence \nwe will see on the floor on this matter.\n  Now, I have to make a point. When the Ethics Committee voted 3-3 and \ndeadlocked, they made a big point of saying, the chairman did, of how \nhe was going to release all the materials in the case. As a matter of \nfact, a couple of the members from the Ethics Committee have said to \nthe press, ``I feel really good. We are disclosing everything.'' Making \npeople believe that there was something unique about this, that the \npapers were being released.\n  Mr. President, if we look over here--I can barely see over this--here \nwe have the pile of materials that have been released in every other \nethics case that has reached this stage. They are always released. They \nhave never been withheld. Papers are always released. This is every \ncase in history--these are the papers that have been released.\n  Of course, that is a precedent. So is public hearings. Every one of \nthese cases also had public hearings. In this case, the doors have been \nslammed shut. I just hope that is a temporary glitch that we can \nstraighten out here today.\n  There are a number of points, I know, that my Democratic colleagues \non the Ethics Committee will make more eloquently than I, because they \nunderstand the precedence of the committee better than I, because it is \ntheir job to serve on the committee, to study the committee, and to act \nin the best traditions of the committee.\n  I have to say, as one U.S. Senator who is going to vote on how to \ndispose of this matter in a fair and just fashion to all concerned, I \ndo not want to base my vote on a stack of papers. I know that the \nSenator in the case had a chance to go before the committee and look \nthem in the eye and explain any discrepancies, in fact, if any; and \nwhen you read the papers, clearly there are. I do not know for a fact, \nbut if you read the papers, there are discrepancies, in fact.\n  Yet, those on the other side have no chance to walk into that room, \nlook in the eyes of the Senators, and tell their story. It reminds me \nof a trial where one side is heard and then they just say, OK, the jury \nshould go in now, sequester itself and vote a penalty.\n  Excuse me, a juror might say, I never heard from the victims. I never \nheard from the victims. Yeah, I read what they said. But the defendant \nhas said No, in certain cases, that is not what happened. I need to \nfind out for myself. That would be a mistrial, and it would be \nunprecedented. That is what we are dealing with here.\n  I cannot believe that some Senators, from what I hear, are going to \nvote against public hearings and cast a vote without all the facts. I \nthink this is something extremely important.\n  Now, I want to point out in my amendment I have bent over backwards \nto be fair to the Ethics Committee. As a matter of fact, it is a very \nrespectful amendment. It says that the committee, by majority vote, can \nvote to close the hearings, and it underscores the fact that rule 26 \nwill allow the committee to protect witnesses if they decide that must \nbe done.\n  We are in no way in this amendment being disrespectful of the Ethics \nCommittee. We are being respectful of the Ethics Committee.\n  For some to say Go away and never comment, would be a dereliction of \nconstitutional responsibility of each and every Senator, if you read \narticle V, section 1, that says, ``We are responsible in this Congress \nto police ourselves.''\n  Here we have an unprecedented circumstance where, for the first time \nin history, a case that has reached the investigative stage will not \nhave public hearings. And then we must ask ourselves the next question: \nWhy? Why? That is the question.\n  The question is not about Senator Boxer or any other Senator, or \nabout what the record is in the House in holding hearings. The question \nis, why would the Republicans on the Ethics Committee vote not to \nproceed to public hearings when every single time in history--and it \ngoes back to the day the Ethics Committee was formed--there have been \npublic hearings.\n  I want to say, there were some who said, ``Wrong, Senator Boxer, \nthere were not any on this or that case.'' I will ask to have printed \nin the Record the dates of every public hearing, of every single case. \nYou cannot argue with the facts. This would be the first time.\n  When you answer that question--why--the only thing I can think of are \na few responses. One is, protect this particular Senator from something \nwe never protected any other Senator from. The second is, it is \nembarrassing. Well, that is no answer, Mr. President. The Senators \nshould have thought of that before.\n  Is the message that if you do something and it is embarrassing, there \nwill not be public hearings? That is a swell message to send. That is \nthe message that is being sent unless we break the deadlock here today.\n  I was going to quote from Senator Bryan, in his letter that he sent \nwhen five Senators were concerned about this matter, but he is here and \nrather than quote him, I know he will have much to say on the subject.\n  But I want to personally thank the courage, the courage of the Ethics \nCommittee members who were fighting hard in a very difficult situation \nfor what is justice and what is right. What the Republicans have done \nby voting against public hearings is a miscarriage of justice any way \nyou slice it. The best face you can put on it is a miscarriage of \njustice to allow the Senator to come before the committee and not allow \nthe victims--and not allow factual differences to be explored by \n\n[[Page S11156]]\nthe committee. That is wrong. And if Senators want to hide behind a \nfeel-good amendment, a sense of the Senate that does nothing on this \nmatter, so be it. So be it. But let there be no mistake, that is what \nwe are facing: An amendment that says there shall be public hearings \nunless a majority vote says no by the committee; and a feel-good \namendment that is a sense of the Senate that does nothing.\n  Mr. President, it has been a very long road for me to get to this \npoint, and it has been a harsh road, and it has taken many turns, some \nof them quite personal. But I am so honored that I am a Member of the \nU.S. Senate and that, because the people of my State sent me here and \nbelieve that I have a right to be here, that is all it took for me to \nhold my ground. You cannot be intimidated when you know you are doing \nwhat you think is right. So this has been, in many ways, a very \nimportant debate, just getting to this point.\n  In concluding my remarks, before I yield 30 minutes to the vice \nchairman of the Ethics Committee, Senator Bryan, let me summarize. \nThere are four main reasons to support public hearings in this case.\n  First of all, honor Senate precedent. Do not make an exception in one \ncase. That is a very perilous path, because the message that it could \nsend is: The more embarrassing the transgression, the more protected \nyou will be. And if it is sexual misconduct, you can count on it being \nbehind closed doors. And that is wrong, not only to the women of this \ncountry, but to their husbands, to their sons, to their fathers, to \ntheir uncles. We are all in this together.\n  Second, public hearings will clarify the issues that are in dispute.\n  Third, it is a question of fairness. The Senator got his chance to \nappear before the committee. The accusers did not.\n  Finally, we should fully air our problems. This is not a private \nclub. This is the people's Senate, and we ought to act that way and \nopen up the doors. We can handle it. My God, the Republicans voted for \nhearings and hearings and hearings and hearings on Whitewater, on \nFoster, on Waco. I voted with them. Open up the doors. Do not let \nproblems fester. But do not suddenly close them when it comes to sexual \nmisconduct. That is wrong, and a terrible signal for us to send.\n  Mr. President, I yield 30 minutes to the distinguished and eloquent \nvice chairman of the committee, Senator Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I firmly support the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from California. For more than six decades, \nthe U.S. Senate has held public hearings on all major ethics cases. The \ncommittee counsel again confirmed this fact to each member of the \ncommittee earlier this week at our Monday meeting. So there can be no \nmisunderstanding, what Senator Boxer seeks to accomplish with the \namendment she is offering this afternoon is to continue that unbroken \nprecedent of public hearings.\n  I embrace this position after considerable reflection. I can assure \nmy colleagues that no one is more anxious than I to have this matter \nconcluded without further delay. My service as chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee for 2 years, and more recently my service as vice chairman \nover the past 7 months, has not been a pleasant experience.\n  Yet, I am firmly convinced that public hearings are essential if the \nintegrity of the Senate and of the ethics process are to be sustained. \nThere are many reasons to hold public hearings. There is no credible \nreason to make an exception in this one case.\n  On May 17, the Ethics Committee released the charges it was bringing \nagainst Senator Packwood. The Ethics Committee found substantial \ncredible evidence providing substantial cause for the committee to \nconclude that Senator Packwood may have engaged in a pattern of sexual \nmisconduct between 1969 and 1990, and may have engaged in improper \nconduct and/or violated Federal law by intentionally altering \nevidentiary materials needed by the committee; and may have \ninappropriately linked personal financial gain to his official position \nby soliciting offers of financial assistance from persons who had \nlegislative interests.\n  Following its rules, the committee then offered Senator Packwood an \nopportunity to appear before the committee to make a statement and to \nanswer committee questions. That occurred over a 3-day period, from \nJune 27 to June 29.\n  In addition, Senator Packwood was also offered his right to a \nhearing, which would involve cross-examination and appearances by those \nwho had brought the charges against him. He declined this opportunity.\n  When the Senate returned from the Fourth of July recess, it was the \npoint in the process for the committee to make a decision on what else \nneeded to be done in the final investigation and final stage, including \nthe all-important question as to whether or not public hearings should \nbe held; in other words, to complete the evidence phase.\n  On July 31, the Ethics Committee voted on the question of holding \npublic hearings. The committee was split, deadlocked at 3-3.\n  So here we are today with a deadlock in the committee. In my view, it \nis entirely appropriate that the question now come before the full \nSenate for its determination.\n  I want to address the question of delay which has been raised. There \nis, in my view, no delay or improper interference with the committee \nprocess for the Senate to debate and vote on an amendment as to whether \npublic hearings should be held.\n  In fact, this is the proper time for the Senate to make that \ndecision. Otherwise, the committee will move ahead on making the \ndecision on sanctions without holding customary and traditional and, in \nmy opinion, needed hearings.\n  As for the delay in completing this case, I am confident the \ncommittee can hold public hearings, bring this case to the Senate, and \nthe Senate can resolve it without undue delay. I have suggested we put \na time limit on the hearings, say, no more than 3 weeks. During those 3 \nweeks, we can call witnesses the committee needs to hear, we can hear \nfrom them in person, we can examine their demeanor, we can test their \nbelievability. We can attempt to resolve discrepancies in previous \ntestimony and to give to the alleged victims--the point made by the \ndistinguished Senator from California--the same opportunity that \nrightfully we extended to our colleague from Oregon, who faces these \naccusations; in effect, to give the victims their opportunity to be \nheard.\n  I would like to put the process in some perspective, if I may. We \ndeadlocked on the decision for public hearings. The committee, after \nthat deadlock, did vote to release all relevant evidentiary materials \nto the public.\n  Some have suggested this is an unprecedented action. I assure my \ncolleagues, this is consistent with the practice followed in the past; \nnamely, that all evidentiary material is released.\n  I asked that this material be released as soon as possible, as \nopposed to waiting until after these proceedings are concluded, and the \ncommittee agreed. The committee counsel has told us it would take about \na week to compile and print the documents.\n  I fully support the release of all evidentiary materials, as did each \nand every member of the Ethics Committee.\n  However, the release of all evidentiary materials is not and cannot \nbe a substitute for public hearings. I can tell you unequivocally that \nthere is a world of difference between reading a transcript and holding \na hearing.\n  Release of the evidentiary material has been standard operating \nprocedure in all previous major ethics cases, the same cases where \npublic hearings were held. Release of all evidentiary material is the \nprecedent. The release of all evidentiary material was done in the \nseven major ethics cases that the Senate has dealt with in this \ncentury. Indeed, if the Ethics Committee had not voted to do what it \ndid yesterday, it would have broken yet another precedent in this one \ncase.\n  What was done by the decision of the Ethics Committee earlier this \nweek to release the evidentiary materials is a minimum public \ndisclosure standard. I do not believe that the U.S. Senate wants to be \njudged by a standard of minimum public disclosure. I believe the \nappropriate standard is public disclosure and is consistent with the \nhistory and the practice of the Ethics \n\n[[Page S11157]]\nCommittee. That requires public hearings.\n  I would like to briefly run through some of the reasons why I think \npublic hearings are important--indeed, necessary--in this case. And I \nwould suggest to my colleagues that this will be one of the most \nimportant ethics votes that will be cast in this session of Congress, \nor perhaps in their congressional careers.\n  First, the precedent of the ethics process has been to hold public \nhearings in every major ethics case in this century. As you know, those \nof you who have served on the Ethics Committee were often guided by \nprecedent just as courts are in legal matters. Indeed, few decisions \nare made by the committee without first inquiring of the staff to state \nthe precedent or case history. The precedent on the question of holding \npublic hearings is clear. The committee has always held public \nhearings.\n  Since 1929, seven Senators--Senators Bingham, McCarthy, Dodd, \nTalmadge, Williams, Durenberger, and Cranston--have been the subject of \ndisciplinary proceedings on the floor of the U.S. Senate. All first \nfaced public hearings. The pending case against Senator Packwood has \nnow moved into the final investigative phase. Since the three-tiered \nethics process was adopted in 1977 setting up the investigative phase, \npublic hearings have been held in all four cases--Talmadge, Williams, \nDurenberger, and Cranston--matters which reached this very serious \nstage.\n  Let me briefly review the major cases.\n  In 1929, the Hiram Bingham hearings were held between October 15 and \nOctober 23 on charges of employing on his committee staff an employee \nof a trade association which had a direct interest in legislation then \nbefore the committee.\n  In 1954, the celebrated Joe McCarthy hearings began August 31 and \nended on September 13 on charges of obstructing the constitutional \nprocess.\n  In 1966, the Dodd hearings of March 13 to 17 on charges of converting \npolitical contributions to personal use.\n  In 1978, the Talmadge hearings, 27 days of hearings between April 30 \nand July 12 on charges of submitting false expense vouchers and misuse \nof campaign funds.\n  In 1981, the Senator Harrison Williams hearings were held, July 14, \n15 and 28, on the question of misuse of his official position to get \nGovernment contracts for a business venture in return for a financial \ninterest.\n  In 1989, Durenberger, June 12 and 13, hearings on charges of \naccepting excess honoraria and illegal reimbursement of personal living \nexpenses.\n  In 1991, in the Keating matter, in which only the Cranston case \nentered the investigative phase, had 26 days of hearings beginning on \nOctober 23, 1990, on conduct which linked campaign fundraising and \nofficial activities.\n  There were no other ethics cases which entered the investigative \nphase or which came before the Senate for a proceeding. In short, there \nhas been no exception in holding public hearings in any major ethics \ncase in this century.\n  I suggest that is the standard by which the Senate ought to act today \nin supporting the Boxer amendment which seeks to continue that unbroken \nprecedent.\n  Second, I ask myself: Is there some reason, some compelling or \npersuasive reason, as to why we ought not to hold a hearing in the \nPackwood case in light of the fact that there has been a clear and \nundeniable precedent?\n  I have given that considerable thought. And I must say I can find no \njustifiable reason for not holding a hearing in this case. I have heard \nno credible reason offered from any of my Senate colleagues.\n  I would ask you to ask yourself: Why would we make an exception in \nthis one case? I do not think by and large you will be pleased with the \nonly answer that I believe exists, and that is, the Senate does not \nwant to hold public hearings in this case because it deals with sexual \nmisconduct. In my view, that is not a persuasive reason to depart from \nour honored tradition of the past.\n  Third, I think this case presents an even more compelling reason for \nholding public hearings because of the alleged victims. This, to the \nbest of my ability to review the record of the ethics process in the \nSenate, is the first case in the history of the Senate in which there \nare alleged victims that have come forward and filed sworn charges \nagainst a U.S. Senator for actions that have been directed against them \nindividually and personally.\n  This is a case of first impression on two aspects--because they are \nalleged victims and because of the finding of substantial evidence of \nsexual misconduct. From a public credibility standpoint, there should \nbe no doubt about the need to hold public hearings on a matter of this \nmagnitude.\n  What message will the Senate be sending to those who have come \nforward in this case or anyone who dares to come forward in the future? \nIf there are victims, we do not want to hear from you, so we will close \nthe door? Mr. President, that is the standard that we invite if we \ndecline to hold public hearings in this case.\n  Fourth, this is not just a question of the future of one Senator. \nThis decision speaks to the fundamental question of whether the Senate \nas an institution is capable of disciplining its Members and itself in \na manner which merits public confidence. This is far more important \nthan any one of us individually.\n  In the most recent serious ethics case before the Senate, the so-\ncalled Keating case, all six Ethics Committee members voted to hold \npublic hearings--Senators Heflin, Pryor, Sanford, Rudman, Helms, and \nLott.\n  In the opening statements of the first day of those hearings, no \nSenator was more eloquent nor more persuasive nor more to the point \nthan our colleague Senator Lott, who said it best in focusing on the \nneed for hearings for the sake of public credibility of the \ninstitution, when he said:\n\n       It may be necessary to hold these public hearings if for no \n     other reason than to remove the cloud that has come over the \n     Senate and to clarify the basis for decisions on whether \n     violations of laws or rules have occurred. These proceedings \n     will mean that the public will have a full opportunity to \n     hear and view for itself the evidence in each case.\n\n  I wish I were so eloquent. That is, in my view, a compelling and \nriveting reason for the public hearing process in this case and all \ncases which reach this stage in the ethics process.\n  This debate is not based upon ideological division. Four Christian \npro-family groups have called for hearings. Gary Bauer of the Family \nResearch Council told the Hill, a newspaper publication, on June 7, and \nI quote:\n\n       We are an organization that talks about values . . . I've \n     urged my Republican friends that the party ought to err on \n     the side of being aggressive in removing any cloud over it. \n     These charges are serious enough to warrant full hearing and \n     investigation.\n\n  Eight women's law or advocacy groups have called for public hearings. \nNine of the women who have made charges to the Ethics Committee have \npublicly called for hearings.\n  Let me comment here on an objection which some have made to holding \npublic hearings. I am afraid I think it is more of an excuse rather \nthan a reason. It is argued by some that we should not hold public \nhearings because we need to protect the women who have filed charges. I \npoint out again that 9 of the 17 women have called for hearings. I am \nnot aware that any of the others have expressed opposition.\n  I am not unmindful of the need to protect victims.\n  In order to protect women who come forward with complaints of sexual \nmisconduct I asked the committee to adopt the principles of the Federal \nrape shield law. As the author in 1975 of Nevada's State rape shield \nlaw, I feel strongly about these principles. Rape shield laws are \ndesigned to protect victims of sexual misconduct from unfair cross \nexamination when there are attempts to inquire into the most personal \nand intimate relationships totally unrelated to the current allegation.\n  There is no issue which should be before the committee or the Senate, \nnor should any other issue be referred to by any Senator or anyone \ninvolved in this case, except the issue of the specific allegation made \nby a woman against Senator Packwood.\n  The issue of public hearings, some have tried to claim, is strictly \nan issue within the beltway. To the contrary, editorials from \nnewspapers throughout the country, every geographical region, have \ncalled for public hearings.\n  USA Today, July 14:\n\n       Open the Packwood hearings; this isn't a personal matter\n\n\n[[Page S11158]]\n\nread their headline. And the editorial went on to say,\n\n     No doubt public testimony about such acts may prove \n     embarrassing. But the Senate can be shamed only if it tried \n     to deal with the allegations behind closed doors.\n\n  Cincinnati Enquirer, July 1:\n\n       So why the soft glove treatment and protection for Senator \n     Packwood? Perhaps the mostly male, starched-shirt proper \n     Senate is embarrassed or scared at being criticized and \n     scrutinized over this matter.\n       The way Packwood's alleged exploits are being treated by \n     the Senate, there's room for suspicion--suspicion that could \n     be quelled if the hearings were open.\n\n  Charlotte Observer, May 26:\n\n       As committee members move to the next phase of the Packwood \n     case, the public is watching how they treat their own.\n\n  San Francisco Chronicle, May 19:\n\n       The system has worked and the process should now move to \n     the final, necessary stage . . . the public forum for which \n     Packwood has so often pleaded.\n\n  Atlanta Constitution; June 10:\n\n       Word has it around the Capitol that the Senate Ethics \n     Committee is under considerable pressure to spare the upper \n     Chamber, and perhaps Packwood himself, the embarrassment of a \n     public inquiry. . . . Some Packwood allies are hopeful of \n     arranging a settlement, presumably including some sort of \n     penalty, so as to avoid a messy hearing and clamor for \n     Packwood's ouster. . . . He's entitled to the best defense he \n     can muster, but that must be a public defense if he is to \n     minimize suspicions of favoritism.\n\n  A fifth reason for public hearings is that the hearings will build \nupon the evidence already before the committee, and give committee \nmembers an opportunity to listen to and see the reactions of witnesses \nfirsthand, not just read a report, and also ask questions to follow up \non earlier interviews by our committee counsel.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know a little about evidence. I know that \nsometimes when a witness faces a jury in person, he or she provides \nadditional information or gives additional insight from what can be \ngathered from reading a written report.\n  I know that if there are conflicting explanations, I want to question \nall parties in person about those conflicts.\n  I am familiar with the depositions of the women who have made charges \nof sexual misconduct. However, in the interest of fairness and judicial \nprudence, they should be given the right to come before the committee, \njust as Senator Packwood was given that right.\n  It is equal justice that we seek here. We are rightly concerned about \nbeing fair to our colleague who is being charged by others. We need to \nbe fair to those who have come forward at considerable personal risk \nthemselves and who have made very specific allegations and seek the \nopportunity for a public hearing.\n  Some reports today are stating the committee hearings will be in \nprivate. Let me correct that impression. The committee voted to hold no \nhearings, public or private, not to hear in person from anyone involved \nin this case except Senator Packwood.\n  So those are the reasons, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that \npublic hearings should be held. First, it has been the precedent of \nthis institution in major ethics violations for this century.\n  Second, I know of no justifiable reason for not holding public \nhearings. The only answer that has been suggested is that somehow the \nSenate ought to avoid embarrassment because this issue deals with \nsexual misconduct. I believe that is unacceptable rationale.\n  Third, this is a case of first impression in which we have victims \ncoming before the Senate Ethics Committee and hopefully to be heard by \nthe entire Senate and the American people who have made sworn charges \nagainst a U.S. Senator for actions directed against them. And this is \nalso the first time the Senate will judge a Senator who has been \ncharged by the Ethics Committee with sexual misconduct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Chair reminds the Senator that \nhe has spoken now for 30 minutes and the Senator from California could \nyield more time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I have 3 more minutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Fourth, the credibility of the institution to deal with \nthis issue is very much irreparably damaged without public hearings.\n  Fifth, as I have indicated, I think each of us needs an opportunity \nto evaluate credibility.\n  I will conclude by noting: What kind of message does the Senate want \nto send to the citizens we serve? This is really our opportunity to \nsend a message to the American people that fits the message they sent \nto each of us last November. The public expects their Government to be \nopen and to hold Members accountable to a proper standard of behavior. \nThe message the Senate risks sending today, however, is that in \ndisciplinary matters involving Members, we have chosen to retreat and \nto close the door tighter than it has ever been before.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be happy to yield for a question. I only have a \ncouple more minutes, so if I am abrupt with the Senator, I do not mean \nto be rude.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am concerned about whether there is \nany issue of material fact--I do not know what the Senator can tell me \nabout that. I know there is some privilege. But can the Senator tell me \nwhether there is an issue of material fact which by having a hearing \nthe Senate would be further instructed as to the different sides of \nthat material fact?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me just respond as I have tried to do in my statement \nthat I believe the Ethics Committee, the Senate, and the American \npeople would be further enlightened if we heard the testimony of the \nwitnesses. I cannot get into the specifics of the evidence, but I must \nsay that this is not in my view a circumstance in which nothing is to \nbe gained by holding public hearings because I believe there are points \nat issue that, indeed, would be clarified.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Just one further question. Has Senator Packwood \npublicly pleaded guilty in effect to the charges? Does the Senator know \nwhether that is so?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I do not believe--I think the answer to that is no.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BRYAN. In terms of public statements, those would be for each \nSenator to interpret.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask the manager of the amendment for \nthe majority if he is interested in taking any time to discuss this \nmatter?\n  The point is I do not want to use all the time up on our side, but \nwant to see if there are any speakers on the other side.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two \nimportant documents here which I believe go to the question of finding \nof fact that the Senator from Louisiana spoke of. In other words, his \nconcern is, is there a need to have hearings to figure out if there are \ndiscrepancies?\n  In an AP story, an Associated Press story that was reprinted in one \nof the newspapers on July 29, Senator Packwood is quoted as saying:\n\n       If there was a hearing, we'd finally have a right to \n     question the complainants. We've been unable to do that.\n\n  So I think that sentence alone says to me that there are differences \nof fact. And second, there is documentation from a ``Nightline'' \nappearance that I was on with Senator Simpson in which Senator Simpson \nsays:\n\n       If they want to come forward in a public hearing, they got \n     to get their right hand up and be cross-examined with the \n     rules of evidence. The last one,\n\nmeaning women,\n\n     made moves on Bob Packwood. You'll find that in the \n     deposition.\n  Now, this raises a lot of other questions, but it certainly raises \nthe issue that there are differences of fact here.\n  The point made by the Senator from Nevada, who is very careful on \nwhat he says on this floor--I am only amplifying his answer by showing \nyou two very important statements, one by Senator Packwood himself \nquoted in the AP story, the other by Senator Simpson which indicates \nthat there is, in fact, a dispute over what occurred.\n  And I now ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record at \nthis time. They are identified as the actual words from the \n``Nightline'' appearance and the AP wire story.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11159]]\n\n\n              [From ABC News ``Nightline'', July 27, 1995]\n\n                  The Dawdling Packwood Investigation\n\n(This transcript has not yet been checked against videotape and cannot, \nfor that reason, be guaranteed as to accuracy of speakers and spelling. \n                                 (JPM))\n\n       Announcer. July 27th, 1995.\n       Sen. Mitch McConnell, (R), Chairman, Select Ethics \n     Committee. This has been the mother of all ethics \n     investigations.\n       Chris Wallace [voice-over]. The sexual misconduct \n     investigation into Senator Bob Packwood: why won't the Ethics \n     Committee conduct public hearings?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer, (D), California. I don't want to tell \n     the Ethics Committee what to do, I want them to do the right \n     thing.\n       Paul Jigow [sp?]. The demand for a public hearing is real \n     low-ball, hardball politics.\n       Chris Wallace [voice-over]. Tonight, the Packwood \n     investigation; is it a case of the old boys' network looking \n     after one of its own?\n       Announcer. This is ABC News Nightline. Substituting for Ted \n     Koppel and reporting from Washington, Chris Wallace.\n       Chris Wallace. The veil of decorum in the U.S. Senate was \n     pulled back ever so slightly today in a debate over what to \n     do about Bob Packwood. While maintaining all the practiced \n     civilities of the Senate floor, the Republican head of the \n     Ethics Committee, Mitch McConnell and a Democratic freshman \n     from California, Barbara Boxer, were very politely sticking a \n     shiv in each other. McConnell said the Ethics Committee \n     wasn't about to be pushed around in deciding to deal with the \n     Packwood case. Boxer said she respects the committee, but if \n     it doesn't decide to hold public hearings on its own, she \n     will bring the issue to the Senate floor.\n       Ever since the Clarence Thomas hearings, there's been a \n     charge that the Senate--made up overwhelmingly of white \n     middle-aged men--is insensitive to issues of sexual \n     misconduct. Now, as the Packwood case is well into its third \n     year, and so far, all the proceedings have been behind closed \n     doors, that charge of insensitivity is being heard again. As \n     ABC's Michel McQueen reports, the investigation of one \n     senator is now putting some heat on all of his colleagues.\n       1st former Packwood Staff Member. There was no warning. He \n     suddenly grabbed me by the hair and forcefully kissed me, and \n     it was very hard to get him off.\n       2nd former Packwood Staff Member. He stood on my feet, \n     pulled my hair, pulled my ponytail, my head back, was \n     forcefully trying to kiss me, and with his other hand----\n       3rd former Packwood Staff Member. In his offices, did grab \n     me at the shoulders and kiss me forcefully.\n       Michel McQueen, ABC News [voice-over]. There isn't much \n     doubt about what he did.\n       Sen. Bob Packwood, (R), Oregon. [NBC, 1992] My actions were \n     just plain wrong, and there is no other, better word for it.\n       Michel McQueen [voice-over]. The question has always been \n     what to do about it.\n       [on camera] For two and a half years, the Senate Ethics \n     Committee has investigated charges that Republican Bob \n     Packwood of Oregon repeatedly harassed the women around him, \n     and then tried to tamper with evidence to cover it up. In \n     May, the Ethics Committee issued a finding that there was \n     substantial credible evidence to warrant a formal \n     investigation, the equivalent of a pretrial indictment or \n     charge. But little has happened since then, and many people \n     are getting impatient.\n       [voice-over] Last week, Senator Packwood's accusers and \n     some of the congresswomen who support them held a press \n     conference.\n       Rep. Nita Lowey, (D), New York. Let me be very clear. The \n     women of America will not tolerate politics as usual. We will \n     not tolerate politics as usual in the good old boys' club. We \n     will not stand for another Anita Hill. Whether it's in the \n     Senate or in the office, the American people understand that \n     sexual harassment is a serious abuse of power.\n       Michel McQueen [voice-over]. What the lawmakers and many of \n     Senator Packwood's accusers want are public hearings to air \n     the allegations against him. An Oregon women's group paid for \n     this ad in The Washington Post, designed by Democratic media \n     consultant Mandy Grunwald.\n       Mandy Grunwald. For 40 years, the Ethics Committee has had \n     public hearings every time they've found credible evidence. \n     They put out a public report saying they found credible \n     evidence of abuse of office tampering with evidence, and 17 \n     counts of sexual misconduct. I think getting these things out \n     in the open is appropriate, I think actions should have \n     consequences, and he should be held accountable.\n       Michel McQueen [voice-over]. The battle was joined on the \n     Senate floor last week when five women senators [Boxer, \n     Moseley-Braun, Feinstein, Murray, Snowe] led by California \n     Democrat Barbara Boxer, strongly urged the Ethics Committee \n     to hold public hearings.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer, (D), California. I have written the \n     Ethics Committee and informed them that if no public hearings \n     were scheduled by the end of this week--and that means the \n     end of today--I would seek a vote on the matter by the full \n     Senate.\n       Michel McQueen [voice-over]. Senator Boxer's demand \n     triggered threats to reopen past Democratic scandals, and \n     complaints about her respect for protocol.\n       Sen. Bob Dole, Majority Leader. Well, I believe in the \n     integrity of the committee process. I don't believe that \n     every time a senator doesn't like\n      what the committee does, they come out with some motion.\n       Michel McQueen [voice over]. Senator Boxer, who is not a \n     member of the Ethics Committee, said Senate rules and the \n     precedent set by previous cases demand public hearings.\n       Stanley Brand [sp?]. The line of precedent is unbroken on \n     the fact that this stage of the procedure occurs in a public \n     hearing.\n       Michel McQueen [voice over]. Stanley Brand is a former \n     Democratic counsel to the House of Representatives. He now \n     represents both Democrats and Republicans before the ethics \n     committees.\n       Stanley Brand. It really has nothing to do with partisan \n     politics. These have been the rules through both Democratic \n     and Republican control of the House and Senate, and in fact, \n     these committees are evenly split along party lines, to \n     prevent partisanship from taking control, if you will.\n       Michel McQueen [voice over]. Not so fast, says Wall Street \n     Journal editorial writer Paul Jigow.\n       Paul Jigow. What we're seeing here is the politics of \n     ethics. If you don't have an issue, you can use personal \n     politics, personal foibles of politicians. It was elevated to \n     an art form in the 1980s against people like John Tower, \n     Clarence Thomas, and in Bob Packwood's case, it's being used \n     again, not to say that there's not real allegations here, but \n     the public hearing aspect, the demand for public hearing, is \n     real low-ball, hardball politics.\n       Michel McQueen [voice over]. Whether it was politics or \n     process, the argument erupted on the Senate floor today \n     between Ethics Committee chairman Mitch McConnell and Senator \n     Boxer.\n       Sen. Mitch McConnell. This has been the mother of all \n     ethics investigation. It is also the first full-fledged \n     investigation of sexual misconduct ever conducted in the \n     Senate. Although allegations of sexual misconduct were \n     leveled against two other senators in the past, the committee \n     dismissed both of these cases rather than proceed to an in-\n     depth inquiry.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. I'm glad that the committee is meeting, \n     but I'm not backing off one bit. If they don't vote for \n     public hearings, I'll be back here with an amendment, so \n     let's keep the wheels turning.\n       Michel McQueen [voice over]. Senator McConnell said that \n     the committee would resume its work on the Packwood case next \n     week, after what he called a ``cooling-off period.'' But \n     there was no word on how the committee will handle the \n     question of public hearings. This is Michel McQueen for \n     Nightline, in Washington.\n       Chris Wallace. When we come back, we'll be joined by one \n     senator who's defending Senator Packwood's right\n      to private hearing and by another who's pressing for them to \n     be made public. [Commercial break]\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Alan Simpson is a supporter of \n     Senator Packwood's attempt to have his hearings held in \n     private. He joins us now from our Washington bureau, as does \n     Senator Barbara Boxer, the Senate's most vocal supporter of \n     public hearings.\n       Senator Boxer, let's start with this issue of public \n     hearings. The Ethics Committee has conducted a thorough \n     investigation, they've issued what amounts to a tough \n     indictment. Why not let them finish this matter in private? I \n     mean, what good does it do either the Senate or Bob Packwood \n     to have a public spectacle?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer, (D), California. What I want is for the \n     Ethics Committee to do the right thing, and the right thing \n     is what ethics committees have always done in the entire \n     history of the United States Senate, and that is, when you \n     get to this phase of an investigation where there is \n     credible, substantial evidence that a senator has committed \n     wrongdoing, that there are public hearings. It's the way the \n     Senate has always been. And by the way, I think it's \n     important to note, even with that, the Senate, under Rule 26, \n     could close those hearings if there was a sensitive matter or \n     to protect a witness, so I think I'm just being very \n     reasonable and, frankly, conservative, because that's what \n     the ethics committees have always done throughout Senate \n     history.\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Simpson, this is a public official \n     charged with misconduct. Personally painful as it may be, \n     doesn't this have to be conducted out in the open?\n       Sen. Alan Simpson, (R), Wyoming. Well, let's let the Ethics \n     Committee finish their work. They're not finished with their \n     work, and this is unprecedented, that a member of the Senate \n     would ask and try to go past the Ethics Committee. If that \n     ever happens, I can tell you who'll be the losers. The losers \n     will be those who in the minority of the U.S. Senate, \n     Election time comes, just roll one up and fire the shot, and \n     let'em dig out from under the rubble. I'm not suggesting that \n     we go--that we don't have private or public. I'm just saying \n     let them finish their work, and Senator Boxer said that on \n     the floor in November of '93, let them finish their work.\n       Chris Wallace. But Senator Simpson, isn't this the point at \n     which the committee has to decide, or the Senate has to \n     decide, whether or not to hold hearings, in private or in \n     public?\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. But that will come when the committee \n     has finished their work. If you allow a single senator to \n     subvert the process at this point, the only losers will be \n     those who are in the minority. Senator Boxer's party is in \n     the minority. Can you imagine what happens if this gets done? \n     I can tell \n\n[[Page S11160]]\n     you, there are plenty of people on our side who, in a personal \n     vendetta, would simply file grievances and reports against \n     Senator Boxer. Then, when we're in the minority, that's the \n     purpose of the Ethics Committee.\n       Chris Wallace. But Senator Simpson, let's not get bogged \n     down in the procedural issue. Let's talk about the\n      actual decision as to whether to hold public or private. You \n     favor private hearings, do you not?\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. I have--I have never--I have never \n     objected to public hearings. I say let the Ethics Committee \n     finish its work. I know you'd like me to say that I don't \n     want them to have public hearings, but I don't know.\n       Chris Wallace. No, I want you to say whatever you--whatever \n     you feel, Senator.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. I just believe that the Ethics Committee \n     should finish its work. If you--if you shortcircuit the \n     investigatory process right now, you're--you're dooming the \n     U.S. Senate. That's what you're doing.\n       Chris Wallace. Let me ask you about this, Senator Boxer, \n     because since you called for public hearings, some of your \n     Republican colleagues have warned about possible \n     repercussions. In fact, Senator Simpson took you aside the \n     other day off the Senate floor. What did he----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. No, that's not true. I never warned \n     Senator Boxer at all. I have the highest regard for her, and \n     respect. We don't agree with things, but you can ask her--\n     she's here----\n       Chris Wallace. Well, I just----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson [continuing]. I never warned her about--\n     --\n       Chris Wallace [continuing]. I was just trying to, Senator.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson [continuing]. No, but I get offended by \n     that, because that didn't happen. I've already written a \n     letter about the reporter that reported it that way.\n       Chris Wallace. Well, Senator Boxer, what--whether it's a \n     warning or whatever he said to you, what did Senator Simpson \n     say?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, Senator Simpson and I are \n     friends, and he gave me some friendly advice. The friendly \n     advice was, essentially, to lay off. And I have to say this. \n     I find it offensive. I had----\n       Chris Wallace. To lay off?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer [continuing]. The advice. Because I \n     think it's wrong, I think, to tell a senator to back off when \n     she thinks something is important. I'll tell you what's \n     unprecedented, not a senator making a view known on an \n     important issue like this; what's unprecedented is that, in \n     fact, in fact, we already had Trent Lott, who is a leader of \n     the Republicans in the Senate, say he favors private \n     hearings. It's no great secret that Mitch McConnell, the head \n     of the Ethics Committee, favors private hearings. Listen, I \n     wasn't born yesterday. That's where it's moving. That would \n     be a change in precedent, and that would be wrong. The Senate \n     is not a private club, as much as some would like to see it. \n     It is the people's United States Senate, and we cannot sweep \n     these things under the committee room rug, and that's exactly \n     where this was going unless I had spoken up, and I'm really \n     proud that I have.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Well, let's get the record straight. I \n     never said to Barbara Boxer to lay off, and Barbara Boxer was \n     a member of the House of Representatives while they did five \n     of these kind of hearings, and she never once asked for a \n     public hearing, and voted on the rules to prohibit public \n     hearing.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. That's incorrect. That is incorrect.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Well I can read and write, too.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, that is so incorrect, that--in \n     1989 we changed the rules in the House to force public \n     hearings, and in the two sexual misconduct cases that came \n     before me, Chris, what I did is vote for tougher penalties, \n     and that was against a Democrat and a Republican. But what \n     happens is, when you're winning an argument, my mother always \n     taught me, your opposition is going to change the subject. I \n     am not the subject. The subject is can the Senate police \n     itself, and will they, in this one case, make an exception \n     and close the doors? That would be wrong, and I'm not going \n     to be intimidated.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Well----\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Simpson, let me ask you, there have \n     been reports--and we're asking you about them so you can tell \n     us if they're true or not--that you and other Republicans \n     have suggested that if Barbara Boxer goes ahead with her call \n     for public hearings on Packwood, that the Republicans might \n     have public hearings on every Democratic scandal since 1969. \n     First of all, did you say it?\n       Sen Alan Simpson. No, I've never said that. I think that'd \n     be a real mistake. I heard 'em mention Ted Kennedy. I heard \n     'em mention Tom Daschle. I think those things would be a real \n     mistake. But I'll tell you one thing we could do. We could go \n     back just as far as the statute of limitations on these cases \n     in every other jurisdiction in America, and the longest one \n     is three years, and they're back in 1969 on this one. How \n     many of--in the people in this audience can pass that little \n     test, as to what they were doing in 1969?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. And remember, he was not charged with \n     sexual harassment, it is sexual misconduct. You want to get \n     back to the real specter of this, Anita Hill and Clarence \n     Thomas, remember that Anita Hill never charged Clarence \n     Thomas with sexual harassment, either.\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Simpson. Senator Boxer, we have to \n     break in here for a moment, but when we return, I want to \n     bring up the Hill-Thomas hearings and ask you just how \n     enlightened the Senate is these days when it comes to matters \n     of sexual misconduct, and we'll be back in just a moment. \n     [Commercial break.]\n       Chris Wallace. and we're back now with Senators Alan \n     Simpson and Barbara Boxer.\n       Senator Boxer, you were elected to the Senate in the wake \n     of the Clarence Thomas hearings, and there was some feeling \n     then that a lot of senators, quote, ``Didn't get it,'' when \n     it came to matters of sexual misconduct. Are we still seeing \n     some of that here in the Packwood case?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, I have to say that we are, \n     although I'm very hopeful, because now that Senator Bryan, \n     who's the vice chair of the committee, has called for \n     meetings, and Mitch McConnell agreed today that they will \n     vote to have public hearings, but let me tell you this. \n     Supposing they vote not to, and it's a 3-3 deadlock, 'cause \n     there's three Republicans and three Democrats, and they\n      don't move forward, and this is the first time in history, \n     as I've said, that they would have closed hearings. What \n     is the message? That if you violate ethics and it has to \n     do with mistreating women that you get the privacy behind \n     closed doors to look at those charges? I think that would \n     be awful. If it's embarrassing, the more embarrassing it \n     is, the more it's behind closed doors? And I think it's \n     important to note that the charges against Senator \n     Packwood where the committee found substantial credible \n     evidence in three areas, not just sexual misconduct, but \n     tampering with evidence, and then trying to get his wife a \n     job so, presumably, he could lower his alimony payments, \n     and going to lobbyists, those are the charges that are \n     before us here. They're serious, and the last one was in \n     1990, in terms of the sexual misconduct, so it isn't that \n     it just was in 1969.\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Simpson, is this, as some have \n     charged, a case of the boys' club protecting one of its own?\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. No, you know, that's really old stuff. I \n     have a mother, a wife and a daughter, one of whom has been \n     subjected to much more than anything I ever heard in the \n     Anita Hill issue or this issue. This is absurd. This is a--an \n     elitist, sexist statement, and it's not true.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, you don't know what happened in \n     this issue, Senator Simpson.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. I do know what happened to people in my \n     own family, and I do know----\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. No, I said----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson [continuing]. That this man has not been \n     charged with sexual harassment, and sexual harassment, as a \n     statute of limitations, is three years in every other \n     jurisdiction in America.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. The women haven't had a chance to come \n     forward before the committee. Senator Packwood has----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Well, I'll tell you, there are going to \n     be a couple of 'em that won't want to come forward, and the \n     last one, which was the charge--\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, what does that mean?\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Just what I said. If they want to come \n     forward in a public hearing, they got to get their right hand \n     up and be cross-examined with the rules of evidence. The last \n     one made moves on Bob Packwood. You'll find that in the \n     deposition.\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Boxer?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, I'm just saying this. In every \n     single case that has come before the Senate Ethics Committee, \n     we've had public hearings. In every single----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. That's not true.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer [continuing]. In every single case. I \n     put that in the record today. The vice chairman of the \n     committee has stated that, Richard Bryan, very well-\n     respected. It's been stated by Senate historians. I am not \n     partisan. The amendment that I plan to offer if, in fact, we \n     don't get the hearings, just says, in every case, be it \n     against a Democrat or a Republican, if it gets to the stage--\n     --\n       Chris Wallace. Senator----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Barbara's gonna get----\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer [continuing]. If it gets to the stage \n     where there's substantial credible evidence, there should be \n     public hearings.\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Simpson, I want to ask you about the \n     last comment you made, because there was a lot of feeling \n     after the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings that in some \n     sense--and this part of, I think,the anger of some people on \n     one side, you would certainly say--was a feeling that some \n     Senate members tried to make Anita Hill, through cross-\n     examination, tried to make her into the transgressor. What \n     you seem to be saying is, if this becomes public hearings, \n     there's going to be a kind of fierce cross-examination of \n     some of Bob Packwood's accusers.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Of course there will. What do you think \n     happens in these kind of situations where you're trying to \n     destroy a person? People get destroyed in the process. Is \n     anyone so out of that they don't understand that?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, you know----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Barbara Boxer is going to have her \n     chance too anything she wants, bring up any amendment, bring \n     up any argument, tear the joint down, tear it up, but not \n     until the committee is through with their work.\n\n[[Page S11161]]\n\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Simpson, you know, for all the talk \n     about issues of sexual misconduct and enlightenment and all \n     that, is this just pure politics? Is this just Democrats \n     looking for a way to embarrass a big Republican and \n     Republicans looking for a way to sweep it under the rug?\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. I don't know, but I do know this that my \n     friend from California is a highly partisan individual. She \n     has said remarks on the floor since she come here, and \n     they're hard, and I know hard politics, 'cause I do it \n     myself. But Barbara Boxer is one of the toughest partisan \n     shooters in this building.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Well, first of all----\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Boxer, is it just politics?\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. This is ridiculous. I already showed \n     you where, when I was in the House and the Ethics Committee \n     was too soft on a Democrat who I felt committed sexual \n     misconduct, actually worse than that, I voted for a tougher \n     penalty. My amendment isn't aimed at Bob Packwood. It is a \n     generic amendment that just says we shall have public \n     hearings in any case that gets to the stage of the \n     investigation. I am stunned to hear my colleague say some of \n     the things he has said tonight, turning the tables on this \n     situation, making women look like they're the problem. Here--\n     --\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. See, there's the argument, there it \n     goes.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer [continuing]. No, well, Alan----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Now you're getting the argument.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer [continuing]. Well, Alan, Alan, if you \n     would give me a chance.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. I've heard that one.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. You bet you have.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Yeah, you bet.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. And you're going to hear it again, and \n     here's what it is.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Well, I've heard it enough.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Here's what it is. Well, one more time, \n     just for the road.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Yeah, well, trot it out one more time.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. One more time for the road. The fact \n     is, Mitch McConnell and his Republicans on the Ethics \n     Committee, Richard Bryan and his colleagues on the Ethics \n     Committee, found substantial credible evidence.\n       That's a very high level of proof----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Yes.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer [continuing]. That there was wrongdoing. \n     It is time for the light to be shined on this matter, so that \n     senators know how to vote, so that the public can understand \n     it. Today we learned the vast majority of the American people \n     agree they ought to have a chance to know more about this. \n     After all, we are not a private club, we are not a country \n     club where guys put their feet on the table, light up a \n     cigar, and disguise it.\n       Chris Wallace. Senator Simpson, you've got 30 seconds for \n     the final word.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Well, that's pretty sexist. I've been in \n     these a lot, you know, and I know that finally they flee to \n     this one about bald white guys that don't understand \n     anything, and really, I practiced law for 18 years, I \n     understand an awful lot about sexual issues.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. You sure do.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. And molestation.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. You do.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. And rape and incest, that's what I did \n     in my practice, so I've heard all that guff before. Let's get \n     down to the point. This senator is going to have her chance \n     to do whatever she wishes when they finish the investigation, \n     and there was only one charge of sexual misconduct in the \n     last 13 years, and if that's a pattern, I'll buy the drinks.\n       Chris Wallace. Well I think we're going to have to leave it \n     there, but I think I'd point out, as a point of information, \n     Senator Simpson, that I think there were a half-dozen \n     allegations of sexual misconduct----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. No, there were not. In the last----\n       Chris Wallace [continuing]. In the--during the course of \n     the '80s.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson [continuing]. Thirteen years, one.\n       Chris Wallace. I know, but there were a lot in between '80 \n     and '83, so the question----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Yeah, but in the last 13 years, one.\n       Chris Wallace. Well, you can divide it where you want to.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. Yeah, I will divide it.\n       Chris Wallace. Sentor Simpson----\n       Sen. Alan Simpson. It's called fairness.\n       Chris Wallace [continuing]. Senator Boxer, thank you both \n     very much for joining us.\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer. Thank you.\n       Chris Wallace. And I'll be back in just a moment. \n     [Commercial break]\n       Chris Wallace. Tomorrow on 20/20, an exclusive interview \n     with David Smith. Barbara Walters talks with the ex-husband \n     of convicted murdered Susan Smith. That's tomorrow, on this \n     ABC station.\n       And that's our report for tonight. I'm Chris Wallace in \n     Washington. For all of us here at ABC News, good night.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, July 29, 1995]\n\n               Packwood Sees Benefits to a Public Hearing\n\n       Washington.--While not endorsing the public hearings being \n     demanded by Democrats, Sen. Bob Packwood said Friday they \n     would give his lawyers their first chances to cross-examine \n     some of the women accusing him of sexual and official \n     misconduct.\n       ``If there was a hearing, we'd finally have a right to \n     question the complainants. We've been unable to do that,'' \n     the Oregon Republican said in an interview with The \n     Associated Press.\n       Packwood's lawyers earlier told the Senate Ethics Committee \n     that the senator would not exercise his right to ask for a \n     public hearing. The senator refused Friday to say whether he \n     wanted a public hearing.\n       ``It's up to the Ethics Committee to decide whether there \n     is anything to be gained by that. I'm not sure any new \n     information would be gained,'' Packwood said.\n       Two Democrats on the panel, Richard Bryan of Nevada and \n     Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, have called for public \n     hearings. Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposes \n     the idea.\n       Packwood said he would make clear in any hearing that most \n     of the allegations were more than a decade old.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is there anyone on the other side who wishes to take some \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right now, there is no one to answer that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is no one to answer that. I say to my colleagues \nthat this is a very important debate that is going on. And I think in \nfairness we ought to go back and forth, side to side, here. I find it \nvery strange, given all the criticism of this Senator's amendment in \nthe press, personally, publicly, every which way you could send a \nmessage to somebody, that they are not here to talk about it.\n  But in any event, at this time I am going to yield 30 minutes to the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. I thank the Senator who has \nsponsored the resolution for yielding me this time.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the Boxer resolution. The purpose of this \nresolution states: ``To instruct the Select Committee on Ethics of the \nSenate to hold hearings on certain allegations of wrongdoings by \nMembers of the Senate.'' I want to commend Senator Boxer for her \nefforts in pursuing this issue. Senator Boxer has been persistent and \nclear. She says we must hold public hearings in order to defend the \nintegrity of the U.S. Senate and follow its historic precedent. I agree \nwith her purpose.\n  I regret that some have made Senator Boxer the issue. Senator Boxer \nis not the issue. And I would like to compliment Senator Boxer on her \nstamina and on her strength in resisting the abuse that has been hurled \nat her because she wishes to exercise her prerogative as a Senator and \noffer legislation on the floor. I compliment her that she refused to \nhave her voice silenced on behalf of defending the women who have been \nthe victims in this ethics proceeding. As we both know, whenever women \nare assaulted, battered, they themselves are always made to look like \nthey are the problem rather than the victim. So I thank Senator Boxer. \nI thank her for not having her voice silenced, and I thank her for \noffering an amendment to ensure that the voices of the women are not \nsilenced.\n  And I say that because as we look at what has been happening, we now \nsee that as a Member--as it currently stands, the voices of the women \nwill be silenced. As a member of the Ethics Committee, I voted to \nsupport public hearings in the Packwood case. Unfortunately, that \nmotion failed on a 3 to 3 vote, strictly on party lines. I wanted \npublic hearings to occur because I felt it was important for the honor \nand integrity of the U.S. Senate. I also voted to release all relevant \ninformation to the public as soon as physically possible.\n  Let me clarify that this release of information is the usual practice \nof the Ethics Committee. It is neither unusual nor is it unprecedented. \nIt is the committee's customary practice that this type of information \nhas been released to the public in the seven major cases in this \ncentury--involving Senator Hiram Bingham, Senator Joe McCarthy, Senator \nThomas Dodd, Senator Herman Talmadge and Senator Harrison Williams, as \nwell as Senator David Durenberger and Senator Alan Cranston.\n  I want to emphatically state that I do not believe that the release \nof this information is a substitute for public hearings. I do not \nbelieve that it is in lieu of public hearings. And, also, it is \n\n[[Page S11162]]\nnot a proxy for public hearings. It is the minimal acceptable form of \ndisclosure.\n  Now, why is this not a substitute for public hearings? As my \ncolleagues know, I am always for public hearings, public hearings to \nprotect the honor of the Senate and because it is important to give \nvoice and value to the charges brought by women. These women are the \nfirst actual victims ever to bring complaints against a U.S. Senator to \nthe Ethics Committee. It is the case of first impression. And if we \nsilence them now on the issue of sexual misconduct, will victims ever, \never again bring a charge to the Ethics Committee because they believe \nthey will be treated as the problem or that they will be silenced \nbecause of the kind of vote that we saw?\n  I voted for public hearings because I wanted to be sure that women \ngot a fair shake and that they got a fair shake in the U.S. Senate, \nthat, as we know, when again women are ever assaulted, battered, or \nabused they are told to be silent or there is institutional forums to \nbe silent. I want to assure them that their voices were not silenced, \nthat they were treated with respect and dignity, that their allegations \nwere taken seriously and would have value.\n  I never met these women. I have only heard their stories through \ndepositions, affidavits, and through the summaries of their \ntestimonies. I do not want their stories to be filtered. I also did not \nhave a chance to personally hear the other witnesses, whether it was \nrelated to diary tampering or solicitation of jobs for Senator \nPackwood's wife to have a job to lower the alimony. I did hear Senator \nPackwood's statements.\n  There has been no opportunity to cross-examine or ask questions of \nthe women or other witnesses in this area of investigation. I did not \nget to talk to the women. I did not get to talk to the lobbyists that \nSenator Packwood spoke to about a job for his former wife. I did not \nget a chance to talk to the woman who has been typing Senator \nPackwood's diary for all of these years and whether, in fact, there has \nbeen diary tampering and why. Because that is the way the committee \nworks.\n  The committee first functions like a grand jury. We listen to the \nissues and concerns through depositions, through affidavits. And then \nwe come to a conclusion. Is there substantial, credible evidence to \npresent a bill of particulars to the U.S. Senate? We did do that. Now \nwe have to decide whether there is clear and convincing evidence on \nthose allegations to determine the sanctions. Now, how can we decide \nwhether something with a higher standard of evidence is clear and \nconvincing unless we follow the practice that has been done by the \nSenate in each and every one of those cases? That is the purpose of \npublic hearings.\n  I also believe that the public hearings will help restore the honor \nand integrity of the U.S. Senate. We all know the American people have \nlittle confidence in their elected representatives and little \nconfidence in the institution of Congress. They do not believe that we \ncan police our own. The American people believe that, given a choice, \nwe will always protect our own at the expense of others. They believe \nwe meet in backrooms, behind closed doors, cut the deals, circle the \nwagons to protect our own. We must demonstrate by our actions this is \nnot so. And this is why we need public hearings.\n  Now, I lived through the Anita Hill debacle. To many, the Senate did \nnot deal fairly with Miss Hill's allegations. The Senate trivialized \nwhat Miss Hill had to say. Anita Hill was put on trial and treated very \nshabbily. She was shamed here in the U.S. Senate. And the institutional \nbehavior of the U.S. Senate raised questions whether this institution \ncould ever deal with allegations related to sexual misconduct.\n  Now, I want the American people to believe that we can act \nresponsibly, and we do that not with words, but with deeds, and the \nmost important deed we can do today is to vote for the Boxer resolution \non public hearings.\n  I support public hearings because it will allow all of us, Members of \nthe Senate and the American public, to judge for ourselves what has \nhappened, to show that we can hold hearings that are neither a \nwhitewash nor a witch hunt. No matter what we decide, the full Senate \nand the American people have a right to know the facts on these cases, \na right to know how we arrived at those facts and reached our \ndecisions. And they should have confidence that we have done the right \nthing.\n  Now, why do the arguments against hearings not hold up? Some say this \nwill be a spectacle. I say it is going to be a spectacle if we do not \nhold public hearings. No matter what the Senate decides, I believe that \nthere will be a public forum held on this matter.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We need to have a fair format, to make sure the format \nand tone is fair for the victims telling their stories, and a fair \nformat for Senator Packwood. Public hearings are the best way to ensure \nthat there is no spectacle and that all parties are treated fairly. s\n  To say that those hearings will debase and sensationalize the Senate \nand that the Senate will compete with the O.J. trial--hey, let me say \nthis. No one seems very concerned about the Whitewater hearings \ndebasing the U.S. Senate. No one seems concerned that the Whitewater \nhearings are debasing the Presidency.\n  No one seems very concerned about debasing the Congress through the \nWaco hearings. Nobody seems very concerned that at the Waco hearings, \none of the purposes is to demean another woman, the Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  Nobody seemed to be concerned when a Senator stood on one side of the \naisle and chanted, ``Where's Bill? Where's Bill?''\n  No one seemed concerned about the Senate when another Senator stood \non the floor and sang ``Old MacDonald Had a Farm,'' concluding with \n``oink, oink, oink.''\n  Well, there is a question about where the barnyard really is.\n  So I think we should stop these arguments that are filled with \nfallacy. If we want to honor the Senate, let us follow its historic \nprecedents.\n  I think we further debase the Senate if we do not hold these \nhearings, precisely because citizens have come forward, they believed \nin us, they believed in the process, and the procedure. This is the \nfirst time that citizens have come forward and made statements about \nmisconduct, the first time victims have come and asked us to listen to \nthem, to allow them to tell their story, and this must occur.\n  Let me be clear, a public hearing at this point in the proceedings \nhas been the practice of the Senate. If the Senate does not hold public \nhearings in this matter, the Senate would deviate from its own \nprecedent.\n  In every case where the Ethics Committee has reached the \ninvestigation stage, where the Packwood case now stands, there have \nbeen public hearings. Those cases were Senators Tom Dodd, Herman \nTalmadge, Harrison Williams, David Durenberger, the cases involving \nCharles Keating--Senators DeConcini, McCain, Riegle, Glenn, and \nCranston.\n  Let me be clear that in this case the Ethics Committee found \nsubstantial credible evidence of misconduct and has moved to the \n``investigation'' stage.\n  This resolution sets forth the committee findings in three areas: \nSexual misconduct, diary tampering, and jobs for Mrs. Packwood.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what the committee members found. We \nfound substantial credible evidence that Senator Packwood may have \nengaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct spanning 20 years, 18 \ninstances involving 17 women. Let me give an example, just so it \nrefreshes everybody's memory.\n  Out of our bill of particulars, we found substantial credible \nevidence that in the basement of the Capitol, he walked a former \nstaffer into a room, where he grabbed her with both hands in her hair \nand kissed her, forcing his tongue into her mouth.\n  We also found that in his Senate office in DC, he grabbed a staff \nmember by the shoulders, pushed her down on a couch and kissed her. \nWhen the staffer tried to get up, he repeatedly pushed her down.\n  In the Capitol, he grabbed an elevator operator by the shoulders, \npushed her to the wall, kissed her on the lips, followed her home, \ntried to kiss her and elicit her to engage in an intimate relationship.\n  I cannot bring myself to read more of these cases on the floor of the \nU.S. \n\n[[Page S11163]]\nSenate, but I think if you read the bill of particulars, you will see \nwhat this is.\n  Then we find there is a strong possibility that Senator Packwood \ntampered with his diaries; that he fought the committee 1 year--1 \nyear--and this is why it has taken so long.\n  Then there are the allegations he improperly solicited job offers for \nhis former wife so he could reduce his alimony payments.\n  All I see for the Senate to do is what it has done before, to hold \npublic hearings in a case where we also found substantial credible \nevidence of misconduct, to then determine what is clear and convincing \nso we can come to what sanctions we need to recommend to the Senate. \nHearings will allow all of us--Members of the Senate and the American \npublic--to judge for ourselves what happened.\n  No matter what we decide, the American people have a right to know \nhow we reached our decision. They should have confidence in us that we \ndid the right thing.\n  As we try to then judge for ourselves what happened in the Packwood \nmatter, know today when this vote is taken, it will be the Senate that \nwill be judged and the criteria will be: Can the Senate police its own? \nCan it follow its precedent, and can it do its business in an open, \npublic, fair format?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Maryland has 15 \nminutes left.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I reserve my time for later on in the debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that means I will hold that time for the \nSenator from Maryland; is that appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California controls that \ntime.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will reserve that time for my friend.\n  Let me just say to my friend from Maryland, who for so long carried \nissues for the women of this country, in many ways by herself that her \ncourage and her conviction and her sense of fairness pervade this \ninstitution. I know how lonely the fight can get, and I was not nearly \nas lonely as the Senator from Maryland was for a long time. So I want \nto thank her.\n  Mr. President, I note there is not one Republican on the floor, \nexcept the good Senator in the chair. I wonder whether or not the \nRepublican Senators would yield me additional time, because I have a \nnumber of people who wish to speak and it does not appear that any \nRepublicans wish to speak. There is much debate in the media.\n  I see now the manager. I was going to ask the manager of the \namendment, if he did not have many speakers if he would yield me an \nadditional 30 minutes of time, because I have more speakers than I \nthought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from California, I understand her \nrequest, but I am going to have to reserve the 2 hours for this side \nand hope that she will be able to work everybody in under the agreement \nthat we entered into.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator have speakers at this time to take any \ntime?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator will be using the time or controlling the \ntime, and that is his prerogative.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My question is, does the Senator have any speakers at \nthis time? Does the Senator from Kentucky have any speakers at this \ntime?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have said three times that I have 2 \nhours under my control under the unanimous-consent agreement. I was \ntrying to respond to the request from the Senator from California. I \nbelieve I did that. I retain the 2 hours for this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was trying to find out in the spirit of \nrunning this place if the Senator had any particular speakers at this \ntime, I would defer. How much time does the Senator from California \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty-two minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 5 minutes to the good Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I especially thank \nthe Senator from California, Senator Boxer, for her courage and \ntremendous leadership on this issue, a painful issue but something that \nabsolutely has to come before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, let me say how much I admire the work of the Senator \nfrom California, the courage, really, in this case. This is a hard \nthing to do. It is a hard thing to have to come before this collegial \nbody and force an issue about public hearings that I think just \ncomports with the common sense of every American.\n  As I look out at the room and see no one--no one--from the other side \nprepared to speak, I wonder if this is really a debate at all. Several \nof us have already spoken. The Senator from Maryland made a very \neloquent, clear presentation; the Senator from Nevada; the Senator from \nCalifornia; others here are ready to speak.\n  What I understood was that they were going to have a back-and-forth \ndebate for the American people to see about whether or not we should \nhave public hearings in this Packwood case.\n  I recognize that this is a very emotional and painful matter for \nevery Member of the U.S. Senate. These kinds of charges and the \nappropriate response by this institution is something that no one can \nenjoy considering. We are uncomfortable with the subject of the \ncharges, with the task of judging one of our colleagues and with the \ntaking of responsibility as a body with what is the proper format for \ndealing with this issue.\n  For some, Mr. President, there is a tremendous desire to just let the \nEthics Committee decide whether there should be public hearings. Some \nsay let Senator Packwood make the decision. Some say let someone else \ntake responsibility for this difficult question.\n  Mr. President, as the Senator from California pointed out so well, \nthis is really an abdication of our responsibility to the American \npeople and to the countless number of women and, yes, men, who have \nbeen the victims of the kind of conduct which is alleged to have been \ncommitted in this case.\n  The question before this body today is not whether Senator Packwood \nis guilty, not whether the punishment proposed fits the alleged \nmisconduct; the question, rather, is whether those who have alleged \nthat they have been the victims of misconduct should have the right to \na public hearing in which they have the opportunity to present their \nevidence and be heard.\n  I am pretty sure, Mr. President, if Senator Packwood had requested a \npublic hearing to clear his name or his reputation, there is little \nquestion that these women would be required to present public testimony \nsupporting their charges. There could be no doubt of that, as I know \nthe Senator from Maryland is very aware. Yet, Mr. President, in this \ninstance, it is apparent that the Ethics Committee intends to break \nwith a longstanding tradition of holding public hearings when a case \nreaches this stage of the proceedings.\n  Our current rules provide for a three-tiered process for examining \nallegations of misconduct. First, the preliminary inquiry; second, \ninitial review; and, third, the investigative stage. A case reaches the \ninvestigative stage only if there is substantial, credible evidence \nthat misconduct has occurred. Heretofore, when a case reached this \nstage, every time public hearings have taken place, even before the \ncurrent system was adopted, public hearings have been held in cases \ninvolving serious allegations of misconduct. Yet, Mr. President, \nsomehow, despite this history, the Ethics Committee is currently \ndeadlocked on whether to order such hearings.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has an obligation to make a decision on \nwhether such hearings should be held. We should not try to hide behind \nthe Ethics Committee for excuses that we should not interfere with its \nprocesses. The Senate, as a whole, is responsible for establishing what \nare fair procedures--fair to those directly involved and fair to the \nAmerican public.\n  So, Mr. President, as we look at this whole picture here, with all \nthe Senators on this side ready to speak and debate, the Senators on \nthe other side not even present, I ask, what is the image that is being \npresented in an institution that prefers to conduct its \n\n[[Page S11164]]\nbusiness behind closed doors, an institution that believes that \nscandalous charges should not be publicly discussed, even after its own \nfactfinding body has determined that there is substantial, credible \nevidence to support those charges?\n  Mr. President, let me repeat that phrase: Substantial, credible \nevidence to support the charges. This is not a request for a public \nhearing on every libelous or baseless charge made against any elected \nofficial. This is a request only for public hearings in a case which \nhas advanced to the final stages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator that his 5 \nminutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator. Now we are asking the American \npublic to allow the Senate to make its decision on this case behind \nclosed doors, without public testimony. Little wonder that the public \nis so disillusioned about our political process. We are so concerned \nabout protecting the image of this institution that we seem to forget \none big thing, and that is that we are a public entity that is \nresponsible to the American public. This is not a private club where \nthe rules are made to please ourselves or to protect ourselves from \npublic scorn.\n  The charges are sexual misconduct. There is little doubt but for the \nnature of the charges, the public hearings would have been scheduled \nquickly. That has been the practice of the past. We do ourselves no \ngreat service by this debate.\n  We should not seek to hide this matter behind closed doors. Public \nhearings should take place, and obviously the committee has the \nauthority to close those portions of the hearings that would be \nprejudicial, or otherwise be appropriately closed. But to say that no \npublic hearings at all should be held in this matter because of the \nnature of the charges is just plain unacceptable.\n  Across America, countless women are watching how this institution \nhandles this matter. What is the message we send to those women who \nhave been subjected to sexual misconduct if we refuse to air those \ncharges in a public format? What are we telling our daughters about \nwhat can happen if you are the victim of this kind of misconduct and \nbring charges against a powerful person?\n  So, Mr. President, the Senate should go on record now, today, making \nit clear that this institution is prepared to hold its disciplinary \nprocess up to the plain light of day and to public scrutiny.\n  I again thank my colleagues on the floor, and especially the Senator \nfrom California for her persistence in this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I asked for 3 minutes because there is \nreally no one to debate. I do not want to use up any more time on this \nside.\n  I voted for and support public hearings in the case of Senator \nPackwood.\n  There are two values to which I hold fast as a U.S. Senator: fairness \nand accountability. This is the commitment I have made to Minnesotans \nwho sent me here.\n  Refusing to hold public hearings on this matter runs contrary to \nthese values and what, I believe, the American people expect of this \ninstitution. Given the committee's refusal to hold public hearings, I \nam very concerned about the message we are sending to the public.\n  We are now in the final investigative stage where there is precedent \nin the Senate for public hearings on ethics cases. It is time to move \nforward.\n  Shining the light of day on Senate proceedings is very important. I \nvoted for public hearings because it is important to show that this \ninvestigation has not been held behind closed doors. While I commend \nthe committee for unanimously voting to release all relevant documents, \nit is not sufficient. There simply is no substitute for full and open \nhearings at this stage of the proceedings before the committee and then \nthe Senate are called upon to render our judgment about this case. I \nbelieve full and open hearings will help to ensure the public's \nconfidence that we can--and will--police the conduct of Members--we \nhave that responsibility.\n  It is also important to give voice to the charges brought by these \nwomen. I believe each of these women should have the opportunity to \ncome before the committee to tell their story and I believe Senator \nPackwood should have that same opportunity.\n  I feel strongly today that this is the right course. Let us honor the \nvalues of fairness and accountability. Let us move forward with public \nhearings.\n  Mr. President, I really came down to the floor for this debate, first \nof all, for a personal reason, which is to support my colleague from \nCalifornia. Senator Boxer is a friend, and I very much admire her \ncourage. And I have some indignation--the same indignation that Senator \nMikulski from Maryland has--about some of the attacks on a Senator who \nhas been persistent and has had the courage to speak up, and whom I \nthink has been a most effective Senator representing not just women, \nbut men, really people all around the country. Because to me, Mr. \nPresident, the issue is just one of accountability.\n  At this final investigative stage, I think it is very important for \nall the parties concerned--for all the parties concerned--and I think \nit is very important for the U.S. Senate, that we now have a public \nhearing. It seems to me that there are important, compelling questions \nto be answered. I know that this process will be fair.\n  I do not believe anybody in this Chamber is pleased about where we \nare right now. It is painful for everybody. But we cannot have this \nkind of hearing at this stage of the process done privately. We cannot \nhave it done behind closed doors. It really will serve no good purpose. \nIt will serve no Senator well, and it certainly will not serve any of \nus well, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, or men or women.\n  Therefore, I am in strong, strong support of the Boxer amendment. I \nthank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I will retain the remainder of my time for the Senator \nfrom California, who is managing her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time do I have now, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California controls 52 \nminutes 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not see any Republican Senators on the floor to \nengage in a very important debate that involves the constitutional \nresponsibility of each and every Senator. I am very disappointed in \nthat.\n  I have many Senators who wish to speak. At this time, I will yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, who has been \nsuch a leader on issues such as this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to address the amendment \noffered by the Senator from California. First of all, I want to commend \nmy friend, my colleague from California. She has been aggressive, \nforthright, and true to her principles on the issue currently pending \nbefore the Ethics committee. She has raised very difficult, but I \nbelieve very important, questions to which all of us must give very \nserious thought.\n  This has been a very long and very difficult case for the Ethics \nCommittee. The whole Senate has waited for over 30 months while the \ncommittee has pored over the documents, interviewed the witnesses, and \nattempted to find the right path. In light of this work, I regretfully \nmust express my grave disappointment in the committee's decision not to \nhold public hearings on this case.\n  Mr. President, this case is a test of the Senate and the Ethics \nCommittee. The U.S. Constitution gives this body the sole \nresponsibility for policing itself. No other agency of Government--not \nthe executive, not the House, not the judicial branch--has authority to \nensure that the Senate adheres to high standards of ethics and conduct. \nI am sure the senior Senator from West Virginia, or any other \nconstitutional scholar, can give us a detailed explanation of this \nauthority. Therefore, this case, like every other considered by the \ncommittee, is a test of whether \n\n[[Page S11165]]\nthe Senate can demonstrate to the public that it is capable of policing \nitself.\n  All Senators have gone out of their way to not interfere in this \ncase, to give the committee the time it needs to go through the \nprocess.\n  Indeed, we have supported them when they needed the full Senate to \nsupport the investigation. We have continued steadfastly to allow the \ncommittee to do its job. As individual Senators, this has been our \nresponsibility to the institution and to our constituents.\n  Now, we have a responsibility to conclude this matter in an equally \nresponsible way. If it cannot be done by the Ethics Committee, it \ncannot be done at all.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside the emotions of this case and focus \ncarefully on the facts. In May, the committee found substantial, \ncredible evidence of Senate rules violations. I am not a lawyer. I have \nnever tried cases. I know that is a very high standard.\n  In every major case that has come before, public hearings have been \nheld. Why, I ask my colleagues, should this case be any different? That \nis the key question. Why should this case be any different?\n  I believe a deviation from precedent on this case will cast a long \nshadow over the Senate's credibility. Specifically, the lack of \nhearings will shade any subsequent action by the committee on this \nissue and any issue that comes before the committee in the future.\n  I feel very strongly this will create doubt in a general public that \nis already skeptical of its public officials. They have a right to know \ntheir elected officials are held to high standards. Anything less not \nonly damages this institution, but also our individual credibility.\n  Mr. President, like many Senators, I am already on record in support \nof public hearings on this issue. I believe this is the only way the \ncommittee and the Senate can show the public that it is serious about \nits responsibilities. I encourage Senators to weigh the facts as we \ncurrently know them. I believe we will conclude that the amendment \noffered by the Senator from California offers the best course of \naction. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the remaining time to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield time to my friend and colleague \nfrom Illinois who has fought many of these battles. I think she will \nadd greatly to the debate, Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I very much regret that this issue has become \nembroiled in partisanship, because the issue before the Senate now is \nnot a partisan issue.\n  In truth, it is not even about Senator Packwood. The amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from California, Senator Boxer, \ndoes not in any way represent any attempt to express a judgment on the \nmerits of the complaint against Senator Packwood that is presently \npending before the Ethics Committee.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that this amendment \nis not about Senator Packwood's ethics at all. This amendment is about \nthe Senate's ethics. This amendment is about how we, as an institution, \nas a body, will comport ourselves in the public view.\n  Quite frankly, I think it is not surprising, I say to my colleagues, \nSenator Boxer and the Senator from Maryland, it is not surprising, no \none on the other side of the aisle will speak to this issue. This is \nstill something that can only shame, and I think it is the shame of the \nattempt to try to defend the indefensible that has kept the opposition \nfrom coming forward and speaking to this issue.\n  What this amendment is all about, in my opinion, is not any \nindividual case, but about the Senate's obligation to the American \npeople in every case. That is, the obligation that we have to resolve \nthese ethics cases in public.\n  Mr. President, I serve on the Senate Banking Committee. The \nmembership of that committee, with few additions, constitute the \nmembership of the Special Whitewater Committee. Last year, under the \nresolution, we reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. We conducted \nabout 37 depositions. The committee had days and days and days of \nhearings--6 days, in fact.\n  The whole purpose of the public hearings was that the American people \nwould have the opportunity to hear and to see the people who were \ninvolved in Whitewater themselves, and to reach their own judgments.\n  Now we are back again this year. The committee has reviewed, again, \nan additional hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, conducted at \nleast 61 depositions, and we are right now in the middle of 13 days of \npublic hearings--hearings that go all day long. Again, so the American \npeople can see for themselves, can hear for themselves, and make their \nown decisions about the circumstances around the handling of papers \nfollowing Mr. Foster's untimely death.\n  Mr. President, that is the way this should be. That is the way that \nwe do things here in the United States. We investigate in public; we \ndecide this in public. That, in fact, if anything, is one of the \nfounding cornerstones of our democracy.\n  We do not have secret trials. We do no have star chambers. We believe \nsunshine is the best disinfectant. Quite frankly, acting in public is \nnot just the principle of the Congress that applies to our \ninvestigations of the executive branch. The Senate has always applied \nthat same principle to ethics investigations involving this body.\n  Without going over the details or the process, which the Senator from \nMaryland has spoken to, the fact is, in every single past case handled \nby the Ethic Committee that moved to this third stage, there have been \npublic hearings. It seems to me, Mr. President, that our obligation to \nthe American public is no less now than it has been in the past. We \nhave the same responsibility to conduct public hearings now as we did \nin the past.\n  So the question then remains, Mr. President, whether or not we are \ngoing to stand up for this institution, whether or not we are going to \nstand up for the regard that the public has of this institution's \nbusiness, whether or not we are going to allow in this particular \ninstance for raw power to determine whether or not we air these issues \nin public or whether or not they will simply be covered up.\n  I do not believe that the Members of this body want to be seen as \nparticipating in a coverup. I do not believe that the Members of this \nbody want to be seen as participating in any diminution of stature in \nregard to this institution, in the minds of the American people.\n  Mr. President, again, this is not a personal issue. I also happen to \nbe the first woman--the only woman--to serve on the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I have had occasions to work with Senator Packwood. He is a \nbrilliant man. He has certainly been fair. He certainly has been fine \nto work with.\n  In that regard, it puts me in a very difficult situation to stand on \nthis floor and to take this position in the collegial atmosphere of the \nSenate. I have to say that service on the same committee--\nnotwithstanding the fact is this is not a partisan issue, this is not a \npersonal issue. This is not an issue of Senator Packwood's ethics. This \nis an issue going to the ethics and the regard of the U.S. Senate in \nthe minds of the American people.\n  I believe that toward that end and in defense of this institution, we \nhave an obligation, a moral obligation, if you will, to support the \namendment of the Senator from California.\n  I yield the time back to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Kentucky on the \nfloor, so I will defer to see if he wants to make a statement. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, the time will be \ndeducted equally from both sides.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask \nthat the time be charged to the other side, since they have no speakers \nat this time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have to say this is a very sad day for \nthe Senate. It is sad for a number of reasons.\n  It is sad because we ought to all be for public hearings. That is the \nright thing to do. It is also sad that because clearly we have a lot of \nspeakers on our side who wish to express themselves, who are assuming \nthere would be speakers on the other side to participate in the debate.\n  I think there is an obvious point being made here, which I will let \nothers interpret. \n\n[[Page S11166]]\n\n  I think something that the Senator from Illinois said ought to be \nthought about. Namely, why no Member is willing to come over here at \nthis point and debate on the other side.\n  Another point that was made by my friend from Maryland when she says, \n``Don't kid yourself. Whether there is a public hearing or not, there's \ngoing to be a public hearing,'' because this is the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The American people already, 2 to 1, are in favor of public hearings \nin this matter, when they watch this debate. Unless we prevail, I think \nthey will demand it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? When I said \nthere would be a public hearing, even if your amendment is defeated, \nthe women are counting on the U.S. Senate to provide a forum. They have \ncounted on us for 30 months.\n  If, in fact, the Senate rejects that opportunity, and rejects them, I \nbelieve that the women will conduct some type of forum themselves--I do \nnot know that.\n  I will reiterate the point that I have never spoken to the women as a \nmember of the Ethics Committee. I have followed the rules of the Ethics \nCommittee and never spoken to those women.\n  They are going to tell their story. I would much rather that they \ntell their story in an organized format in the Senate than through a \nseries of other forums.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think the Senator made such an excellent point here, \nbecause some of the things we hear whispered around here are, ``This is \ntoo embarrassing. We better have this behind closed doors.'' If anyone \non the other side thinks this is going to stay behind closed doors \nsimply because they tried to close the doors today, they are mistaken. \nBecause this is America. This is not a tyranny. This is not a country \nthat gags its people.\n  At this time I yield 4 minutes to my friend from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy. I am very proud he has come over to join the debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree this is a matter that should be \nheard before the Senate and heard in public. There is no question it is \ngoing to be heard, one way or the other. But we Senators, no matter how \npainful it might be, no matter how torn any one of us might be \nindividually, for the good of the Senate--and that is important in our \nconstitutional government --for the sake of trust in elected officials \nin the Senate, these hearings should be held here.\n  Certainly, for the women who have waited to be heard, the accusers in \nthis case, ought to be heard and heard in public. For the Senator in \nquestion, he ought to be able to be heard in public, be able to hear \nhis accusers and give his answers.\n  But I worry: in a country like ours, a democracy where our Government \noperates on the trust of the people, that the U.S. Senate should be the \nconscience of the Nation. The Senate, with our 6-year terms, with our \nunlimited debate, is the body that can be the conscience of the Nation. \nWe are not reflecting that conscience if we do not have open hearings. \nNot because anybody in this body will relish this, but because we know, \nevery single Senator knows in his or her soul, that it is the right \nthing to do. Every single Senator in this body knows in his or her soul \nthat, if we are to be the conscience of the Nation, we must do this \npublicly before the Nation, no matter how difficult it is.\n  None of us knows how these hearings are going to unfold. When I was a \nprosecutor I presented a case, the other side presented a case, and the \ncourt ruled. Here, in a way we become judge and jury together. For many \nof us that is a unique experience. But for the U.S. Senate, it is not a \nunique experience. It has over 200 years of proud history. It is the \nbody that has, time and time again, allowed the conscience of the \nNation to be expressed. Unless we do it here openly, we do not uphold \nour own conscience, we do not uphold the standards we ask of others, \nand we do not uphold the standards of a great institution.\n  I hope the whole Senate will rise and support the Senator from \nCalifornia and say, let us have the open hearings. Whatever happens, we \nwill have them, for the good of the Nation, for the good of the \nindividuals involved, but also for the long term good of this fine \ninstitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who yields time? The Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was doing some work on matters for my \nconstituents, and my staff tells me there is some suggestion that there \nmight not be any speakers on this side of the issue. Let me disabuse my \nfriends on the other side of that notion. It is my understanding, under \nthe unanimous consent agreement, each side had 2 hours. We are prepared \nto use some or all of that time.\n  Let me say at the outset that I am told a number of Senators have \nsuggested that a 3-3 vote in the Ethics Committee is not a decision. In \nfact it is a decision. The Ethics Committee was crafted on purpose to \nrequire four votes from a bipartisan committee to take any affirmative \naction. So at the outset let me make it clear, there is no deadlock to \nbe broken. A decision was made on the public hearing issue.\n  Also, let me suggest that the resolution offered by my friend from \nCalifornia, ironically in the name of precedent, really seeks to uphold \na precedent that does not exist--it simply does not exist--but \ndemolishes other precedents which do exist and are vital to the ethics \nprocess and to the Senate.\n  One precedent which it destroys is that, in the 31-year history of \nthe Ethics Committee, there has not been a single occasion upon which \nthe full committee--the full Senate--injected itself into the process \nand sought to push the committee one way or the other or to overturn \ndecisions the committee had properly taken.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the argument about whether there are \nprecedents for public hearings, let me say that, while there is a \nconsistent precedent for no interference with the procedures of the \nEthics Committee by the full Senate until the full Senate is presented \nwith the final product, there is a clear precedent for not doing that, \nwhich the approval of the Boxer proposal would violate, setting a new \nprecedent. There is no precedent on the issue of public hearings.\n  The Durenberger case, for example, was a staged presentation with a \npre-scripted proceeding, without witnesses and without cross-\nexamination, hardly in any way what we would normally consider a public \nhearing.\n  In the Cranston case, there were some public hearings. They were used \nin the preliminary fact-gathering phase alone and not later in the \ncase. The committee decided, actually, in the Cranston case not to hold \npublic hearings, at a point when its rules and procedure provide, at \nthe end of the inquiry.\n  So, with regard to the precedent issue, there is no clear, consistent \nprecedent for holding public hearings at the end of major \ninvestigations in the Ethics Committee. But there is a 31-year \nprecedent for not having the full Senate bind the Ethics Committee in \nany particular case. And while I suppose it could be argued that the \namendment of the Senator from California is generic in nature, it is \ncertainly no accident that it is being offered at this particular time. \nThis is not the normal way in which we would change a committee rule.\n  So make no mistake about it, Mr. President. The precedent that would \nbe set today would clearly be the beginning of the end of the ethics \nprocess, because you can imagine what would happen, particularly around \ncampaign season when out here on the floor where there is always a \nmajority and always a minority--unlike the Ethics Committee where it is \n3-3--the temptation to offer amendments directing the committee to do \nthis or to do that would be overwhelming, particularly as you get \ncloser and closer to an election.\n  The second point I want to make, Mr. President, and those members of \nour committee on both sides who have served for the last 2\\1/2\\ years, \nI think, all agree that the professional staff of the Ethics Committee \nis completely nonpartisan. The same folks who are working there now \nunder my chairmanship were there working under the chairmanship of the \nvice chairman last year. This professional staff, which has its \nreputation on the line in this case \n\n[[Page S11167]]\nas well--these are professional investigators who serve the Ethics \nCommittee on a nonpartisan basis. There is no partisan hiring \nwhatsoever in putting together the staff of the Ethics Committee. They \nknow more about this case than anybody else, more than I know, more \nthan the vice chairman knows, and on many occasions members of the \ncommittee from both sides on our committee have praised the work of the \nstaff.\n  In almost every instance we have followed their advice and counsel in \nworking on this case, or other cases. The staff in this case, Mr. \nPresident, recommended that public hearings were not appropriate.\n  Why did they do that, this group of skilled professionals who have \ntheir own reputations on the line in a high-profile case like this? Mr. \nPresident, I think the answer is rather clear. There are two \ninvestigative criteria for holding hearings. One is to ensure the \ncompleteness of the evidentiary record--to ensure the completeness of \nthe evidentiary record--and the second would be to assess the \ncredibility of the witnesses who gave testimony.\n  The Ethics Committee, first and foremost, is an investigative body, \nand investigative criteria must be applied to our decisions. The staff \njudgment was that the evidentiary record is not just complete, the \nstaff judgment was that the record was not just complete; it was \nencyclopedic and ready for final decision. Hearings would be needed \nonly if witness credibility was in doubt tested by questioning and \ncross-examination.\n  Every committee member, Mr. President, has strong feelings about the \nbelievability of the testimony given to us through sworn depositions. \nNo hearings are going to change that--we have voluminous sworn \ndepositions before us--and poring over those.\n  In addition, there is the question of delay. The staff opinion is \nthat real hearings would take at least 2 months, actually probably much \nmore than that, given the preparation time involved to get ready for \nhaving them.\n  So we needed to ask: Is there another way to make our proceedings in \nthis case public without adding unnecessary delay to a 2\\1/2\\-year-old \ncase? The fact that the public has a right to know all the relevant \ninformation in this case is really not in dispute. The relevant sworn \ntestimony of witnesses who came forward will be shared with the public. \nThe Senate and the public will have all the relevant facts prior to the \ndisciplinary action.\n  So it is not a question of whether the public is going to be denied \ninformation relevant to the final decision.\n  The resolution of the Senator from California, in effect, Mr. \nPresident, destroys the independent ethics process. I have some \npersonal knowledge of this. I happen to have been a summer intern here \nin the summer of 1964, the year I graduated from college. I was in \nSenator John Sherman Cooper's office. Some of the folks here in this \nbody who have been around for a while remember Senator Cooper. He is \nsomething of a legend in Kentucky, known for his integrity and his \nwisdom. Interestingly enough, it was Senator Cooper's resolution in \n1964, the year I was an intern here, that created the Ethics Committee. \nWhat he was trying to do was to get misconduct cases--this was in the \ncase of the Bobby Baker incident--which in those days was handled by \nthe Senate Rules Committee, and, obviously, the Rules Committee, like \nevery other committee of the Senate except the Ethics Committee, was \ncontrolled by the majority. So there was a sense, after the Bobby Baker \ncase, that it really was not handled all that well, and both sides felt \nthat way.\n  So it was Senator Cooper's vision that there would be created an \nevenly balanced committee, in effect, forced to be bipartisan because \nof the nature of the committee, and that committee, to act in any \naffirmative way, would have to achieve four votes. It would require \nbipartisanship to go forward. Mr. President, for 31 years this process \nhas stood the test of time until today.\n  The Ethics Committee, as Senator Cooper envisioned it, was to be \nempowered to investigate cases as it--it--saw fit without outside \nintervention. The committee's authority was intended to be exclusive \nand absolute through the investigative phase.\n  Obviously, at that point it was envisioned the committee's work would \ncome to the full Senate typically with a recommendation for action \nwhich only the full Senate could approve. The whole idea, Mr. \nPresident, was to make it possible in this most political of all places \nto have a bipartisan investigation, and the process has served the \nSenate well. And at no point during the 31-year history has there been \na resolution offered, debated, and voted upon in front of the full \nSenate seeking to tell the committee what to do.\n  So the resolution of the Senator from California will shatter this \n31-year precedent, and the new precedent for the future will be a way \nof proposals on the Senate floor to suggest that the committee open a \ncase here, close a case there, do this, do that. That will be the \nprecedent.\n  The approval of the proposal of the Senator from California would \ndestroy the vision of Senator Cooper, and others, that the Senate \ncould, at least through the investigative phase, remove a misconduct \nmatter, deal with it on a bipartisan basis, and then produce a final \nproduct for the floor of the Senate.\n  All future Ethics Committee actions, Mr. President, or split votes--\nwhich, as I have already indicated earlier, is a decision--would be \nfair target for bruising, public floor fights.\n  Currently, the Ethics Committee sets aside preelection season \ncomplaints. Now I am fairly confident that the wave of the future will \nbe resolutions in the Chamber forcing immediate action on one matter or \nanother.\n  The resolution of the Senator from California sends really an \nunequivocal message. The Ethics Committee can be treated like a \npolitical football, propelled in any direction that the majority seeks \nto push it--kicked around by any Member who wants to push a political \nor personal agenda. The approval of the Boxer resolution would be the \nbeginning of the end of the Ethics Committee and a return to the bad \nold days. And the bad old days before 31 years ago were to deal with \nmisconduct cases on a partisan basis.\n  The other irony, Mr. President, is that the principal loser under a \nsystem which allowed the majority to control misconduct cases would be \nthe minority party in the Senate. So the other ironic effect of the \nproposal of the Senator from California is to force a matter out of a \nbipartisan forum onto the floor of what arguably is one of the more \npartisan places in America. In what way does the minority party benefit \nfrom, in effect, ending a bipartisan forum?\n  Second, Mr. President, while we are discussing precedents, the \nresolution of the Senator from California clearly violates the \nprecedent set earlier in this case when we had before the full Senate \nthe question of the subpoena of diaries. Just a little while back, in \n1993, I remind my colleagues, the Senate voted 94 to 6 to enforce the \nEthics Committee's subpoena of the Packwood diaries. The Senate also \nvoted 77 to 23 against an amendment restricting the committee's access \nto diaries. And clearly what was in this Chamber just in the fall of \n1993 was a question of whether the committee judgment was going to be \nsustained. My friend from California and others were emphatic in saying \nthe Ethics Committee should handle the case. Unfortunately, that was \nthen and this is now.\n  At that time, both Democrats and Republicans argued that the Ethics \nCommittee had exclusive authority to investigate misconduct without \ninterference from the full Senate or from any single Member, and that \nwas just in the fall of 1993. The Senate voted overwhelmingly that the \nEthics Committee alone had the right to determine what procedures it \nshould follow in conducting investigations. Senators from this side of \nthe aisle voted almost unanimously against the interests of one of our \nown. Republicans voted against the demands that one of their own was \ntrying to impose on the committee.\n  I know it would be extremely tough for someone on the other side of \nthe aisle to oppose the resolution of the Senator from California, but \nI hope there may be a few listening to this debate who will think \nthrough the ramifications of the passage of the Boxer amendment. \nRemember, there is no deadlock. Three-three on the Ethics Committee is \na decision. It takes four votes to do anything affirmatively in \n\n[[Page S11168]]\nthe ethics process. Make no mistake about it. This proposal is designed \nto overturn a decision already taken by a bipartisan committee.\n  Now, this vote today, in my judgment, is not about Republicans versus \nDemocrats or, in my view, even being for or against public hearings. \nThis vote is about whether the Ethics Committee should be allowed to do \nits work, to do its work without interference or second-guessing from \nthe floor at least until it finishes its job. And that is important to \nunderstand. It is not like any individual Senator or group of Senators \nare not going to have ample opportunity to express themselves, to \ncondemn the work of the committee, to argue that we should have done \nthis or should have done that. None of those options are waived, Mr. \nPresident, by allowing us to finish our work. As a matter of fact, \ngiven the controversial nature of this case, it is inconceivable to me \nthat we are going to be applauded by very many of our friends up in the \ngallery or anybody on the other side no matter how we handle it. The \nquestion is will we be allowed to finish? And--and--will the process be \nchanged, the 31-year precedent of no interference in this bipartisan \ncommittee's work?\n  Many of us like to quote our senior colleague from West Virginia \nbecause he has said many wise things when it comes to this institution \nand what is necessary to protect it. Back during the diary debate, the \ndiary subpoena debate in this case, Senator Byrd said, ``If we turn our \nbacks on our colleagues who have so carefully investigated this \ndifficult matter, we may as well disband the committee.''\n  I do not know where we go if we are going to set the precedent that \nthe committee is to be in effect micromanaged from the Senate, but it \ndoes make one wonder whether this is a useful process. The committee is \neither going to be allowed to finish its work without interference from \nthe floor or it is not. And if it is not, then I wonder why anybody \nwould want to serve on the Ethics Committee. My colleagues, Senator \nCraig and Senator Smith, and I have scratched our heads on that issue \noccasionally and wondered why we agreed to do it in the first place.\n  Imagine a scenario under which this Ethics Committee or any Ethics \nCommittee knows that all along the way, at any crucial point or at any \ntime when somebody is trying to score a political point or wants to \nmake a few headlines, they are going to be out on the floor of the \nSenate in an awkward position trying to protect confidential \ninformation that they know about and at the same time trying to engage \nin a public debate on a case not yet finished. I do not want to be an \nalarmist here, but it seems to me there is no point in having the \nEthics Committee if that is the way it is going to be from now on.\n  I cannot imagine that anybody would want to serve. I just cannot \nimagine it. It is not much fun now, I can assure you. It is not the way \nI particularly want to spend my afternoons. But imagine if in addition \nto presiding over the toughest kind of investigation against one of \nyour own colleagues, you know that all along the way during the process \nyou are going to be out here like we are today getting a bunch of bad \npress, trying to do what you think is right, while one or more Members \nof this body get terrific editorials and terrific headlines standing up \nfor what appears to be the popular thing.\n  So I think we ought to think it through, Mr. President, whether or \nnot if the Boxer resolution passes--and I say, think this through on a \nbipartisan basis, really--whether we want to continue to have an ethics \ncommittee. Maybe we go back to the Rules Committee. Maybe Senators \nthink that would be a better way to do this. Of course, the Rules \nCommittee is controlled by the majority party, and some people might be \nconcerned that the Rules Committee might be a little less enthusiastic \nabout pursuing a Member of the majority than a Member of the minority.\n  But maybe I am off base here. Maybe it would not operate that way. \nMaybe people would on the Rules Committee just kind of rise above party \naffiliation and be just as interested in pursuing examples of alleged \ncases of impropriety against Members of the majority as they would \nagainst Members of the minority. Or maybe we ought to just throw up our \nhands and say, ``We cannot do this job. Let us let outsiders do it.'' \nSome have suggested that.\n  Well, Mr. President, one thing you can say about the case that has \ngenerated this floor debate, it is the toughest investigation in \nhistory. As I said earlier, it has been the mother of all ethics \ninvestigations. The witnesses have consistently praised the committee's \ncomprehensive inquiry. The handling of the Packwood case outshines all \nprevious investigations of sexual misconduct, certainly here because we \nhave not had any, and compared to the House, which has had 5 in the \nlast 10 years, the handling of this has been vastly superior in every \nmeasurable way.\n  The committee has interviewed 264 witnesses, taken 111 sworn \ndepositions, issued 44 subpoenas, read 16,000 pages of documents, spent \n1,000 hours in meetings. And even in spite of all of that, if the \nSenate will allow us to finish our work, the Senate will indeed have an \nopportunity at the appropriate time to substitute its collective will \nfor ours.\n  The Senate will have a chance to challenge committee action. The \nSenate rules give broad latitude--broad latitude--for floor action \nafter the committee's work is done. Any Member can accept, reject, or \nmodify the recommendations of the committee at the appropriate time. No \nrights are waived. No rights are waived by allowing the committee to \nfinish its work.\n  But to undermine the work of the committee in the middle of the case \ntakes away its independence. It is tantamount to abolishing the \ncommittee outright or maybe dissecting it piece by piece by piece.\n  Let me say in conclusion, Mr. President, every precedent weighs \nagainst the resolution of the Senator from California. And precedents \ndo not mean a thing, Mr. President, if they are not upheld in difficult \ncases.\n  Let me say again, there is no clear, consistent precedent for full-\nfledged public hearings at the end of every investigation involving \nethics.\n  I may speak again later, but let me say, regardless of the outcome, I \npledge as chairman of this committee we are going to try to finish our \nwork. We are going to try to finish it in good faith. And let me say I \nwould be less than candid if I did not say that the spilling over of \nthis case on to the floor of the Senate has divided our committee. We \nhave been able to work together on the whole, I think, on a good, \nbipartisan basis in this long and difficult investigation. There is no \nquestion that we have been feeling the strain. And I hope that once \nthis unfortunate floor proceeding is over, that the six of us who have \nactually in many ways become good friends during the course of this \ndifficult assignment, will be able to come back together, finish this \ncase, do what is best for the Senate, for the American people, and for \nSenator Packwood.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 1\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may desire to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding.\n  Mr. President, in seeking office to be a U.S. Senator, it was not my \nhope that I would ever be in the position that I am now in on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate as a member of the Ethics Committee essentially \ndebating in some ways regarding a case involving one of our colleagues. \nIt is not something you look forward to.\n  But before entering into the discussion of the Boxer amendment, which \nI strongly oppose, I just want to say regarding the chairman of this \ncommittee--and frankly, his predecessor as well, Senator Bryan--\nstarting first with Senator Bryan, I served on the Ethics Committee and \nI have served for the past 4 years on that committee, a year--2\\1/2\\ \nyears of that--3\\1/2\\ years of that was under the chairmanship of \nSenator Bryan. Never, ever under any circumstances did I see any \npartisanship reflected by him or his colleagues on the committee. We \nalways worked together in the spirit of knowing, \n\n[[Page S11169]]\nfrankly, as you refer to this case, but for the grace of God it could \nbe some or one on the other side.\n  See, as Senator McConnell has so brilliantly outlined, that is the \nbeauty of the whole concept of the Ethics Committee, Mr. President, to \nthe fact that we have taken this whole issue of judging a colleague out \nof the hands--out of the hands--of politics and put it into a \nnonpartisan, rather than bipartisan, in my estimation, Ethics \nCommittee.\n  Senator Cooper, who was referred to by Senator McConnell, who helped \nto craft this legislation to create this committee, was brilliant, in \nmy estimation. Is it a perfect process? No. I can certainly attest to \nthat, as can any of my colleagues who have served on this committee.\n  Senator McConnell, as the chairman of this committee, involving a \nmajor case of one of our colleagues on our side of the aisle, has taken \nmore abuse than any chairman of this committee that I can recall in \nrecent times. And every word of it, every single word of it has been \nunfair. And I happen to know because I have served with him every step \nof the way, both when he was ranking member and as chairman. He has \ntaken it from the press, he has taken it from colleagues on his side of \nthe aisle, he has taken it from colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. And none of it, none of it, is justified.\n  I know how frustrating it is--because I have been in the Senate when \nI was not a member of the committee--when there is a case of this \nmagnitude, or any case that is before this committee, to not know what \nis going on, meeting behind closed doors, if you will. There is a \nreason for that.\n  No, it may not be popular out there in the public. It is certainly \nnot going to be popular when you have colleagues like Senator Boxer \nrailing against the process on the floor of the Senate. No, it is not \ngoing to be popular. It is going to be unpopular because when Senator \nBoxer and others rail against the process on the Senate floor, they \nwill make it unpopular. That is why it is unpopular.\n  There is no confidence in public officials or public institutions, it \nhas been said on the other side of this debate. When I say ``on the \nother side of this debate,'' I do not necessarily mean all of the other \nparty. But that is the reason why, because with all due respect to my \ncolleague, she did not give us the opportunity to render a decision, \nnot a decision in regard to Senator Packwood in terms of punishment, if \nany. No, no; that is not the issue. She did not give us a chance to \nrender a decision on whether or not there was going to be a public \nhearing.\n  This issue is not about a public hearing. Let us be honest about \nthis. This is not about a public hearing. If it was about a public \nhearing, with all due respect to the Senator from California, the \nSenator from California would have waited until the Ethics Committee \ntook a vote and, as it turned out, it was 3 to 3. Then she would have \ncome to the Senate floor and criticized the vote, which she has a right \nto do, and say we should have had public hearings.\n  But that is not what happened, I say to my colleagues. Senator Boxer \ndecided, before the Ethics Committee made a decision, that she was \ngoing to criticize the Ethics Committee to intimidate the Ethics \nCommittee and break up the process, the nonpartisan process. That is \nwhat happened. That is exactly what happened, and my colleagues know \nthat is what happened, and that is wrong. We have now interjected the \nugly aspect of partisanship into this process.\n  I heard it said on the floor of the Senate prior to this debate that \nthe three of us on our side of the aisle in this case had made up their \nminds and had already announced their decisions. This Senator had not \nmade any such decision, and my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle know it. If they are honest about it, they will admit it, because \nI never made any statements until just days, a couple of days, before \nthis whole thing happened, did I ever say to one of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle how I was voting. I did not know how I was \ngoing to vote. I tried to keep an open mind.\n  I heard Senator Mikulski say in the debate a while ago that I have \nalways been in favor of public hearings. Let me just say, that is not \ntrue. In my case, I was never always against public hearings. You know \nwhat; I tried to listen to the merits of this case and I tried to make \nmy mind up on whether or not there should be a public hearing based on \nwhat I heard after 2\\1/2\\ years. I did not make my mind up on anything, \nnot anything at all, because it is too important to do that.\n  This is a colleague that we are talking about; these are victims out \nthere that we are talking about. They all deserve--they all deserve--a \nfair process, and the process that has been outlined by Senator \nMcConnell is fair. It is fair, and it keeps politics out of it. It \nallows the Senate Ethics Committee to operate not under the pressures \nof what is popular out there, or unpopular out there, whatever the case \nmay be, not what the Washington Post says or anybody else says out \nthere in the media, not what is written on the editorial pages, no, and \nnot what is said on the floor of the Senate in some partisan debate. \nThat is not the way we are supposed to operate. We cannot operate that \nway.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider that when you vote. Forget about the \n``D'' or the ``R'' next to your name and think about it. Think very \ncarefully about it, because as Senator McConnell has said, we very well \nmay be back to the Rules Committee making decisions.\n  I do not know who in the world, as he said, would serve on the Ethics \nCommittee if before you make a decision on anything, be it public \nhearings or final decision, we have to be told or intimidated by debate \nas to what may be popular how we are supposed to rule. That is not the \nprocess.\n  As Senator McConnell also said, we never had any partisan rancor in \nthis case; a little bit of it when we had the situation on the floor \nover the diaries, but minimal. But in terms of the meetings that we \nhad, I do not know how many hundreds of them we have had and the hours \nwe have spent.\n  I was sitting here and did not check the record--and I will be happy \nto stand corrected if I am wrong--I cannot recall one vote, not one, \nthat was 3 to 3 on anything that we have done on this case, and we have \nhad one heck of a lot of votes. This is the only one. It was 3 to 3.\n  I have to deal with my own conscience and with my own Creator, and I \nmade that decision not based on whether there is an ``R'' next to my \nname or not, thank you, I say to Senator Boxer, but I made it on the \nbasis of what I thought was right. That is how I made my decision. And \nmy colleagues on the committee who have worked with me for the past 4 \nyears know it.\n  The Senator seeks to undermine the bipartisan nature of this \ncommittee. It is a very dangerous road to travel down. The many issues \nthat we face with other committee members have been handled not only in \na bipartisan, nonpartisan, but a respectful manner--respectful manner.\n  I truly believe that each member of this committee feels strongly \nabout every case we have worked on, about each Member's conduct we have \njudged, and the effect every case has on the Senate as an institution, \nas well as the victims, as well as the Senator accused--but also the \nSenate.\n  I can honestly state that I have never seen any partisanship until \nnow. I understand the pressures, and I regret very much that because of \nthose pressures, some have had to succumb to this. I regret very much--\nand I do not cast any personal aspersions, and my colleagues know \nthat--but I regret very much for the few moments that I was in the \nchair earlier this afternoon, seeing all of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle on the Ethics Committee converged around the Senator \nfrom California with their staffs, working on an amendment which, in \nessence, guts the entire Ethics Committee process. I regret that very \nmuch. I want to get that out on the floor as a matter of public record. \nI regret it very much.\n  At each step of this investigation, with a Democrat as chairman, with \na Republican as chairman, we have conducted our business fairly, \nbipartisanly, and we have never left a stone unturned that I am aware \nof, and that includes the committee. When Senator McConnell took over \nas chairman of the committee, he did not change one staff member; not \none. Can \n\n[[Page S11170]]\nwe say that about other Senate committees after the parties changed \npower? Not one staff person. It did not even cross his mind. It was \nnever discussed, ever.\n  We cannot circumvent the procedure that we have here. If this Boxer \namendment is adopted, no longer--no longer--will there be a thoughtful \ndiscussion of the facts among committee members, no more thoughtful \ndiscussions. It will be what is popular.\n  I resent very much--and I again want to be strong in my statement--I \nresent very much some of the terms that have been used on the floor in \nthis debate: ``Whitewash''; ``sweep things under the rug''; ``behind \nclosed doors''; ``men's club.'' I have heard all of it. I have heard \nall of it, and it is an insult, frankly, to all six members, and all \nsix members know it is an insult.\n  The public has a right to know; it absolutely has a right to know the \nfacts in this case. I spent 6 years on a school board, 3 years as its \nchairman. I strongly support the public right to know, the right-to-\nknow laws, and full public disclosure. I take a back seat to no one on \nthat.\n  I can tell you that when this case is concluded, everything that this \ncommittee knows the public will know. I can also tell you that after \nthe decision is rendered and this case is discussed on the floor, you \ncan ask any question that you want to ask of this Senator, of any other \nSenator on the committee, any information. It is all there. You will \nhave it all. You can question anything you want--anything. You can \noverturn any decision we make. You can agree to any decision we make. \nBut that is the way the process is supposed to work, and that is not \nwhat is happening now.\n  Think about this. In this case, it is a popular thing that Senator \nBoxer has brought up here. It is popular in the sense that somehow the \nperception is that a ``men's club,'' a U.S. Senate with very few women, \nis somehow, because of this being an allegation involving sexual \nmatters, sweeping something under the rug simply because we do not have \npublic hearings. Hearings are supposed to produce new evidence, add to \nthe debate. That is a decision for the committee to make, and we made \nit.\n  We made it in spite of the attacks that were made on this committee \nand the integrity of the process by the Senator from California. And I \nam glad we did, because it was the right thing to do. And tomorrow, God \nforbid, or next year, it may be someone on your side of the aisle, and \nyou will be glad we did. You will be very glad we did.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, we have enough information to move on \nthe disciplinary phase of this process. I would like to end this 2\\1/\n2\\-year investigation, which has taken many, many hours of my time and \ndays of my time, and that of my colleagues--time I would have liked to \nhave spent with my family or on other matters. I believe that at its \nconclusion, most likely the case will be before you here on the floor. \nEvery one of you will have the opportunity to make your own judgment.\n  I say to you, give us the chance, my colleagues. Vote against the \nBoxer amendment and give us a chance to be judged on the decision that \nwe make. Give us that opportunity to be judged on the decision that we \nrender.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire not only for his outstanding comments here \ntoday, but also for his dedicated and principled service on the Ethics \nCommittee. He has been absolutely indispensable to the process and has \nalways conducted himself with the highest integrity, both in the \ncommittee and outside the committee, in how he has dealt with the \nmatters before the committee and in complying with the rules of the \ncommittee. So I thank him very much for his kind comments.\n  Mr. President, another important member of our committee that has \nbeen with us during this process would like some time.\n  I yield the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho such time as he \nmay need.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee. Let me inquire of the Chair, are we to move to recess at 4 \no'clock for the purpose of the conference, or is there any standing UC \non that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no pending unanimous-consent request \non that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All right.\n  Mr. President, I, like all of my colleagues, come to the floor today \ngravely concerned about the ability of the Ethics Committee of the U.S. \nSenate to function in an appropriate manner and to render its decisions \nand to bring those decisions to the floor of the U.S. Senate to be \nconsidered by our colleagues.\n  At the outset of my comments, let me recognize the chairman from \nKentucky, who has, in my opinion, served in an honest and forthright \nway to cause this procedure to go forward in a timely fashion, but in a \nthorough and responsible fashion, so that the accused and the victims \nof this issue could be considered appropriately. I think he has done an \nexcellent job. And I must also say that, in my over 1\\1/2\\ years of \nservice in this body, I also served under the Democrat chairman. He, \ntoo, functioned in the same manner.\n  As has been mentioned by my two colleagues, the staff of that \ncommittee is, by every respect and every test, bipartisan. They have \nworked in that fashion untold hours to bring about a body of knowledge \nand information from which we should make decisions that is probably, \nin total, unprecedented in number of pages and hours of work effort \ninvolved.\n  For the next few moments, then, let me read something into the Record \nthat I think is extremely valuable for the Senate to focus on, because \nsomehow in this proceeding, there is an attempted air of suggesting \nthat things are being done behind closed doors, and that that somehow \nis unfair to the process and unprecedented in the openness of the U.S. \nSenate, and, therefore, judgments and decisions rendered inside that \nenvironment could somehow be distorted on behalf of a colleague under \nconsideration and against those who might be victims.\n  Let me read:\n\n       May 17, 1995. The attached resolution of investigation was \n     unanimously voted by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics on \n     May 16, 1995.\n\n\n                      RESOLUTION FOR INVESTIGATION\n\n       Whereas, the Select Committee on Ethics on December 1, \n     1992, initiated a Preliminary Inquiry (hereafter ``Inquiry'') \n     into allegations of sexual misconduct by Senator Bob \n     Packwood, and subsequently, on February 4, 1993, expanded the \n     scope of its Inquiry to include allegations of attempts to \n     intimidate and discredit the alleged victims, and misuse of \n     official staff in attempts to intimidate and discredit, and \n     notified Senator Packwood of such actions; and\n       Whereas, on December 15, 1993, in light of sworn testimony \n     that Senator Packwood may have altered evidence relevant to \n     the Committee's Inquiry, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman \n     determined as an inherent part of its Inquiry to inquire into \n     the integrity of evidence sought by the Committee and into \n     any information that anyone may have endeavored to obstruct \n     its Inquiry, and notified Senator Bob Packwood of such \n     action; and\n       Whereas, on May 11, 1994, upon completion of the Committee \n     staff's review of Senator Packwood's typewritten diaries, the \n     Committee expanded its Inquiry again to include additional \n     areas of potential misconduct by Senator Packwood, including \n     solicitation of financial support for his spouse from persons \n     with an interest in legislation, in exchange, gratitude, or \n     recognition for his official acts;\n       Whereas, the Committee staff has conducted the Inquiry \n     under the direction of the Members of the Committee; and\n       Whereas, the Committee has received the Report of its staff \n     relating to its Inquiry concerning Senator Packwood; and\n       Whereas, on the basis of evidence received during the \n     Inquiry, there are possible violations within the Committee's \n     jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. \n     338, 88th Congress, as amended;\n       It is therefore resolved.\n       I. That the Committee makes the following determinations \n     regarding the matters set forth above:\n       (a) With respect to sexual misconduct, the Committee has \n     carefully considered evidence, including sworn testimony, \n     witness interviews, and documentary evidence, relating to the \n     following allegations:\n\n  I am now going to proceed to read 18 different allegations. Mr. \nPresident, am I divulging secret information? Is this something that \nwas held behind closed doors? Am I, for the first time, exposing to the \npublic information that the committee has known that might otherwise \ncome out in a public hearing?\n  No, I am not. This is a document that was put before the public and \nput before the press corps of this Senate some \n\n[[Page S11171]]\nmonths ago. And it was thoroughly reported in many of the newspapers, \non television and radio across this Nation.\n\n       (1) That in 1990, in his Senate office in Washington, DC, \n     Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders and \n     kissed her on the lips;\n       (2) That in 1985, at a function in Bend, OR, Senator \n     Packwood fondled a campaign worker as he danced. Later that \n     year in Eugene, OR, in saying good night and thank you to \n     her, Senator Packwood grabbed the campaign worker's face with \n     his hands, pulled her toward him and kissed her on the mouth, \n     forcing his tongue into her mouth;\n       (3) That in 1981 or 1982, in his Senate office in \n     Washington, DC--\n\n  And the allegations go on, all 18 of them, through 1969.\n  Then it says:\n\n       Based upon the committee's consideration of evidence \n     related to each of these allegations, the committee finds \n     that there is substantial creditable evidence that provides \n     substantial cause for the committee to conclude that \n     violations within the committee's jurisdiction as \n     contemplated in section 2(a)(1) of Senate Resolution 338, \n     88th Congress, as amended, may have occurred; to wit, that \n     Senator Packwood may have abused his U.S. Senate office by \n     improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the U.S. \n     Senate, by engaging in a pattern of sexual misconduct between \n     1969 and 1990.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this document be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Resolution for Investigation\n\n       Whereas, the Select Committee on Ethics on December 1, \n     1992, initiated a Preliminary Inquiry (hereafter ``Inquiry'') \n     into allegations of sexual misconduct by Senator Bob \n     Packwood, and subsequently, on February 4, 1993, expanded the \n     scope of its Inquiry to include allegations of attempts to \n     intimidate and discredit the alleged victims, and misuse of \n     official staff in attempts to intimidate and discredit, and \n     notified Senator Packwood of such actions; and\n       Whereas, on December 15, 1993, in light of sworn testimony \n     that Senator Packwood may have altered evidence relevant to \n     the Committee's Inquiry, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman \n     determined as an inherent part of its Inquiry to inquire into \n     the integrity of evidence sought by the Committee and into \n     any information that anyone may have endeavored to obstruct \n     its Inquiry, and notified Senator Packwood if such action; \n     and\n       Whereas, on May 11, 1994, upon completion of the Committee \n     staff's review of Senator Packwood's typewritten diaries, the \n     Committee expanded its Inquiry again to include additional \n     areas of potential misconduct by Senator Packwood, including \n     solicitation of financial support for his spouse from persons \n     with an interest in legislation, in exchange, gratitude, or \n     recognition for his official acts;\n       Whereas, the Committee staff has conducted the Inquiry \n     under the direction of the Members of the Committee; and\n       Whereas, the Committee has received the Report of its staff \n     relating to its Inquiry concerning Senator Packwood; and\n       Whereas, on the basis of evidence received during the \n     Inquiry, there are possible violations within the Committee's \n     jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. \n     338, 88th Congress, as amended;\n       It is therefore Resolved:\n       I. That the Committee makes the following determinations \n     regarding the matters set forth above:\n       (a) With respect to sexual misconduct, the Committee has \n     carefully considered evidence, including sworn testimony, \n     witness interviews, and documentary evidence, relating to the \n     following allegations:\n       (1) That in 1990, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C., \n     Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders and \n     kissed her on the lips;\n       (2) That in 1985, at a function in Bend, Oregon, Senator \n     Packwood fondled a campaign worker as they danced. Later that \n     year, in Eugene, Oregon, in saying goodnight and thank you to \n     her, Senator Packwood grabbed the campaign worker's face with \n     his hands, pulled her towards him, and kissed her on the \n     mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth;\n       (3) That in 1981 or 1982, in his Senate office in \n     Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood squeezed the arms of a \n     lobbyist, leaned over and kissed her on the mouth;\n       (4) That in 1981, in the basement of the Capitol, Senator \n     Packwood walked a former staff assistant into a room, where \n     he grabbed her with both hands in her hair and kissed her, \n     forcing his tongue into her mouth;\n       (5) That in 1980, in a parking lot in Eugene, Oregon, \n     Senator Packwood pulled a campaign worker toward him, put his \n     arms around her, and kissed her, forcing his tongue in her \n     mouth; he also invited her to his motel room;\n       (6) That in 1980 or early 1981, at a hotel in Portland, \n     Oregon, on two separate occasions, Senator Packwood kissed a \n     desk clerk who worked for the hotel;\n       (7) That in 1980, in his Senate office in Washington, D.C., \n     Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders, \n     pushed her down on a couch, and kissed her on the lips; the \n     staff member tried several times to get up, but Senator \n     Packwood repeatedly pushed her back on the couch;\n       (8) That in 1979, Senator Packwood walked into the office \n     of another Senator in Washington, D.C., started talking with \n     a staff member, and suddenly leaned down and kissed the staff \n     member on the lips;\n       (9) That in 1977, in an elevator in the Capitol, and on \n     numerous occasions, Senator Packwood grabbed the elevator \n     operator by the shoulders, pushed her to the wall of the \n     elevator and kissed her on the lips. Senator Packwood also \n     came to this person's home, kissed her, and asked her to make \n     love with him;\n       (10) That in 1976, in a motel room while attending the \n     Dorchester Conference in coastal Oregon, Senator Packwood \n     grabbed a prospective employee by her shoulders, pulled her \n     to him, and kissed her;\n       (11) That in 1975, in his Senate office in Washington, \n     D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed the staff assistant referred \n     to in (4), pinned her against a wall or desk, held her hair \n     with one hand, bending her head backwards, fondling her with \n     his other hand, and kissed her, forcing his tongue into her \n     mouth;\n       (12) That in 1975, in his Senate office in Washington, \n     D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff assistant around her \n     shoulders, held her tightly while pressing his body into \n     hers, and kissed her on the mouth;\n       (13) That in the early 1970's, in his Senate office in \n     Portland, Oregon, Senator Packwood chased a staff assistant \n     around a desk;\n       (14) That in 1970, in a hotel restaurant in Portland, \n     Oregon, Senator Packwood ran his hand up the leg of a dining \n     room hostess, and touched her crotch area;\n       (15) That in 1970, in his Senate office in Washington, \n     D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by the \n     shoulders and kissed her on the mouth;\n       (16) That in 1969, in his Senate office in Washington, \n     D.C., Senator Packwood made suggestive comments to a \n     prospective employee;\n       (17) That in 1969, at his home in Virginia, Senator \n     Packwood grabbed an employee of another Senator who was \n     babysitting for him, rubbed her shoulders and back, and \n     kissed her on the mouth. He also put his arm around her and \n     touched her leg as he drove her home;\n       (18) That in 1969, in his Senate office in Portland, \n     Oregon, Senator Packwood grabbed a staff worker, stood on her \n     feet, grabbed her hair, forcibly pulled her head back, and \n     kissed her on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth. \n     Senator Packwood also reached under her skirt and grabbed at \n     her undergarments.\n       Based upon the Committee's consideration of evidence \n     related to each of these allegations, the Committee finds \n     that there is substantial credible evidence that provides \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that \n     violations within the Committee's jurisdiction as \n     contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th \n     Congress, as amended, may have occurred; to wit, that Senator \n     Packwood may have abused his United States Senate Office by \n     improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the United \n     States Senate, by engaging in a pattern of sexual misconduct \n     between 1969 and 1990.\n       Notwithstanding this conclusion, for purposes of making a \n     determination at the end of its Investigation with regard to \n     a possible pattern of conduct involving sexual misconduct, \n     some Members of the Committee have serious concerns about the \n     weight, if any, that should be accorded to evidence of \n     conduct alleged to have occurred prior to 1976, the year in \n     which the federal court recognized quid pro quo sexual \n     harassment as discrimination under the civil rights Act, and \n     the Senate passed a resolution prohibiting sex \n     discrimination, and taking into account the age of the \n     allegations.\n       (b) With respect to the Committee's inherent responsibility \n     to inquire into the integrity of the evidence sought by the \n     Committee as part of its Inquiry, the Committee finds, within \n     the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, \n     as amended, that there is substantial credible evidence that \n     provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that \n     improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate, and/or possible \n     violations of federal law, i.e., Title 18, United States \n     Code, Section 1505, may have occurred. To wit:\n       Between some time in December 1992 and some time in \n     November 1993, Senator Packwood intentionally altered diary \n     materials that he knew or should have known the Committee had \n     sought or would likely seek as part of its Preliminary \n     Inquiry begun on December 1, 1992.\n       (c) With respect to possible solicitation of financial \n     support for his spouse from persons with an interest in \n     legislation, the Committee has carefully considered evidence, \n     including sworn testimony and documentary evidence, relating \n     to Senator Packwood's contacts with the following persons:\n       (1) A registered foreign agent representing a client who \n     had particular interests before the Committee on Finance and \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation;\n       (2) A businessman who had particular interests before the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation;\n       (3) A businessman who had particular interests before the \n     Committee on Finance and the Committee on Commerce, Science \n     and Transportation;\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\n       (4) A registered lobbyist representing clients who had \n     particular interests before the Committee on Finance and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation;\n       (5) A registered lobbyist representing a client who had \n     particular interests before the Committee on Finance.\n       Based upon the Committee's consideration of this evidence, \n     the Committee finds that there is substantial credible \n     evidence that provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that violations within the Committee's jurisdiction \n     as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th \n     Congress, as amended, may have occurred, to wit; Senator \n     Packwood may have abused his United States Senate Office \n     through improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the \n     United States Senate by inappropriately linking personal \n     financial gain to his official position in that he solicited \n     or otherwise encouraged offers of financial assistance from \n     persons who had a particular interest in legislation or \n     issues that Senator Packwood could influence.\n       II. That the Committee, pursuant to Committee Supplementary \n     Procedural Rules 3(d)(5) and 4(f)(4), shall proceed to an \n     Investigation under Committee Supplementary Procedural Rule \n     5; and\n       III. That Senator Packwood shall be given timely written \n     notice of this Resolution and the evidence supporting it, and \n     informed of a respondent' rights pursuant to the Rules of the \n     Committee.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. The reason I do that is to show you and the rest of the \nSenators who I hope are listening this afternoon that there has been a \nconcerted effort on the part of the Ethics Committee, not only to \nthoroughly investigate but to, in a responsible and timely fashion, \nspread before the Senate and the public the process and the procedure \nby which the Senate Ethics Committee was conducting its charge and its \nresponsibility in the investigation of Senator Bob Packwood.\n  Mr. President, I have had the unique experience of serving on this \nEthics Committee and the Ethics Committee in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I have also had the unique experience of serving on \nboth of those bodies during times of extremely high profile cases. \nDuring the time that I served in the House it was the time that the \nHouse Ethics Committee was investigating the Speaker of the House, Jim \nWright. All during that investigation there was never a question that \nthere should be public hearings. But there was always a tacit \nunderstanding that all of the findings and all of the information \ncollected would become a part of the public record, and that it would \nbecome a part of the public record simultaneous to the decisions, the \nfindings and the recommendations of that Ethics Committee to the whole \nof the U.S. House as to the penalties that might be brought down on \nthen the Speaker, Jim Wright.\n  I must tell you, Mr. President, that is exactly how the Ethics \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate plans to operate. That there will be full \npublic disclosure. Less than a few days ago we voted unanimously to \ncause that to happen. That, upon our findings and upon our \nrecommendations to the U.S. Senate we would spread, for the public's \nreview and for the Senators' review, all of our thousands and thousands \nof pages of findings and all 264 witness depositions, the vast body of \ninformation that you have already heard about today that have been \ntalked about by my colleagues.\n  Never once in my experience on any Ethics Committee in either of \nthese two bodies have I ever voted against public disclosure. I believe \nit is our responsibility. I think it is, more importantly, the right of \nthe public to know.\n  But I also recognize it is the responsibility of the Ethics Committee \nof the U.S. Senate so charged by the U.S. Senate to operate in a \nbipartisan--or as my colleague from New Hampshire said, a nonpartisan--\nenvironment, in which to render its decisions.\n  I was, frankly, very amazed to see our committee for the first time \nsplit apart on this issue. I do believe that this, in itself, could be \none of the most precedent setting involvements that we have ever seen, \nprecedent setting in the fact that after 32 years of nonpartisan or \nbipartisan relationships we now find ourselves causing that aisle to \ndivide us on how this committee should operate before it has rendered \nits decision to the Senate as a whole.\n  Last week that professional nonpartisan staff looked at us, after \nhaving provided us with all of this information, and said: It is our \nrecommendation that public hearings are not necessary. There is nothing \nto be gained. It appears that, after the exhaustive effort at full \ndiscovery that was a unanimous vote of the committee, that there is \nlittle or no information that can be gained. It is now time to make a \ndecision. It is now time to review and to render to the Senate our \nfindings for the purpose of the Senate agreeing or disagreeing on those \nfindings and those recommendations.\n  I am therefore tremendously bothered and frustrated that we risk \nmaking partisan what some 31 years ago we took off from the partisan \ntable. I understand the pressures. I understand the nature of the \narguments being placed. I also understand the uniqueness of these \nparticular allegations.\n  But in all fairness I find them no different, as it relates to the \nconduct of a Senator in this body charged with the responsibility of \nbeing a U.S. Senator, whether he or she acted in a proper and \nresponsible fashion, or whether he or she did not. And that is exactly \nwhat the Ethics Committee of the Senate is charged with finding out.\n  I am also amazed that we have members of the committee who would \nsuggest they ought to have the right to question witnesses. It is \nimportant for the U.S. Senate to know that, by a unanimous vote of the \ncommittee, we charged the professional staff with the responsibility of \ngoing forward to take depositions and at no time was any member of that \ncommittee barred from the right to attend those depositions and to \nquestion any and all witnesses. So I am a bit surprised today that any \nmember of the Ethics Committee would come to the floor using the \nargument that they did not have the opportunity to question all of the \nwitnesses of whom questions were asked and depositions were taken. That \nis not true. What is true was that they had that right but, because of \nthe vastness of the investigation, we spread the bulk of that \nresponsibility to the professional staff of the Senate Ethics \nCommittee.\n  I also remember arguing and agreeing and voting unanimously to not \nleave one stone unturned, to examine all allegations, to ask all \nparties under which allegations had been launched as to any kind of \nrelationship or involvement Senator Packwood had with any individual. \nAnd I must say, in all fairness, in a wholly bipartisan voice, that the \ncommittee responded in an exhaustive bipartisan, nonpartisan fashion. \nSo there is a precedent here, and it is a precedent of risk.\n  It is a precedent of politicizing. It is a precedent of making \npartisan this very nonpartisan approach to dealing with the discipline \nof U.S. Senators. Discipline is the responsibility of the Senate and of \nits calling, and all of us understand that. And all of us for 32 years \nin this body have taken it most seriously. Every Senator has one \nabsolute uncontested right--that when the Ethics Committee renders its \nfinding and its decision, and it brings it to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate for a full public debate, that any Senator can investigate and \nreview those findings, make a determination, argue for or against, \noffer amendments to change judgments and decisionmaking, and proceed in \nthat fashion. That is the way we have always functioned.\n  As the chairman of the committee said, never before in the middle of \na proceeding has it ever occurred to the U.S. Senate to abruptly \nattempt to cause the rules of the Senate to be changed because a \nSenator comes to the floor arguing that something in an alternative \nfashion ought to be done. The Senate has the rule. The Ethics Committee \nhas made a decision, and the decision was not to hold public hearings. \nThe fundamental reason has already been stated, time and time again--\nupon advice of the professional staff. All of the information was \navailable.\n  So if hearings are for the purpose of allowing the public to know and \nto collect additional information and the second criteria had been met, \nthen what about the first criteria? That criteria has also been met, \nand that is to provide full public disclosure of all relevant \ninformation, which is nearly 100 percent of all of the documentation \nthat has been put before the committee for its process.\n  So I have one simple closing plea that I offer to my colleagues, my \nfellow Senators. I hope they are listening this afternoon in their \noffices, and I hope that they will come to the floor to vote with this \nin mind. I ask my colleagues \n\n[[Page S11173]]\nto allow us to finish our decisionmaking process, to allow us to bring \nto the floor in a responsible fashion our findings and our conclusions \nand our recommendation, and then for the Senate to do as they have done \nhistorically, and I believe responsibly: Judge us, judge our findings, \nand vote accordingly. I hope that is the case. I hope you will allow us \nto finish our work in a responsible fashion in defense of the victims, \nand in respect for the process, recognizing that in the end Senator \nPackwood, too, has rights, and that we respect all parties as we work \nthis issue to bring about that conclusion that I hope this Senate will \nhonor and recognize in its vote on this issue this afternoon. To \nfulfill that request, your vote would be to oppose the Boxer amendment, \nwhich I believe is the appropriate vote in allowing this committee to \ncontinue to function with its responsibility at the request of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Forty-nine minutes is remaining \non your side; the other side has 36 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a number of requests for time, \nso I am going to have to start allocating minutes, fewer minutes than I \nhad hoped. Senator Kassebaum has indicated she wants to speak. Senator \nHutchison has indicated she wants to speak. Senator Simpson is here. \nSenator Brown is here. But I believe Senator Brown is really sort of \nnext in order. I would like to give to Senator Brown 10 minutes.\n  I yield Senator Brown 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I \nappreciate the time.\n  The Senate is now deliberating a change in its rules, and ostensibly \nthe question that should be before us is one of openness. I am for \nopenness. I believe in openness and in sharing information--I think it \nis the foundation of our democracy. I am not just verbally for \nopenness. I was a sponsor of Colorado's sunshine law. It is probably \none of the most--or the most--progressive laws in the country. It \nguarantees open meetings. It talks about open records. It even \nguarantees that whenever legislators get together, even in a caucus, \nthat the press is allowed to be there to make sure that information \ngets out to the public.\n  I not only advocate openness, I vote for it. But Members should be \naware that the amendment before us is not just about openness. The \ndeliberations of the Ethics Committee will come to the floor regardless \nof how they rule, and they will be open, they will be public, and they \nwill be subject to debate. And the information will be there.\n  The decision has already been made to make the information, the \ndocuments, and the investigation public. This debate is not about \nwhether or not the facts about this case become public. They will \nbecome public, and the documents will be open and available.\n  This debate goes to a different problem, one that is always possible \nwith investigations of this type. The danger in this or in any \ninvestigation is that it will become bottled up in committee and never \nheard of again. I served 7 years on the House Ethics Committee. It is \nmy impression that this problem surfaced on a number of occasions and \nthat people who committed serious infractions simply waited for their \nterms to end while the committee investigated. Often the matter was \nnever brought forth in time.\n  Even though openness and access to the public are important, Mr. \nPresident, it may surprise some to know that the House rules \naccommodated delay and coverup. They allow the committee to continue to \ndeliberate and never bring the matter to a close thus keeping it from \nthe public. I voted against those House rules.\n  But amazingly, the sponsor of this amendment voted for those House \nrules, consistently voting for rules which allowed the Ethics Committee \nto bottle up complaints. That is not openness, Mr. President. That is a \nvote for closed Government and turning a blind eye toward ethics \nviolations.\n  In 1983, Mr. President, there was a motion on the floor of the House \nto create a select committee to investigate alterations in hearing \ntranscripts, a serious infraction. Believing in openness, I voted for \nthat investigation. But the author of the amendment before us did not \nvote for openness. She voted against that investigation. She voted to \nclose it down, to not let people see what went on.\n  In 1983, there was a proposed change in the House rules to make it \neasier for committees to hold meetings that are closed to the public, \nprecisely the issue that we are deliberating today. I voted against \nclosed meetings. I voted against that motion in 1983 because I am for \nopenness. But the sponsor of the amendment today voted for it, voted \nfor the motion to make it easier to close meetings.\n  Mr. President, the question before us today goes beyond openness or \nclosed meetings. It is about something far different.\n  In 1987, the House had a motion to further investigate Congressman St \nGermain and to report findings back to the House. I voted for that \nfurther investigation, for the openness, and for the report. The \nsponsor of the amendment that is before us voted against it. She did \nnot vote for openness. She voted for closed meetings.\n  In 1987, further, there was a sense of the House that a special \ncommission be established to investigate an allegation of corruption of \nMembers, charging the select committee to come back with suggested \nreforms. I voted for that select committee and for that investigation \nbecause I believe in openness. But the sponsor of the amendment before \nus voted against it.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is simply this. This amendment is not \nabout openness. Each of us have had countless votes on which we can \nexpress our view and our feelings as to whether this body and the \ndemocratic process ought to be open. I am for openness, and I voted for \nit and I stand for it consistently. But this amendment is not about \nopenness. The documents in this case are open and will be available to \nthe public. The results of the deliberations will be open and publicly \ndebated in this Chamber. This amendment is about partisan gamesmanship. \nI do not think it deserves to pass.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to Senator \nExon of Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  I have been listening with great interest to the debate. It is one of \nthose painful debates that the Senate has to go through from time to \ntime, and I have been through many of them. I simply say I think we all \nowe a debt of gratitude to Members on both sides of the aisle who serve \non the Ethics Committee. It is a thankless task. I think I have \nsupported the Ethics Committee any time there has been any controversy. \nI would simply say that I have served in this body longer than any \nother Member on either side of the aisle on the Ethics Committee, and \ntherefore I think I have some claim to what I think is proper for this \nbody and for this institution and for what it stands.\n  I wish to thank personally once again now by name the distinguished \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who have served with great \ndistinction, in my view, on the Ethics Committee, as have Members of \nthe body before them, once again a totally thankless task. If I were \ncharged with an ethics violation, I would have complete confidence, I \nmight say to the President, and the Members on that side of the aisle, \nSenator McConnell, Senator Smith, Senator Craig, and likewise the three \nSenators on this side of the aisle, Senator Mikulski, Senator Bryan--\nand, of course, Senator Bryan used to serve as the chairman of the \ncommittee--and certainly the newest member of the committee has served \nwith great distinction, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  I have no ill will toward any of them. I think they have done a very \nyeoman job. But we are now down to a situation where we have to make a \ndecision, and I stand here today in defense of the Senator from \nCalifornia for what I think is a proper course of action. \n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\n  I looked through the previous open hearings that we have held in the \nSenate since I have been here, Cranston in 1991, Durenberger in 1990, \nHarrison Williams in 1981, and Herman Talmadge in 1978. I was here \nthrough all of those. And I remember the difficult task, very difficult \nvote that we as Senators were called upon to cast after the Ethics \nCommittee had made its recommendations, all of them, I might say, after \nopen hearings.\n  Therefore, I simply say that I have been quite amazed at the \nbroadside against the Senator from California for what I think is a \nvery legitimate action on her part. When she first made her \nannouncement of considering going to and asking the Senate to go on \nrecord, I intended to visit her about it and see what was behind it. \nThen about that time a Member on that side of the aisle made a public \nstatement--it has not been retracted as far as I know--that I consider \na direct threat to the prerogatives of the Senator from California, by \nsaying if the Senator from California proceeded with her action, that \nSenator on that side of the aisle might well investigate other \nprominent Members of the Democratic Party on this side of the aisle.\n  That was a threat. That should never have been made. And it is about \ntime to receive an apology for that.\n  With that statement, Mr. President, this one Senator, who tries to be \nevenhanded on these things, recognized and realized that the Senator \nfrom California was only doing what I think is right and should be \ndone.\n  The Senate of the United States is on trial. The institution is being \nlooked at by the American people today, and its credibility is on \ntrial.\n  I have no ill feelings against Senator Packwood at all. I have worked \nwith him on many, many important measures over a long period of time. I \nwould just happen to feel better, frankly, if the Senator--could I have \n2 more minutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. One more minute to the Senator. I am running out of time. \nOne more minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I hope that maybe Senator Packwood would be better served \nby open hearings.\n  In closing, let me say that if the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom California fails, the Senate fails, and the time will never come \nwhen the Senate can redeem itself in the eyes of the public and/or the \neyes of itself. The Senate self-esteem is at issue. It was important \nyesterday. It is important today. It will be important tomorrow.\n  The Senate itself is on trial, and I hope that it does not fail in \naccepting the amendment offered by the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom California, [Mrs. Feinstein].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support my colleague and her resolution, \nwhich I believe is appropriate, fitting, and not partisan. I do not \nbelieve that she had in mind a partisan effect at all. I believe she \nhad in mind being able to conclude a process in a way which gave much \nfresh air and clarity and credibility to it. So I am pleased to support \nher.\n  I think every member of the Ethics Committee has worked hard in what \nhas been a very difficult case. None of us likes to sit in judgement of \nanother, and certainly the Senator at issue is one who is competent, \nwho has had great credibility and great standing in this body.\n  Nonetheless, I came here in 1992, and this issue was very much with \nus in 1992. The allegations and the statements of the accusers have \nbeen printed and published all over the United States. The question \nreally is, are they credible statements? And this question can only be \nanswered by a hearing.\n  I heard the distinguished chairman of the Ethics Committee say 264 \nwitnesses had been interviewed but, of course, that is by staff. The \nSenator from New Hampshire said, well, any member of the committee \ncould sit in and listen to those depositions. That is not likely to \nhappen with the busy nature of the life we lead in this body.\n  Human beings are certainly not perfect, and there may well be \nmitigating circumstances, but I think sexual misconduct, and \nparticularly sexual harassment, is often misunderstood. It means \ndifferent things to different people.\n  What is compelling to me is that 9 out of the 18 accusers have \npublicly asked for public hearings. Generally, this is not true. \nGenerally, women do not want to come forward publicly. However, these \nwomen have publicly asked for the hearings.\n  As the Senator from California, my colleague, has pointed out, in \nevery one of these cases, when the investigation has been completed, \nthere has in fact been a public hearing. As I have heard stated on this \nfloor, the reason not to have a public hearing is often to protect the \naccuser or the person who provides the testimony. However, that is not \nthe case here.\n  I think the only way to successfully conclude this is with a public \nhearing. Why? Because questions can be asked. Questions can be \nclarified. Issues can be probed. And the degree of culpability can be \nestablished. Perhaps that is very low. Perhaps it is very great. \nWithout a hearing, I have no way of knowing, as a non-Ethics Committee \nmember.\n  Another reason that is important to me is the allegations have all \ntaken place in the course and scope of the individual's duties as a \nU.S. Senator. This is not private, personal conduct. This is conduct \nthat took place in public service, and many of the people involved are \nthemselves Federal employees. So I think these allegations involve \nconduct about which a hearing must be held and a decision must be made.\n  Is it acceptable? Is it not? If it is not, to what degree? I think \nissues revolving around sexual misconduct are issues that need to see \nthe clarity of day and the openness of probing questions, and their \nresolution. So I am very proud to support my colleague from California \nand to stand and say that I believe her motives were of the highest. \nAnd I am hopeful that this body will conclude the process as rapidly as \npossible.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank my friend from California.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nwould like to begin by paying tribute and gratitude to Members on both \nsides of the aisle who served on the Ethics Committee. They bear an \nenormous burden. There are too few here willing to serve. And we should \nall understand the difficulty of that service.\n  Whether willful or not, Mr. President, the effect of denying a public \nhearing here is to sweep away the human voices and to replace them with \npaper. That is a denial of process. And it is a reversal of the very \ncommitment made by the U.S. Senate recently where we voted to live the \nway other Americans live. If probable cause was found in a case of \nsexual misconduct against an American citizen, that American citizen \nwould find themselves in a public situation facing an accuser, having a \npublic review. It is only because there is this hybrid entity called an \nEthics Committee that was set up, in a sense, to try to guide this \nspecial institution through its life that there is now a denial of that \nopen process.\n  It is contrary to all prior precedent where you have had a finding of \nprobable cause, where you have found substantial and credible evidence. \nIn every substantial and credible evidence case, the U.S. Senate has \nhad a public hearing. If we are going to apply the standard which \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are now suggesting, that when \nyou build a sufficient record of depositions, you can make a judgment, \nthat because it is encyclopedic you do not have to have a hearing, then \nlet us end the Whitewater hearings today. Maybe we should come in here \nwith a resolution as an addendum to this to say we have an encyclopedia \nof depositions. Let them speak for themselves. We do not have to hear \nfrom all these other people. I know my colleagues would vote against \nthat. It is a double standard, double standard for Alan Cranston, \ndouble standard for John Glenn, John \n\n[[Page S11175]]\nMcCain, Don Riegle, and now here we are at a moment where the Senate \nhas to make a judgment as to whether or not depositions speak like \npeople.\n  Bob Packwood had his moment before the members of this committee. It \nwas sufficient for him to be able to come forward and look them in the \neye and be able to be asked questions. But our colleagues are being \ndenied that same right to provide a record. That is what is important \nhere, Mr. President, the question of whether there will be a \nsufficiency of a record for the U.S. Senate, where people are put to \nthe test. It may help Bob Packwood to have some of these people asked \nquestions publicly, to have the full measure of these accusations \njudged by the American people, not off paper that everybody knows they \nwill never read, but in the full light of day. That is what this is \nreally about. Staff doing a deposition is not a Senator asking a \nquestion within public scrutiny of the hearing process.\n  So I respectfully suggest, Mr. President, that based on precedent, \nbased on the standard we have accepted in the Senate, based on the best \nmeans of providing process in this situation, i.e., adequate capacity \nto ask questions and to judge answers, it is appropriate for the Senate \nto explore this in public. And it is interesting to hear my colleagues \nsuggest that somehow this is popular----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Can I have 1 additional minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. KERRY. I hear the notion of popularity. There is a reason that \none is popular and one is not. That is because one judgment is correct \nand the other is not. This is not a matter of partisanship, and it \nshould not be. But it is highly inappropriate to apply a different \nstandard that suggests that we are going to shut the door and sweep \naway the human capacity to speak to what has happened. These probable \ncause issues rise not just to the question of sexual misconduct, but \nthey rise to the question of obstruction of justice, they rise to the \nquestion of a breach of ethics with respect to assistance in job \nfinding for personal family members. And it is very hard to explain why \nall of a sudden sufficiency of record will be in depositions without \nsenatorial participation. If that is the new standard around here, then \nlet us fold up Waco, let us fold up Whitewater. Let us just do the \ndepositions and live by that standard across the board. So the test \nhere is very, very clear. And I congratulate my colleague for having \nthe courage to bring it before the Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield 5 minutes to my friend from Connecticut. I \nwant to make a point to the Senator from Massachusetts. I just want to \nthank him for coming over here because it was such a new point that was \njust injected into the debate that was worth repeating for just a \ncouple seconds. Why do we not just shut down all the committees and not \ncall one witness in any of our work and just read the depositions? That \nis what this is about. And I want to thank my friend, because obviously \nthat is ludicrous. But yet it is a standard that three members of the \nEthics Committee want to apply.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom California.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the resolution offered by the \nSenator from California. And I do so with great respect and empathy for \nthe six colleagues who are on the Ethics Committee. And I do so--it \ndoes not need to be said; I am sure it is true of all of us today--I do \nso without in any way prejudging the allegations that have been made \nagainst Senator Packwood. In fact, quite the contrary. What I am saying \nin rising to support the resolution is that I believe that I, as one \nSenator, will not be able to reach the kind of informed decision I want \nto reach on the serious allegations that have been made against Senator \nPackwood without the benefit of testimony from the witnesses live \nbefore the committee, subject to examination by the members of the \ncommittee and by counsel for Senator Packwood.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has established the Ethics Committee in a \nremarkable act as a way to delegate responsibility to this committee to \nadopt standards for the behavior of the Members of this institution and \nthen to uphold those standards. As a way, if you will, to discipline, \nto set standards for our behavior, in between those times when the \nultimate judges of our behavior, namely our constituents, have the \nopportunity to vote on us.\n  The committee was established, I am convinced, to keep strong the \nbonds of trust between those of us who have been privileged and honored \nto govern and those for whom we govern. And at the heart of that trust \nis credibility and confidence in the process by which we judge each \nother. And it is on that basis that I feel so strongly that it is right \nand fair to have public hearings in this matter.\n  The precedents seem to say to me that in every case which has reached \nthe investigative stage, including, I gather, the case of former \nSenator Cranston, there have been public hearings, although in the \nCranston case the hearings were uniquely at an earlier stage. The point \nhere is to preserve public credibility on the one hand. And that \ncredibility is based on the public's assessment of the fairness of the \nprocess. But it is also critically important in terms of the judgment \nwe reach. The members of the committee will have the opportunity to \nhear the witnesses come before them, and as I have said, Senator \nPackwood's counsel will have the opportunity to cross-examine those \nwitnesses.\n  The fact also is that how can we explain to the witnesses, those who \nhave made allegations, that the doors to the judge's chamber \nessentially are closed to them, although the one against whom they have \nmade the accusations has had the opportunity to appear in person.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the committee, the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, has made an important argument and statement \nwhen he says that this would be a breach of precedent for the Senate as \na whole to intervene in ongoing ethics proceedings, without letting the \ncommittee make the judgments itself.\n  It is an important point. Let me explain to him, and I was troubled \nby it, why I am supporting Senator Boxer's resolution. I do not take \nthis resolution to amount to an intervention on a side. I do not take \nthis resolution to equal an intervention to direct a particular \nverdict, to bias the proceedings. I see this as an intervention that is \ntotally procedural and not at all substantive. It is, in fact, neutral \non the question of substance.\n  Does it create a precedent? In a sense, it builds on a precedent and \nperhaps creates a clear statement by the full Senate, which has \ndelegated our authority to govern ourselves and judge our own ethics to \nthis six-member committee. And the precedent is that the burden of \nproof should be on the committee in rejecting hearings, because the \nopenness of these proceedings is so critically important to the \ncredibility of the final judgment.\n  Let me repeat what I said as one Senator as to why I am supporting \nthis resolution to the members of the committee.\n  We give them a tremendous responsibility, and it is a difficult \nresponsibility, to spend all this time, to hear all this evidence and \nto come back and report to us. On the basis of that, we make these \nterribly difficult judgments about our colleagues.\n  This Senator is saying respectfully to the members of this committee, \nI feel that I will not have all the information I need to make an \ninformed judgment on the charges against our colleague from Oregon \nunless the committee has the opportunity to hear and confront those who \nhave made these serious allegations and to cross-examine them. That is \nwhy I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in that \nspirit, will vote to support the resolution of the Senator from \nCalifornia, understanding it does not in any way prejudge the case. \nQuite the contrary, it suggests the desire that all of us have for the \nfullest possible information before we reach a conclusion in this case.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair. \n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is not an easy matter for me. I am on \nthe Finance Committee. Bob Packwood is my chairman. I have known Bob \nPackwood, I have served with Bob Packwood for many years.\n  But I believe that we as Senators have a higher calling. It is not \nfriendship--though friendship is very important--it is more important \nthan friendship. It is fulfilling our responsibility of public service; \nliving up to our obligation to the people we represent.\n  When I first came to the Congress, there was a joint conference \nmeeting on a tax bill, a major tax bill. I wanted to learn a little bit \nabout the tax bill. I wanted to learn how Senators and House Members \ndecide matters in a conference. But I had a hard time finding where the \nconferees were meeting. Finally, I asked myself, ``Who would know where \nthe conferees were meeting?'' This is about 20 years ago, about 1975.\n  Mike Mansfield, the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, I thought \nought to be able to tell me where the conferees are meeting. I went to \nhis office. They told me. I went to the meeting. There was a policeman \nstanding at the door. I said, ``I am a Member of Congress.'' He said, \n``OK, go in.''\n  It was the House Ways and Means Committee hearing room: A sea of \nexecutive branch people. Secretary Bill Simon was there. Senator \nRussell Long, chairman of the conference, was talking about when he was \na boy back years ago in Louisiana. Al Ullman, chairman of the Ways and \nMeans Committee, was talking. Then Jimmy Burke of Massachusetts walked \nup to me and said I had to leave. ``Why,'' I asked.\n  He said, ``Because of the rules.''\n  I said, ``What rules?''\n  He said, ``The Senate rules.''\n  I asked, ``What Senate rules?''\n  He said, ``Just the rules.'' He said, ``Nobody else can be in here; \nnobody else; no other Senator or Congressman. It is closed to \neverybody--closed to the public, closed to the press, closed to Members \nof the House, closed to the Senate.''\n  I said, ``That is wrong. And I am going to do something about it.''\n  That afternoon, I stood up on the floor of the House and I said it \nwas time to change this rule.\n  Ab Mikva, then a House Member, got up and agreed with me. And the \nnext year we had the rules changed, so now all conferences are open to \nthe public. I am very proud of that.\n  And I am also very proud of my home State of Montana and a provision \nwe have in our State constitution requiring that all public meetings be \nopen. It causes a certain burden on our Governor, a burden on certain \nState officials who would rather, in some instances, not to have \neverything open, but it is open. And the public benefits from this \nopenness. In Montana, we know what our State government is up to. This \nhas helped tremendously to increase confidence in the people of the \nState of Montana in State government. It has made a big difference.\n  I just stand here, Mr. President, basically to say that we have a \nmuch higher calling and honor to perform the public trust; that is \nopenness. The U.S. Congress now is at one of its lowest ebbs in public \npopularity in modern history. Seventy-five percent of the public \ndistrust the Congress.\n  I say one way, albeit a small way, to help regain some trust that the \nAmerican people have lost in this institution is to open up everything. \nOpen up the Ethics Committee investigation. What is there to hide? \nSure, there is going to be a little bit of embarrassment. It is going \nto be difficult for some people. Some people of the Senate will be a \nlittle bit put out, but in the long run, public confidence will \nincrease.\n  Again, this is a very difficult matter for me to address, because I \nam on the Finance Committee. But I feel very strongly that fair and \nopen hearings are the right thing to do. I am bound to stand up and do \nwhat I think is right. I think we should vote for the resolution \nsponsored by the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-four minutes are left, and on the other \nside, 11 minutes are left.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will not support the Boxer amendment. \nI have to say that it is a tempting proposition probably for a lot of \nus because on its face, I think it is a perfectly reasonable request, \nbecause, after all, what is wrong with letting the sunshine in on all \nthe business we do around here?\n  But there is an important reason for holding public hearings \ngenerally, because you hold public hearings, do you not, so the truth \ncan be known to the public? It allows the public then to judge the \ncredibility of what we do as a body. Public disclosure, in general, \nhelps this process.\n  There are three elements of what has helped our democracy endure and \nflourish: seeking the truth, holding people accountable, and dispensing \njustice. It is my belief that the Senator from California, hopefully, \nwants all three of those elements to prevail in the case of Senator \nPackwood. I think we agree with those elements. We support those \nelements.\n  The Senate does have a process, however, for achieving all three of \nthose elements. Of course, it begins with the relevant committee and it \nends with the action of this full body. This process is set up to \ngather facts, and it is set up to learn the truth. It must then \nevaluate the facts, it must assign responsibility, and then it sets \nappropriate punishment.\n  I might add that the Ethics Committee is not yet finished with its \nown part of the process. To me, this is a very key point, and I will \nreturn to that point in just a minute.\n  But during the Senate process, sometimes it is necessary to air the \nfacts publicly, sometimes not.\n But I would stress that closed hearings are OK if, and only if, the \npunishment at the end of the process fits the facts because, otherwise, \nthe process opens itself up to legitimate criticism. Public hearings \nare necessary when a problem of credibility arises, as in the Anita \nHill case, or if the punishment does not fit the facts, as I have \nstated. But, Senator Boxer, the committee has to render a judgment \nbefore it can be criticized. That is my view.\n\n  By the way, the issue of public disclosure is met to a large degree \nby the committee's decision already made to disclose all the relevant \ndocuments. Of course, this is not the same as a hearing, and I do not \npretend that it is. But if the committee decides not to hold public \nhearings, then it, for sure, better do the right thing. If it does, \nthen public hearings become a nonissue, so long as disclosure of \ndocuments is made. If it does not, then a motion to recommit is in \norder and the Senate should then demand open hearings. That is because \nthe credibility of the committee's decision would have been questioned. \nBut the key is, for Senator Boxer and my colleagues, the committee must \nrender a judgment first before we can credibly call into question the \ncommittee's work. In the past, the committee process has produced \nunacceptable results that did not fit the facts, and that process has \nbeen rightly criticized. The Ethics Committee has been criticized in \nthe past for whitewashing and dispensing mere slaps on the wrist, when \na much harsher punishment seemed to be justified.\n  This Senator has joined in that criticism. I also intend to vote \nagainst the McConnell amendment, as well, because of the first finding \nof the amendment that would say this: ``The Senate Committee on Ethics \nhas a 31-year tradition of handling investigations of official \nmisconduct in a bipartisan, fair, and professional manner.''\n  Mr. President, I am not so sure that I can support an amendment with \nthat language, because I think too often in the past--and, of course, \nthis is not under Chairman McConnell's able leadership, but well before \nhim--the committee has acted too timidly, and I \n\n[[Page S11177]]\nthink it is important to not regard that too lightly.\n  And it is not just the Ethics Committee. I have had my own battles \nwith the Armed Services Committee on closed versus open hearings. I \ntied up the Senate for 2 days at the end of the last Congress on a \nnomination that you will recall was General Glosson's promotion. I \nshould add that I did so with the help of the Senator from California. \nThe committee had recommended that General Glosson retire with a third \nstar. We felt that the facts of the case dictated that he should not \nget such a promotion.\n  The committee recommended a third star, despite the fact that General \nGlosson had tampered with the promotion board. This was a serious \noffense because it jeopardized the integrity of the military promotion \nprocess, and the committee had a history of cracking down on such \ntampering.\n  Also, the Defense Department inspector general found that Glosson \nlied under oath during the investigation.\n  Mr. President, no evidence was uncovered at that time that overturned \nthese serious charges. As the committee deliberated over the facts in \nthe case and its recommendations, I took the posture of informing of \nthe committee's judgment.\n  Yes, I believed in General Glosson's case there should be a public \nhearing, but I did not demand one. I wanted to give the committee a \nchance to do the right thing without it, a chance to make \nrecommendations to be commensurate with the facts of that case. The \ncommittee chose to review the matter in several closed hearings.\n  If the closed-hearing process would produce a verdict commensurate \nwith the merits, I would have had no problem. Under that scenario, \npublic hearings in the Glosson case were, in my mind, irrelevant. It is \nthe dispensing of a just remedy that I was most concerned with.\n  Well, the committee had several hearings and availed itself of the \ninformation I provided. Nonetheless, the committee recommended a third \nstar for General Glosson. But--and this is important--it was not until \nI examined the committee's evidence and the committee's rationale in \nsupport of its decision that I decided to question the committee's \njudgment. And then I made my case on the Senate floor.\n  The committee and Senate leaders supported General Glosson --\nregardless of the facts in the case--I think out of friendship. I think \nthat is as plain then as it is today. I accused the committee of \nputting friendship over integrity.\n  My point is, the amendment by the Senator from California has a \nproper objective. But the timing is wrong. In my view, the Senator from \nCalifornia has an appropriate amendment when, and only when, the \ncommittee renders a recommendation, and when, and only when, she \nmeasures the recommendations against the facts as presented by the \ncommittee's findings, because that is when the credibility is earned \nfor persuading the public and this body of her intent.\n  I, for one, would join the Senator from California in a motion to \nrecommit if it were clear that the committee fails to do the right \nthing, because if it were clear that the Ethics Committee were once \nagain dispensing slaps on the wrist, having learned nothing then from \nthe Anita Hill experience, the Senator from California would have all \nthe moral authority in the world to insist on public hearings and \ninsist that the committee get it right.\n  But the time for sending that message is not yet upon us. So let us \nwait for the committee's recommendations first. Clearly, that is the \nright thing to do right now.\n  Finally, let me reiterate a point about Senator McConnell's \nleadership. The comments I have made with respect to the Ethics \nCommittee's past do not reflect on him. The Senator from Kentucky has \nconducted himself fairly in this case, especially in the case of \nacquiring diaries and disclosing the relevant documents. Up to this \npoint, I can find no fault with his committee's approach, and he has \nshown able leadership on a difficult issue. But I will reserve final \njudgment on his committee's work product pending its recommendations. \nThat is the proper time to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 34 minutes remaining. The Senator \nfrom California has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the pending \nmotion regarding hearings in the current Ethics Committee investigation \nof our colleague, Senator Bob Packwood.\n  I have listened very carefully to the remarks made by my colleague, \nSenator Boxer of California. Let me try to start on a positive note, a \nnonpartisan note, by outlining those areas where we agree. The Senator \nfrom California has urged us to focus our thoughts, to avoid being \ndistracted by irrelevant issues, or by peripheral considerations. She \nhas, in the past, urged us to remember what the issue is, saying, ``I \nam not the issue.''\n  I could not agree more. Senator Boxer is not the issue; partisan \npolitics is not the issue; and I will say very firmly--and I hope this \nis heard correctly--sexual harassment, even, is not the issue here. \nSenator Packwood has not been charged with that. My colleague from Iowa \nhas just spoken about another issue we were both involved in, the \nClarence Thomas hearings. Remember, too, please, in that particular \ngrievous exercise sexual harassment was not the issue in that matter \neither. I know that may be shocking to some, but Anita Hill never \ncharged Clarence Thomas with sexual harassment--ever. That was never in \nthe record, never any part of that proceeding. She wanted us to ``be \naware of his behavior and his conduct. That is all borne out in the \nrecord. You can find that to be true through the Democrats and \nRepublicans who served and anguished with regard to that.\n  The issue here is, how we do the difficult business of conducting \nethics investigations, of passing judgment on our colleagues in a way \nthat is fair and is nonpartisan? That is the issue here--the only \nissue. The issue before us is whether or not we are going to begin to \ndismantle the nonpartisan process by which such decisions are made in \nthe U.S. Senate and whether to subject gritty, tough, sometimes ugly \nethical decisions and questions to the whims of partisan majorities. \nThat is the issue.\n  I hope everyone will understand this. It is absurd to say that it is \na ``threat'' to simply note that it is a very, very bad idea to make \nthese questions contingent upon who can rally the most votes on the \nSenate floor, and, ironically, this surely cedes a terrible degree of \npower to the party in the majority. Hear that. That is not a \n``threat.'' That is as real as you can get about partisan politics.\n  We have, through the Ethics Committee, deliberately created a \nnonpartisan forum in which these questions can be addressed. It is just \nabout the worst job any Senator can have. I do not want it, would never \ntake it. Chairing that committee is a daunting task. At the very least, \nin the past, we have tried to assure the chairman and co-chairman of \nthe Ethics Committee that the process employed by the Ethics Committee \nwould be respected,\n and that the full Senate would not interfere to change the rules in \nthe middle of a case.\n\n  And I do hope that any suggestions that there is an attempt at \nsecrecy here can be swiftly laid to rest. I have been reading all this \nnow for about 2\\1/2\\ years. I read about the witnesses. I read about \nwhat they have said about Senator Packwood. I do not know what is left \nto hear--except one thing that I am anxious to hear, and that is what \nwill be said when somebody stands up and puts their right hand up and, \nunder affirmation or oath, subjects themselves to cross-examination and \nthe rules of evidence. Then I will be right here. I would love that. I \npracticed law for 18 years. Few here did.\n  I am not talking about ``leaks'' from the Ethics Committee, but it is \nsurely all out there. There is not a single new thing you are going to \nfind that is relevant. You might find some things that are not \nrelevant, or what happened that might destroy somebody else from an \nevent occurring 10 years ago, 20 years ago. \n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\n  Let the record be very clear here too. I have never received or seen \na committee deposition. That has been reported. Perhaps that is my own \nmisstatement. I have never seen a deposition. I have seen statements. \nThose statements have a very different view of the ``contact'' that \ntook place at that particular time; a very different view. Those will \ncome out. Somebody will be very hurt in that process. That is not a \nthreat. That is the way it works.\n  But I think, when we talk about secrecy, it is very difficult for \nanyone to believe that when the committee is going to release thousands \nupon thousands of pages of documents in an unprecedented airing of \nprivate information--yes, even personal diary information--I can assure \nyou that few of us, if this were happening to us, would find that to be \na laudable result. Who among the hundred of us does not know dozens, \neven hundreds of individuals who stand ready to cast all form of \naspersions upon us for things that we may have done through the \ndecades? Fortunately, I threw all mine right out there when I first \nran. It is all there for the public to see. I believe any one of us \nwould be stunned to find that there was to be a release of thousands of \npages of such allegations. I do not believe any of us would ever feel \nthat such an action, as seen by us or the public, would be called \n``covering up,'' or ``secrecy.'' What an absurdity.\n  What we are debating today my colleagues, and I hope all will \nunderstand, has nothing to do with the merits of the case in question. \nIt has to do strictly with the integrity of the process itself. It has \nto do only with whether or not we will respect the judgments of the \ncommittee with respect to the appropriate process to follow.\n  What is the appropriate process? What is it in such a case as this? \nDo we calibrate our sensitivities to the issue of sexual misconduct by \nhow much we are willing to trample upon the nonpartisan procedures of \nthe Senate in order to achieve a desired result? Do we measure our \nsensitivity by how far we are willing to go back to dredge up \nembarrassing and inappropriate conduct? No. We measure--or should \nmeasure--our sensitivity and our seriousness by the degree to which we \nensure that such charges are weighed in a nonpartisan atmosphere of \nfairness.\n  Even if Senators are to be held to a higher standard of conduct, this \nsurely does not mean we should employ a lower standard of fairness.\n  Under the current Federal law--hear this--when an individual wishes \nto bring a charge of sexual harassment, the individual has 180 days to \nfile that complaint with the EEOC if there is no State agency to handle \nthe complaint, 180 days, hear that; 300 days is the limit in a State \nwith a deferral agency.\n  There is not a single statute of limitations in America that is over \nthe limit of 6 years for sexual harassment--and Senator Packwood has \nnot been charged with sexual harassment; not one case. Not one \njurisdiction in the United States. Go back more than 6 years, and here \nwe are back in 1969, we are back in 1974, we are back in 1979 and 1980.\n  Why is there a statute of limitations? Probably because the \nreliability of such charges, such grievous charges as these, cannot be \naccurately judged at a tremendous distance from the time in which they \nwere alleged to occur.\n  I agree with Senator John Kerry, my good friend from Massachusetts. \nLet us indeed apply to ourselves the laws we apply to others because \nthe biggest one out there is the statute of limitations on tort and \nsexual harassment. It is 6 years, as far back as you can go in any \njurisdiction in this country. But in the matter of the conduct of the \nSenator from Oregon, conduct which even the Senator has himself said \nwas ``terribly wrong''----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator's 8 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. But in the matter of the conduct of the Senator from \nOregon, conduct which even the Senator has himself said was ``terribly \nwrong,'' we are dealing with charges reaching back for decades.\n  All of us will soon pore through thousands of pages of depositions to \ninvestigate charges that would not get a moment's hearing if they were \nbrought before any other jurisdiction in this country. It is \nastonishing the degree to which we go. And we do that because we are \ndifferent. These are decades after the fact. If ever there was a \n``consistent pattern'' of behavior here, the pattern ceased to exist \nsome time ago.\n  What we see here is a case study in the continuing destruction of a \nman. I ask my colleagues, how would you feel if this were happening to \nyou? There is a good reason to pose the question, because if we approve \nthe resolution of the Senator from California, someday it will happen \nto each of us, whether we ``had it coming'' or not. Our political \nopponents will see to it. Believe it. It is a sad chapter in the Senate \nhistory if this resolution passes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine, Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  On July 10, I cosigned a letter to the chairman and vice chairman of \nthe Ethics Committee urging that they hold public hearings at the \nconcluding stages of the case currently before the committee.\n  Signing that letter was not an easy step to take. But I believe it \nwas the right step to take. It was not an issue of politics; it was an \nissue of principle. The fact is, instances of misconduct know no \npartisan lines. Allegations of impropriety know no political \nboundaries.\n  My singular goal and overriding goal in this matter has been to \npreserve the integrity and reputation of this institution, and I \nbelieve we do so by opening up the final stage of an ethics process for \npublic view.\n  Let me say from the outset, though, that I have the utmost respect \nfor the hard work, dedication and integrity of the Chairman, Senator \nMcConnell, Senators, and staff of the Ethics Committee have done in \nthis case to date. Indeed, they have been assigned the most difficult \nand thankless of tasks in this institution.\n  Without question, this is a painful and difficult matter. It is tough \nfor the institution of the Senate. It is difficult for each and every \nSenator in this Chamber and everybody involved.\n  But the time has come, Mr. President, the time has come for a \ndecision to be made about the ethics process. On Monday, the Ethics \nCommittee opted not to hold public, open hearings in the case pending \nbefore them. That is a decision with which I respectfully disagree.\n  I recognize that this is a very complex and delicate process, and I \nunderstand why some Senators look upon this amendment with concern.\n  But, Mr. President, this Chamber at the top of a hill in the Nation's \nCapital is not a museum. It is not an institution that should be \nremoved from the people. And it must never be above the ideals of our \ncountry or its people. It must represent America at its very best.\n  This is a place where nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court are \ndecided. It is the place where members of the President's inner \ncircle--the Cabinet--are confirmed. And it is the part of Congress \nwhere the hope for peace is hatched through our unique role of crafting \ntreaties.\n  The U.S. Senate is not immune to some of the problems and challenges \nof our society. Throughout the history of the Senate, Members have been \ncited and reprimanded for those flaws.\n  In this case, since December 1992, the Senate Ethics Committee has \nconducted a thorough investigation into accusations of misconduct \nagainst a Member of this institution.\n  Clearly, the Senators of this committee and their staff have not \ntaken this case lightly.\n  Their analysis--released in mid-May--concluded that there exists \n``substantial credible evidence'' that the Senator has engaged in clear \nmisconduct over a period of 25 years. The committee then voted \nunanimously to proceed to the third and final investigative stage.\n  These are very difficult, very sensitive, and very disturbing \nallegations. For perhaps the first time since its creation 31 years \nago, the Ethics Committee has had to investigate charges that are not \nsimply numbers on paper. They \n\n[[Page S11179]]\nare not a series of accountant's slips or ledgers. It is about a tough \nsubject--we all know that--and it is about never tolerating that kind \nof misconduct, no matter when it occurs, no matter who the perpetrator, \nno matter what the context.\n  But the real issue that has come before this Chamber is whether to \ncontinue this matter behind closed doors or to conclude this last--and \nmost serious--phase of the investigation in full, public view by way of \nopen hearings.\n  Some have claimed that this will embarrass us as an institution.\n  Embarrass us as an institution? It is by our lack of action, Mr. \nPresident, by our failure to hold open hearings and by our embrace of \nthe institutional sanctuary of closed doors that we would embarrass \nthis institution.\n  To do otherwise would threaten those bonds of trust and faith with \nthe American people. Does this policy mean that, simply because the \nissue at hand is in the form of sexual misconduct, even less openness \nis in order? Does that mean that financial misconduct deserves open, \npublic hearings, but sexual misconduct should be a closed door policy? \nI think not.\n  The point is, if we are ever to turn back the tide of sexual \nmisconduct--which has taken years to even get into the realm of public \ndebate and dialog--open hearings must be held in this and othe cases.\n  In words attributed to Lord Acton, this point is made: ``Everything \nsecret degenerates, even the administration of justice; nothing is safe \nthat does not show how it can bear discussion and publicity.''\n  These are thoughts to bear in mind as we make our decision on this \namendment today.\n  Mr. President, this amendment takes the simple and honest step of \nshining light into the process of the U.S. Senate.\n  In the end, the issue at hand drives us to cross a new threshold for \nthis revered institution. Its significance cannot be underestimated, \nnot just in terms of fairness and justice, but in terms of what we are \nas an institution, and who we are as servants of the American people. \nIt is my hope that we will make the right decision.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield such time as she may need to \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the matter before us today is very serious and \nextremely important. It is not an issue for partisanship. It is an \nissue that demands of each of us our best judgment of what is right and \nwrong. What is right about this matter is that the Senate Ethics \nCommittee has been scrupulous about investigating every charge and \naccusation lodged against the Senator from Oregon. It is unprecedented \nin Senate history that so much time and effort has been devoted to \nassembling the facts on such a matter.\n  What is wrong is that this amendment threatens to render null and \nvoid all that has been done to date. The Ethics Committee must be \nallowed to finish its work and make its recommendations. At that point \nthe full Senate will be called upon to agree or disagree and act on the \nrecommendation. The full Senate will be heard on this matter. The \nquestion is whether we will wait to hear the Ethics Committee decision \nas our rules require us to do.\n  If we are not going to wait for the Ethics Committee's full report \nand recommendations before acting, we might as well disband the \ncommittee completely and conduct all future proceedings on the floor of \nthe Senate. I think that bypassing the committee and conducting public \nhearings at this critical moment in the Packwood case would be a \nterrible mistake.\n  If we open these hearings and overrule our bipartisan Ethics \nCommittee today, we will set the precedent that its authority can be \nusurped at any time the majority intends to make political points or \nwhatever motive the majority might have.\n  I have been asked how my position on this question pending before the \nSenate squares with my position regarding sexual harassment in the \nNavy. In the case of the Tailhook incident, the Navy conducted its \ninvestigation. I was asked if the investigations were adequate. In my \njudgment, they were not.\n  The case before us is very different. We have an investigation in \nprocess. No recommendation has yet been made. But some of our Members \nwant to make a judgment on its adequacy before it is finished. And I \nthink that is wrong; wrong for the Senate and wrong for the process we \nhave established for ethics cases.\n  I believe we should not change the rules in the middle of the case. \nIf we decide the rules should be changed, we should do so when and if \nwe have acted on the Ethics Committee recommendation and judged it to \nbe inadequate. I believe fair play to all concerned is to give our \nrespect to the process and to wait for the Ethics Committee to act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator from South Carolina will use some of \nher time right now, I would appreciate it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You mean the Senator from California, not the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I do not know who you thought I was. But it is an \ninteresting slip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend that I have no doubt in the world \nwho she is.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 3 minutes to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, other members of the Ethics Committee have \nnow all spoken on this floor on this issue, and it understates the \ncase, it seems to me, to say that this is a difficult ethics case \nrequiring tough, hard choices for everyone in the Senate. The ethics \nissues are difficult under any circumstances, especially difficult it \nseems to me in a political institution like the U.S. Senate. Our duties \nrequire us to confront not only what is convenient but rather what is \nnecessary, and the duties of those of us on the Ethics Committee \nrequire us to with fairness judge the ethics complaints that are filed \nagainst Members of the U.S. Senate. I serve on that committee not by \nchoice; I serve because I was asked, and there is no joy in that \nassignment.\n  In the committee process of the pending case, six of us who serve on \nthat committee, three Republicans and three Democrats, were faced \nfinally with the question of public hearings. I mention that the Senate \nEthics Committee has six members. I want to say that I have enormous \nrespect for every member of that committee. When confronted with the \nquestion of hearings, we voted. And the committee had a 3-to-3 vote on \nthe question of whether to hold hearings. It takes four votes to \nadvance and, therefore, the motion to hold hearings died.\n  Senator Boxer, exercising her rights as a Member, brings a resolution \nto the floor of the Senate calling for public hearings. She has asked \nthe full Senate to express its will on a matter already voted on in the \nEthics Committee and on which there was a tie vote. It is perfectly \nwithin her rights to do so. And I intend to vote for the resolution \noffered by Senator Boxer just as I voted for the resolution in the \nEthics Committee.\n  So the will of the Senate will be expressed on this issue. One thing \nis clear. When the decision is made, men and women of good will, with a \nsense of purpose and fairness, must meet their responsibilities on the \nEthics Committee and deal with the decisions in this case and bring our \ndetermination to the full Senate.\n  I want to say that I will not be critical of those who reach a \ndifferent conclusion on the issue of public hearings. I respect their \ndecision as well. But I will vote for public hearings as I did earlier \nthis week in committee. It seems to me that when the Senate has \nexpressed its will on this question--and it is an important question--\nwhatever the Senate decides, however it turns out, we must as an Ethics \nCommittee and as a Senate move to a conclusion on this case. We owe \nthat to the U.S. Senate, and we owe it to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time is remaining to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S11180]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas whatever time she may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  As a former member of the Ethics Committee, I certainly can \nsympathize with the comment Senator Dorgan made preceding my comments--\nthat there is no joy in the process in serving on the Ethics Committee. \nBut I also know the difficulties that are imposed in the process that \nthis Ethics Committee has to undertake, and I am flatly and strongly \nopposed to any effort to inject the full Senate into the committee \nprocess in midstream, and at this point.\n  It saddens me that we have reached this point, Mr. President. It \nshould be a cause of great concern to all of us on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. I would feel this same way whether it was a Member on the \nother side of the aisle or a Member on this side of the aisle. We \nshould not be debating the case at this point, but the process.\n  The Ethics Committee has one of the most difficult jobs in the \nSenate. It is never easy to sit in judgment of a colleague. But it is \nessential to the working of the Senate and to the public confidence in \ngovernment that some of us take on that role.\n  I regret that the committee is now divided on how to proceed in this \ncase. I have enormous respect for both the chairman, Senator McConnell, \nand the vice chairman, Senator Bryan. There is an honest difference of \nopinion with legitimate concerns on both sides. I believe it is a \nserious mistake to turn that honest disagreement into a partisan \nbattle.\n  I do not believe that there is any effort for a coverup. I do not \nbelieve that it was designed to be done behind closed doors. And I \nreally regret that we have reached this particular point.\n  The investigation of charges against Senator Packwood has now been \nunderway for 31 months. The committee has spent thousands of hours and \ninterviewed hundreds of witnesses. It has conducted what may be the \nmost thorough and exhaustive investigation in Senate history. Now we \nare at the end of this process, and the committee apparently is \npreparing to render its verdict, as it should.\n  Mr. President, I see no purpose in further delaying this matter by \nordering the committee to conduct public hearings on this matter that \ncould go on and on and on.\n  It is time to make a decision. That is the real question that the \ncommittee and the full Senate must address. Is Senator Packwood guilty \nof the charges leveled against him? And, if so, what is the appropriate \npunishment? I believe we must answer that question in a fair and prompt \nmanner. The committee should lay out all the evidence it has gathered, \nand then it should present its verdict to the Senate and the American \npeople. We can then focus our energy not on committee procedures but on \nthe committee product. Mr. President, that is the way it should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could take a moment, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas for her remarks. As a former member of the Ethics \nCommittee, I think she understands this process very well, and I am \nextremely grateful to her for expressing her view on this most \nimportant matter.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska, [Mr. \nKerrey].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I come to the floor to support this amendment. I must \nconfess that at first I thought it was a terrible idea. I thought the \nSenate Ethics Committee ought to complete its work and then let us make \na decision about whether the work was worthwhile. I was concerned that \nthe rhetoric was getting partisan. I was concerned as well that Senator \nPackwood could be tried in a court of public opinion as opposed to \nallowing the facts to determine guilt or innocence, and I believe the \ncharges of sexual misconduct necessitate special protection for those \nbringing the charges.\n  I have listened very carefully and particularly to the arguments of \nthe Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Bryan], who has made five very compelling \narguments. First, he observes that every case this century which \nresulted in a Senate proceeding first had a public hearing, and every \ncase which reached the final, serious investigative stage had a public \nrecord. This is our unbroken precedent.\n  Second, the Senator from Nevada points out that a justifiable reason \nmust be there for not holding public hearings in this case. Except that \nif the Senate does not want to hold public hearings because it deals \nwith sexual misconduct, there is not one. Since none of the alleged \nvictims are unwilling to endure cross-examination, our concern does not \nstand as an excuse.\n  Third, he makes a legal point that this is a case of first impression \nbecause, for the first time in Senate history, these are alleged \nvictims, citizens who came forward and filed sworn charges against a \nU.S. Senator for actions against them.\n  Fourth, the Senator from Nevada points out that he is concerned that \nthe credibility of the Senate itself to deal fairly and openly with the \ndiscipline of its Members would either be greatly enhanced or \nirreparably damaged.\n  Mr. President, he is unquestionably right. The integrity of the \nSenate is far more important than the risk of embarrassment to any \nMember.\n  Fifth, he believes that hearings would provide a valuable opportunity \nto evaluate the witnesses firsthand, not just read a written statement. \nThis last point made me believe that Senator Packwood----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the Senate is \nnot in order, and I think it is very important. This is a Senator who \nhas changed his view on this matter. Perhaps other Senators ought to \nhear his reasoning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time actually expired. If the \nSenator would like to yield more time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the Senator an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is a rather simple change and I think \nit is a very important change in our law\n governing all ethics cases including the one involving Senator \nPackwood. The simplicity and brevity of this proposed law compels me to \nread it in full:\n\n       The Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate shall hold \n     hearings in any pending or future case in which the Select \n     Committee, first, has found, after a review of allegations of \n     wrongdoing by a Senator, that there is a substantial credible \n     evidence which provides substantial cause to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has \n     occurred, and second, has undertaken an investigation of such \n     allegations. The Select Committee may waive this requirement \n     by an affirmative record vote of a majority of the members of \n     the committee.\n\n  This proposal deserves the support of any who are concerned about the \nintegrity of this institution, the Senate, as well as the integrity of \none of our Members, Senator Bob Packwood. One stands accused of \nmisconduct by citizens. He has not been convicted and deserves to be \ntreated as innocent until a judgment is rendered. The other will stand \naccused of impeding the chance for justice to be delivered if we vote \nno on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, H.L. Mencken said that ``Injustice is not so difficult \nto bear as it is made out by some to be; it is justice that is \ndifficult to bear.''\n  Let us vote yes with this truth in mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from New \nJersey [Mr. Lautenberg].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California for her \nwillingness to give me just a couple minutes.\n  I first wish to commend her for bringing the issue to the point that \nwe \n\n[[Page S11181]]\nhave, where it is being discussed openly. And that ought to be the \nfocus, because the public as well as the Senate has been working very \nhard on opening the process.\n  In the last 2 weeks we have had a couple of very serious votes on \nwhether or not lobbyists have to be open in their dealings. We have \nopenness questions on whether or not gifts are acceptable. We have \ntried to illuminate the process for the public. We all know that the \npublic trust is no longer with us and they will not be with us if this \nprocess continues to be hidden, secretive.\n  Even though our friends on the other side of the aisle say that we \nought not to interfere with the committee process, this is far above \nthe committee process. This is a matter of human rights, of individual \nrights of a woman to work and to not be harassed during her job hours.\n  This is a question of whether or not someone has violated the basic \nrules of the Senate, and we should have an open hearing. I know that \nSenator Packwood loves this institution. He has worked very hard on \nmany good issues and has delivered positively on those issues. But we \nare not judging Senator Packwood's past record. What we are making a \njudgment about is whether or not the public is entitled to know what is \ntaking place. And in my view there is no doubt about it. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut, when he spoke, suggested that even for Senators it \nwould be worthwhile to be able to gain the knowledge that would come as \na result of a public hearing.\n  Mr. President, I think we are at a crossroads, and whether or not the \nhearings are secret or public will determine what the public thinks \nabout Senator Packwood's guilt. They will condemn him absolutely if the \nprocess continues to be hidden. And I hope that our Members will take \nheed for the good of the body to insist----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That Senator Boxer's resolution goes through and that \nwe have public hearings on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in closing this debate, I wish to \nparticularly thank Senator Smith and Senator Craig, who have served \nwith me on the Ethics Committee on our side of the aisle for these 2\\1/\n2\\ long years. I wish to say that they have approached this issue in \nevery single instance with character, with integrity, with conviction \nand a sincere desire to produce the best possible result for the Senate \nand for the accused Senator.\n  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on the committee, \nuntil very recently, I think we had, indeed, succeeded in developing a \nbipartisan approach to this, and I regret deeply that this case has \nspilled over into the full Senate before it was over.\n  And that is what is before us today. Thirty-one years ago, Senator \nJohn Sherman Cooper, of Kentucky, some of the old-timers around here \nmay remember, in the wake of the Bobby Baker case, felt that there \nought to be a better way to handle misconduct charges against a sitting \nSenator. He felt we had to remove, if at all possible, these kinds of \ncases from the floor of the Senate where everything is partisan. And so \nhe suggested we have a bipartisan Ethics Committee with not too many \nmembers, just six, three on each side of the aisle.\n  This approach, coupled with the requirement that there be four votes \nto do anything affirmatively, guaranteed--guaranteed--that the results \nof any case would have a bipartisan stamp. It has been said that the \ncommittee was deadlocked when it voted 3-3. It was not deadlocked. That \nwas the decision. Because under the rules of the Ethics Committee, a 3-\n3 vote is not an affirmative act to proceed. So the decision on the \nissue of public hearings in the Packwood case has been made pursuant to \nthe rules of the committee. So the Senator from California today would \nhave us change the rules in the middle of the game--change the rules in \nthe middle of the game.\n  I would say, Mr. President, not only is it a bad idea generally \nspeaking to change the rules in the middle of the game, it is a bad \nrules change anyway. And beyond it being a bad rules change, what is \nhappening here on the floor of the Senate today is exactly what Senator \nCooper feared would happen if we did not create the Ethics Committee. \nAnd that is, have every one of these cases debated here in the most \npartisan forum imaginable, with the majority making the decision.\n  One of the astonishing things about this proceeding today is I think \nit can be totally persuasively argued that the principal beneficiary of \nthe bipartisan Ethics Committee is whichever party happens to be in the \nminority in the Senate at a given time, and yet this proposal emanates \nfrom the minority side to bring a matter out of a bipartisan forum into \na partisan forum for decision.\n  We will rue the day we go down this path. Just imagine campaign \nseason. We are out here on the floor of the Senate introducing \nresolutions to condemn Senator so-and-so because the latest poll shows \nhe is in trouble and our side may be able to pick up a seat. The \ntemptation would be overwhelming. And so that is what this vote is \nabout.\n  The reason for an Ethics Committee was that these cases would be \ninvestigated through the investigative phase without interference from \nthe Senate. And it has never been interfered with in 31 years. At the \nend of the process the committee would take an affirmative action which \nwould require at least four members, which would guarantee some \nbipartisan stamp. If the case was serious enough, bring it to the floor \nof the Senate, and at that point every Senator would have his or her \nopportunity to say whatever they felt appropriate about the work of the \nbipartisan committee. Criticize it, condemn it, applaud it, amend it, \nfilibuster it, whatever. There is an opportunity, Mr. President, for \nany Senator to have his or her fair say about this when we get through.\n  So what we are experiencing today is the great fear that Senator \nCooper had 31 years ago if we did not have an Ethics Committee. And yet \nhere we are having this debate, slowing down the disposition of the \ncase.\n  As I said earlier, candidly, it has all had an impact on the members \nof the committee. It has pulled us in opposite directions. It has tried \nto make us more political. And one of the things we are going to have \nto do, if the Boxer resolution is hopefully not approved, on the \ncommittee is to get ourselves back together again. Friendships have \nbeen strained. And we have got to get ourselves back together so we can \nfinish this case.\n  Nobody's taken a bigger beating in the last 2\\1/2\\ weeks than I have. \nI am getting to wonder who the accused is in this case.\n  But I am proud to be chairman of the Ethics Committee because I \nbelieve in this process. I think it serves this institution well and I \nthink it serves the public well. There is not going to be any coverup \nin this case. No coverup. Let us finish our work. We will release \neverything relevant to the decision. And if you do not like the penalty \nthat we recommend, recommend another one. But do not start down this \npath. It is the beginning of the end of the ethics process, which has \nserved this body well for 31 years.\n  So, Mr. President, I sincerely want to thank as well the Senators not \non the committee on this side who came over and pitched in. Frankly, I \nthought I might be the only speaker. I did not have to ask anybody to \ncome over. Senator Simpson was here. Senator Brown was here. Senator \nKassebaum was here. Senator Grassley was here. And Senator Hutchison \nwas here. And none of them on the committee. And this is the kind of \nthing your staff will whisper in your ear, ``Boy, you don't want to get \nnear this one. Vote and leave.'' And yet they came over and spoke in \nopposition to this resolution, expressed their opinion that the \nresolution was a bad idea and that the Ethics Committee ought to be \nable to finish its work.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Democratic leader \nwould like to use some leader time to speak. I do not see him on the \nfloor at the moment. So how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will for the moment reserve the balance of my time. \nI \n\n[[Page S11182]]\nmay well choose not to use it, but I reserve the balance of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and that the time in the quorum not \nbe taken out of the 8 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have to object to that. Every time, when \nI tried earlier, and I had so many people waiting, I was unable to get \nadditional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The objection is \nheard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am trying to resolve the matter. Perhaps my friend \ncan----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection has been heard, Senator.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just reserve my right. I did not say ``object.'' I \nreserve my right to object. And I would ask my friend from Kentucky----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am more than happy to yield back the time and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  Both sides had 2 hours. I do not think it is in any way unfair for \nthe time to be equal. If the Democratic leader would like to speak, it \nis my understanding the Republican leader would like to speak. \nOtherwise, we could----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a point of \nclarification?\n  The Senator from Maryland wishes to inform him, the Democratic leader \nis coming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am not aware of any additional \nspeakers on my side.\n  I gather the two leaders can speak with leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Consequently, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from California. The amendment tracks many years of precedent \nin the Senate Ethics Committee by clarifying that all cases advancing \nto the substantial-credible-evidence stage should be the subject of \npublic hearings. At the same time, it allows the Ethics Committee to \nwaive those hearings by a simple majority vote.\n  I regret that some have chosen to suggest this is a partisan matter, \nfor it is not. Furthermore, such statements distract us from the real \nissue of how the Ethics Committee and the Senate should pursue ethics \ncomplaints. I believe the Boxer amendment charts a course that is both \nwarranted and appropriate.\n  The vice chairman of the Ethics Committee and several others have \nalready outlined some of the facts that lead me to that conclusion:\n  First, under the precedent of the Senate and the Ethics Committee, in \nevery major ethics case this century, public hearings have been held. \nIn 1977, a three-tiered ethics process was adopted. Public hearings \nhave been held in all four cases that reached the final investigative \nphase under this process.\n  Second, the amendment before us today would apply to all pending and \nfuture cases that reach the final investigative phase. We must, as the \nvice chairman of the committee has suggested, consider whether or not \nthere is sufficient reason to stray from that clear precedent in any \nparticular case, including the case currently before the committee. \nThree members of the Ethics Committee have argued that we should not \nmake such an exception, though, again, I note that the Boxer amendment \nwould allow a simple majority of the committee to do so.\n  The issue before us goes far beyond the specifics of any case. If the \nevidence in a case before the Ethics Committee has reached the final \ninvestigative phase, and if there is not sufficient reason to make an \nexception for that case, then it is appropriate for the committee to \nmove forward with public hearings. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Finally, I want to commend the Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer, for offering this amendment. I also want to commend my other \ncolleagues on the Ethics Committee. We all know theirs is a thankless \njob, yet they deserve all Senators' thanks.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time is left. This will be yielded from \nleader time.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes left.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry, Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes left.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator in \nCalifornia.\n  My colleagues have spoken on both sides of this issue with eloquence \nand passion. For me, the central issue that we are debating today is \nthe simple proposition of shall there be public hearings. A vote for \nthe Boxer amendment commits this Senate to public hearings; a vote for \nthe amendment of the distinguished chairman of the Ethics Committee \nvotes not to have public hearings.\n  There has been much comment made about this somehow disrupting the \nprocess, or that it portends that in the future the minority may be \nplaced at some disadvantage.\n  What this is all about, as far as I am concerned, is that in every \ncase, whether a Member of the majority or the minority in which there \nis an ethical matter of this magnitude brought to the attention of the \ncommittee, there ought to be public hearings.\n  It has been said that precedent will be violated, 31 years of \nprecedent will be violated if, indeed, the amendment is offered and \napproved. That is true, but if we fail to support the amendment of the \nSenator from California, the Senate abandons nearly a century of \nprecedent, a precedent which has said that in every case of a major \nethics violation, public hearings have been held. If my colleagues have \nany question about that, simply call the ethics office, and they will \ntell you the same thing that they have told each and every one of us.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, where I began, and that is: Why should \nthis case be different? I am unable to reach a conclusion as to why \nthis should be different. We have another precedent, and that is for \nthe first time we have victims who seek to come forward and to present \ntheir testimony before the members of the committee. I think that we \nought to reflect for a moment on what kind of a process we support----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator his 2 minutes \nhave expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to make clear that at no time \nduring this debate or at any time during my membership on the Ethics \nCommittee have I been critical of the other members of the Ethics \nCommittee or of its current chairman. I believe that the Ethics \nCommittee has conducted itself with honor, meticulousness, and really \npursued due diligence.\n  We have an honest disagreement on the issue of public hearings. There \nis something special about the U.S. Senate. The world views us as the \ngreatest deliberative body. The rules guarantee full and complete \nopportunity for all concerned parties to speak. We have great pride in \nthe way we protect the rights of the minority.\n  It is that history and tradition that I believe that calls us now, as \nwe get ready to vote, to honor the precedent of public hearings, for \ncross-examination of witnesses, to resolve discrepancies in testimony, \nto have a fair format----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator the 1 minute has \nexpired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. A vote here is the right thing to do. It is the \nsenatorial thing to do. It is the American thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friends. I say to my colleagues \non both sides that my amendment is very respectful of the Ethics \nCommittee but is also respectful of the full Senate and \n\n[[Page S11183]]\nthe victims in this case. It is very respectful to the American people \nwho want us to open the doors, very clearly.\n  The Ethics Committee chairman says the committee has not deadlocked. \nOnly in the U.S. Senate would you say a 3 to 3 vote resulting in no \naction is not a deadlock. Clearly, the committee has deadlocked for the \nfirst time in its history.\n  The Boxer amendment says you need a majority vote to close hearings. \nI think that is very reasonable and no Senator--no Senator--from either \nparty should fear a majority vote.\n  We have had 18 Senators speak in behalf of my amendment, including \none Republican. I am a very proud Senator, as I stand here today, \nbecause when I started this, many colleagues told me that nobody cares \nabout this but the Senator from California, and that never was true.\n  Why do we care? Because we love this place, and we want it to work \nright. I read the Constitution, and article I, section 5 says each and \nevery one of us has a responsibility to make sure we police ourselves \nand do it in the right way.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has stated that I am turning precedents on \nits head. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you vote for the \nBoxer amendment, you vote to continue public hearings. We have heard it \nfrom the vice chairman of the committee; we have heard it from Senator \nMikulski. These are valued Members of this body. I know they are well \nrespected. It is not just a Senator who is not on the Ethics Committee \ncalling for public hearings.\n  Then we hear we have the documents. Is that not wonderful, let us \njust have the paper. I want to ask you, does a piece of paper talk to \nyou about the humiliation? Does a piece of paper come alive? I say not.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I note with regret that during debate on this \namendment, several Senators made reference to my record on ethics \nmatters as when I served as a Member of the House of Representatives. \nUnfortunately, their statements mis-char-acterized my record. I wish to \ntake this opportunity to clarify the record.\n  Specifically, the Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, stated that I \nrepeatedly voted against public hearings in ethics matters. In fact, \nthe opposite is true. In 1989, I supported a comprehensive ethics \nreform bill that greatly improved House ethics procedures. As a result \nof that bill, rules were promulgated requiring public hearings in the \nfinal stage of ethics cases. The Senator from Colorado opposed that \nbill.\n  Also, in cases of sexual misconduct to reach the House floor, I voted \ntwice to increase sanctions against individual Members. In those cases, \none of the accused Representatives was a Democrat and one was a \nRepublican. Senator Brown, then my colleague in the House, voted for \nincreased sanctions for the Democrat, but not the Republican.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Do not vote in favor of paper, vote in favor of people \nand support the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to hear the \ndebate. I know every second has been used. To many this is a very \nimportant matter and certainly the charges leveled against the Senator \nfrom Oregon are serious ones. There is no place for sexual harassment \nor any other form of sexual misconduct in the United States, in the \nU.S. Senate. That is point one.\n  Equally as important is point two. We do have an Ethics Committee. We \nmay not have another one again. Maybe this is the end of the Ethics \nCommittee. Maybe it should be. If they do not have any standing, if \nthey do not have any credibility, if they are not supported by the \nbipartisan leadership, I am not certain what function they can perform \nin the future.\n  It is supposed to be a bipartisan committee. That is why it is 3 to \n3, to avoid all the things we are doing right now. That is the reason \nit was implemented in this way, structured in this way, so we avoid a \ncircus on the floor if somebody felt so inclined.\n  So we have a procedure that has worked, as I understand, fairly well \nfor 31 years. I think it ought to be followed today. We have had 2\\1/2\\ \nyears of investigation in this case--2\\1/2\\ years--against Senator \nPackwood. As a part of this investigation, the Ethics Committee has \ninterviewed 264 witnesses, taken 111 sworn depositions, issued 44 \nsubpoenas, read 16,000 pages of documents and spent 1,000 hours in \nmeetings just on this case alone.\n  It is now my understanding, at least, that the Ethics Committee is \npreparing relevant information, the most detailed public submission \never made by the committee in any case. As it does in other cases, the \nEthics Committee will also recommend an appropriate sanction. And \nbefore the Senate votes on this sanction, the committee will provide a \nfull and complete record of all relevant evidence, and this record will \nbe made available to the public.\n  So I believe the American people, as they should, will have a right \nto know. The American people will know; they will have an opportunity \nto review the record, blemishes and all. It just seems to me, as \nsomeone not on the Ethics Committee--and, believe me, it is not easy to \nask your colleagues to serve on that committee; it is going to be even \nmore difficult from this day forward, I assume, unless you want to make \nit just a partisan committee, and then maybe we ought to change the \nnumbers. But I guess the real question is whether or not we are going \nto allow the Ethics Committee to do its work without second-guessing on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  The Ethics Committee should not be a political football. We have a \nprocess and that process should be followed. It has been followed in \nnumerous cases in the past. If we want to change the rules and change \nthe process, I assume we will do it as we normally do, prospectively, \nin future cases, and not in the middle of a case.\n  I can imagine what would happen if this case were on the other side \nof the aisle. The Senator from California would not be on her feet. \nThere were several cases in the House, as I understand it, and there \nwas not a word uttered by the Senator from California, who was then in \nthe House. But this is different.\n  I have confidence in the Ethics Committee. We are out here in the \nmiddle of a case--actually, at the end of this case, because I \nunderstand the committee would like to act. Now, if we do not believe \nin the integrity of the Ethics Committee, why do we not abolish it? We \ncan turn it over to the Senator from California to be in charge of \neverybody's ethics in the Senate, or to someone else who does not agree \nwith the Ethics Committee.\n  We do not agree with a lot of things that happen in committees around \nhere, but I am not certain we challenge every committee when we have a \ndisagreement and bring it to the floor and demand a public hearing on \nour issue because we did not prevail in any other committee.\n  This is the Ethics Committee. I can tell you, as the leader, that it \nis extremely difficult to ask your colleagues to serve on this \ncommittee. It is going to be more difficult if this becomes a \ntransparent effort to score partisan political points either in this \ncase or the next case. Maybe the next time it will be on this side and \nwe will want to score the partisan political points. Things that go \naround come around here, or whatever it is. I hope that is not the \ncase.\n  If I felt for a moment that there were Republicans on the Ethics \nCommittee--not in this case--who were not men of integrity, I would say \nmove right ahead. I think their integrity probably matches that of \nthose on the other side. I think they are all men and women of \nintegrity on the Ethics Committee.\n  So I hope my colleagues will defeat the amendment offered by the \nSenator from California and then adopt the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Let the committee proceed. This may be good media, but it is bad \npolicy. The press loves this. They have been flocking in all day long. \nThey like it. Going after a Member really whets their appetites, \nwhether it is this case or any other case. It is a great way to get big \nheadlines and make the nightly news.\n  But what does it do for the integrity of the Ethics Committee to \nscore a few political points at the expense of the \n\n[[Page S11184]]\ninstitution? If anybody can show me that Senator McConnell or Senator \nCraig or Senator Smith have, in some way, violated their oaths and \nviolated their obligations as members of the Ethics Committee, or \nanybody else in this Chamber, then I would say, OK, let us proceed, \nbecause they have let us down. If anybody, including the Senator from \nCalifornia, can find one scintilla of evidence that somehow the \nRepublican members prejudged or overlooked whatever they overlooked, \nwhatever the charge might be, then that is one thing.\n  So I hope I will be standing here the next time when it may be \nreversed, and I will be making the same speech, not a different one. I \nwill be saying, maybe the next time, wait a minute, we have an Ethics \nCommittee--we may or may not have an Ethics Committee, who knows. But \nif we have an Ethics Committee, and if it is evenly balanced with \nDemocrats and Republicans, then let us wait until we hear what the \ndecision is.\n  So for all the reasons I can think of--and I know it is, again, good \ntheater, but sometimes we have to look beyond the theater in this body. \nThis is a proud institution and, in my view, I think we can properly \noversee and provide appropriate remedies for misconduct by anybody in \nthis Chamber, Republican or Democrat, and I trust that is the way it \nwill be in the future.\n  Mr. President, the charges that have been leveled against my \ncolleague from Oregon are very serious ones. There is no place for \nsexual harassment or any other form of sexual misconduct in the United \nStates or in the U.S. Senate. That is point 1.\n  Point 2 is that the Ethics Committee has established procedures for \ninvestigating charges of misconduct against Members of the Senate. \nThese procedures have worked in the past, an they should be followed \ntoday.\n  During the past 2\\1/2\\ years, the Ethics Committee has been \ndiligently investigating the charges against Senator Packwood. As part \nof this investigation, the Ethics Committee has interviewed 264 \nwitnesses, taken 111 sworn depositions, issued 44 subpoenas, read \n16,000 pages of documents, and spent 1,000 hours in meetings just on \nthis case alone.\n  It is my understanding that the Ethics Committee is now preparing the \nlargest, most detailed public submission every made by the committee in \nany case.\n  As it does in other cases, the Ethics Committee will also recommend \nan appropriate sanction. And before the Senate votes on this sanction, \nthe committee will provide a full and complete record of all relevant \nevidence in this case. This record will be made available to the \npublic.\n  So, this debate is not about the American people's right to know, as \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed. The \nAmerican people will know. They will have an opportunity to review the \nrecord--blemishes and all.\n  The real question here is whether we will allow the Ethics Committee \nto do its work, without second-guessing from the floor of the Senate. \nThe Ethics Committee should not be a political football. We have a \nprocess, and that process should be followed as it has been followed in \nnumerous cases in the past.\n  If we want to change the rules, change the process, then we should do \nso prospectively, in future cases, not in the middle of this case or \nany other case, and certainly not as part of a transparent effort to \nscore partisan political points.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

And I understand they are going to take \nthe \n\n[[Page S11185]]\namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin and take an amendment from the \nSenator from Iowa. But we need to find other amendments. And we have \nhad a five-hour delay here, rain delay, that is not the fault of the \nmanagers. So we have lost five hours. So they would like to make up \nsome of that time tonight.\n  If we cannot find any amendments, we need, in fairness, to let our \ncolleagues know. If we cannot find amendments, we need to have our \ncolleagues know whether we can have a roll call, and at what time. So \nmaybe the managers can take a quick check and let the leaders know, so \nwe can advise our forces.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I urge Democratic Senators to come to the \nfloor. We have a whole series of amendments that ought to be debated. \nThis is prime time and a very important opportunity. I hope we will not \nlet it go to waste. There are Senators who have expressed their \ninterest in amending this bill, and they ought to come to the floor to \noffer these amendments.\n  I urge Cloakrooms to encourage Senators to come to the floor at their \nearliest convenience.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield to me \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

I thank the benign hand of destiny for allowing \nme to live to see one of my grandsons become a Ph.D. in physics.\n  On yesterday, Darius James Fatemi was given his Ph.D. in physics. \nSeneca is reported to have said that a good mind possesses a kingdom. \nDisraeli said, upon the education of our youth, the fate of the country \ndepends. Emerson said that the true test of civilization is not the \ncensus nor the size of cities nor the crops--no, but the kind of man \nthe country turns out.\n  You can imagine, those of you who are grandparents, and those of you \nwho may not yet be grandparents, the pride which I share with my wife, \nErma, in feeling that we have, indeed, contributed to this great \ncountry a new physicist, a doctor of physics.\n  Darius was named after Darius the Great, who became King of Persia \nupon the neigh of a horse. Darius James Fatemi did not get his \ndoctorate by the neigh of a horse.\n  We are grateful that the good Lord has blessed us with wonderful \ngrandchildren, and this is the first Ph.D. in our line. I suppose if we \nall look back far enough, may I say to the distinguished majority \nleader and to my colleagues, we would find somewhere in our ancestry a \nslave--the Greeks, the Persians, the Romans, other peoples of antiquity \nowned slaves. And so we may have an ancestor who was a slave. At the \nsame time, we may have an ancestor who was a king. But as far as I \nknow, this is the first Ph.D. in my line, and I thank the good Lord for \nthat.\n  I thank all Senators for listening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11185-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11185-S11190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FEDERAL SPENDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in pursuit of a balanced \n     federal budget, Congress should exercise fiscal restraint, \n     particularly in authorizing spending not requested by the \n     Executive and in proposing new programs.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jack \nKennedy and Floyd DesChamps, who are currently serving fellowship \nassignments on Senator McCain's staff, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor during the Senate's consideration of S. 1026, the fiscal year \n1996 national defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a simple sense-of-the-Senate \namendment stating that Congress should exercise self-restraint in \nauthorizing and appropriating funds for all Federal spending, including \ndefense spending, especially in cases where the spending has not been \nrequested by the applicable agency in the first place or is not \ndirectly related to national security needs.\n  I will just speak very briefly, because I understand the managers \nintend to accept this, but I do want to make a brief point about it.\n  I think every Member of this body is aware of the problem this sense-\nof-the Senate is intended to address. Congress passed a budget \nresolution a short time ago that called for increased defense spending \nover the next few years of more than $58 million. We ought to \nunderstand that just because there is room in the budget resolution to \nspend that extra money, it does not mean that Congress has to or is \nforced to spend it on projects that are either unnecessary or not \ndirectly related to national security interests.\n  In recent weeks, the reports, Mr. President, have been increasing. \nMedia reports have documented what they have called a business-as-usual \nattitude in Washington, DC, as many of these so-called reformers have \ngotten in line not to decrease but to add defense spending for weapons \nsystems that our military people have not even asked for. Why? Because \nthe weapons systems are built in their districts or their home States. \nThat is the simple answer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nMonday, July 31, Washington Post, entitled ``Extra Pentagon Funds \nBenefit Senators' States,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 31, 1995]\n\n             Extra Pentagon Funds Benefit Senators' States\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       While Republicans talk about a revolution in the way \n     government spends taxpayer money, in at least one area, \n     according to a new study, the GOP is now the keeper of a \n     decades-old bipartisan tradition: funneling Defense \n     Department dollars to businesses back home.\n       Of the $5 billion in weapons spending that the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee added on to President Clinton's budget \n     request, 81 percent would go to states represented by \n     senators who sit on the committee or on the Appropriations \n     defense subcommittee.\n       This includes $1.4 billion for an amphibious assault ship \n     built by Ingalls Shipbuilding, a huge employer in Sen. Trent \n     Lott's state of Mississippi and partial funding of $650 \n     million for two Aegis destroyers built by Ingalls and Bath \n     Iron Works in Sen. William S. Cohen's state of Maine. \n     Republicans Lott \n\n[[Page S11186]]\n     and Cohen are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Cohen \n     chairs its seapower subcommittee, nicknamed the \n     ``shipbuilders subcommittee,'' which decides the fate of most \n     sea-related military equipment.\n       Defense officials admit they do not need either ship to be \n     ready to fight two wars nearly simultaneously, which is the \n     standard set for all branches of the military by the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff. But, said a senior defense official, ``If I \n     don't get some of these ships, I'm going to have to keep some \n     older ships in the fleet.''\n       The ships are just the most expensive examples of \n     congressional add-ons to the $258 billion presidential budget \n     request, which all the Republican chairman of House and \n     Senate defense-related committees believe is too low. The \n     Senate Armed Services Committee added about $7 billion to \n     Clinton's request. The House added nearly $10 billion. The \n     full Senate is to take up the defense spending bill in \n     August.\n       Of the 44 military construction projects that the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee added to the defense budget, 32 of \n     them--and 73 percent of the $345.8 million in add-ons--went \n     to states represented by senators on one of the two defense \n     committees, according to the same study. The study is a \n     culling of the defense bill programs compiled by the Council \n     for a Livable World, a Washington-based organization that \n     advocates decreased defense spending.\n       ``They have added [these programs] not for national \n     security reasons, but to help members of Congress,'' said \n     Council President John Isaacs. ``It is absolutely business as \n     usual. This is a practice as common among Republicans as \n     Democrats. Changes of parties, changes of ideology don't \n     matter.''\n       Technically, the Defense Department is supposed to \n     wholeheartedly support the president's budget request. But \n     when the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate defense \n     committees asked the services this year to come up with a \n     wish list if they had more money, not one balked.\n       That is the one reason, defense officials said, they did \n     not want to be named in this article, or even identified as \n     Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine.\n       Many items at the top of the services' wish list showed up \n     on the Senate committee's list. Among them: 12 extra F-18 \n     Hornet fighter jets for $564 million, built in the states of \n     Sens. Christopher Bond (R-Mo.) of the Appropriations \n     subcommittee on Defense and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) of \n     the Armed Services Committee; 20 extra Kiowa Warrior \n     helicopters for the Army, built by companies in states of \n     Armed Services Committee members Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-\n     Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.). Sen. Phil Gramm (R), the other \n     senator from Texas, is on the Appropriations defense \n     subcommittee.\n       ``To be very honest, yes, Senator Coats certainly is very \n     concerned when there are Indiana companies that have a tie-\n     in--that is a consideration,'' said Coats's press secretary, \n     Tim Goeglein. ``But if Senator Coats feels that is money the \n     Armed Services Committee should not be budgeting, he would \n     not support it.'' A spokeswoman for Cohen's office sent a \n     copy of the committee's bill to explain why Cohen had voted \n     to spend more money than requested. It says the committee \n     believes ``the procurement of basic weapons and items of \n     equipment has been neglected during the decline in defense \n     spending'' and that it would be cheaper to order more now \n     than wait until a time when production costs could be higher.\n       Kennedy was not the only Democrat who benefited in the \n     committee bill. The committee decided to buy three CH-53 \n     Super Stallion helicopters for the Marines at a cost of $90 \n     million. They are produced by General Electric Co. in \n     Massachusetts and United Technologies Corp. in Democratic \n     committee member Joseph I. Lieberman's state, Connecticut.\n       Kennedy did not support adding money to the president's \n     request, said a spokesman for the Massachusetts senator, but \n     when he realized Republicans were going to do it anyway, ``he \n     wanted to see the money spent as best as possible.'' He said \n     Kennedy believes the helicopters will help the Marines \n     improve their countermine warfare efforts.\n       ``All politics is local,'' one defense official said. ``If \n     I'm a defense contractor I'm going to do everything I can to \n     locate in a powerful chairman's district because I have \n     immediate access. Jobs are important on the Hill.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am not suggesting that we should only fund weapons \nsystems requested by the Pentagon, or that because the Pentagon has \nasked for something, that Congress should automatically vote to provide \nthem with their wish list.\n  What I am saying is that when Members of Congress start adding things \nto the Department of Defense spending list, we ought to give extra \nspecial scrutiny to those items that the administration never even \nrequested.\n  I think we ought to be looking carefully to make sure those \nadditional items, in fact, are related to national security needs, not \njust a source of jobs back home. There are better ways to provide those \njobs than building new weapons that we do not need, are not wanted by \nthe military, and further drain our National Treasury.\n  Mr. President, my sense of the Senate is simply intended to make a \ncommonsense statement. We do not have to spend it all just because the \nbudget allows it. Let us apply some fiscal discipline and restraint in \nall budget areas, including the Department of Defense.\n  I do hope the amendment will be accepted, as has been indicated to me \npreviously. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we will accept the amendment on this \nside.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the amendment makes sense. I urge our \ncolleagues to accept it on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2082) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2083\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit a waiver of the time-in-grade requirement for a \n  retirement in grade of an officer who is under investigation or is \n   pending disposition of an adverse personnel action for misconduct)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment, I do not think, will be \ncontroversial. I hope it has been cleared on both sides. I believe it \nhas. My amendment will modify section 505 of the bill.\n  Section 505 of the bill streamlines the procedure for retiring our \nmost senior military officers. That means admirals and generals who \nhold three- or four-star rank. Under current law, the President must \nnominate the most senior officers for retirement, which involves \nsenatorial confirmation under existing law. If a three-star or four-\nstar officer is not nominated or not confirmed under current law, that \nindividual then, as we all know, reverts to his or her permanent grade, \nwhich, obviously, is lower.\n  For a three-star general, as an example, this could mean retirement \nwith a two-star, or even a one-star grade, I believe. I hope I \nunderstand it well. section 505 would eliminate Senate confirmation. \nThat means section 505 of this bill would do away with Senate \nconfirmation of three-star and four-star officers who are retiring.\n  When Senator Hutchison and Senator Nunn, and others, first introduced \nthis measure, it was introduced as S. 635 and introduced on March 28 of \nthis year. At that time, I very much opposed the idea, and I joined \nSenator Boxer and Senator Murray in signing a letter to the committee \non May 11 of this year expressing opposition to the bill by Senators \nHutchison and Nunn. We felt that S. 635 would undermine congressional \noversight, that it would undermine civilian control of the military, \nand would undermine accountability.\n  Our most senior military officers, we felt--because they are \nentrusted with tremendous power and responsibility--ought to, in all \ninstances, be proven to do that. So, for that reason, and that reason \nalone, we feel that they must be held to the very highest possible \nstandards.\n  Well, section 505 of this bill is not much different from the \noriginal S. 635. The language has not changed much, but I can say that \nwe have changed as we viewed the intent of the Nunn-Hutchison bill.\n  Our initial reaction to S. 635 was tempered by several very difficult \nand controversial retirement nominations last year. Remember Admiral \nKelso, Gen. Buster Glosson, General Barry, Admiral Mauz. We thought \nthat we had good reason to question those nominations for retirement. \nWe thought our concerns were justified. We still do.\n  Well, after the Hutchison-Nunn bill was introduced, I asked the \nAmerican Law Division of the Congressional Research Service to assess \nall of the bill's implications. Mr. Bob Burdette, legislative attorney \nwith the division, was kind enough to prepare a very thoughtful and \nhelpful analysis of the proposed changes to the law, as suggested by \nour colleagues. Mr. Burdette's report helped to lay most of my concerns \nto rest.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that report printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n\n[[Page S11187]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, July 20, 1995.  \n     To: Hon. Charles E. Grassley. Attention: Charlie Murphy.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: The Legal Effect of Enacting Section 505 Of S. 1026, \n         104th Cong., 1st Sess., Respecting Retirements of \n         Commissioned Officers Who Have Served At Grades O-9 and \n         O-10.\n       This memorandum explains the legal effect of enacting \n     Section 505 of S. 1026, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995). This \n     section of the proposed legislation would make four changes \n     in the provision presently codified at 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370. \n     By way of ``conforming amendments,'' this section would also \n     repeal provisions presently codified at 10 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 3962(a), 5034, and 8962(a).\n       The proposed legislation would not amend paragraph (1) of \n     subsection (a) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370. That is, regardless of \n     whether the proposed legislation is enacted, this paragraph \n     will still specify a general rule that a commissioned officer \n     of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine corps shall, except \n     as provided in paragraph (2) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370(a), be \n     retired in the highest grade in which he served on active \n     duty satisfactorily for at least six months.\n\n\n                     section 505(a)(1) of the bill\n\n       The first change, which would be made by section 505(a)(1) \n     of the bill, is substantive in nature. It would strike out \n     the words ``and below lieutenant general or vice admiral'' \n     which presently appear at 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370(a)(2)(A). With \n     such words excised from subparagraph (A) of Sec. 1370(a)(2), \n     that subparagraph would read, as follows:\n       In order to be eligible for voluntary retirement under any \n     provision of this title in a grade above major or lieutenant \n     commander [...], a commissioned officer of the Army, Navy, \n     Air Force, or Marine Corps must have served on active duty in \n     that grade for not less than three years, except that the \n     Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a \n     military department to reduce such period to a period not \n     less than two years in the case of retirements effective \n     during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990.\n       As a consequence of the excision, commissioned officers \n     serving, or who have served, at the grades of O-9 and O-10 \n     would be eligible to retire at such grades only after serving \n     at them for at least either three years or, if authorized by \n     both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the \n     military department concerned, as little as two years in the \n     case of retirements occurring during the specified nine-year \n     window.\n       Subparagraph (B) of Sec. 1370(a)(2) would not be amended by \n     the proposal. Hence, it would still confer none-delegable \n     authority on the President to ``waive subparagraph (A)'' in \n     individual cases involving either extreme hardship or \n     exceptional or unusual circumstances. In other words, a \n     relevant presidential waiver made under the conditions \n     specified could render a particular commissioned officer \n     above the grade of O-4 (albeit now including officers \n     serving, or who have served, at the grades of O-9 and O-10) \n     eligible to retire at the highest grade at which that officer \n     had served without regard to the length of time he had served \n     at that highest grade.\n\n\n                     section 505(a)(2) of the bill\n\n       The second change, which would be made by section 505(a)(2) \n     of the bill, is likewise substantive in nature. It would \n     strike out the words ``and below lieutenant general or vice \n     admiral'' which presently appear at 10 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1370(d)(2)(B). Subsection (d) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 \n     relates generally to retirements of reserve officers under \n     chapter 1225 of Title 10. Paragraph (1) of 10 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1370(d) specifies that a person entitled to retired pay \n     under chapter 1225 is to be credited with satisfactory \n     service in the highest grade in which that person served \n     satisfactorily at any time. With the relevant words excised \n     from subparagraph (B) of Sec. 1370(d)(2) as indicated in the \n     proposed legislation, that subparagraph would read, as \n     follows:\n       In order to be credited with satisfactory service in an \n     officer grade above major or lieutenant commander [...], a \n     person covered by paragraph (1) must have served \n     satisfactorily in that grade (as determined by the Secretary \n     of the military department concerned) as a reserve \n     commissioned officer in an active status, or in a retired \n     status on active duty, for not less than three years. A \n     person covered by the preceding sentence who has completed at \n     least six months of satisfactory service in grade and is \n     transferred from an active status or is discharged as a \n     reserve commissioned officer solely due to the requirements \n     of a nondiscretionary provision of law requiring that \n     transfer or discharge due to the person's age or years of \n     service may be credited with satisfactory service in the \n     grade in which serving at the time of such transfer or \n     discharge, notwithstanding failure of the person to complete \n     three years of service in that grade.\n       As a consequence of the excision, reserve commissioned \n     officers serving, or who have served, at the grades of O-9 \n     and O-10 would be eligible to retire at such\n      grades only after serving at them for at least either three \n     years or, in the specified circumstances, as little as six \n     months.\n       It might be pointed out that no authority is presently (or, \n     under the proposed legislation, would be) conferred on the \n     President to ``waive subparagraph (A)'' in individual cases \n     involving either extreme hardship or exceptional or unusual \n     circumstances. Thus, eligibility for high-grade retirement \n     presently does (and under the proposed legislation would \n     continue to) differ as between regular and reserve officers.\n\n\n                     section 505(b)(1) of the bill\n\n       The third change, which would be made by section 505(b)(1) \n     of the bill, is nonsubstantive. It would amend subsection (c) \n     of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 by replacing certain words with \n     certain other words. That is, the words ``Upon retirement an \n     officer'' would be stricken out and replaced by the words \n     ``An officer.'' All this amendment does is simply remove \n     excess verbiage.\n\n\n                     section 505(b)(2) of the bill\n\n       The fourth change, which would be made by section 505(b)(1) \n     of the bill, is substantive in nature. It would amend \n     subsection (c) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 by striking out the \n     words ``may, in the discretion'' and all that follows and \n     replacing them with certain other words. This amendment would \n     alter the thrust of the subsection entirely. At present, \n     subsection (c) is the provision which allows officers serving \n     at grades O-9 and O-10 while on active to duty to be retired \n     at those grades, at the discretion of the President and \n     subject to Senate confirmation. The proposed amendment would \n     change the subsection, as already amended by section \n     505(b)(1) of the bill, to read, as follows:\n       ``An officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps \n     who is serving in or has served in a position of importance \n     and responsibility designated by the President to carry the \n     grade of general or admiral or lieutenant general or vice \n     admiral under section 601 of this title may be retired in the \n     higher grade under subsection (a) only after the Secretary of \n     Defense certifies in writing to the President and the Senate \n     that the officer served on active duty satisfactorily in that \n     grade.''\n       One obvious effect of this change would be to eliminate the \n     requirement of Senate confirmation for officers retiring at \n     grades O-9 and O-10. Another effect of this change is less \n     obvious.\n       As noted at the outset of this memorandum, paragraph (1) of \n     subsection (a) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 presently specifies a \n     general rule that a commissioned officer of the Army, Navy, \n     Air Force, or Marine Corps shall be retired in the highest \n     grade in which he served on active duty satisfactorily for at \n     least six months. The language setting out that general rule \n     is preceded by the caveat ``[u]nless entitled to a higher \n     retired grade under some other provision of law.'' The words \n     ``higher grade'' used in this caveat are not used anywhere \n     else in subsection (a). Consequently, when the new language \n     that would be added to subsection (c) of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 \n     refers to ``the higher grade under subsection (a),'' it \n     clearly implies that there may be instances in which officers \n     who would not otherwise be entitled to retire at higher \n     grades under the terms of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1370 (e.g., because \n     they have not served long enough at those higher grades) \n     could under some unspecified ``other provision of law'' be \n     entitled to retire at those higher grades so long as the \n     Secretary of Defense ``certified'' served satisfactorily for \n     an unspecified period of time in the grade concerned and \n     supplied such certification to the President and to ``the \n     Senate.'' The transmittal of such a certification to ``the \n     Senate'' is of unknown significance.\n                                               Robert B. Burdette,\n                                           Legislative Attorney.  \n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is very hard to argue with the \nfairness and the justice embodied in Section 505 of the bill. Under \nSection 505, the retirement of three-star and four-star officers will \nbe considered under the same standards and under the same procedures as \nthe retirement of one-star and two-star generals. In fact, the \nretirement of all officers above the rank of major or lieutenant \ncommander will be handled in the same way.\n  Under the new law, then, assuming this bill is enacted, once these \nofficers have served 3 years in grade, they would be allowed to retire \nwith their highest grade without Senate confirmation. I cannot argue \nwith that, and it seems to me that that is the right way to do it. But \nin investigating this, I came up with this concern that I hope my \ncolleagues feel is legitimate.\n  Under the law, the Secretary of Defense and service secretaries will \nstill have broad discretionary authority to waive time in grade \nrequirements. That is a potential loophole, as far as I am concerned. \nHence my amendment.\n  I would like to offer a hypothetical scenario. Say a three-star \ngeneral, with only a few months in grade, gets caught violating a \nregulation or law. The IG is called in to investigate. The IG finds \nthat the general has violated the law and lied about it to his \ninvestigators. The IG then recommends disciplinary action. The service \nsecretaries reject the IG's recommendation, as is too often the case. \nThe secretaries \n\n[[Page S11188]]\nchoose, instead, to waive time in grade requirements, allowing the \nofficer to retire with full rank, as a three-star general. This would \nend the controversy, but it would give the officer an unearned \npromotion.\n  Mr. President, once we do away with the confirmation of three-star \nand four-star retirements, this scenario might be more than \nhypothetical. It might be very real.\n  My amendment, then, is meant to plug that loophole. Under my \namendment, time in grade requirements could not be waived if an officer \nwere under investigation for an alleged misconduct or if adverse \npersonnel action was pending.\n  Mr. President, this would address the concerns that we have --meaning \nSenator Murray and Senator Boxer and myself--arising out of the \ncontroversial retirement nominations we wrestled with last year and, \nhence, our letter to the Armed Services Committee in May of this year.\n  Mr. President, with that one minor modification that will be in my \namendment, I would support Section 505. We will still have ample \nopportunity to scrutinize the performance and conduct of our most \nsenior military officers through the regular confirmation process.\n  All three-star and four-star active duty promotions and assignments \nwill still be subject to Senate confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2083.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 159, line 3, before the end quotation marks insert \n     the following: ``The 3-year time-in-grade requirement in \n     paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (a) may not be reduced or \n     waived under such subsection in the case of such an officer \n     while the officer is under investigation for alleged \n     misconduct or while disposition of an adverse personnel \n     action is pending against the officer for alleged \n     misconduct.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Grassley \namendment, which seeks to modify section 505 of this bill. Section 505, \nwhich is almost identical to S. 635, would eliminate Senate \nconfirmation of retiring three-star and four-star officers.\n  Currently, the President nominates senior officers for retirement and \nthey come before the Senate for confirmation. As we all know, in recent \nyears, there has been great cause for Senate involvement in the \nconfirmation of retiring officers. This new section would allow \nofficers who have served 3 years in grade the ability to retire with \ntheir highest grade without action by the Senate.\n  On May 11 of this year, I joined Senators Grassley and Boxer in \nsending a letter to the Armed Services Committee outlining our concerns \nwith the provisions in S. 635. At a minimum, we asked that public \nhearings be held before proceeding with this action. Obviously, my \nconcerns with this section have not been alleviated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the \nletter sent to the Armed Services Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express our concern \n     regarding S. 635, legislation recently introduced to \n     eliminate the Senate's role in confirming the retirement \n     nominations of military officers who hold three- and four-\n     star rank and who have served three years or more in grade.\n       As you know, the law governing the Senate role in approving \n     the retirement nominations of three- and four-star military \n     officers was enacted in 1947 and has been amended several \n     times since. Available information on the legislative history \n     of this issue indicates that the introduction of Senate \n     confirmation of senior military officers in 1947, for \n     promotion or retirement, was principally an issue of \n     separation of powers. One of the goals of the original \n     statute, the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, was to reinforce \n     civilian control over the military and increase Congressional \n     purview over what had once been an exclusive function of the \n     Executive Branch. We believe these principles are as valid \n     today as they were in 1947.\n       Perhaps even more importantly, Congress' governing power \n     and authority over the Nation's armed forces is clearly set \n     out in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Of \n     additional relevance is Article II, Section 2, which \n     describes the Advice and Consent role of the U.S. Senate with \n     regard to Presidential appointments.\n       Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to \n     outline our concerns regarding S. 635 and to respectfully \n     challenge the rationale behind its introduction.\n       Upon introduction of S. 635, the argument was made that our \n     Nation's highest ranking military officers should be treated \n     like their civilian superiors and other government officials. \n     We believe that civilian comparisons are not relevant to this \n     situation. The military, and indeed the Committee, have often \n     taken the position that civilian rules and laws are not \n     appropriate when applied to the unique role and mission of \n     our Nation's armed forces. It is precisely for these reasons \n     that we have concluded that requiring our highest ranking \n     military officials to come before the Senate for their \n     retirement\n      nominations provides an important safeguard for their \n     civilian leadership and the American taxpayer.\n       Likewise, we disagree with the argument that standards \n     acceptable in the private sector are relevant to the \n     military. For a variety of reasons, including the involvement \n     of taxpayer funds, public service really bears no comparison \n     to private sector service when it comes to standards of \n     accountability and compensation.\n       Perhaps most importantly, we are concerned with this issue \n     as it relates to leadership and command accountability in our \n     Nation's armed services. The central issue in considering \n     retirement nominations has been, and remains, that service in \n     our Nation's military, especially at the highest levels, is a \n     privilege and an honor. We continue to believe that the \n     military should be governed by the highest standards, and \n     that command accountability to those standards should in no \n     way be compromised.\n       An additional argument made in support of S. 635 is that \n     this legislation will ``reduce the administrative work load \n     of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Department of \n     Defense.'' We are sympathetic with this goal, but we believe \n     that S. 635 fails to provide an effective and prudent \n     response to this problem. We understand that in fiscal year \n     1993, for example, the Committee was asked to review just six \n     grade 0-10 officers for retirement, and less than twenty at \n     grade 0-9. In total, these retirement nominations represented \n     just a fraction of the total number of nominations reviewed \n     by the Committee--which we have been told numbered in the \n     thousands. According to the Congressional Research Service, \n     the numbers for 1993 are typical of the work load presented \n     in other years by these retirement nominations.\n       Moreover, we reject the idea that military nominations, be \n     they for promotions or retirements, are nothing more than \n     routine ``administrative workload.'' Reviewing military \n     nominations is one of the Armed Services Committee's most \n     important responsibilities. It is a Constitutional \n     responsibility and an important tool for maintaining civilian \n     control and accountability. It is also a way of keeping the \n     Senate involved in the crucial process of nurturing military \n     leadership.\n       Since the passage of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, \n     your Committee has held the view that the top-most military \n     and naval officers in the Nation should be subject to Senate \n     approval. The reason for this is quite simple: the question \n     of who gets the ``top rank'' will in the log-run determine \n     the overall quality of\n      the leadership in the Armed Forces. And having top quality \n     military officers is probably the single most important \n     ingredient of military strength.\n       Keeping the Senate involved in the promotion and retirement \n     process as the final, independent check will help to ensure \n     that only the best are rewarded with top-level promotions. \n     Most of those promotions go to future leaders, but some are \n     given as rewards at retirement for outstanding service.\n       Retirement nominations are no less significant than others \n     handled by the Committee. As you know, retired members of the \n     armed forces can be recalled to active duty at any time, \n     voluntarily or involuntarily, and therefore the status \n     conferred on those individuals at the time of retirement \n     carries much more than ceremonial significance.\n       Finally, last year we were encouraged by the Senate's \n     almost unanimous support of the Moseley-Braun/Murray \n     amendment to the FY 1995 Defense Authorization Act which \n     required that the armed services improve the procedures by \n     which discrimination and sexual harassment complaints are \n     processed. In part, the amendment states:\n       ``The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the Department \n     of Defense regulations governing consideration of equal \n     opportunity matters in evaluations of the performance of \n     members of the Armed Forces include provisions requiring as a \n     factor in such evaluations consideration of a member's \n     commitment to elimination of unlawful discrimination or of \n     sexual harassment in the Armed Forces.''\n       This statutory language reflects an important public \n     policy, but we are concerned that \n\n[[Page S11189]]\n     without strong enforcement mechanisms DoD will not get the message. It \n     is our understanding that so far DoD has missed every \n     deadline for reporting to Congress and adopting the new anti-\n     discrimination regulations required under the Amendment. This \n     foot dragging underscores the need to maintain congressional \n     oversight, including the Senate confirmation of retirement \n     nominations where relevant leadership can be questioned on \n     these types of matters. We believe it would be very unwise to \n     relinquish this important tool for assuring compliance with \n     national anti-discrimination policies and others critical to \n     military readiness. In addition, less senior members of our \n     armed forces who cannot turn to an independent judiciary with \n     an unresolved but persistent discrimination or whistleblowing \n     complaint deserve to know that their leadership is routinely \n     held accountable to the highest standards.\n       In short, we have serious reservations about S. 635, and we \n     hope you will consider our views carefully when reviewing \n     this legislation. At a minimum, we strongly urge the \n     Committee to hold a public hearing on this issue before any \n     further action is taken.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patty Murray.\n     Charles Grassley.\n     Barbara Boxer.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. At this time I would like to outline a few of my \nconcerns as described in the letter with this section.\n  Several arguments have been made in support of this section. For \ninstance, it has been argued that military officers should be treated \nas their civilian counterparts. However, civilian comparisons are not \nrelevant because of the unique role and mission required of our \nNation's Armed Forces.\n  It has been argued that the confirmation of retiring officers \nincreases the administrative workload of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. In fiscal year 1993, the committee reviewed just six grade \n0-10 officers for retirement and less than 20 at grade 0-9. I do not \nbelieve that is an unreasonable number. In addition, reviewing military \nnominations is a constitutional responsibility that helps maintain \ncivilian control and accountability.\n  Most importantly, by removing Senate involvement in the confirmation \nof retiring officers, we remove congressional oversight. We remove our \nability to play a role in the very process that has been so troublesome \nin recent years.\n  Mr. President, Senator Grassley's amendment would prohibit waiving \ntime in grade requirements if an officer is under investigation for \nalleged misconduct or if adverse personnel action was pending. While I \ndo not feel this is the ultimate solution to this problem, I do feel it \nis a move in the right direction toward making this section more \nacceptable.\n  There is no reason for an officer to receive a promotion while an \ninvestigation into alleged misconduct is pending.\n  As I have stated, I still have concerns with the wholesale repeal of \ncongressional oversight as it relates to the confirmation of retiring \nofficers. I believe we have a duty and an obligation to ensure that \nthere are standards of accountability.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Grassley \namendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we will accept the amendment on this \nside.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I want to make sure that I understand the \namendment. I believe I do. The Senator from Iowa can check me on this. \nThis basically would preclude the waiver by the President of time in \ngrade requirements that exist in the law for three-star and four-star \nretirements if there is an investigation or disciplinary action pending \nat that time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is my intent, a narrow application of exception to \nthe purpose of your original bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. As I understand it, Mr. President, the waiver in this \namendment would actually--by the President--would not happen on very \nmany occasions, but if it does not happen, it should not happen when \nthere is an investigation or disciplinary action pending. That is what \nthe Senator is trying to accomplish. This would nail it down and make \nsure that does not happen.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. At that point, if the President wanted to retire them \nunder those circumstances, it would have to come before the Senate for \napproval.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I think that we should not compromise on \naccountability in this area. If the Senate confirmation is going to be \nchanged in the three- and four-star area, then I think we must make \nsure that the waivers are not granted when, at any point, it would \nundermine accountability of the officer in question. I therefore think \nit is a good amendment, and I urge its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2083) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we are ready to go forward with other \nvotes. If Members have any amendments, we are glad for them to come \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes the DOD authorization bill at 9 a.m. on Thursday, \nSenator Dorgan be recognized to offer his amendment, and there be 90 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form, with no second-degree \namendments in order, and following the conclusion or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the Dorgan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                          sections 631 and 632\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to express some concerns I have \nabout sections 631 and 632 of the Department of Defense authorization \nbill for fiscal year 1996, S.1026. These two sections Nos. 631 and 632, \nwill grant unlimited commissary shopping privileges to ready \nreservists, certain retired reservists and to all their dependents.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the men and women who serve \nthis Nation, including those who serve in the Ready Reserve. Their \ncommitment to this Nation's security is strong, and they deserve our \nsupport. My concerns about sections 631 and 632 are not about the Ready \nReserve, but rather about the budgetary impact of these proposed \nchanges.\n  In total, Mr. President, these sections give an estimated 2 million \npeople unlimited access to military grocery stores here in the United \nStates and overseas.\n  This is quite a dramatic expansion over current law, which limits \nreservists to shop at commissaries while on active duty plus an \nadditional 12 shopping trips during the course of a year.\n  Up until now, only active duty, career military men and women enjoyed \nunlimited commissary shopping privileges. However, under section 631 \nand 632 the Congress will be bestowing this special benefit to 2 \nmillion civilians. Stated differently, if we adopt this language, \ncivilian reservists will have the same compensation benefit as career \nactive duty military personnel.\n  Mr. President, I have been advised that according to the Department \nof Defense, there will be no budgetary implications associated with \ngranting unlimited shopping privileges to the ready reservists, retired \nreservists, and their families. I hope this is in fact true, because \nthis is not the same message that we heard when such an expansion was \ncontemplated in the fiscal year 1994 defense authorization bill.\n  According to Pentagon testimony just 3 years ago in 1992, every \ndollar of sales in a commissary store requires about 16 cents in \nappropriated funding. In other words, it takes roughly 16 cents of \ntaxpayer money to subsidize a dollar sale in a commissary store. Back \nin 1992, the Defense Department also told Congress that $24 million in \ntax dollars is needed for every additional 100,000 commissary patrons.\n  Now, here we are in 1995, and all of a sudden, everything has \nchanged. Now, \n\n[[Page S11190]]\naccording to the Pentagon, it won't cost the American taxpayer a single \ndime to grant 2 million civilians unlimited access to commissary \nstores. If this is true, and commissary stores have become efficient, \nstreamline operators, this has to be one of the most astounding success \nstories in recent memory for the Pentagon.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that many of us in this \nChamber have been working very hard to reduce the Federal deficit and \nto achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. Therefore, it is my \nconcern that section 631 and section 632 may be taking us in the wrong \ndirection if this expansion results in the need for greater \nappropriations and taxpayer subsidies next year. This is especially \ntrue in light of the multitude of needs we are trying to fulfill for \nboth active personnel and reservists, within growing budget \nconstraints.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am here to talk again \nabout a topic which will confront the Senate very dramatically later \nthis week. It is the topic of welfare reform.\n  It is time for the Senate to begin to focus not only on the cost of \nwelfare reform in terms of dollars and cents, but the cost of the \nwelfare tragedy in terms of the human cost--not numbers, but lives.\n  In each of the previous evenings when I have had an opportunity to \naddress the Senate on this topic, I have talked about specific \nindividuals. Individuals who have a story; individuals who were tragic \nvictims of our welfare system.\n  The story I want to talk about tonight is the story of Jack Gordon \nHill, Jr., of French Camp, CA. Mr. Hill's story is not a particularly \nuplifting story, for it is yet another story of human suffering at the \nhands of the welfare system.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Mr. Hill's story is the personification \nof a system that has replaced responsibility with rights, and has \nreplaced opportunity with entitlement.\n  This picture beside me is one bright spot in Mr. Hill's welfare \nlegacy. About a year ago, Mr. Hill credited the Federal Government's \nSupplemental Security Income Program with saving his life, and all the \nindications seemed to support his assertion. He was physically strong. \nHe was mentally prepared, and ready once again to accept a place in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, Jack Gordon Hill, Jr, had a serious problem with drugs \nand alcohol his entire adult life. His cocaine and whiskey cost him \neverything he had. Years ago he lost his job, and shortly thereafter he \nlost his family. He and his wife divorced. He gave up an infant son for \nadoption. Most tragically, he abandoned his two small daughters in \nBaltimore, unable or unwilling to take care of them.\n  In short, Mr. Hill was rushing ever faster toward rock bottom and \nalmost hit, he claims, when he discovered SSI, which provides special \npayments for addicts. In his words, ``It is like I've been falling in a \nbottomless pit all my life, and all of a sudden there was this one thin \nbranch sticking out. I grabbed it. Now I am climbing out.''\n  It turns out that the branch of SSI did not save him. It accelerated \nhis fall. Mr. Hill's branch was a $458 a month governmental check, with \nwhich he was able to enter a drug and alcohol treatment center and get \naway from the street corner he had haunted.\n  In an interview with the Baltimore Sun last July, he sat in his room, \nin the California rehab center, playing with his kitten, Serenity--its \nname represented a new-found state of peace in his life. This world of \ncontrived contentment was built on a foundation of sand.\n  Six months after that interview, the Baltimore Sun found Mr. Hill \nback on the same corner where he had begun, drunk and doped up. His \nFederal funds were now being used to support his renewed addiction to \ncocaine.\n  His use of these funds is far from exceptional. The system under \nwhich he got them spends $1.4 billion per year of taxpayers' funds. \nUnlike Mr. Hill, however, most of the individuals who received these \nfunds--hundreds of thousands, according to the Baltimore Sun--never \nenter treatment centers, or seriously try to beat their addictions. The \n$458 a month they receive only speeds their inevitable demise.\n  One drug counselor at a health clinic for the homeless told the Sun \nthat drug dealers flock around the recipients of these Government \nchecks whenever the checks come in. Speaking of his patients who had \ndied from drug overdoses, the drug counselor said, ``All the dealers \ncame circling around the patient of the day like vultures. A week later \nhe would crash from whatever dope he was doing and feel terrible.\n Those were the times he would go looking for help. The problem was \nthat we could never find help for him when that check came in the mail \non the first of the month, and the whole cycle started over again.''\n\n  This cycle of abuse, funded by the Federal Government, this welfare \nsystem which provides funding for the maintenance of these habits, is a \ntragedy which is costing us a tremendous toll in terms of human lives. \nWhen our welfare system clearly and openly supports a policy which runs \ncontrary to every law and principle in our Government, we cannot be so \nblind as not to see the immediate and overwhelming need for an overhaul \nof the welfare system.\n  I have come before this body repeatedly to relate the personal \nstories of real Americans, stories which demonstrate how bankrupt our \ncurrent welfare system is, how it enslaves its beneficiaries, how it \ntraps them and robs them of their independence, their hope, and their \nfutures. It is hard enough to break out of the cycle of poverty and \ndependence which the welfare system creates economically, but when the \nwelfare system buys drugs for addicts, it virtually guarantees they \nwill not escape and they will never be anything but wards of the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. Hill did not only find himself abused, but he tried to do \nsomething. Mr. Hill did more than most of the SSI substance abuse \nrecipients. He tried to get treatment. Yet, because Washington, DC, \nperceived the solution to his problems to be a wad full of Federal \nmoney--because the helping hand of Washington extends money to those \nwho are in need and does not do much else--it destroyed his capacity. \nTrue charity cannot come from the Federal Government, it must come from \nconcerned citizens who know the problems of their own communities, know \nthe citizens in those communities, and truly want to solve the \nproblems. And Federal money, money alone, cannot solve the problem. We \nneed to involve the communities. We need to involve the States. We need \nto involve people--people who have the chance to introduce those on \nwelfare to opportunities that lift them out of welfare.\n  Federal money should be administered to the States directly, allowing \nthem the freedom to direct funds where they are needed. Federal funds \nshould not be administered from a distant Washington bureaucrat and \ndirected in ways that are not meaningful on the local level. Welfare, \nas it is currently practiced, simply provides a means for Mr. Hill and \nothers like him to continue their self-destructive behavior. This \nbehavior costs not only Mr. Hill, it costs us--not only in terms of our \nresources but it costs us productivity and lives. It has cost his three \nchildren an association with a father. It has been a tragedy, not just \nin financial terms, but in personal terms. It provides a means for Mr. \nHill and others like him to continue their destructive behavior.\n  This is not a time for us to engage in half measures of welfare \nreform, and it is not a time for silence. Unfortunately, silence is \nexactly what we are getting from the Democrats who are making proposals \nwhich they call welfare reform. Every Republican plan \n\n[[Page S11191]]\nthat has been proposed eliminates the drug addiction and alcoholism \ndisabilities from SSI. The Democrats are silent. President Clinton is \nsilent on this issue. On issues as important as these, silence is \ndeath.\n  We have been down the road of half measures before. It was called the \n1988 Family Support Act. It made big promises. It was going to put \npeople to work. We had hoped, with the so-called Welfare Reform Act of \n1988, that the devotion of additional resources, that additional \nWashington management, that additional one-size-fits-all solutions from \nthe Nation's Capital would somehow provide a solution to the problem. \nBut if we take a good look at what has happened in terms of welfare \nspending, we did not solve the problem in 1988. The problem skyrocketed \nin 1988. Half measures, the rearrangement of the deck chairs on the \nwelfare Titanic, will do no more than provide a basis for taking the \nline on this chart right off the page.\n  We need to have real reform. We need to understand that welfare that \nis simply the Federal Government's handing individuals a wad of money, \nlike the welfare reform proposal made available to Mr. Hill, is not \nwelfare reform. That is welfare entrapment. We need to be involved in \nwelfare replacement.\n  We must do more, we must ask for more, we must involve more people in \nthe program. We must ask that civic groups and nongovernmental \norganizations be allowed to work with States. We must send the \nresources to the States to give them flexibility. The idea that there \nis a single solution in Washington that will provide the opportunity \nfor everyone everywhere is an idea that has been proven to be a \nfailure.\n  My family has an average size. If we were to try to buy pajamas based \non the average size, one-size-fits-all would translate into one-size-\nfits-none.\n  When the Government in Washington, DC, tries to have a one-size-fits-\nall solution, it frequently fits none. It is time for us to turn the \nopportunity over to the States, States that can involve institutions \nthat care for people, States that have the courage to make basic \nreforms, States that will have the courage to say to those on drugs and \nalcohol, ``We will not continue to support your habit.''\n  The real costs of welfare are not just the costs that we face as a \nresult of the budget crunch. They are the costs in terms of human \ntragedy, costs like those endured by the Hill family as a result of the \nfact that, as a Government, we have chosen to fund one's addiction \nrather than to provide the kind of care that would help an individual \nleave the welfare system and become a productive individual.\n  This Saturday we will begin the welfare debate. We will have the \nopportunity to make a decision to pull together the information which \nwill lead us to an inevitable conclusion that the one-size-fits-all \nWashington system has failed. We will have the opportunity to give the \nStates, which have been begging for decades now, the flexibility to do \nwhat works, to give them the resources through block grants, to allow \nthem to make the kinds of changes and to have the kinds of conditions \nand requirements that will lift people by enlisting nongovernmental \norganizations and others in their communities to help individuals on \nwelfare become productive members of our cities and towns.\n  It is with this in mind that we need to understand that welfare \nreform cannot be tinkering around the edges. It must be substantial. It \nmust be real renovation and reformation, for without renovation and \nreformation in the system, we will not have a new opportunity for the \ncitizens of the land. Indeed, that is what citizens who now are on \nwelfare desperately need.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have enjoyed the statement by the Senator \nfrom Missouri related to welfare reform. I think that is one thing that \nthis country is looking forward to. But I do object to no morning \nbusiness. Now we have not had morning business, or been allowed morning \nbusiness for over a week. We come in here on a defense authorization \nbill and we take 10 minutes to talk about welfare reform. I am sitting \nhere trying to get an amendment on the bill.\n  So we have morning business periodically during the day. That is \nfine. This is prime time, and I know it is a lot better than 8 o'clock \nin the morning or 9 o'clock in the morning. But we have a Defense \nauthorization bill here. I would like to get that done. We are going to \nhave welfare reform. You can talk all day Saturday if you want to, \nabout welfare reform.\n  As I say, I have enjoyed what the Senator said. I appreciate what he \nis trying to do. But we are also trying to get a Defense authorization \nbill through, and I think we ought either to have morning business and \ndo it then, or we should have morning business late in the evening, \ninstead of going through and interrupting the flow of business in the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. I withdraw that suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11191-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11191-S11199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the cold war is over, and in some ways \nwe all long for the old certainties it provided. The Armed Services \nCommittee has grappled with the difficult task of matching our national \nsecurity interests to the new realities of international politics, and \nI commend them for their hard work in this area.\n  But I also want to take this opportunity to express serious concern \nabout certain provisions in this legislation which, in my view, would \ndiscard a generation of progress toward arms control that serves our \nnational security needs.\n  In terms of arms control--and, in terms of our Nation's solemn \ncommitment to its treaty obligations--I have strong reservations about \nthe paths charted by the committee legislation. I hope the Senate fully \nappreciates the weight and implications of proposals now before us.\n  I know that there are some negotiations that are going on regarding \nlanguage, and I am pleased to hear that.\n  By my count, this legislation puts at risk at least four important \narms control agreements. It puts us on a path toward abrogating two \ntreaties which the United States has ratified with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate--agreements which, in accordance with the \nprocesses of our Constitution, our Nation has pledged to honor. It also \ntakes policy steps that may jeopardize our chances to successfully \nconclude and implement at least two other important agreements that our \nNation long has pursued.\n  The stakes are high:\n  The Anti-Ballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty has been in force in the \nUnited States since 1972. This bill would put us on a path to abrogate \nthe ABM treaty by setting a date to deploy national ballistic missile \ndefenses and by unilaterally imposing a line of demarcation to separate \nballistic missile defenses, which are covered by the treaty, from \ntheater defense systems, which are not. This important demarcation \nissue is the subject of ongoing negotiations--and, yet, this bill would \nhave us act alone. Perhaps, as its critics suggest, the ABM Treaty no \nlonger serves our national interests. But if that is so, we should \nreview our commitment to the treaty through a deliberate process--we \nshould not simply take steps toward no longer complying.\n  The safeguards agreement between the United States and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has been in force since 1980.\n  This is another aspect of language in the agreement that I find \ntroubling, and perhaps this has been addressed.\n  This legislation would walk away from that agreement by setting \nunrealistic\n criteria that must be met before any IAEA safeguards inspection \n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\n\ncan take place. When the Senate ratified the safeguards agreement, we \nbelieved that placing many of America's nuclear materials under \nsafeguards would strengthen our ability to press other countries to \naccept safeguards as well. Our national interests are well served when \nother countries accept safeguards, and our interests are at risk when \nsafeguards are rejected, as we have learned bitterly in Iraq and in \nNorth Korea. If the Senate today walks away from our safeguards \ncommitment, what message are we sending to those whose nuclear \nambitions we oppose?\n  The third concern I have is that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n[CTBT] to ban nuclear testing is on schedule for completion in 1996. \nOur negotiators have pursued this agreement for decades, and their hand \nwas significantly strengthened by the decision of the United States \nduring the Bush administration to impose a moratorium on our own \nnuclear tests. Yet, this legislation would commit funds to prepare the \nUnited States to resume testing, even before our own self-declared \ntesting moratorium has expired. If we take this step, we will signal to \nthe world that we are not serious about a test ban, and we will put the \ntreaty's successful conclusion in serious jeopardy.\n  Finally, we all are aware of the importance of START II, the basic \nagreement for implementing President Reagan's vision of deep cuts in \nthe strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the former \nSoviet Union. The treaty now is pending before the Senate and before \nthe Russian Parliament for ratification. Yet, the legislation before us \ntoday would halt for at least a year the retirement of U.S. strategic \nnuclear weapons, would substantially restructure our nuclear forces to \nretain greater capacity, and would strengthen our ability to quickly \nreconstruct weapons in excess of our treaty commitment. At a time when \nhard-line elements in the Russian Parliament are searching for reasons \nto kill the START II treaty--and when certain elements in Russia have \nstated clearly that they expect the United States to adhere to its \ncommitments under the ABM treaty--any actions such as those proposed in \nthis legislation would, I fear, significantly diminish the prospects \nfor Russian ratification of the treaty.\n  Perhaps this again is something that we do not want to undertake at \nthis time. But I think that we ought to have then a more full-blown \ndiscussion of the importance of the START II treaty.\n  Mr. President, I will oppose efforts that endanger these important \nagreements that serve the interests of our Nation. The provisions I \nhave discussed do not serve our national security or foreign policy \ninterests. I believe in a strong national defense, but I also believe \nthat arms control has a place in America's national security strategy \nand that America should not lightly abandon its solemn treaty \nobligations. I urge my colleagues to think long and hard before \nproceeding with the courses of action this bill proposes.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Kansas \nfor her remarks. And I made remarks this morning and went over most of \nthe same items and expressed many--not all but many--of the same \nconcerns, particularly in relationship between what I call an \nanticipatory breach of the ABM Treaty which is in this bill, and the \nrelationship between that and the START treaties which are pending. But \nnot only that; the START I Treaty which has not completely been \nimplemented.\n  I think it would be the height of folly if we end up increasing the \nthreat that would otherwise be aimed at the United States by doing \nsomething in a bill that prevents the deep reductions that are taking \nplace in both START I and START II.\n  So I share the views of the Senator from Kansas on this. I think she \nis on point.\n  I also share the concerns she has expressed about prematurely going \nback into manufacturing of nuclear weapons where we have not had \ndecisions made yet by DOE on that point. I believe in prodding DOE to \nmake sure we have nuclear safety and security. But I think we are \nmaking decisions in this bill that go too far at this time.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to have amendments that will iron \nout each of these problems as we go through this bill. And on the ABM \nquestion, the question that the Senator from Kansas raised, we will \nhave at least two or three amendments tomorrow--early, I hope--on those \nkey questions because she has identified I think the major concerns \nwith this bill.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may, I appreciate the comments of \nthe Senator from Georgia. I was in a markup all morning and did not \nhear his speech. I have the highest regard for the chairman, Senator \nThurmond, and the ranking leader of Armed Services Committee, Senator \nNunn. I know they know these issues well, and have great dedication to \nthem.\n  I appreciate the Senator's comments.\n  Mr. NUNN. I have learned over the years that the Senator from Kansas \ndoes not necessarily need to listen to any of my speeches in order to \ncome to the right conclusion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I say to my distinguished colleague \nthat I was not able to be present throughout the presentation of her \nstatement. But I know it addressed several provisions that I was the \nauthor of in the bill. I will have an opportunity tomorrow after \nexamining the statement in full, Mr. President, to reply I hope in full \nand perhaps to the satisfaction of my distinguished colleague.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2084\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize additional military construction projects)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Thurmond), for \n     himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Reid, Mr. Ford, Mr. Bond, and Mr. \n     Nunn, proposes an amendment numbered 2084.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nNunn, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and \nSenators Burns and Reid, the chairman and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction and Senators Bond and Ford in \nsponsoring this amendment which authorizes an additional $228 million \nfor construction projects which are currently appropriated in the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill for 1996. The amendment would \nauthorize an additional 46 projects to enhance the readiness of our \nArmed Forces and improve the living and working conditions of soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines across the country.\n  Mr. President, last Friday, I spoke against an amendment to the \nmilitary construction bill that would have reduced the funding in the \nbill by $300 million. I will not repeat all the arguments I propounded \nat that time, other than to say that all the services acknowledge they \nhave a significant shortfall and backlog in the repair and maintenance \nof the facilities. The facts also indicate that in excess of 70 percent \nof the family and unaccompanied housing does not currently meet \nDepartment of Defense standards.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the additional \nprojects authorized be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     State/Country              Service            Installation name           Project title         (thousands)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKentucky..............

I further ask that because the Senate has previously \napproved these projects by an overwhelming vote of 84 to 10, we can \nagree to a time limit on the debate and a vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this is a military construction amendment \nwhich we have discussed. This amendment has been worked carefully on \nboth sides of the aisle, with Senator Thurmond's staff and my staff and \nthe staff of other members of the committee, and I am in favor of this \namendment and certainly hope it will pass.\n  It is my understanding that each of these projects meet the committee \ncriteria. Those criteria are that it has to be a part of the 5-year \ndefense plan of the Department of Defense. So these are high-priority \nprojects. They must be the highest priority in the State or the base in \nquestion. Each one of the projects must be executable in fiscal year \n1996. It must be consistent with the BRAC process and they must be \nmission essential.\n  So this is a list of projects for which the appropriators have \nalready appropriated the money. It fits within the 602(b) funding \nallocation, and this would make the authorization committee and the \nAppropriations Committee in sync as I understand it. So I think that \nthis amendment should be accepted. I hope it will be accepted.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I understand the distinguished Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. McCain] will be in in a little bit to speak against this \namendment. I wanted to make that announcement now.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I just wanted to clarify, if I could, \nexactly what the amendment is and then make a short statement.\n  Am I correct, if I could address a question to the chairman or \nranking member, either one, this amendment brings up the amount of \nfunds authorized for military construction to the level that we decided \nto appropriate to last week in the appropriations bill? Is that \nessentially what is being done here?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Am I also correct that the level of funding for \nmilitary construction this year in this bill, the 1996 authorization \nbill as requested by the administration, was about $2 billion over what \nwas requested and appropriated in the 1995 bill?\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Am I also correct that what we are essentially doing \nhere is authorizing what the House has already appropriated, or the \nHouse appropriation/authorization provides, and that is about $500 \nmillion more than the administration request?\n  Mr. THURMOND. They appropriated $500 million. We are only \nappropriating here about $300 million.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We are going above the administration's request by this \namount, is that correct?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the Senator's responses very much.\n  Mr. President, this is the same vote we cast last week where I \nindicated my opposition to adding additional money. I think the figures \nwe had last week were that we were adding $474 million to what was \nrequested by the administration, and in addition another $300 million. \nI tried to persuade my colleagues to not add the additional $300 \nmillion and was unsuccessful. We had a vote on it.\n  I understand that the Senate supports the amendment that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina is offering here, and I will not ask for a rollcall \nvote, but I would like the record to show that I oppose the amendment \nand have me recorded in opposition at the time this is voted by voice.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Senator McCain I believe is ready now.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is with disappointment that I come to \nthe floor. I do not know where my colleagues have been lately. I do not \nknow if they have been seeing what is being written in the newspapers \nand editorials all over America about spending too much money on \nunneeded projects out of defense dollars.\n  You know what we are running the danger of here? We are running the \ndanger of losing support for defense spending if we keep this up, if we \nkeep spending money on things that we do not need.\n  If the chairman and the distinguished ranking member of this \ncommittee can find me one military leader, one military leader that \nwould come over and say this $228 million is a priority, I would like \nto meet that person. What they will say, if you ask the military \nleaders what they need the money for, they will say they need it for \ndepot maintenance; they will say they need it for force modernization, \nthey need it for readiness, more ammunition. I can give you 20 things, \n20 priorities that rank above more military construction.\n  My colleague from New Mexico last week tried to stop additional \nmilitary construction money. We got a total of 17 votes, or was it 19? \nI do not remember. Seventeen votes. It is a little embarrassing to lose \na vote by that much. But this is wrong. This is wrong.\n  I do not understand who we think we are kidding here. We have 54,000 \nyoung men, military families today on food stamps--on food stamps--and \nwe are going to build more MilCon. Before the subcommittee, of which I \nam the Chair, the outgoing Commandant of the Marine Corps said the \nfollowing. He said, yes, we want our military families to live in good \nhousing, but I do not want the widow of a Marine living in a good house \nwhen we come to tell her that her husband has been killed because we \ndid not supply him with the right equipment.\n  That is what the Commandant of the Marine Corps said. What he was \nsaying was that they have a higher priority, they have a number of \nhigher priorities than additional MilCon.\n  The Senate appropriators added a great deal already, $200 million, in \nresponse to the request of the Secretary of Defense that we improve the \nstandard of living and the military housing situation for both married \nand unmarried military personnel. And we did that. And they were \npleased.\n  Then we added another $125 million in the markup. Now we are adding \nanother $228 million. I guess my question to the chairman and ranking \nmember is, how much is enough? How much is enough? If I sound \nfrustrated by this, it is because I continuously talk to people in the \nmilitary who say to me: What are you guys doing adding all this MilCon \nmoney? I get that from captains and lieutenants and majors and \nlieutenant commanders. They say, why is it--we have a depot maintenance \nbacklog of 3 and 4 years, and yet you guys keep adding MilCon money.\n  I have been around this body long enough to know, Mr. President, \nwhere the votes lie.\n  I have been around this body to know that we would probably get \nanother 17 votes if a recorded vote on this was called for. And I do \nnot particularly feel like putting the body through this drill. But I \nwant to tell you, Mr. President, I want to tell you in all sincerity, \nmore and more and more stories are coming out about defense pork. And \nthe confidence and commitment of the American people for us to spend \nmoney on defense where it is truly needed is getting less and less and \nless. So, I guess--I do not know if the ranking member can answer, the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia. I would like to \n\n[[Page S11195]]\nask him, How much is enough? How much MilCon money is enough? But I \nguess there is not any answer because there may not be enough. Because \nif there is another billion or couple million, we will probably put it \nin MilCon.\n  So I want to strongly object to this. I think it is wrong. I think \nthat there are other priorities. Those have been made clear time after \ntime by our military leaders. And we are making a serious mistake \nbecause the time is going to come when we really need to spend some \nmoney on defense or some project and we will have lost the confidence \nof the American people in our ability to spend those funds wisely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I hope that my colleague from Arizona will \nunderstand that there are some of us that just sincerely disagree with \nhim--and I will be glad to yield to the Senator--that we disagree and \nsincerely disagree. And so I hope that somehow or other we can look at \nthe defense of our country in another light.\n  Now, this MilCon, as I understand it, met the criteria of the mission \nessential. It met the criteria of highest priority. And, Mr. President, \none of the things we see as we downsize, we must support and improve \nthe position of our Reserve, our National Guard. We have 66 Members of \nthis Senate that are members of the National Guard Caucus. When we go \nback home we see the 130-H's and see them in Panama or Somalia or \nBosnia and those places. Those are the National Guard. Those are the \nones we want to train. These are the people in this MilCon that we are \ntrying to support. So we are trying to strengthen the National Guard \nand give them the kind of training centers, the ranges, those things \nthat would make them better military personnel.\n  And I understand that you do not want to go to a fine house and talk \nto a widow. But I also understand that if you are going to have quality \npersonnel in the military, if you are going to continue to get, keep \nand recruit high-quality personnel, then we have to have a quality of \nlife for the military personnel. And housing is one of the most \nimportant things that you can do.\n  And so, Mr. President, under this bill we have an appropriated \namount. And we voted on that, 80-some-odd votes approving this \nparticular amendment.\n  Now, we want to approve this amendment in the authorization part of \nthe DOD bill. And I think it is only fair that we put it in the \nauthorization now so that we can go on with supporting the quality of \nlife of our military personnel, to strengthen the National Guard and \nthe Reserve to meet our highest priority and mission essential. So I \nhope that we will vigorously support this amendment as I believe and \nsincerely believe it is in our best interest in the defense of our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am glad that we are using the criteria \nthat we established in the Readiness Subcommittee on the Armed Services \nCommittee over the last couple of years, the criteria for setting the \nground rules for how we move forward on items like this. I must, \nhowever, join my friends, Senator McCain and Senator Bingaman, in their \nconcerns about what we are doing. I recognize fully that we did vote \nfor the appropriations bill last week that had these things in it, but \nit was done on the contingency, as I understand it, that we pass the \nauthorization. Senator Bingaman disapproved of it then and wanted to \nmove that money out of that appropriations bill and into contingency \noperations. And I supported that amendment of his.\n  Now we have $228 million we seem to have found here. It seems to me \nthat that money would be better spent for what Secretary of Defense \nPerry has called one of his highest priorities; that is, getting the \nmoney to pay for Bosnia and Iraq and the other operations that we have \ngoing all around the world. So it would lessen the amount they would \nhave to come up in the supplemental one of these days.\n  The criteria that were established says that if an item is on the \nFYDP, the 5-year defense plan, that we can move it forward. But one of \nthe hurdles that would have to be jumped would be that one of having it \non the 5-year defense plan. As I understand it, all of these items that \nare on the proposal for the $228 million expenditure do comply with \nthose criteria being on that plan.\n  However, to me, we have so many other things that we are contending \nwith on the defense budget this year. We have depot maintenance that is \nrequired. We are shortchanging that. We are shortchanging military \nhousing. We are shortchanging a lot of other things and, in effect, \nmoving these items forward to a higher priority than some of those \nitems. We are moving things forward on what was going to be taken care \nof somewhere out in the 5-year defense plan.\n  We are moving it forward basically because some Members want these \nthings in their districts, as I see it. And I can appreciate that. I \nhave no quarrel with people wanting things in their particular \ndistricts or their particular States. But I just think that we are \ngetting our priorities a little bit out of line when we move things \nforward on that 5-year defense plan and move them ahead of other \nrequirements that I think are much more pressing than most of the \nthings that this $228 million would be spent for.\n  So I appreciate the fact that we are using the criteria that has been \nestablished. I do not think we are setting our priorities right, \nthough, when we move this $228 million ahead of some of the other \npriorities where money is more desperately needed in the defense budget \nthan for these items. I realize they have already been put through the \nappropriations process. But I think they are wrong. And I would follow \nmy colleagues earlier and ask that, if this is to be passed on a voice \nvote--I am not asking for a rollcall vote on this; I do not believe \nthat has been done--but I would follow the lead of Senator Bingaman and \nsay, if there is to be a voice vote, I wish to be recorded against it. \nI know that will be probably a losing effort. But I think that we have \nto stand up on some of these things. We have established a pattern in \nthe Armed Services Committee of opposing some of these things the last \ncouple of years. And I would want to do the same thing here even though \nwe did pass the appropriations bill a week or so ago. So I would ask \nthat, if there is a voice vote on this, that I be recorded in \nopposition.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would just like to point out to the Senator from Ohio--\nand I appreciate his leadership in this area and his remarks--that \nthere are a number of these projects that are family housing projects. \nThere are a number of these projects that are barracks. That was one of \nthe high priorities that was mentioned. That is one of the things we \ntalked about. There are three of these projects that are day-care \ncenters and fitness centers. We are talking about high-quality, \npriority projects. None of these have been drawn out of the air. As I \nunderstand it, all of them are on the 5-year priority list for the \ndefense plan.\n  I think people ought to understand, as we hear this talk about waste \nand so forth, that the reason the military construction add-ons are \nhaving to occur here is because the administration itself has requested \na whole lot less money in military construction over the last couple of \nyears because the BRAC process was going on. We now know what happened \nin BRAC. We did not know that, the administration did not know that, \nwhen they submitted their defense budget this year or last year. So \nthat defense request, that is going to be the measurement.\n  If anything is going to be labeled waste that goes over the \nadministration request in military construction, I think that is really \na misleading kind of portrayal, because the BRAC process was ongoing \nwhen the administration put the budget together. They did not request a \nnumber of projects that are now high-priority projects. An awful lot of \nthis money is going to barracks and to housing and to daycare, and to \nquality-of-life projects. We have one project on here, for instance, in \nJoe Foss Field in South Dakota, a World War II facility, a vehicle \nmaintenance and storage complex. It is of World War II vintage. And it \ndoes not meet the \n\n[[Page S11196]]\nfire and safety standards. It is in violation.\n  So I think people ought to be very careful and look at this on a \nproject-by-project basis. I know the Senator from Ohio has done that, \nor will do that. But an awful lot of this effort here goes directly to \nthe very areas that are a priority.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I do not quarrel with the fact that some of the funding in \nthis goes to MilCon projects that are good and under the 5-year plan \nwould be fine. But if we found $228 million to spend, it seems to me if \nwe want to spend that on MilCon projects, we should have gone back to \nthe Defense Department and said, where do you need it most, where are \nthe worst barracks, where are the people living in the most intolerable \nconditions, and let them prioritize where the greatest needs are.\n  I submit most of these items were placed back on this agenda and \nmoved ahead on the 5-year plan because of a personal interest of a \nparticular Senator, and this was not done on a priority basis where the \ngreatest needs are in the military. That is my objection to it.\n  I know that we followed some of the criteria on the 5-year defense \nplan that we used as one of our criteria. I think if we can find this \nkind of money, it should be put to use in places where the Pentagon \nsays they need it most, not just in those areas where the Members were \ngetting something back for their particular States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to thank my ranking minority member \non the subcommittee because we worked together on this. I want to \nassure the Senators, not only did we follow the criteria, but the \nsuggestions of the different services that appeared before our \ncommittee. This is where they wanted housing built. This is where they \nwanted the construction.\n  We increased family housing $111 million, in family housing alone, \nand this touches every service. There is no one service, but these were \nthe high priority units requested by each of the services. We have a \ntotal deficit of 273,000 units which are inadequate or entirely \nunavailable.\n  When we went to the all-volunteer Army, in all the services, we \nchanged our relationship with our military personnel.\n  As my friend from Arizona pointed out, he is hearing from captains \nand lieutenants about the construction, ``Why are we getting this \nmoney?'' I will tell you that there is not a lot of it that is going \ninto officer's quarters. If you will look at where this money is going, \nit is going to the enlisted personnel. We have a deficit of barrack \nspaces. We are 161,000 units short of that.\n  Then Dr. Perry, when we talked to him, the Secretary of Defense, \nsaid, ``I have a new housing initiative, but give me a little money and \nI can lever in the private sector.''\n  He wants a pilot program on that to see if it will work on off-base \nhousing for some of our married personnel. We gave that to Dr. Perry \nbecause it is very high on his priority list.\n  He said maybe we can double the availability of housing that we have. \nSo when I say that my friend from Nevada and I, when we had the \nhearings and our staffs got together--and there has been nobody better \nto work with on this committee in trying to prioritize what we do with \nthis money than Senator Reid--we know that the BRAC has taken a lot \nmore money out of MilCon than we first thought it ever would, because \nof the environmental cleanup. We are not through that yet. In fact, we \ndo not really know what the bottom line is going to be on that or what \nthe cost is going to be before these bases that are being closed and \nbases are being realigned, before those bases become available and can \nbe moved into the private sector, because right now they have no value \nto us at all until we complete the mission of environmental cleanup.\n  So when we look at the totality of what we have, the dollars are very \nwell invested and all meet the criteria that was set forth by the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  I want to thank the Armed Services Committee, because they have done \nan excellent job in setting priorities on this particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind comments of the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the junior Senator from Montana.\n  I support this amendment that has been offered by the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee. Mr. President, this conforms the military \nconstruction projects in the authorization bill to those already \napproved by the Senate in the military construction appropriations \nbill. I am a cosponsor of this amendment and hope the Senate will \nsupport it as strongly as it did, an identical provision, by a vote of \n77 to 18 a week or so ago when we considered the military construction \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, these projects are critical, worthy, well-scrubbed, \nquality-of-life projects which are needed in this era of an all-\nvolunteer force. The chairman of the subcommittee very well outlined \nhow our military force has changed. We depend much more today than we \ndid 5 years ago, 10 years ago on a Reserve and Guard component, as we \nshould. Any suggestion, as indicated by the senior Senator from Ohio in \nhis remarks just a short time ago, that military housing is \nshortchanged is certainly true. That is what we are trying to rectify \npartially in this bill, and this amendment will allow us to do that.\n  Military housing has been shortchanged. I agree with the Senator from \nOhio. We built many homes for the military during the Second World War. \nThose homes were to last for 5 years, 10 years at the most. People are \nstill living in them after 50 years.\n  In many places, the military cannot live in the houses provided. No. \n1, some of them are so bad they cannot live in them with their \nfamilies, and at other times they just do not exist. So they have to \nlive off base. Because housing is so expensive, they have to go on food \nstamps. One out of every 10 of our military is on food stamps. Why? \nBecause housing is so outrageously expensive, they have no choice.\n  What the chairman of the subcommittee did and the ranking member is \ntry to do a little bit to solve that problem--dormitories, barracks \nwhere single military can live. We did not go for officer's quarters. \nWe looked to the enlisted men, what we could do to help the enlisted \nmen and women of this country live a little better.\n  There is a tremendous backlog. We only do a little bit, but that \nlittle bit will help those people concerned.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, if you are in the military and you want \nto live and live decently, you are really more concerned about that \nthan some new weapons system. If we are going to have a strong \nmilitary, one of the things we must have are people who feel good about \nbeing in the military; they have a decent place to live.\n  So I strongly endorse the remarks made by the chairman of the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, my friend, Mr. Burns. He has done a great job on this \nsubcommittee.\n  As he has said, each project meets strict criteria. First, these \nprojects are all mission essential.\n  Second, each of these projects has already been programmed in the \nDepartment's outyear budget.\n  Third, a construction site has been selected for each of these \nprojects, not by members of the subcommittee, not by members of the \ncommittee, but by the military.\n  Fourth, each project is considered by the base commander as their \nhighest priority, not a priority, but their highest priority.\n  And fifth, each of these projects can be awarded in this 1996 fiscal \nyear.\n  As I have said on the floor in the past, I do not think anyone would \nconsider the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, as a big spender. I have never heard the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina referred to as a big spender. I do \nnot know of anyone in the history of the U.S. Senate that has gained a \nstronger reputation for watching how the money of this country is spent \nthan the Senator from South Carolina, the sponsor of this amendment. \nAnd probably running a close \n\n[[Page S11197]]\nsecond is the Senator from Georgia, the senior Senator from Georgia, \nthe ranking member, formerly the chairman of this full committee. The \nsenior Senator from Georgia, on all issues, not only military issues, \nwatches where the pennies are spent.\n  Well, Mr. President, during the floor action to approve the military \nconstruction bill, we heard from both cochairmen of the National Guard \nCaucus. We heard from Senator Bond of Missouri today and then we heard \nfrom Senator Ford of Kentucky. Their statements reflect the degree to \nwhich the active services tend to protect their own. The Pentagon \nalways looks out for their own and not very often do they look out for \nthe guard and reserve. That is an obligation traditionally that we have \nhad, and I do not shirk that responsibility. Their statements, I \nrepeat, reflect the degree that the active services tend to protect \ntheir own, neglecting adequately to consider and promote the National \nGuard and Reserve components. The active services can, therefore, \nbudget their forces in the active force request and they traditionally \nunderfund the guard and reserve. This year is no different. That is not \nthe way it should be, but that is the way it is.\n  The guard and reserve deserve more than what the Pentagon and \nadministration requested in this budget and in budgets in the past. \nWhen the going gets tough and there is a potential crisis on the \nhorizon, the guard and reserve are called. I recently received a call \nfrom my friend who is a major in the Nevada National Guard. This man \nleft his business during the gulf crisis to serve his country for 1 \nyear. He was a combat veteran from Vietnam. He wanted to go to combat \nagain in Iraq. They would not let him do it. They needed his service in \nthe Pentagon. He has now been asked to go to Germany because he is an \nexpert in something they need. That is what the guard and reserve is \nall about. They deserve more than what the administration and Pentagon \nrequested in this budget. My friend, Maj. Evan Wallot, is debating in \nhis own mind whether he is going to go to Germany. We in Congress are \ntraditionally forced into the position of putting the priorities into a \nbetter balance--I am glad we have done that--which means adding needed \nfunds to projects in the guard and reserve. These funds are for nothing \nlavish.\n  The amendment helps emphasize the importance of housing for our \nmilitary families. This amendment replaces housing that suffers. Some \nplaces have suffered more than 50 years of neglect; they were built \naround the Second World War as temporary structures, built just for \nthat war era.\n  It was not for the Second World War, not for Korea, not for Vietnam, \nnot the cold war, or for Iraq, not for Haiti. Although that Second \nWorld War is long since gone, our military personnel continue to \nsurvive in these outdated residences. These projects are not budget \nbusters. Each Senator should understand that the Military Construction \nSubcommittee was totally within our 602(b) allocation. Every penny was \nwithin the 602(b) allocation. It is just this simple. The committee \nevaluates rather than the Pentagon.\n  The budget requested by the Department of Defense has been, once \nagain, as in past years, neglected, and I use that word pointedly to \naddress the military construction needs of the National Guard. It is \n$182 million for guard and reserve military construction, as compared \nto $574 million appropriated just last year. When approved, this \namendment will authorize 20 percent less than last year, some $452 \nmillion.\n  Once again, I emphasize this amendment addresses the long, overlooked \nquality of life initiative, particularly, Mr. President, in family \nhousing and barracks, the initiative making up nearly one-third of the \ntotal military construction authorization. I repeat, as the senior \nSenator from Ohio said, military housing is usually shortchanged. We \nrecognize that. That is why a third of what we are talking about here \ngoes to military housing.\n  Mr. President, these programs are wasteful. The chairman of the full \ncommittee has sponsored this amendment and has come here to say that \nthese that these projects are important. We must do a better job with \nthe persons defending our country. We must recognize the necessity of \nthe total bill and the effect of this amendment will help to authorize \nits completion.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator from Arizona and I have joined together on a \nnumber of items. This is an area where we happen to disagree.\n  Mr. NUNN. If the Senator will yield, I thank my friend from Nevada \nfor his leadership in this military construction area and for his \nremarks on the floor, and also my friend from Montana, chairman of that \nsubcommittee. They have done a splendid job, and we have enjoyed \nworking with them.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, some time ago, I contacted the Department \nof Defense raising my concerns about the status of military housing. As \nchairman of the Personnel Subcommittee and someone that is charged with \nlooking out for the quality of life of our military personnel, survey \nafter survey, inquiry after inquiry, letter after letter kept raising \nthe issue of the quality, or lack thereof, of military housing, both \nfamily housing and single soldier housing. And so I contacted the \nDepartment of Defense, and they confirmed my worse suspicions and gave \nme information that, frankly, was far worse than what I thought I would \nhear. That is, that military housing is in a deplorable State.\n  Much of the housing is more than 30 years old. It has suffered from \nlack of adequate maintenance and repair because funds have been \ndiverted to other uses. Whenever there is a crunch on the utilization \nor need for funds, it seems like housing has always been pushed aside \nto be dealt with next year.\n  The Secretary of Defense saw that problem in his travels around the \nworld in talking with troops, commanders, and others, and he identified \nthis as a priority and has testified before our committee that this is \none of his top priorities. He has articulately drawn the link between \nquality of life and readiness, and he has displayed for us and outlined \nfor us the very sad state of military housing throughout our military. \nIt has been neglected.\n  We have young men and women who are committing a career to service \nfor this country, who are given the very best of training; they are \ngiven the very best of leadership that this country can offer; they are \ngiven the very best of equipment to operate and to utilize that this \ncountry can produce. We are attracting some of the very best people \nthat our institutions are graduating to the services today. But when it \ncomes to providing for their living conditions, they are given not the \nbest, not anywhere close to the best, but some of the worst housing you \ncan find in any of our cities across the country.\n  I have personally visited a number of barracks and a number of family \nhousing units and a number of different bases. These are facilities \nthat do not begin to measure up to minimum standards that we would \nexpect. Some of the statistics are stunning: 60,000 Air Force housing \nunits do not measure up to contemporary standards, and they are \nprobably the best of the services; 75 percent of the Army's family \nhousing does not even meet Department of Defense standards.\n  I just want to inform my colleagues that Department of Defense \nstandards are not standards that you normally find outside of the \nmilitary. They are lower; they are smaller in square footage; they \nrequire less in terms of quality construction than what is normally \nfound.\n  I think it is a disgrace that we are putting some of our military \npeople in some of the kind of housing that we find in our military \nbases.\n  Nearly 85 percent of the Army's barracks--facilities that house \nsingle sailors and soldiers and Air Force and marines--80 to 85 percent \nof the Army's barracks do not meet current Department of Defense \nstandards. So we have a huge backlog of dilapidated housing in which we \nare putting our Army families and putting our system military people.\n  We have leaking roofs, air conditioners that do not work. We have \nlatrine facilities that do not begin to meet the needs of those living \nin the units. Four shower heads, usually two that are not working, for \nabout 60 to 65 soldiers. We have toilets that do not flush. We have \nmold that is rotting away the tile and rotting away some of the walls. \nWe have windows that do not provide adequate seals. We have rooms that \nare of such small square footage \n\n[[Page S11198]]\nthat the military personnel cannot begin to put their stereo, their TV, \nor just a basic dresser drawer to put their clothes in.\n  We are looking at a program here that is going to take a number of \nyears, at least a decade, to begin to bring the facilities up to \nstandard.\n  When we have been able to come up with some additional funds, I think \none of the top priorities for those funds needs to be adequate housing \nfor our military personnel.\n  I cannot speak to the portion of the military construction budget \nthat goes to fund other items. I know we have infrastructure and other \nmaintenance problems throughout the military. I cannot speak to that, \nbut I can speak to the portion that goes to the housing.\n  I am pleased that the committee has designated this as a priority. I \nam pleased they have adopted the criteria established by the Senate \nArmed Services Committee for evaluating these needs. I have had a \nnumber of discussions with the chairman of the MilCon Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and he has outlined for me that they have faithfully \nfollowed the criteria and the recommendations to try to get at some of \nthe worst housing on a priority basis.\n  To the extent that we can accelerate some funding for this crucial \narea, I think we ought to do that. I am supportive of this particular \neffort. There is a housing initiative that has been undertaken by the \nDepartment. We granted some new authority for that to the Department of \nDefense.\n  Passage of this authorization bill and acceptable conference of the \nitem will provide the Department of Defense with needed new authority \nto privatize some of this construction and maintenance effort, \nrebuilding efforts, and renovation effort. That is necessary if we are \never going to provide the kind of housing on a decent timetable for our \nmilitary personnel.\n  The combination of the military construction funds that are utilized \nnow for building new and renovating military family housing and \nbarracks housing and the initiative that has been undertaken by the \nDepartment of Defense with both the inside task force group and an \noutside task force group headed by former Secretary of the Army John \nMarsh, a two-pronged effort to try to deal with a very significant \nproblem that exists today in our armed services.\n  We have directed considerable funds to a number of tactical systems, \nto modernization, to readiness. If we had more, we could direct more. \nWe wish we had more.\n  We cannot continue to defer the construction of housing and the \nrenovation of housing for our military personnel and claim that we are \nproviding the necessary quality of life for themselves and their \nfamilies, that will attract the kind of people we want for our \nmilitary. We cannot continue to do that. We are forfeiting the future.\n  We have postponed this now for more than a decade. It is time we \nundertook this project. I am thankful for the work by the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee. I hope that we \ncan successfully move this forward as we attempt to finalize the \nlegislation on this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to remind the Senate that \nthe House has already passed $500 million for these facilities. In this \namendment we are asking only for $228 million. The defense \nappropriations has approved this amount already.\n  We are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further discussion? If there is no \nfurther discussion, the question is on agreeing to amendment numbered \n2084, offered by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The amendment (No. 2084) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2085\n\n(Purpose: To exclude the Associate Director of Central Intelligence for \n Military Support from grade limitations applicable to members of the \n                             Armed Forces)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask it \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2085.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 403, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1095. ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE FOR \n                   MILITARY SUPPORT.\n\n       Section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     403) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) In the event that neither the Director nor Deputy \n     Director of Central Intelligence is a commissioned officer of \n     the Armed Forces, a commissioned officer of the Armed Forces \n     appointed to the position of Associate Director of Central \n     Intelligence for Military Support, while serving in such \n     position, shall not be counted against the numbers and \n     percentages of commissioned officers of the rank and grade of \n     such officer authorized for the armed force of which such \n     officer is a member.''.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. This amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 \nprovides, in the event neither the director or deputy director of \nCentral Intelligence is a commissioned officer of the Armed Forces, a \ncommissioned officer of the Armed Forces appointed to the position of \nassociate director of Central Intelligence for Military Support, while \nserving in such position, shall not be counted against the numbers and \npercentages of commissioned officers of the rank and grade of such \nofficers authorized for the Armed Force of which such officer is a \nmember.\n  Mr. President, the law now provides that a commissioned officer of \nthe Armed Forces appointed as either the Director or Deputy Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency shall not be counted against the \nnumbers and percentages of commissioned officers of the rank and grade \nof such officer authorized for the Armed Force of which such officer is \na member.\n  At the present time, neither the Director nor Deputy Director of the \nCIA is a commissioned officer. At the same time, an important new \nposition of Associate Director of the CIA for Military Support is being \ncreated. The incumbent of the new position, who will be a three-star \nadmiral, will serve as the principal advisor to the Director and Deputy \nDirector of the CIA on military issues, with particular emphasis on \nIntelligence Community support for military forces and operations. This \nwill include serving as liaison between the Intelligence Community and \nsenior military officers of the Joint Staff and the unified combatant \ncommands; evaluating the adequacy of intelligence support for all \nmilitary purposes, including operations, training, and weapons \nacquisition; reviewing intelligence resources in the light of military \nneeds; representing the Director of Central Intelligence on various \nboards and interagency groups established for crises and issues that \npotentially involve the deployment of U.S. military forces; and serving \nas the Director's principal liaison with foreign military \norganizations.\n  This new position will be of critical importance under the \ncircumstances when, as now, neither the Director nor Deputy Director of \nCIA are commissioned officers. However, because of Congressionally \nmandated grade limitations, the Navy, which will be providing the 3-\nstar officer for this position, does not have a 3-star number available \nand has had to borrow a number from the Army. The Army will need that \nnumber in a couple of months.\n  This amendment, by enabling the assignment of a three-star officer \nwithout counting against that officer's Armed Force, would facilitate \nthe performance of this critically important function at times when, as \nat present, neither the Director nor Deputy Director of CIA is a \ncommissioned officer.\n  What this amendment does, since there is no military officer either \nas director or deputy director, it simply shifts over and allows this \nexemption on counting against the officers in the military services to \napply to the new position, which is the associate director for military \nmatters.\n  This is a new position. It will carry out the spirit of what we had \ndone in the past with this exemption. \n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\n  I believe this amendment is acceptable to both sides. I hope it would \nbe supported.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objection to this amendment. \nIt will make it possible for one qualified service military officer to \nbe assigned to the CIA without counting against the limit on senior \nofficers within the Department of Defense.\n  I join the distinguished Senator from Georgia in supporting this \namendment and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further discussion, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment numbered 2085, offered by the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  The amendment (No. 2085) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2086\n\n(Purpose: To authorize a land conveyance, Naval Surface Warfare Center, \n                              Memphis, TN)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Thompson, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for Mr. \n     Thompson, proposes an amendment numbered 2086.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 487, below line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2838. LAND CONVEYANCE, NAVAL SURFACE WARFARE CENTER, \n                   MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Convey.--The Secretary of the Navy may \n     convey to the Memphis and Shelby County Port Commission, \n     Memphis, Tennessee (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Port''), all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to a parcel of real property (including any \n     improvements thereon) consisting of approximately 26 acres \n     that is located at the Carderock Division, Naval Surface \n     Warfare Center, Memphis Detachment, Presidents Island, \n     Memphis, Tennessee.\n       (b) Consideration.--As consideration for the conveyance of \n     real property under subsection (a), the Port shall--\n       (1) grant to the United States a restrictive easement in \n     and to a parcel of real property consisting of approximately \n     100 acres that is adjacent to the Memphis Detachment, \n     Presidents Island, Memphis, Tennessee; and\n       (2) if the fair market value of the easement granted under \n     paragraph (1) exceeds the fair market value of the real \n     property conveyed under subsection (a), provide the United \n     States such addition consideration as the Secretary and the \n     Port jointly determine appropriate so that the value of the \n     consideration received by the United States under this \n     subsection is equal to or greater than the fair market value \n     of the real property conveyed under subsection (a).\n       (c) Condition of Conveyance.--The conveyance authorized by \n     subsection (a) shall be carried out in accordance with the \n     provisions of the Land Exchange Agreement between the United \n     States of America and the Memphis and Shelby County Port \n     Commission, Memphis, Tennessee.\n       (d) Determination of Fair Market Value.--The Secretary \n     shall determine the fair market value of the real property to \n     be conveyed under subsection (a) and of the easement to be \n     granted under subsection (b)(1). Such determinations shall be \n     final.\n       (e) Use of Proceeds.--The Secretary shall deposit any \n     proceeds received under subsection (b)(2) as consideration \n     for the conveyance of real property authorized under \n     subsection (a) in the special account established pursuant to \n     section 204(h) of the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 485(h)).\n       (f) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property to be conveyed under \n     subsection (a) and the easement to be granted under \n     subsection (b)(1) shall be determined by surveys satisfactory \n     to the Secretary. The cost of the surveys shall be borne by \n     the Port.\n       (g) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance authorized by subsection (a) and the \n     easement granted under subsection (b)(1) as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. The committee has reviewed the amendment. It provides \nfor the exchange of property at fair market value, which ensures that \nthe Federal Government is fully compensated.\n  The amendment appears to be in the best interest of the Navy and the \ncommunities.\n  I recommend approval of the amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment is supported by the \nDepartment of Navy.\n  I have a letter dated July 28 from the principal deputy of the \nDepartment of Navy, Office of the Assistant Secretary, and I ask it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                            Office of the Assistant Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: Based on the inquiries from your \n     staff, this is to advise you that the Department of the Navy \n     would support the proposed legislation pertaining to a \n     proposed land agreement involving the Naval Surface Warfare \n     Center, Memphis Detachment and Memphis and Shelby County Port \n     Commission. The property is located at Presidents Island, \n     Memphis, Tennessee.\n       The proposed legislation will provide a buffer zone between \n     the river and the Cavitation Channel facility, which will \n     increase mission efficiency. In addition, the Navy has no \n     immediate need for the crane which if transferred to the \n     Ports Authority will be maintained in operable condition and \n     available for our use in the future if required.\n       If I may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate \n     to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Cheryl Kandaras,\n                                                 Principal Deputy.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment will allow a transfer of \nproperty between the U.S. Navy and the Port of Memphis, TN. The Navy \nwill receive 100 acres of land to act as both a security and acoustic \nbuffer zone for its Naval Service Warfare Center in Memphis. In return, \nthe port will obtain from the Navy a 1,250-ton stiff leg derrick crane. \nThe crane will give the port a facility to load and offload specialty \ncargo. In fact, no other port in the Central United States will have \nsuch lifting capabilities. This will be a great benefit for recruitment \nof future industry to Memphis and Shelby County.\n  This is something the Navy wants and the Port of Memphis and others \nin the community want. Local officials say it will bring new industry \nand more jobs to the Memphis area. As this is beneficial for both sides \nand there are no new costs involved, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge approval of the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2086) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11191-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COATS.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to make \nreimbursement of defense contractors for costs of excessive amounts of \ncompensation for contractor personnel unallowable under Department of \nDefense contracts.\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\n\n\n              department of defense contracts legislation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \ncap taxpayer reimbursement for the salaries of defense contractor \nexecutives at $250,000 per year. This legislation will permanently \nextend the temporary CAP established in the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense \nAppropriations Act. I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by \nthe Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley].\n  I began investigating this issue after hearing reports of multi-\nmillion-dollar bonuses awarded as a result of the Lockheed-Martin \nMarietta merger. As a result of that merger, $92 million in bonuses \nwill be awarded--$31 million of which will be paid by the taxpayers.\n  I think it is wrong that corporate executives make so much money at a \ntime when their employees are struggling just to make ends meet. What \nmakes it even worse in this case is that these multi-million-dollar \nbonuses were given as a reward for a business deal resulting in 12,000 \nlayoffs nationwide.\n  So the taxpayers buy rich executives $31 million worth of champagne \nand caviar, while laid-off defense workers struggle just to feed their \nfamilies. I think the defense industry employees--in California and \nacross the Nation--are the ones who deserve a bonus. The CEO's and \nmultimillionaire executives are doing just fine.\n  As I investigated this issue further, I discovered that the problem \nwas not limited to mergers or bonuses. Top defense industry executives \nroutinely earn more than $1 million per year--sometimes even more than \n$5 million. And the taxpayers pick up most of the tab.\n  This legislation sets a $250,000 maximum for compensation that is \nreimbursable by the taxpayers. It applies to all forms of compensation \nincluding bonuses and salary.\n  It is important to understand that my bill sets no limit on the \ncompensation that an executive can receive. That is an issue best left \nto the stockholders and directors of each company. If the stockholders \nbelieve that the Lockheed-Martin merger was such a fine business \ndecision that they want to award their CEO a $9 million bonus--or for \nthat matter a $90 million bonus--that is fine with me. All my \nlegislation would do is stop them from passing the check to the \ntaxpayers.\n  My legislation would add ``excessive compensation''--defined as all \npay over $250,000 in any fiscal year--to an existing list of expenses \nthat cannot be reimbursed by the taxpayers. Under current law, the \nPentagon cannot reimburse contractors for expenses ranging from small \nitems such as concert tickets and alcoholic beverages to large items, \nlike golden parachutes and stock option plans. My legislation would add \ncompensation in excess of $250,000 to this list.\n  Congress has studied this issue for a number of years and has noted \nwith increasing concern that executive compensation seems to be \nspiraling out of control. In last year's DoD appropriations bill, \nCongress placed a 1-year $250,000 cap on executive compensation. This \nlegislation takes the next logical step--making that cap permanent.\n  I think this legislation addresses the issue fairly and responsibly. \nI hope my colleagues will support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be inserted in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend for 4 years the period of applicability of \nenrollment mix requirement to certain health maintenance organizations \nproviding services under Dayton Area Health Plan; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  DAYTON AREA HEALTH PLAN LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today, Senator DeWine and I are \nintroducing legislation which is necessary for the continued operation \nof the Dayton Area Health Plan.\n  The Dayton Area Health Plan is a mandatory managed care plan for \n24,000 Medicaid recipients in Montgomery County, OH, which has been \noperating very successfully for over 6 years. It emphasizes preventive \ncare and has developed two programs--Baby's Birth Right and Neighbors \nin Touch--to increase the use of prenatal and after-delivery care. In \npartnership with the Dayton School Board, it brings HealthChek physical \nexams to schoolchildren in Dayton.\n  Last fall, the Dayton Area Health Plan became the first Medicaid HMO \nin Ohio to publish a quality score card which assesses the plan's \nperformance in the important areas of access to care, preventive care, \nsuccess of medical care, consumer satisfaction, operational \nefficiencies, and quality assurance survey scores.\n  The Dayton Area Health Plan is operating under a waiver of the \nFederal 75/25 enrollment mix requirement for HMO's--a requirement that \nfor every three Medicaid enrollees a plan must have one non-Medicaid \nenrollee. The current waiver expires at the end of the year, and the \nlegislation we are introducing today extends it until December 31, \n1999. This legislation is supported by the Ohio Department of Human \nServices, which received a waiver of the 75/25 enrollment mix \nrequirement for HMO's participating in OhioCare, an 1115 Medicaid \nwaiver program. However, the implementation of OhioCare has been \ndelayed due to concerns about the level of Federal Medicaid funding for \nfiscal year 1996 and beyond.\n  The Dayton Area Health Plan has widespread community support and has \nbeen increasingly successful in providing high-quality, cost-effective \ncare to Medicaid recipients in Montgomery County, OH. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation which extends the plan's waiver \nfor 4 years.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 1104.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce two temporary duty \nsuspension bills. It is my understanding that they are \nnoncontroversial. I am introducing these on behalf of AgrEvo, a company \nlocated in my home State of Delaware, because they will help improve \nthe company's overall competitive posture by lowering its costs of \ndoing business.\n  While I recognize that it is exceedingly difficult to enact temporary \nduty suspensions, the administration has authority to proclaim certain \ntariff reductions in the context of additional progress in the WTO to \nharmonize chemical tariffs at lower levels. I urge the administration \nto achieve such progress, particularly through expanding the \nparticipation of other countries in the WTO's chemical tariff \nharmonization agreement. This would allow the administration to address \ngrowing demands for new duty suspensions on chemical products by \nutilizing existing tariff proclamation authority.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same insurance reserve treatment to financial guaranty insurance as \napplies to mortgage guaranty insurance, lease guaranty insurance, and \ntax-exempt bond insurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the financial guaranty insurance act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Moynihan, and I are introducing legislation to amend Section \n832(e) of the Internal Revenue Code to extend the scope of its \nprovisions to general financial guaranty insurance.\n  Financial guaranty insurance, commonly called bond insurance, is an \ninsurance contract that guarantees timely payment of principal and \ninterest when due. The bond insurance contract generally provides that, \nin the event of a default by an insured issuer, principal and interest \nwill be paid to the bond holder as originally scheduled.\n  Originally enacted in 1967, currently, section 832(e) applies to \nunderwriters of mortgage guaranty insurance, lease guaranty insurance, \nand state and local tax-exempt bond insurance. Congress enacted section \n832(e) to alleviate the significant drain on insurance providers' \nworking capital that State financial regulations place on those firms. \nUnder section 832(e), a company writing mortgage guaranty insurance, \nlease guaranty insurance and tax-exempt bond insurance may deduct, for \nFederal income tax purposes, amounts required by state law to be set \naside in a reserve for losses resulting from adverse economic cycles. \nThe deduction cannot exceed the lesser of, first, the company's taxable \nincome or, second, 50 percent of the premiums earned on such guaranty \ncontracts during the taxable year.\n  Further, the deduction is available only to the extent that the \ntaxpayer purchases non-interest-bearing tax and loss bonds equal to the \ntax savings attributable to the deduction. The taxpayer insurance \ncompany may redeem such bonds only as and when it restores to income \nthe associated deduction for reserves. Reserves are restored to income \nas and when they are applied, according to state regulations, to cover \nlosses, or to the extent that the company has a net operating loss in \nsome subsequent year. In addition, the reserve deduction taken in any \nparticular year must be fully restored to income by the end of the 10th \nsubsequent year. For the tax-exempt bond insurance, this period is \nincreased to 20 years.\n  Mr. President, our proposed legislation would expand the scope of \nsection 832(e) to include general financial guaranty insurance. This \nreflects the fact that the guaranty industry has expanded, and now \nprovides other insurance guaranty instruments not offered at the time \nsection 832(e) was enacted. These new guaranties are regulated by the \nsame State financial regulations that apply to insurance guaranties \ncurrently covered by section 832(e); producing the same extraordinary \ntax burden that existed for earlier guaranty insurance instruments. \nThus, the proposed legislation constitutes a sensible modification of \nthe code to reflect new forms of bond insurance, and does so in a way \nwhich both Congress and Treasury have previously found acceptable.\n  This bill would allow those insurance companies which are writing \nlease guarantee insurance and insurance guaranteeing the debt service \nof municipal bond issues, for example, obligations the interest on \nwhich is excludable from gross income under section 103 of the Code, to \ndeduct additions to contingency reserves in accordance with the current \ntreatment of such additions for mortgage guaranty insurance under \nsection 832(e).\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Simon, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. \n        Leahy, and Mr. Pressler):\n  S. 1107. A bill to extend COBRA continuation coverage to retirees and \ntheir dependents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n             THE RETIREE CONTINUATION COVERAGE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in March I introduced a bill to address a \nserious problem brought to my attention by the retirees of the John \nMorrell meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls. Unfortunately, the situation \nhas deteriorated in recent months and I feel that a new bill is needed \nto address the issues raised by this incident and to protect future \nretirees from being placed in a similar predicament.\n  Last January more than 3,000 retirees of the Morrell Co. in Sioux \nFalls and around the country found out that their health benefits were \nbeing terminated by their former employer.\n  With just a week's notice, these retirees, many of whom had accepted \nlower pensions in return for the promise of lifetime health benefits, \nwere suddenly faced with the prospect of losing the benefits that they \nhad assumed would be available for them and their spouses during their \nretirement years.\n  The bill I introduced in March would have required employers to \ncontinue to provide retiree health benefits while a cancellation of \ncoverage was being challenged in court. However, the Supreme Court \nrecently refused to hear the Morrell case, leaving this group no \npossibility of a judicial remedy for their problems.\n  Meanwhile, thousands of retirees and their families are left stranded \nwithout health coverage.\n  I am introducing a bill today to allow early retirees and their \ndependents who lost their health benefits to purchase continuing group \ninsurance coverage until they become eligible for Medicare.\n  This would not prohibit employers from modifying their retiree health \nplans to implement cost-savings measures, such as utilization review or \nmanaged care. But it would protect retirees from suddenly losing their \nemployer-sponsored health benefits.\n  This legislation simply extends COBRA coverage to early retirees and \ntheir dependents whose employer-sponsored health care benefits are \nterminated or substantially reduced. There would be no direct cost to \nthe employer.\n  COBRA currently requires employers to offer temporary continuing \nhealth coverage for employees who leave their jobs. The employee is \nresponsible for the entire cost of the premium, but is allowed to \nremain in the group policy, thus benefiting from lower group rates. \nThis legislation would extend the COBRA law to cover early\n retirees and their families, until they are eligible for Medicare.\n\n  This bill would help secure health coverage for the most vulnerable \nretirees, at no cost to the Federal Government. It simply allows those \nworkers who may not be able to purchase coverage elsewhere to take \nadvantage of their former employer's lower group insurance rate.\n  These retirees deserve this kind of health security.\n  Workers often give up larger pensions and other benefits in exchange \nfor health benefits. It never occurs to these employees that their \nbenefits could be taken away, with no increase in their pensions or \nother benefits to compensate for the loss.\n  Early retirees have often been with the same company for decades, \nperhaps all of their adult lives. They rightfully believe that a \ncompany they help build will reward their loyalty, honesty and hard \nwork.\n  When these hard-working people abruptly lose their health coverage, \nthey suddenly have to worry that high medical costs will impoverish \nthem or force them to rely on their children or the Government for \nfinancial help. Each day without insurance they live in fear of illness \nand injury.\n  In this particular case, Morrell retirees received a simple, yet \nunexpected, letter stating their health insurance plan was being \nterminated, effective midnight, January 31, 1995--only a week later. \nThe benefits being terminated, the letter said, included all hospital, \nmajor medical and prescription drug coverage, Medicare supplemental \ninsurance, vision care, and life insurance coverage.\n  For those retirees under 65, this action poses a particular problem. \nWhile Morrell did give them the option of paying for their own coverage \nfor up to 1 year, for many that is simply not \n\n[[Page S11204]]\nenough time. For example, if a retiree leaves the company at age 59, he \nor she will not be eligible for Medicare for 6 years; the original \noffer from the company could have left him or her without coverage for \n5 years.\n  This bill will help many Morrell retirees; but there are thousands of \nother workers who could also benefit from this legislation. A 1994 \nFoster-Higgins report found that two-thirds of American companies \nsurveyed had plans to reduce retiree health benefits or to shift more \ncosts to retirees in the coming years, and 2 percent said that they \nwere actually eliminating benefits altogether.\n  The presence of preexisting conditions can make it impossible for \nelderly Americans to purchase health insurance; insurers may refuse to \nenroll people who they expect to be heavy users or they may price the \npolicies so that they are simply unaffordable. Consequently, early \nretirees with medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, \nneed to be continuously covered until they become eligible for \nMedicare.\n  This bill is not a cure, but it is a step in the right direction. It \nwill help secure coverage for early retirees who cannot afford to buy \nan individual insurance policy. Under this legislation, Morrell \nretirees could be paying a premium of $500 a month per couple. While \nthis is a lot of money for retirees on limited incomes, it is \nsubstantially less than if they purchased coverage on their own. And, \nof course, many are currently unable to purchase insurance at any \nprice.\n  As I have said repeatedly, the long-run solution is comprehensive \nhealth reform that guarantees every American citizen--and every \nAmerican employer--access to affordable health care.\n  I have fought over the years for comprehensive health reform and was \ndeeply disappointed when the 103d Congress was unable to pass \nlegislation addressing some of our health care system's most serious \nproblems. If we had passed health reform, the Morrell retirees I have \nspoken about today would not face this loss of their health benefits.\n  Clearly, the problems we talked about in last year's health reform \ndebate did not solve themselves when the session ended.\n  But some of these problems, like the one the Morrell retirees face, \ncannot wait for the long-run.\n  I hope we can pass this measure expeditiously, to help alleviate the \nharshest aspects of the injustice created by the Morrell Co. decision \nto eliminate retiree health coverage, and so that others are helped as \nthey face the problem Morrell retirees are grappling with today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals to designate that up to 10 percent of their income tax \nliability be used to reduce the national debt, and to require spending \nreductions equal to the amounts so designated.\n\n\n                     THE TAXPAYER DEBT BUY-DOWN ACT\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the \nTaxpayer Debt Buy-Down Act. The proposal is specifically designed to \ngive taxpayers an unprecedented role in the budget process and provide \na mechanism for an annual national referendum on Federal spending. If \nCongress fails to reign in Federal spending, this bill allows the \ntaxpayers of America to speak out every April 15.\n  The proposal would amend the IRS Code to allow taxpayers the \nopportunity to voluntarily designate up to 10 percent of their income \ntax liability for the purpose of debt reduction. All moneys designated \nwould be placed in a national debt reduction fund established in the \nDepartment of the Treasury, and used to retire the public debt, except \nobligations held by the Social Security trust fund, the civil service, \nand military retirement funds.\n  On October 1, the Treasury Department would be required to estimate \nthe amount designated through the checkoff. Congress would then have \nuntil September 30 of the following year to make the necessary cuts in \nFederal spending. The Debt Buy-Down Act does not micromanage the \nspending cuts. Congress retains complete authority to cut any Federal \nspending program it deems appropriate. \n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\n  To coordinate this measure and the efforts to balance the budget, the \ncheckoff will apply only if the amount designated is greater than the \ncuts that Congress has already implemented. For example, if Congress \npasses a reconciliation bill this year that designates cuts of $50 \nbillion in 1998, and the checkoff in 1998 totals $60 billion, the $50 \nbillion will count toward the checkoff and only an additional $10 \nbillion will need to be cut.\n  If Congress failed to enact spending reductions to meet the amount \ndesignated by the taxpayers, an across-the-board sequester would occur \nof all accounts except the Social Security retirement benefits, \ninterest of the debt, deposit insurance accounts and contractual \nobligations of the Federal Government. If Congress enacted only half of \nthe necessary cuts, the sequester would ensure the other half. The Debt \nBuy-Down account would hold Congress's feet to the fire.\n  All spending cuts required by the act would be permanent--the cuts \nwould permanently reduce the spending baseline. For example, if $1 \nbillion of cuts are\n required and Congress eliminates a $1 billion program in the \nDepartment of Energy, that program would be gone forever. If Congress \nlater decided that they needed the program, they would be required to \ncut $1 billion elsewhere. Although nothing in the legislation would \nprohibit Congress from increasing taxes, tax increases could not be \nused to substitute for the spending reductions designated by taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow the current talk about balanced \nbudgets to deter us from our ultimate goal--elimination of the $4.9 \ntrillion national debt. Yes, we must balance the budget first, and this \nproposal serves as a friendly enforcement mechanism to do just that. \nBalancing the budget, however, does not guarantee that we will begin to \nbuy down our national debt. If our budget is balanced by the year 2002 \nas required by the congressional budget resolution, what happens next?\n  Under current law, the answer is: nothing. There is no requirement \nthat Congress begin to attack the debt problem. This bill would change \nthat. The American people would be allowed to tell us exactly how much \ndebt reduction they believe is necessary and Congress would be required \nto act. That is the way our system of government is supposed to work.\n  Mr. President, the Taxpayer Debt Buy-Down Act was endorsed by then-\nPresident Bush at the 1992 Republican Convention. The House companion \nlegislation, H.R. 429, is sponsored by Congressman Bob Walker, and \npassed the House earlier this year as part of the Contract With \nAmerica.\n  The legislation is supported by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business [NFIB], Americans for a Balanced Budget, Americans \nfor Tax Reform, The American Legislative Exchange Council [ALEC], The \nCouncil for Citizens Against Government Waste, Association of Concerned \nTaxpayers for a Fair and Simple Tax, the Institute for the Research on \nthe Economics of Taxation [IRET], the National Taxpayers Union [NTU], \nand the U.S. Business and Industrial Council.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Taxpayer Debt Buy-Down Act. It is \nan innovative proposal that makes ``We the People'' an integral part of \nthe Federal budget process.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1109. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey the \nCollbran reclamation project, Colorado, to the Ute Water Conservancy \nDistrict and the Collbran Conservancy District, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the collbran reclamation project legislation\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleague \nfrom Colorado, Senator Brown, in introducing legislation to transfer \nthe Collbran project from the Federal Government to its real owners--\nthe people who have paid for and own the water produced by this \nproject.\n  This legislation will complete the repayment to the American people \nthe amounts owed by the users of this project. Because this legislation \ninvolves a substantial payment from the Collbran and Ute Water \nConservancy Districts to the Federal Treasury, this legislation helps \nus reduce the Federal deficit by a small, but important, amount.\n  Millions of people live, work, and play in Colorado and the other \nWestern States. People are drawn to the rural areas of the West because \nthese communities offer an attractive mix of economic opportunity and \naccess to world-class natural resources. This high quality of life \nwould not exist if it were not for the water and power provided from \nFederal reclamation projects constructed under the 1902 Reclamation \nAct.\n  The original vision of the Reclamation Act was that Congress would \nfacilitate the construction of locally sponsored and locally \ncontrolled projects. Congress achieved this result by providing \nfinancing for these projects, subject to the requirement that a local \nentity repay the Federal investment in the irrigation portion of the \nproject, and that power users in the West repay the remaining costs of \nthe project.\n  Congress explicitly stated the water rights for reclamation projects \nwere to be obtained in accordance with State law, and Federal courts \nhave consistently ruled that the real owners of the water from \nreclamation projects are the people who put the water to beneficial \nuse. The important point is that Federal ownership of these projects \nwas always for the purpose of ensuring that the Federal investment was \nrepaid; the Federal partnership in reclamation of the west was never \nintended to perpetuate Federal control over the use of land and water \nat the local level.\n  Water from reclamation projects allowed the development of irrigated \nagriculture, which provides an important complement to other industries \nsuch as mining, recreation, and tourism. Power from reclamation \nprojects was and is an important part of extending the benefits of \nelectricity beyond cities to people in the country. In short, the \nReclamation Act has achieved its primary goal--the development of \nhealthy and stable communities throughout the West.\n  While there is a continuing obligation to honor previous Federal \ncommitments to complete reclamation projects, it is now time to \nreassess the Federal involvement in those projects which have been \ncompleted. In particular, the Federal Government should not be spending \nscarce resources on the operation and maintenance of projects when the \nproject beneficiaries have or will repay all of their financial \nobligations to the United States. In these cases, the Federal \nGovernment should transfer the project to the local beneficiaries, \nsubject to the requirement that the project continue to be operated for \nthe purposes for which it was authorized.\n  The Collbran project meets these criteria. The project was authorized \nin 1952 for agricultural and municipal purposes, and included a power \ncomponent. The project provides an important water supply for irrigated \nlands in the Collbran Conservancy District. In addition, the water \nreleased from the project provides an important domestic water supply \nfor over 55,000 people in the Grand Valley served by the Ute Water \nConservancy District. This legislation requires the districts to pay \nthe net present value of the revenues which the United States would \notherwise receive from the project, plus a premium of $2,000,000 and a \nsignificant contribution to promote additional protection for the \nColorado River ecosystem.\n  The Federal goals of the project have been attained. It is now \nappropriate to transfer the project to the districts, with the United \nStates retaining only its commitment to the State of Colorado on \nrecreational facilities. This legislation not only establishes a good \nprecedent for transfer of projects to reduce the Federal debt, but also \nfulfills the original vision of the 1902 Reclamation Act by ensuring \nthat the project will continue to be used to benefit the people and \ncommunities for whom it was built.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1110.

Mr. President, I introduce the National Heritage \nAct of 1995.\n  Today, most of my colleagues are aware that the opportunity to \ncreate \n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\nnew park units is most difficult in light of the current condition of \nthe National Park System. The Park Service, facing a 37-year backlog in \nconstruction funding, a 25-year backlog for land acquisition, and a \nshortfall of over $846 million for park operation and management, is \nclearly in trouble.\n  However, these difficulties are compounded by the growing popularity \nin Congress to recognize and designate important areas of our country \nfor inclusion in the National Park System. Over the last 10 years \nalone, Congress has designated over 30 new units of the Park System. \nThese new additions, while meritorious, have added significantly to \nthis huge backlog of funding facing the agency.\n  It is well known that when you create a new unit, limited fiscal and \nhuman resources must be taken away from existing park units. Unfunded \nand poorly managed parks will only contribute to the continued erosion \nof the existing Park System. As a result, it can be fairly stated that \nin our current system new additions can actually hinder rather than \nenhance the Park Service System.\n  I am aware of approximately 110 areas, some of which have already \nbeen introduced in Congress, that may be suitable for inclusion into \nthe Park System as heritage areas. I know of eight areas in my own \nState of Colorado, that may deserve recognition. However, under the \ncurrent system, the National Park Service may not be able to afford any \nnew area, no matter how deserved it may be.\n  Thus, the question of how to lighten this overwhelming load on the \nPark Service, while maintaining Congress' ability to recognize and\n protect precious areas of our country's heritage is before us.\n\n  I believe that my legislation will provide the solutions to this \nproblem. National heritage areas can be created and established as an \nalternative to the traditional National Park Service designation. This \ncan be accomplished in a very cost effective and efficient method, \nwithout creating unnecessary Federal management and expense to the \ntaxpayer.\n  My bill, when enacted, will encourage appropriate partnerships among \nFederal agencies, State, and local governments, nonprofit \norganizations, and the private sector, or combinations thereof, to \nconserve and manage these important resources.\n  This bill will authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \ntechnical assistance and limited grants to State and local governments \nand private nonprofit organizations, to study and promote the potential \nfor conserving, maintaining, and interpreting these areas for the \nbenefit of all Americans--now and in the future.\n  In addition, this legislation would direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to set the standards by which areas may be eligible and \ndesignated as national heritage areas.\n  Mr. President, most important, this legislation, when enacted, will \nempower individuals, groups, and organizations to be true partners with \nthe Federal Government. By giving the groups the decisionmaking \nauthority, as well as a share of the fiscal responsibility, they will \nbe able to maintain local control and ultimate oversight of the very \nareas they work so hard to save. Who better to manage our natural and \ncultural heritage, than those who are already going above and beyond \ntheir duties as Americans to preserve, restore, and protect these \nwonderful areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of the legislation be printed in the Record for the benefit of \nmy colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the section-by-section analysis was ordered \nto be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n       Section-by-Section Analysis--National Heritage Act of 1995\n\n       Section 1 entitles the Act the ``National Heritage Act of \n     1995''.\n       Section 2 sets forth Congressional findings.\n       Section 3 states the purposes of the Act.\n       Section 4 defines terms used in the Act.\n       Section 5(a) establishes a National Heritage Areas \n     Partnership Program within the Department of the Interior to \n     promote nationally distinctive natural, historic, scenic, and \n     cultural resources and to provide opportunities for \n     conservation, education, and recreation through recognition \n     of and assistance to areas containing such resources.\n       Subsection (b) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior \n     (the ``Secretary'' as used in this Act) (1) to evaluate areas \n     nominated under this Act for designation as National Heritage \n     Areas according to criteria established in subsection (c) \n     below, (2) to advise State and local governments and other \n     entities regarding suitable methods of recognizing and \n     conserving thematically and geographically linked natural, \n     historic, and cultural resources and recreational \n     opportunities, and (3) to make grants to units of government \n     and nonprofit organizations to prepare feasibility studies, \n     compacts, and management plans.\n       Subsection (c) lists the eligibility criteria for \n     designation as a National Heritage Area.\n       Subparagraph (1) states that the area shall be an \n     assemblage of natural, historic, cultural, or recreational \n     resources that represent distinctive aspects of American \n     heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation, \n     and continuing use and that such resources are best managed \n     as such an assemblage, through partnerships among public and \n     private entities.\n       Subparagraph (2) states that the area shall reflect \n     traditions, customs, beliefs, or folklife, or some \n     combination thereof, that are a valuable part of the story of \n     the Nation.\n       Subparagraph (3) states that the area shall provide \n     outstanding opportunities to conserve natural, cultural, \n     historic, or recreational features, or some combination \n     thereof.\n       Subparagraph (4) states that the area shall provide \n     outstanding recreational and educational opportunities.\n       Subparagraph (5) states that the area shall have an \n     identifiable theme or themes, and resource important to the \n     theme(s) shall retain integrity that will support \n     interpretation.\n       Subparagraph (6) states that residents, nonprofit \n     organizations, other entities, and governments within the \n     proposed area shall demonstrate support for designation of \n     the area and appropriate management of the area.\n       Subparagraph (7) requires that the principal organization \n     and units of government supporting the designation be willing \n     to enter into partnership agreements to implement the compact \n     for the area.\n       Subparagraph (8) requires the compact to be consistent with \n     continued economic viability in the affected communities.\n       Subparagraph (9) requires the consent of local governments \n     and notification of the Secretary for inclusion of private \n     property within the boundaries of the area.\n       Subsection (d) states that designation of an area may only \n     be made by an Act of Congress, and requires that certain \n     conditions be met prior to designation. An entity requesting \n     designation must submit a feasibility study and compact, and \n     a statement of support from the governor of each state in \n     which the proposed area lies. The Secretary must approve the \n     compact\n      and submit it and the feasibility study to Congress, along \n     with the Secretary's recommendation.\n       Section 6 describes the feasibility studies, compacts, and \n     management plans.\n       Subsection (a)(1) requires that each feasibility study be \n     prepared with public involvement and include a description of \n     resources and an assessment of their quality, integrity, and \n     public accessibility, the themes represented by such \n     resources, an assessment of impacts on potential partners, \n     units of government and others, boundary description, and \n     identification of a possible management entity for the area \n     if designated.\n       Subparagraph (2) requires that compacts include a \n     delineation of boundaries for the area, goals and objectives \n     for the area, identification of the management entity, a list \n     of initial partners in developing and implementing a plan for \n     the area and statement of each entity's financial commitment \n     and a description of the role of the State(s) in which the \n     proposed National Heritage Area is located. This subsection \n     requires public participation in development of the compact \n     and a reasonable time table for actions noted in such \n     compact.\n       Subparagraph (3) describes the plan for a proposed area. \n     Such plan must take into consideration existing Federal, \n     State, county, and local plans and include public \n     participation. The plan shall specify existing and potential \n     funding sources for the conservation, management, and \n     development of the area. The plan will also include a \n     resource inventory, policy recommendations for managing \n     resources within the area, an implementation program for the \n     plan by the management entity specified in the compact, an \n     analysis of Federal, State, and local program coordination, \n     and an interpretive plan for the National Heritage Area.\n       Subsection (b) requires the Secretary to approve or \n     disapprove a compact within 90 days of receipt and directs \n     the Secretary to provide written justification for \n     disapproval of a compact to the submitter.\n       Section 7(a) outlines the duties of the management entity \n     for a National Heritage Area. Duties include development of a \n     heritage plan to be submitted to the Secretary within three \n     years of designation. This section directs the management \n     entity to give priority to implementation of actions, goals, \n     and policies set forth in the compact and management plan for \n     the area. The management entity is directed to consider the \n     interests of diverse units of government, businesses, private \n     property owners, and nonprofit groups in the geographic area \n     in developing and implementing the plan, and requires \n     quarterly public meetings regarding plan implementation. \n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\n       Section (b) states that eligibility for technical \n     assistance is suspended if a plan regarding a National \n     Heritage Area is not submitted in accordance with the above \n     provisions.\n       Subsection (c) prohibits the management entity for a \n     National Heritage Area from using federal funding to acquire \n     real property or interest in real property.\n       Subsection (d) states that a management entity is eligible \n     to receive technical assistance funding for 7 years following \n     area designation.\n       Section 8(a) states that National Heritage Area designation \n     continues indefinitely unless the Secretary determines that \n     the area no longer meets the criteria in section 5(c), the \n     parties to the compact are not in compliance with the terms \n     of the compact, the management entity has not made reasonable \n     and appropriate progress in developing or implementing the \n     management plan, or the use, condition, or development of the \n     area is incompatible with the criteria in section 5(c) or \n     with the compact. If such determination is made, the \n     Secretary is directed to notify Congress with a \n     recommendation for designation withdrawal.\n       Subsection (b) requires the Secretary to hold a public \n     hearing within the area before recommending designation \n     withdrawal.\n       Subsection (c) states that withdrawal of National Heritage \n     Area designation shall become final 90 legislative days after \n     the Secretary submits notification to Congress.\n       Section 9(a) outlines the duties and authorities of the \n     Secretary. The Secretary may provide technical assistance and \n     grants to units of government and private nonprofit \n     organizations for feasibility studies, compacts and \n     management plan development and implementation. The Secretary \n     is prohibited from requiring recipients, as a condition of \n     awarding technical assistance, to enact or modify land use \n     restrictions. This subsection directs the Secretary to \n     investigate, study, and monitor the welfare of all National \n     Heritage Areas whose eligibility for technical assistance \n     under this Act has expired and directs the Secretary to \n     report on the condition of such areas to Congress.\n       Subsection (b) states that other Federal entities \n     conducting activities directly affecting any National \n     Heritage Area shall consider the potential effects of such \n     activities on the plan for the area and requires consultation \n     with the State containing the area.\n       Section 10 states that this Act does not affect any \n     authority of Federal, State, or local governments to regulate \n     land use, nor does this Act grant zoning or land use powers \n     to any management entity for a National Heritage Area.\n       Section 11 is a fishing and hunting savings clause.\n       Section 12 authorizes an appropriation of not more than \n     $8,000,000 annually for technical assistance and grants as \n     outlined in section 9(a), and states that technical \n     assistance and grants under this Act for a feasibility study, \n     compact, or management plan may not exceed 75 percent of the \n     cost for such study, compact, or plan. This section also \n     places a total funding limit of $1,000,000 for each National \n     Heritage Area, with an annual limit of $150,000 for a \n     National Heritage Area for a fiscal year.\n       Section 13 states that the authorities contained in this \n     Act shall expire on September 30 of the 15th fiscal year \n     beginning after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       Section 14 requires the Secretary to submit a report of the \n     status of the National Heritage Areas Program to Congress \n     every 5 years.\n       Section 15 is a savings clause, preserving existing \n     authorities contained in any law that designates an \n     individual National Heritage Area or Corridor prior to \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1111. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, with respect \nto patents on biotechnological processes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n            THE BIOTECHNOLOGY PATENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr HATCH. Mr. President, today, I rise with Senator Kennedy to \nintroduce the Biotechnology Patent Protection Act of 1995, S. 1111. \nThis bill is similar to legislation which passed the Senate last year, \nand is identical to a measure reported by the House Judiciary Committee \non June 7.\n  It is abundantly clear that the current patent law is not adequate to \nprotect our creative American inventors who are on the cutting edge of \nscientific experimentation. Through biotechnological research, for \nexample, scientists are using recombinant processes to mass-produce \nproteins that are useful as human therapeutics.\n  The potential for unfair foreign competition, however, threatens the \ncapital base of the biotechnology research industry. Clearly, without a \nprotected end product that can be sold or marketed, there is little \nincentive to invest millions of dollars in biotechnology research.\n  The Hatch-Kennedy legislation extends patent protection in \nbiotechnology cases to the process if there is a patentable starting \nproduct, offering the biotechnology research industry valuable and \nneeded protection.\n  Specifically, the Biotechnology Patent Protection Act modifies the \ntest for obtaining a process patent by clarifying In Re Durden, 763 F. \n2d 1406 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\n  In Durden, the Federal circuit held that the use of a novel and \nnonobvious starting material with a known chemical process, producing a \nnew and nonobvious product, does not render the process itself \npatentable. The erroneous application of Durden, a nonbiotechnology \nprocess patent case, to biotechnology process patent cases has led to \ndevastating results for the biotechnology industry.\n  Under the current Patent Code, an inventor may hold a patent and \nstill be unable to bar the importation of a product made abroad with \nthe use of the patented material, if the inventor has been unable to \nobtain patent protection for the process of using such material.\n  The biotechnology field is particularly vulnerable to abuse under\n   Unfortunately, the naturally occurring human protein was extremely \ndifficult to obtain or produce.\n\n  Amgen scientists, using recombinant DNA technology and molecular \nbiology, were able to produce an erythropoietin product, for the first \ntime ever. Amgen was able to obtain a patent for the gene encoding and \nfor the host cell, but not for the process of making the product, or \nfor the final product.\n  With knowledge of Amgen's development, Chugai, a Japanese company, \nbegan manufacturing a similar protein in Japan using the patented \nrecombinant host cell. Since the process of placing genes in host cells \nis prior art, thus unpatentable, and the end product is a previously \nknown human protein, thus unpatentable, Amgen was without any recourse \nunder our patent law when Chugai imported the erythropoietin product.\n  The proposed legislation would extend patent protection to the \nprocess of making new and nonobvious products. Thus, if a process makes \nor uses a patentable material, the process, too, will be patentable. \nThe fact that the steps in the process, or most of the materials in the \nprocess are otherwise known in the art should not make a difference. \nObviousness should be determined with regard to the subject matter as a \nwhole, as the current Patent Code suggests.\n  S. 1111 will also make our patent law consistent, at least in the \nfield of biotechnology, with the patent examination standards now \npracticed by the European and Japanese patent offices. American \ntechnology and research has been exploited by the legal loophole that \ncan no longer be tolerated.\n  This bill is identical in substance to last year's Senate \nlegislation, with one exception. This year's bill changes the \ndefinition of ``biotechnological process'' to include the wide range of \ntechnologies currently used by the biotechnology industry. New \nsubparagraph 102(b)(3)(A) has been rewritten to cover the enhanced \nexpression of a gene product--via the addition of promoter genes--and \ngene deletion and inhibition.\n  We were very disappointed when the Senate bill, which passed last \nyear, died in the House Judiciary Committee. The House version of the \nbill introduced last year was drafted to address issues broader than \nbiotechnology industry, due to then Chairman Hughes' insistence that \nthe measure not be industry specific, an approach which was not \nacceptable to the Senate.\n  This Congress, Carlos Moorhead, chairman of the Courts and \nIntellectual Property Subcommittee, has shown great leadership in \nsponsoring the narrower version, which was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee June 7. The bill we introduce today is identical to the \nHouse-reported measure.\n  Mr. President, the Hatch-Kennedy biotechnology process patent bill \nwill restore fairness to inventors, promote and protect investment in \nbiotechnology research, and eliminate the foreign piracy of our \nintellectual property. We commend this measure to our colleagues' \nattention.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1113. A bill to reduce gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk \npurchases of \n\n[[Page S11208]]\nhand guns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      the anti-gun trafficking act\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today Senator Simon and I are \nintroducing legislation, the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act, to reduce \ninterstate gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk purchases of handguns. \nThe bill generally would prohibit the purchase of more than one handgun \nduring any 30-day period.\n  Mr. President, the United States is suffering from an epidemic of gun \nviolence. Tens of thousands of Americans die every year because of \nguns, and no communities are safe. Reducing the violence must be a top \nnational priority,\n  Mr. President, my State of New Jersey has adopted strict controls on \nguns. We have banned assault weapons, and we have established strict \npermitting requirements for handgun purchases. Yet the effectiveness of \nthese restrictions is substantially reduced because the controls in \nother States are far less strict.\n  Unfortunately, many criminals are making bulk purchases of handguns \nin States with weak firearm laws and transporting them to other States \nwith tougher laws, like New Jersey. This has helped spread the plague \nof gun violence nationwide, and there is little that any one State can \ndo about it.\n  A few years ago, the State of Virginia enacted legislation that was \ndesigned to prevent gunrunners from buying large quantities of handguns \nin Virginia for export to other States.\n Under the legislation, handgun purchases were limited to one per \nmonth.\n\n  The Virginia statute has proved very effective in controlling gun \ntrafficking from Virginia. A study by the Center to Prevent Handgun \nViolence found that for guns purchased after the law's effective date, \nthere was a 65-percent reduction in the likelihood that a gun traced \nback to the Southeast from the Northeast corridor would have originated \nin Virginia.\n  Mr. President, Virginia's experience suggests that a ban on bulk \npurchases can substantially reduce gunrunning. However, to truly be \neffective, such a limit must be enacted nationwide. Otherwise, \ngunrunners simply will move their operations to other States.\n  The legislation I am introducing today proposes such a nationwide \nlimit.\n  Under the legislation, an individual other than a licensed firearms \ndealer generally would be prohibited from purchasing more than one \nhandgun in any 30-day period. Similarly, the bill would make it \nunlawful for any dealer, importer, or manufacturer to transfer a \nhandgun to any individual who has received a handgun within the last 30 \ndays. Violators would be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and a prison \nsentence of up to 1 year.\n  The legislation would provide an exception in the rare case where a \nsecond handgun purchase is necessary because of a threat to the life of \nthe individual or of any member of the individual's household.\n  Mr. President, I do not claim that this bill will end all handgun \nviolence. However, it is a reasonable and modest step in the right \ndirection. I also would note that President Clinton has endorsed the \nadoption of a once-a-month handgun purchase limit.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record along with other related materials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

But what it should do--and can do--is more \n     important. As the supporters were saying all along, the \n     gunrunners up and down the East Coast won't have it so easy \n     anymore. It was the state's reputation as the favorite stop-\n     and-shop outlet for concealable weapons along the Atlantic \n     Seaboard that propelled such strong bipartisan votes in \n     Richmond. And it is those votes that should now signal \n     Congress that a federal copy of the Virginia law would be \n     politically possible and immensely popular.\n       For sure, the NRA will be all over Capitol Hill, warning \n     that one handgun a month is just a cover for total \n     disarmament of every peace-loving, government-fearing \n     individual. That's what the lobbyists said in Richmond, but \n     Republicans and Democrats--gun owners as well as those who \n     wouldn't touch a firearm--didn't buy it. The lawmakers heard \n     their constituents calling for reasonable ways to curb \n     traffic in weapons that most people don't stockpile. They \n     read polls showing intense public concern about the ease with \n     which guns could be bought and resold in huge quantities for \n     evil purposes. The legislators also learned that they could \n     infuriate the NRA leaders, enact this measure and survive \n     politically--with strong support from every major law \n     enforcement organization in the country.\n       Now Virginia's delegation in Congress should spread the \n     word that a federal version of this law would curb the \n     trafficking of handguns that crosses state lines from coast \n     to coast. With this reasonable purchase limit--and with \n     passage of the Brady bill to establish a workable waiting \n     period--America, like Virginia, might begin to shake its \n     reputation as a global arsenal for criminals. The climate is \n     right.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 4, 1993]\n\n                           One Gun Per Month\n\n       Effective gun control requires national laws because so \n     many firearms used in urban crime are smuggled across state \n     lines. The latest proposal growing out of concern over gun \n     trafficking in Virginia is simple and potentially powerful: \n     Limit purchases of handguns by an individual to one per \n     month.\n       Virginia's Governor, Douglas Wilder, has been pushing a \n     one-gun-per-month bill for his state because it has become a \n     source for illegal gun smuggling on the East Coast. Dealers \n     from New York City, where local laws sharply restrict access \n     to guns, drive to Virginia and fill the trunks of their cars \n     with weapons purchased in stores with the help of local \n     residents. Then they haul the guns back to New York and sell \n     them illegally on the street at huge markups.\n       Since it wouldn't pay to travel back and forth for one gun \n     at a time, limiting purchases to one per month could quickly \n     put the smugglers out of business in Virginia.\n       But why put them out of business only there? Closing down \n     the pipeline from Virginia will most likely result only in \n     new ones opening elsewhere. After South Carolina enacted such \n     a law in 1975, it ceased to be a crime gun supermarket. \n     Smugglers apparently shifted much of their business to \n     Virginia and Florida.\n       A Federal law imposing the limit for all states would shut \n     down all the potential pipelines at once. Representative \n     Robert Torricelli of New Jersey has introduced a bill to do \n     just that. Like the Virginia law, it imposes a one-gun-per-\n     month limit with provisions for those few cases of people who \n     lose a recently purchased gun and have urgent need to buy \n     another.\n       The gun lobby is already screaming about intolerable \n     trespass on individual and commercial freedom. Yet South \n     Carolina's law had no detrimental effects; it simply limited \n     interstate trafficking that had gotten out of hand.\n       Even the most avid collector isn't likely to want--or be \n     able to afford--more than 12 handguns a year. Legitimate gun \n     dealers don't base their success on multiple sales to \n     individuals.\n       Some supporters of gun control worry that the Torricelli \n     bill could distract from the Brady bill, which would impose a \n     national five-day waiting period between purchase and \n     delivery of a handgun. That bill remains important to reduce \n     both interstate trafficking and crime in general.\n       But with gun crime out of control, why should the nation \n     have to choose? Both measures merit early attention in \n     Congress and the support of all Americans who favor a common-\n     sense approach to public safety.\n                                                                    ____\n\n        Evaluating the Impact of Virginia's One-Gun-a-Month Law\n\n(By Douglas S. Weil, Sc.D., and Rebecca Knox, M.P.H., M.S.W., Center to \n                       Prevent Handgun Violence)\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       In response to a growing reputation as a principal supplier \n     of firearms to the illegal market--particularly in the \n     Northeastern United States--Virginia enacted a law (which was \n     implemented July 1993) restricting handgun purchases to one \n     per month per individual. The purpose of this study was to \n     determine whether limiting handgun purchases to one per month \n     is an effective way to disrupt the illegal movement of \n     firearms across state lines.\n\n                               Hypothesis\n\n       The hypothesis tested was that the odds of tracing a gun, \n     originally acquired in the Southeast region of the United \n     States, to a Virginia gun dealer, if it was recovered in a \n     criminal investigation outside of the region, would be \n     substantially lower for guns purchased after Virginia's one-\n     gun-a-month law took effect, than for guns purchased prior to \n     implementation of the law.\n\n                                Methods\n\n       The principal analytic method used in this analysis was to \n     estimate the odds ratio for tracing a firearm to a gun dealer \n     in Virginia relative to a gun dealer in the other \n     Southeastern states (as defined by the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms (BATF)), for guns purchased prior to \n     Virginia's one-gun-a-month law's effective date compared to \n     guns purchased after the law was enacted. The data, including \n     information about 17,082 guns traced to the Southeast, come \n     from the firearms trace database compiled by the BATF.\n\n                                Results\n\n       The hypothesis was substantiated by the data. The odds of \n     tracing a gun, originally acquired in the Southeast region, \n     to a Virginia gun dealer, and not to a gun dealer in another \n     Southeastern state, were substantially lower for firearms \n     purchased after Virginia's one-gun-a-month law took effect, \n     than for firearms purchased prior to implementation of the \n     law.\n       Specifically, for guns recovered: Anywhere in the United \n     States (including Virginia), the odds were reduced by 36%; in \n     the Northeast Corridor (NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA), the odds were \n     reduced by 66%; in New York, the odds were reduced by 71%; in \n     New Jersey, the odds were reduced by 57%; and in \n     Massachusetts, the odds were reduced by 72%.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Most gun control policies currently advocated in the United \n     States (e.g., licensing, registration and one-gun-a-month) \n     could be described as efforts to limit the supply of guns \n     available in the illegal market. This study provides \n     persuasive evidence that restricting handgun purchases to one \n     per month per individual is an effective means of disrupting \n     the illegal interstate transfer of firearms. Based on the \n     results of this study, Congress should consider enacting a \n     federal version of the Virginia law.\n                              introduction\n\n       In July 1993, a Virginia law limiting handgun purchases by \n     an individual to one gun in a thirty day period took \n     effect.\\1\\ Prior to the one-gun-a-month law, individuals were \n     able to purchase an unlimited number of handguns from \n     licensed dealers.\n     Footnotes at end of study.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The law was passed in response to Virginia's growing \n     reputation as a principal supplier of guns to the illegal \n     market in the Northeastern United States.\\2\\ Statistics from \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) provided \n     evidence of the magnitude of gun trafficking from Virginia. \n     The BATF reported that 41% of a sample of guns seized in New \n     York City in 1991 were traced to Virginia gun dealers.\\3\\ \n     Virginia has long been a primary out-of-state source of \n     recovered crime guns traced in Washington, D.C.\\4\\ and \n     Boston.\\5\\\n       Virginia is not the only out-of-state source of firearms \n     illegally trafficked along the Eastern Seaboard. In fact, the \n     BATF has identified the illegal movement of firearms from \n     states in the Southeast northward to states along Interstate \n     95 (sometimes referred to as the ``Iron Pipeline''\\6\\), as \n     one of three principal gun trafficking routes in the \n     country.\\7\\ The same BATF report that identified Virginia as \n     the principal out-of-state source of guns used in crime in \n     New York City noted that a high percentage of recovered guns \n     also came from Florida and Georgia. Together, the three \n     states accounted for 65% of all successfully traced firearms \n     in New York City. Investigators also found that 25% \n     successfully traced firearms recovered in Baltimore were \n     originally purchased in the Southeastern United States.\\8\\\n       Interstate gun trafficking occurs, in part, because of the \n     disparity in state laws governing gun sales. As a result, the \n     ``street price'' of firearms in localities with restrictive \n     gun laws is significantly greater than the retail price for \n     the same guns purchased in states where laws are less \n     stringent. For example, low quality, easily concealable guns \n     like the Raven Arms MP-25, the Davis P-38 and the Bryco Arms \n     J-22 which retail less than $100 can net street prices \n     between $300 and $600.\\9\\ The ability to buy many guns at a \n     retail price to be sold elsewhere at a higher street price \n     suggests that the purchase of multiple firearms in a single \n     transaction is an integral part of the profit motive which \n     supports the illegal market.\n       The objective behind Virginia's passage of the one-gun-a-\n     month law was to undermine \n\n[[Page S11210]]\n     the economic incentive created by the disparities in gun laws among the \n     states--an objective supported by historical evidence. In \n     1975, South Carolina limited purchases of firearms to one gun \n     in a thirty day period. Prior to enactment of the law, South \n     Carolina was a primary out-of-state source of guns used in \n     crime in New York City. After the passage of the law, South \n     Carolina was no longer a primary source of guns for New York \n     City.\\10\\\n\n\n                          purpose of the study\n\n       The objective of this study was to assess the effect of \n     Virginia's one-gun-a-month law on gun trafficking patterns, \n     particularly along the ``Iron Pipeline.''\n\n\n                                  data\n\n       The data\\11\\ used in the analysis come from the firearms \n     trace database compiled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms (BATF). Law enforcement agencies can request that \n     the BATF trace a gun which has been recovered in connection \n     with a criminal investigation. BATF staff at the National \n     Tracing Center (NTC) contact the manufacturer of the firearm \n     to identify which wholesaler or retail dealer received the \n     gun. NTC staff then contact each consecutive dealer who \n     acquired the firearm until the gun is either traced to the \n     most recent owner or, until the gun can be traced no further. \n     There is no requirement that records of gun transfer be \n     maintained by non-gun dealers who sell a firearm. \n     Consequently, the tracing process often ends with the first \n     retail sale of the gun.\n       As part of the tracing process, information is collected on \n     several variables including the location of the gun dealer or \n     dealers who have handled the gun (by state and region); when \n     the gun was purchased; when and where the trace was \n     initiated; and, the manufacturer, model and caliber of the \n     firearm being traced.\n       The firearms trace database contained in excess of a half \n     million records pertaining to approximately 295,000 firearms \n     (9/89 through 3/95). The database contains more records than \n     firearms because two or more traces can be of the same gun, \n     as part of the same criminal investigation. Multiple traces \n     of a particular gun is an indication that the weapon was \n     transferred from federally licensed firearms dealer to \n     another dealer before it was sold to a non-licensed \n     individual. Since 1990, the number of traces conducted each \n     year has more than doubled to approximately 85,000 in 1994.\n\n\n                                methods\n\n       The principal analytic method used in the study was to \n     estimate the odds ratio for tracing a firearm to a gun dealer \n     in Virginia relative to a dealer in the other Southeastern \n     states (as defined by the BATF), for guns purchased prior to \n     Virginia's one-gun-a-month law's effect date compared to guns \n     purchased after the law was enacted.\n       In other words, the data were classified by two criteria: \n     (1) where the gun was purchased (from a gun dealer in \n     Virginia or from a dealer in another state in the Southeast \n     region of the country), and (2) when a traced firearm was \n     purchased (before or after implementation of the Virginia \n     law). The odds ratio was calculated by comparing the odds of \n     a gun being traced to a gun dealer\n      in the state of Virginia relative to a dealer in another \n     part of this region, for guns purchased prior to the law's \n     implementation and for guns purchased after the law took \n     effect.\n       The Southeast region was identified as the comparison group \n     for Virginia because the region has long been identified as a \n     principal source of out-of-state firearms for the Easter \n     Seaboard.\\7\\ In addition to Virginia, the Southeast region \n     includes North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, \n     Mississippi and Tennessee. Only guns traced to a dealer in \n     the Southeast region were incorporated into the analysis.\n       The BATF no longer traces firearms manufactured prior to \n     1985 without being specifically requested to do so. Results \n     are reported in this analysis only for guns purchased since \n     January 1985. However, a sensitivity analysis was conducted \n     incorporating data for all firearms for which date of \n     purchase information was available. The results of the \n     analysis were essentially unchanged by the sensitivity \n     analysis; the conclusions would not change.\n       The period studied for which there is data after \n     implementation of the law was 20 months long. Consequently, \n     the possibility that seasonal variation in gun trafficking \n     patterns could have effected the results of the analysis was \n     studied. A sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding guns \n     purchased more than one full year after the Virginia law took \n     effect. The results of the sensitivity analysis were not \n     significantly different from those of the principal analysis; \n     the conclusions would not change.\n       Date of purchase information was not available for all guns \n     in the firearms trace data set. The distribution of guns \n     traced to the Southeast region (to gun dealers in Virginia \n     relative to the rest of the region) is similar for the subset \n     of data for which date of purchase information was available \n     (24%), and the subset for which date of purchase information \n     was not available (21%).\n       The Virginia law pertains to acquisition of handguns by \n     individuals who are not federally licensed firearms dealers. \n     Therefore, the origin of a gun which had been transferred \n     from a dealer in one state to a dealer in a second state was \n     considered to be the last dealer's location. In other words, \n     if a firearm was transferred by a dealer in Georgia to a \n     dealer in Virginia, who then sold the gun to an individual \n     who was not a licensed dealer, the gun would be considered a \n     Virginia gun.\n       Odds ratios were estimated for traces initiated: (1) \n     anywhere in the United States; (2) the Northeast corridor \n     taken as whole (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode \n     Island and Massachusetts); and, (3) for each of the Northeast \n     states individually considered. For each iteration, the \n     hypothesis being tested remained the same, and was that: the \n     odds of a gun, purchased after enactment of Virginia's one-\n     gun-a-month law, being traced to a Virginia gun dealer \n     relative to a gun dealer in another part of the Southeast, \n     were significantly lower than for guns purchased prior to \n     enactment of the law.\n       A significant reduction in the odds would provide evidence \n     that the Virginia law effectively helped to reduce gun \n     trafficking from the state.\n\n\n                                results\n\n       The date a gun was purchased and the date the trace request \n     was made was available for 55,856 (19%) of the guns in the \n     database. Of these guns, 17,082 (30.6%) were traced to a \n     dealer located in the Southeast region. Approximately one in \n     four guns (24%) traced to the Southeast were traced to a \n     Virginia gun dealer.\n       Cross-tabulations indicate that there is an association \n     between when a firearm was acquired (before or after the \n     Virginia law went into effect) and where it was obtained \n     (either from a Virginia gun dealer or a gun dealer in another \n     state located in the Southeast). Twenty-sever percent of all \n     guns purchased prior to passage of the one-gun-a-month law \n     (including guns recovered in Virginia), which were traced to \n     a gun dealer in the Southeast, were acquired from a Virginia \n     gun dealer. Only 19% of guns purchased after the law went \n     into effect and similarly traced to a dealer in the Southeast \n     were acquired in Virginia. In other words, there was a 36% \n     reduction in the likelihood that a traced gun from anywhere \n     in the nation was acquired in Virginia relative to another \n     Southeastern state, for firearms purchased after the one-gun-\n     a-month law took effect compared to guns purchased prior to \n     enactment of the law (Odds Ratio=0.64; p\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11201-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11216-S11217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 309\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bennett, the names of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar], the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], \nthe Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], and the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Leahy] were added as cosponsors of S. 309, a bill to \nreform the concession policies of the National Park Service, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 593\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the names of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Shelby] and the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 593, a bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act to authorize the export of new drugs, and for other \npurposes.\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\n\n\n                                 S. 692\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the names of the Senator from Maine [Mr. \nCohen] and the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] were added as cosponsors \nof S. 692, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npreserve family-held forest lands, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Biden] was added as a cosponsor of S. 770, a bill to provide for \nthe relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 833\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield] was added as a cosponsor of S. 833, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to more accurately codify the depreciable \nlife of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 3\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the names of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] and the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 3, a concurrent resolution \nrelative to Taiwan and the United Nations.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 147\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thurmond, the names of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings], the Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun], \nthe Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], the Senator from Washington [Mr. \nGorton], and the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Resolution 147, a resolution designating the weeks \nbeginning September 24, 1995, and September 22, 1996, as ``National \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities Week,'' and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 149\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Kassebaum], the Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun], and \nthe Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] were added as cosponsors of \nSenate Resolution 149, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nregarding the recent announcement by the Republic of France that it \nintends to conduct a series of underground nuclear test explosions \ndespite the current international moratorium on nuclear testing.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11216-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11217-S11219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  KYL (AND INHOFE) AMENDMENT NO. 2077\n\n  Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (S. 1026) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 371, below line 21, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1062. SENSE OF SENATE ON PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES \n                   FROM BALLISTIC MISSILE ATTACK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles presents a threat to the entire World.\n       (2) This threat was recognized by Secretary of Defense \n     William J. Perry in February 1995 in the Annual Report to the \n     President and the Congress which states that ``[b]eyond the \n     five declared nuclear weapons states, at least 20 other \n     nations have acquired or are attempting to acquire weapons of \n     mass destruction--nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons--\n     and the means to deliver them. In fact, in most areas where \n     United States forces could potentially be engaged on a large \n     scale, many of the most likely adversaries already possess \n     chemical and biological weapons. Moreover, some of these same \n     states appear determined to acquire nuclear weapons.''.\n       (3) At a summit in Moscow in May 1995, President Clinton \n     and President Yeltsin commented on this threat in a Joint \n     Statement which recognizes ``.  .  . the threat posed by \n     worldwide proliferation of missiles and missile technology \n     and the necessity of counteracting this threat .  .  . ''.\n       (4) At least 25 countries may be developing weapons of mass \n     destruction and the delivery systems for such weapons.\n       (5) At least 24 countries have chemical weapons programs in \n     various stages of research and development.\n       (6) Approximately 10 countries are believed to have \n     biological weapons programs in various stages of development.\n       (7) At least 10 countries are reportedly interested in the \n     development of nuclear weapons.\n       (8) Several countries recognize that weapons of mass \n     destruction and missiles increase their ability to deter, \n     coerce, or otherwise threaten the United States. Saddam \n     Hussein recognized this when he stated, on May 8, 1990, that \n     ``[o]ur missiles cannot reach Washington. If they could reach \n     Washington, we would strike it if the need arose.''.\n       (9) International regimes like the Non-Pro-liferation \n     Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, while effective, cannot by \n     themselves halt the spread of weapons and technology. On \n     January 10, 1995, Director of Central Intelligence, James \n     Woolsey, said with regard to Russia that ``.  .  . we are \n     particularly concerned with the safety of nuclear, chemical, \n     and biological materials as well as highly enriched uranium \n     or plutonium, although I want to stress that this is global \n     problem. For example, highly enriched uranium was recently \n     stolen from South Africa, and last month Czech authorities \n     recovered three kilograms of 87.8 percent-enriched HEU in the \n     Czech Republic--the largest seizure of near-weapons grade \n     material to date outside the Former Soviet Union.''.\n       (10) The possession of weapons of mass destruction and \n     missiles by developing countries threatens our friends, \n     allies, and forces abroad and will ultimately threaten the \n     United States directly. On August 11, 1994, Deputy Secretary \n     of Defense John Deutch said that ``[i]f the North Koreans \n     field the Taepo Dong 2 missile, Guam, Alaska, and parts of \n     Hawaii would potentially be at risk.''.\n       (11) The end of Cold War has changed the strategic \n     environmental facing and between the United States and \n     Russia. That the Clinton Administration believes the \n     environment to have changed was made clear by Secretary of \n     Defense William J. Perry on September 20, 1994, when he \n     stated that ``[w]e now have the opportunity to create a new \n     relationship, based not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured \n     Destruction, but rather on another acronym, MAS, or Mutural \n     Assured Safety.''.\n       (12) The United States and Russia have the opportunity to \n     create a relationship based on trust rather than fear.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     all Americans should be protected from accidental, \n     intentional, or limited ballstic missile attack.\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        NUNN AMENDMENT NO. 2078\n\n  Mr. NUNN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2077 proposed by Mr. \nKyl to the bill S. 1026, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 5, beginning with ``attack,'' strike out all down \n     through the end of the amendment and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following: ``attack.

Mr. President I call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an educational matter that requires continued attention. \nAmericans serving in the armed services who are stationed overseas \nusually depend on Department of Defense Dependents Schools to educate \ntheir children. It has been a matter of concern that these overseas \nschools do not provide the same level of educational services as \nschools on military installations in the United States. I ask to have \nprinted in the Record the executive summary of a recent study providing \nhard numbers substantiating this concern. I hope Senators will consider \nthe findings of this study as we draw down forces in Europe and as we \nprovide for an appropriate quality of life for members of our Armed \nForces stationed overseas.\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\n  The Executive summary follows:\n\n                       DoDDS--A Staffing Dilemma\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       The process of staffing the Department of Defense \n     Dependents Schools has reached a point where it needs to be \n     reviewed.\n       The schools are staffed in the classical, enrollment-based \n     manner which serves as a model for the larger school \n     districts. Applying this method to DoDDS, while giving a \n     favorable appearance on a system-wide basis, does not address \n     the demographics of DoDDS with its many small and medium-\n     sized schools located far apart and in isolated locations.\n       This briefing document describes and compares the \n     configuration of the schools in the United States and in \n     DoDDS-Europe. It shows how the sizes of the schools in the \n     United States vary in enrollment patterns from those in \n     DoDDS-E. A sampling of programs and services found in Section \n     6 schools is included. These schools are for military \n     dependents located on military installations in the United \n     States, and are supervised by the Department of Defense \n     Education Activity (DoDEA), the same Activity which \n     supervises DoDDS. The Section 6 schools provide a full range \n     of educational programs.\n       DoDDS, because of its staffing model is enrollment-ratio-\n     driven, will not be able to provide the same programs or \n     services to the students attending its schools as those \n     attending the Section 6 schools. This staffing model needs to \n     be altered to accommodate the unique character of DoDDS. \n     DoDDS must staff its schools in a manner guaranteed to \n     maintain its current level of excellence.\n       This paper recommends that a staffing freeze be put in \n     place, retaining the current staff, except for those \n     locations where the schools are closing or enrollment is \n     projected to drop sharply based upon next school year's \n     enrollment data. The retention of this level of staffing is \n     estimated to require 400 positions DoDDS-E wide. Since there \n     will be a cut in staffing, this means that 400 fewer \n     positions would be cut. At a work-year rate of $60,000 each, \n     this would amount to a dollar cost of $24,000,000.\n       For the staffing in the coming years, DoDDS has stated that \n     a Staffing Task Force has been established to develop new \n     staffing criteria. Until this Task Force reports its findings \n     and recommendations, all staffing actions should be frozen at \n     present levels, then modified using the guidance developed by \n     the Task Force. Assuming that this Task Force will develop a \n     staffing model based upon program needs, this action is \n     strongly recommended.\n       The educational services delivered by DoDDS are an integral \n     part of the Quality of Life Program as well as of Force \n     Readiness. It is essential that what needs to be done to \n     maintain the current high standard be done.\n       Until the end of the current school year, SY 94-95, the \n     Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) has provided \n     the educational services and programs of a premier school \n     system.\n       DoDDS has the potential and resources to be a truly world-\n     class school system--the standard bearer of the United States \n     in the arena of global education. As evidenced by the DoDDS \n     Strategic Plan promulgated by Dr. Lillian Gonzalez, Director \n     of DoDDS, DoDDS has made a determined commitment in this \n     direction. However, will the current proposed staffing \n     reductions allow DoDDS to reach this serious goal?\n       As part of its ``rightsizing'' goal, DoDDS-Europe is \n     eliminating over 900 positions. Most of these positions will \n     be at the school level. The core of DoDDS' staffing planning \n     is its concept of the ``super teacher,'' a concept based on \n     the belief that the classroom teachers can absorb program \n     cuts back into their basic classroom instruction. In other \n     words, DoDDS is relying on the ``super teacher'' to cover or \n     provide all the services and programs which have been \n     eliminated by the cuts in staffing. DoDDS teachers are \n     arguably a cut above their stateside counterparts, but to \n     demand that they fulfill these expectations on a regular \n     basis is unrealistic--the average teacher doesn't have the \n     skills to: maintain a full-scale modern computerized media \n     center (library); provide quality curricular offerings in \n     physical education, music, and art; conduct all remedial \n     assistance for students who would ordinarily be provided with \n     special help through Reading Improvement Specialists (RIS) \n     and Compensatory Education Specialists (Comp Ed); mainstream \n     and assist students in need of English as a Second Language \n     (ESL); be ready to apply first aid and administer medication \n     or diagnostic assistance for students with health needs \n     (school nurse); and, assess and administer help to students \n     who qualify for learning impairment assistance (Special \n     Education for the Learning Impaired, teachers--SPED) or for \n     school-wide enrichment (SWEP, a.k.a. TAG--talented and \n     gifted, teachers).\n       While most classroom teachers have some skill in these \n     areas, they are not specialists in these areas--to assume or \n     assert that they are simply will not create the skills. \n     Saying it doesn't make it so--no matter how often it is said.\n       Next year DoDDS schools will have fewer specialists, a \n     higher Pupil Teacher Ration (PTR), and fewer options for \n     students, if the cuts now proposed and currently being \n     implemented are allowed to stand. This briefing paper will \n     present statistics on the DoDDS Mediterranean (Med) district \n     and DoDDS-Europe (DoDDS-E) as a whole. We have the necessary \n     documentation on the schools in this district because the \n     Overseas Federation of Teachers is the exclusive bargaining \n     agent for the teachers in these schools. DoDDS Med District \n     represents approximately 1/6 of the enrollment of the odds-E \n     student enrollment. Our proposal, therefore, is based on \n     projecting our data on a 1:6 ratio, so that we can reach a \n     conclusion on what is needed for all of DoDDS-Europe\n       We point out that even though the Med district is unique in \n     geographic terms (most of the schools are located on islands \n     and peninsulas), it can still be used a ``bellwether'' for \n     the other schools and DoDDS-E Districts. As the drawdown in \n     northern Europe continues the school distributions in \n     England, the Benelux, and Germany are going to look more and \n     more like those in the Med District in terms of size and \n     isolation by geographic distance.\n       What programs do American schools commonly have now? To \n     obtain pertinent information, we looked at a random sampling \n     of three school systems servicing American military \n     dependents in the United States--the Section 6 Schools--which \n     are managed by the Department of Defense Education Activity \n     (DoDEA). DoDEA is also the supervisory activity of the DoDDS \n     schools and is also directed by Dr. Lillian Gonzalez. These \n     schools range in size from 262 students to 768 students. From \n     a telephonic survey conducted on May 16-18, 1995, the \n     information (enrollment data) gleaned is presented on Table \n     2, see Appendix no. 7.\n       In the Section 6 Schools surveyed, full services and \n     programs are available to students in the elementary schools. \n     Table 3, Appendix no. 8, shows the comparison of services \n     available to students in schools of various sizes in DoDDS-E \n     and to students in Section 6 Schools. Here it is quite \n     evident that the majority (61.5%) of the DoDDS-E elementary \n     schools do not enjoy the same program benefits as the \n     students attending the Section 6 Schools. This condition is \n     unacceptable.\n       DoDDS has attempted to retain some services and/or programs \n     that fall below its staffing criteria by staffing ``half-\n     teachers,'' Combining ``halves'' does not benefit any \n     program--it simply assumes that one teacher will do two full \n     jobs in half the time and does not recognize the implied \n     reduction in quality that must result. In the Med District, \n     six full-time librarian positions were cut to half-time \n     positions; three full-time art positions were cut to half-\n     time.\n       An example of this is the situation at Vicenza Elementary \n     School. This school has an enrollment and projected \n     enrollment of slightly under 50 students in grades 1-6. The \n     total enrollment tops 500 with the inclusion of pre-school \n     and kindergarten but those students are not included when \n     applying the DoDDS staffing standards for most of the DoDDS \n     specialists.\n       At Vicenza, the high school media specialist--highly \n     trained in the new computer-run library / media center--is \n     cut for next year to a half-teacher. The elementary art \n     teacher-who runs an outstanding DoDDS art program, recognized \n     this year by the Advisory Council on Dependents Education \n     (ACDE)-is also cut for next year to a half teacher.\n       The principals of the high school and elementary school are \n     pooling their work year slots to create a full teacher, who \n     will have to spend half a day in the high school media center \n     and half a day teaching elementary school art classes. Will \n     services be equal to current levels? No. Without a doubt next \n     year both programs will not have the same quality of \n     education that is now provided.\n       The National Profile (Table 94), Appendix no. 3. shows for \n     elementary schools in the United States that the majority or \n     53% are in the range of 400+ student enrollment; for the unit \n     schools (K-12) in the United States, the majority or 58% are \n     in the range of 200+ student enrollment; and for high schools \n     in the United States the majority or 53.5% are in the range \n     of 500+ student enrollment.\n       The current practice in the United States is to keep \n     elementary schools to a medium size, but to consolidate them \n     if they get too small. For high schools, the standard \n     practice is to consolidate. Consolidation of secondary \n     schools (high schools) allows for larger staff and more \n     electives and advanced course options for students--a depth \n     and breadth of offerings not available in smaller secondary \n     schools.\n       The Section 6 Schools generally follow the same stafing \n     pattern as that in the United States. See Appendix No. 7. \n     Table of school enrollments for the sampled Section 6 \n     Schools. See below:\n\n                                                     TABLE 3.

Section 6 Schools surveyed: Camp Lejeune, NC; Fort Bragg, NC; Fort Campbell, KY. 61.5% of DODDS-E Schools   \n  have under 400 students enrolled. 11% of DODDS-E Schools have between 400-500 students enrolled. 17% of DODDS-E Schools have between 500-800 students enrolled. 10% of DODDS-E Schools have   \n  over 800 students enrolled.                                                                                                                                                                   \n\\1\\Authorized only in weighted numbers.                                                                                                                                                         \n\n\n       Overseas, in DoDDS schools, the opposite occurs. This is \n     shown in Table 1. Type and Size of DoDDS-E Schools, found in \n     Appendix No. 4, Tables 4, 5, and 6 in conjunction with Table \n     1, show that:\n       for DoDDS elementary schools, a majority or 61.5% are in \n     the range of under 400 student enrollment; for DoDDS unit \n     schools (K-12), the majority or 58% are in the range of under \n     200 student enrollment; and,\n       for DoDDS high schools, the majority or 81% are in the \n     range of under 500 student enrollment.\n       In particular, it should be noted that there are NO DoDDS \n     high schools with more than 700 students, while U.S.-wide, \n     over half of all American high schools have MORE than 1000 \n     students.\n       The explanation for this phenomenon is quite simple. The \n     bulk of the DoDDS-E schools are spread too far apart to allow \n     for the consolidation that occurs in the United States. For \n     example, in Turkey if the DoDDS schools there could be \n     consolidated, it would make staffing easier. The distances of \n     hundreds of miles which separate these schools prevent this. \n     This is the rule in DoDDS, not the exception.\n       In effect, stateside schools can be visualized as an \n     inverse pyramid, with the largest schools being the \n     consolidated high schools, the smallest ones being the \n     neighborhood elementary schools. It is clear that the sizes \n     of the elementary schools in the United States are generally \n     considerably larger than those in DoDDS. In the overseas \n     schools however, the pyramid is bottom-heavy, positioned in \n     its normal fashion, with most of the enrollment in elementary \n     schools and a paucity of students in the age groups for upper \n     grades (grades 7-12).\n       Overseas schools are often located at distances of 200 to \n     300 miles away from each other with no way to consolidate, \n     which results in decreasing student populations as students \n     move up through the grades.\n       If these smaller schools are staffed based purely and \n     strictly upon enrollment requirements set forth in the \n     Staffing Documents found in Appendix no. 1, can they offer \n     the programs that are available in the sampled Section 6 \n     Schools? Just because students are required to go to schools \n     with smaller enrollments, is it appropriate that they have \n     fewer educational opportunities than their stateside peers?\n       Certainly not. Parents, driven by perception and reality, \n     who are required to bring dependents overseas to schools in \n     these isolated areas will not be satisfied: They will refuse \n     to enroll their children in schools that are not offering at \n     least the same programs that are offered in the United \n     States--in fact, the programs would have to be better to be a \n     real inducement; word will spread that DoDDS is not providing \n     quality education; the Quality of Life available will be \n     degraded; military recruitment will suffer; and, there will \n     be a resistance to overseas assignments.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11220-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        GLADYS MANSON HAUG ARNTZEN TURNS 100 YEARS OLD IN AUGUST\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a very valued constituent of mine, \nE.P. ``Pete'' Paup, executive vice president of the Manson Construction \nand Engineering Co. in Seattle, WA, has brought to my attention that \nhis mother-in-law will reach the age of 100 years on August 13, 1995. \nPete has kindly shared with me the life story of this remarkable woman.\n  Gladys Angelica Christine Manson was born in the small community of \nDockton on Maury Island in the young State of Washington, August 13, \n1895. Her parents, Minnie Carlson Manson and Peter Manson, were Swedish \nimmigrants who had moved to Dockton from Tacoma in 1893.\n  Peter was employed by the local dry-docking company and became \ndockmaster in 1903. The year before, 1902, little Gladys held a lantern \nwhen her mother dug up a glass jar full of $20 gold pieces from a crawl \nspace beneath their house. Because of the bank failures during the \npanic of 1893, the Mansons didn't trust their money to banks, so they \nhid it. The gold from the mason jar was used to purchase a steam donkey \nengine for a floating pile driver. Today, Manson Construction and \nEngineering Co. is a major Pacific coast marine construction and \ndredging contractor.\n  In 1910, Gladys was a member of Dockton Grade School's first \ngraduating class, whereupon she entered Burton High School. In 1912 she \nmoved to Seattle with her family and graduated from Lincoln High School \nin 1914. After graduation, Glady's entered the University of Washington \nand graduated in 1918 with a degree in music.\n  Gladys later taught music in Brooklyn, Seattle, and Roslyn, WA and \nspent 3 years as a district music supervisor in Kent, WA.\n  In 1924 she married Andrew J. Haug and had three children, Irving, \nPeter, and Andrea. Andrew Haug died in 1965. Later Glady's married \nEdward J. Arntzen, a retired professor from Western Washington \nUniversity in Bellingham, WA. Edward passed away in 1971.\n  Gladys is an active member of Grace Lutheran Church in Bellevue, WA \nand is a member of the Lincoln High School Alumni Association. She has \nalso been a member of both the Sons of Norway and the Swedish Club.\n  Gladys Manson Haug Arntzen will celebrate her 100th birthday at her \ndaughter's home, on August 13, 1995. I invite the attention of all my \ncolleagues to this tremendous story and great community contribution, \nand in doing so, I wish Gladys Manson Haug Arntzen the happiest of \nbirthday celebrations on August 13.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11222-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11222-S11223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  APPOINTING SAM FOWLER, CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE MINORITY, COMMITTEE ON \n                      ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of Mackinac Island State Park. From the \nisland's beginnings as a fort fought over by the French, British, and \nAmericans, to the peaceful calm of a historical vacation spot enjoyed \nby many, Mackinac Island State Park and the waters surrounding it are a \nrich and important part of our Nation's frontier and exploratory \nhistory.\n  Mackinac Island State Park became Michigan's first State park in 1895 \nafter its transfer to the State from the Federal Government, ending its \n20-year tenure as the Nation's second national park. The Mackinac \nIsland State Park Commission was founded in 1895 to supervise the \nMackinac Island State Park, including the 14 historic buildings \ncomprising Fort Mackinac, which were built by the British Army in the \nlate 18th century.\n  In 1904, the commission took on the administration of the site of \nColonial Michilimackinac, established by the French in 1715 in Mackinac \nCity and later dismantled and moved to Mackinac Island by the British. \nThe area had been a fur-trade community, full of life and color. In \n1975, the water-powered sawmill and 625-acre nature park known as Mill \nCreek were added to the land overseen by the commission. Mill Creek is \nlocated southeast of Mackinac City on the shore of Lake Huron. Over the \nyears, the acquisition of land by the commission has led to a beautiful \nState park consisting of 1,800 acres and enjoyed by more than 800,000 \nvisitors each year.\n  Mackinac Island State Park is dear to the hearts of many Michigan \nresidents and visitors alike. The smell of Mackinac Island fudge brings \nchildhood memories back to many a visitor while the clip-clop of horse \nhooves and the ring of bicycle bells on the automobile-free island \nrecalls a by-gone time.\n  Mackinac Island State Park is a vital part of Michigan's history. It \nis home to the State's oldest known building still standing and the \nlongest porch in the world, located at the opulent Grand Hotel. I know \nmany people in Michigan and around the world will join me in \ncelebrating the jewel of the Great Lakes in the commemoration of its \n100 spectacular years.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11223-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11223-S11224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              LOWER MILITARY SPENDING YIELDS HIGHER GROWTH\n\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I refer to my colleagues an \narticle from the July 15 issue of The Economist. The article discusses \nthe economic impact of reduced military spending in light of worldwide \ndeclines in defense budgets over the last decade. While the impact of \nsuch a peace dividend is difficult to calculate, the article brings up \nan interesting point:\n\n       In the long run, most economists think that lower defense \n     spending should stimulate growth. One reason for this is that \n     cash can be switched from defense to more productive areas \n     such as education. A second is that smaller military budgets \n     should lead to lower overall government spending, hence lower \n     borrowing than would otherwise have been the case. As a \n     result, interest rates should be lower, stimulating private \n     investment.\n\n  The article also refers to a recent IMF study which finds a clear \nrelationship between lower military spending and increased economic \ngrowth. It concludes that a 2-percent per capita rise in GDP will \nresult from the decreased spending worldwide in the late 1980's. Its \nauthors also estimate that if global military spending is reduced to 2 \npercent of GDP--the United States currently spends 3.9 percent--the \ndividend will eventually lead to a rise in GDP per head of 20 percent.\n  I bring this to light as we consider increasing military spending by \n$7 billion, while making deep cuts in education, job training, health, \nand programs for the poor. Already, our Nation spends more on the \nmilitary than the next eight largest militaries combined. It is a \nmistake to turn back against global trends to a course which, in the \nlong run, will lead to lower growth and hurt our international \ncompetitiveness.\n  This Congress skewed priorities of spending more on the military and \nless on social investment will nullify the dividend we hope to reap \nthrough balancing the budget and lowering interest rates. Simply put, \ninvestment in a B-2 bomber creates a plane that sits there incurring \noperating costs, but investment in a child's education creates \nopportunity, productivity, and long-lasting benefits to society.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                  [From the Economist, July 15, 1995]\n\n     Fewer Bangs, More Bucks--Since the End of the Cold War, \n     Military Spending Has Declined in Most Countries, Yet the \n     Promised ``Peace Dividend'' Is Proving Elusive\n       Francis Fukuyama, an American political analyst, claimed in \n     1989 that the collapse of communism heralded the end of \n     history. Few believed him, but many looked forward to the end \n     of at least one aspect of the cold war: high defence \n     spending. No longer would countries waste precious resources \n     building tanks and bombs. Instead, they could use the cash \n     for more rewarding activities: higher social spending, more \n     capital investment or increased aid to the world's poor. Was \n     this optimism warranted?\n       That overall defence spending has fallen is uncontested. \n     According to the United Nations' latest World Economic and \n     Social Survey, world military expenditure decreased at an \n     average rate of 7.2% a year between 1988 and 1993. The \n     biggest declines came in former Warsaw Pact countries, where \n     defence spending fell by an average of over 22% a year. In \n     America, it fell by 4.4% a year (though the Republican \n     Congress is planning to stem this decline). The cuts are not \n     as steep as some had hoped; but the share of CDP devoted to \n     military spending has fallen everywhere (see chart).\n       Assessing the economic impact is harder. One crude notion \n     is to calculate what countries would have spent on defence \n     without the cuts. A previous UN report in 1994 suggested that \n     had governments maintained their defence budgets in real \n     terms from 1988 to 1994, global defence spending would have \n     been $933 billion higher than it was. That suggests a peace \n     dividend of almost $1 trillion. But such a calculation is \n     flawed: 1987 was a year of high defence spending; had another \n     base year been chosen, the dividend would probably be lower. \n     More important, the sums fail to take into account the \n     broader economic impact of reduced defence spending.\n       As with any big reduction in public spending, defence cuts \n     tend to reduce economic activity in the short term. That may \n     cause unemployment to rise, particularly in regions where \n     defence-related industries are heavily concentrated. Between \n     1988 and 1992, for instance, the increase in the unemployment \n     rates of the four American states that are most dependent on \n     defence spending--Connecticut, Virginia, Massachusetts and \n     California--was some two-and-a-half times greater than that \n     in the rest of the country. Such regional effects often make \n     defence cuts politically awkward.\n       In the long run, however, most economists think that lower \n     defence spending should stimulate growth. One reason for this \n     is that cash can be switched from defence to more productive \n     areas such as education. A second is that smaller military \n     budgets should lead to lower overall government spending, and \n     hence lower borrowing, than would otherwise have been the \n     case. As a result, interest rates should be lower, \n     stimulating private investment. Some economists also argue \n     that lower defence spending will result in fewer distortions \n     in an economy. They point in particular to anti-competitive \n     mechanisms that often feature in military contracts or the \n     trade preferences given to military imports.\n       But big defence budgets can also have positive side-\n     effects. In countries such as South Korea and Israel, spin-\n     offs from military research and development have helped to \n     foster expertise in civilian high-technology industries. In \n     poor countries with low levels of education and skills, \n     military training might be a good way to improve the \n     educational standard of the workforce. During the cold war \n     some poor countries also relied on the rival superpowers not \n     just for military assistance, but also for other aid. If \n     their erstwhile benefactors cut this aid along with military \n     support, it might leave them with fewer resources overall.\n       Until recently, there has been little conclusive evidence \n     about the long-run economic impact of lower defence spending. \n     This is partly due to the difficulty of getting \n\n[[Page S11224]]\n     comparable data, and to the problem of separating short-term from long-\n     term consequences. But in a recent working paper\\1\\ Malcolm \n     Knight, an economist at the IMF, and two colleagues, use a \n     long-run growth model and sophisticated econometric \n     techniques to measure the effect of military spending on \n     growth in 79 countries between 1971 and 1985. They find a \n     clear correlation between lower outlays and higher growth.\n     \\1\\``The Peace Dividend: Military Spending Cuts and Economic \n     Growth''. By Malcolm Knight, Norman Loayza and Delano \n     Villanueva. IMF, May 1995.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The authors then simulate what the long-run effects of the \n     decline in military spending of the late 1980s are likely to \n     be. Unsurprisingly, they are positive. Industrial countries, \n     for instance, can expect a long-run absolute increase in GDP \n     per head of 2% from the spending cuts that occurred up to \n     1990.\n                            delayed payment\n\n       Mr. Knight and his fellow authors then try to estimate what \n     the long-run effects of further cuts in world defence \n     spending might be. They assume that global defence spending \n     is reduced to under 2% of GDP (the current level in Latin \n     America, the region with the world's lowest defence \n     spending). If industrialised countries achieve such a target, \n     the authors expect an eventual increase in their GDP per head \n     of 20%. In other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the effects \n     will be even greater. However, it will take a long time for \n     these benefits to work through. Even after 50 years, for \n     instance, the improvement in the level of GDP per head in \n     rich countries would have reached only 13.2%.\n       Unfortunately, the model does not explain whether this \n     increase would be attributable to more productive public \n     investment, or to lower interest rates. In practice, the cuts \n     in military spending since the 1980s appear to have been used \n     to keep overall public spending under control. This means \n     that the clearest long-term economic benefit from the end of \n     the cold war is likely to come from lower interest rates--\n     unless, of course, public spending rises for other reasons.\n       For those defence employees faced with the sack, it may be \n     scant comfort to hear about the long-term gains to the \n     economy that accompany fewer military bases. But, providing \n     that governments keep public spending in check, the world \n     will indeed benefit from a substantial peace dividend--even \n     though it will not produce the immediate pay-off that \n     optimists were hoping for.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11223-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, last week the Senate sent a clear \nmessage to President Clinton and to our allies that the illegal and \nimmoral arms embargo on the Bosnian Government should be lifted so that \nthe Government and people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina can \nexercise their right to defend themselves and their homes. While we \nwait for the lifting to occur, the people of Bosnia remain under \nsiege--with suffering, death and destruction an intrinsic part of \neveryday life.\n  I am particularly concerned by the tragic developments in the Bihac \nregion of Bosnia. While NATO threatens tough action in response to \nattacks on Gorazde--a threat I hope NATO will actually act on--the \nattacks on the Bihac safe area continue. These are coordinated attacks \nby the Bosnian Serbs, the Krajina Serbs from Croatia, and even renegade \nMoslems who have sided with the Serbs. These are concerted attacks \nwhich, like so much of the fighting in Bosnia, include direct targeting \nof heavy weapons against the civilian population. These are inhumane \nattacks accompanied by efforts to deny food and water to the Bosnians \nin Bihac who are surrounded by Serbs.\n  The fall of Bihac--another U.N. safe haven--would result in more \nhuman tragedy, more ethnic cleansing, more refugees forced from their \nhomes. But the consequences of the fall of Bihac would go well beyond \nthe immediate tragedy for the Bosnians in the region.\n  The fall of Bihac would fundamentally change the strategic balance in \nBosnia and Croatia to favor victory for the Serbs and the establishment \nof a greater Serbia. The establishment of a greater Serbia with no \nplace for Bosnians and Croats of other races and other religions \nclearly remains the objective of the Serbs in Belgrade, Pale and Knin \nalike. For the fall of Bihac would free up Bosnian Serb and Krajina \nSerb troops to continue their campaign of terror elsewhere in Bosnia \nand Croatia.\n  The Croatian Government, recognizing these strategic as well as \nhumanitarian implications, has agreed with the Bosnian Government to \ncome to the aid of Bihac. This may lead to a wider war with renewed \nfighting in Croatia.\n  But the fall of Bihac will become imminent, and this safe area \ndependent on Croatian intervention, if the United Nations forces and \nNATO fail to protect the Bosnian people of the Bihac region. The United \nNations Security Council has declared Bihac a safe haven, but UNPROFOR \nhas failed to keep it safe. NATO has declared Bihac a heavy weapons \nexclusion zone, but NATO has not carried out airstrikes to enforce that \nexclusion zone. The dual key arrangement under which the United Nations \nhas denied NATO the authority to eliminate the missile threat to NATO \naircraft has increased the likelihood that Bihac will not be protected. \nThe United Nations Security Council has declared Bosnia a no-fly zone, \nbut NATO aircraft have\n not been able to prevent Krajina Serb jets from bombing Bihac, because \nUnited Nations and NATO rules don't allow NATO to pursue these planes \ninto Croatian airspace or to hit them on the ground. We need to \neliminate these rules and the dual key arrangements which stand in the \nway of effective action.\n\n  Mr. President, the United Nations and NATO failed to protect \nSrebrenica. The United Nations and NATO failed to protect Zepa.\n  The United Nations and NATO must not fail again in Gorazde. They must \nnot fail in Bihac, Tuzla, Sarajevo or other areas where Bosnian \ncivilians come under attack. The international community must not fail \nthe people of Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, last week an important voice spoke out against the \ninternational failure to halt atrocities in Bosnia. Former Polish Prime \nMinister Mazowiecki resigned his position as the United Nations human \nrights investigator for the former Yugoslavia to protest the United \nNation's inaction to address the human rights violations he reported \nand the United Nation's failure to protect the United Nations-declared \nsafe havens of Srebrenica and Zepa.\n  Allow me to read a few passages from Mazowiecki's letter of \nresignation, since his words are surely more eloquent than mine:\n\n       One cannot speak about the protection of human rights with \n     credibility when one is confronted with the lack of \n     consistency and courage displayed by the international \n     community and its leaders.\n       Human rights violations continue blatantly. There are \n     constant blockages of the delivery of humanitarian aid. The \n     civilian population is shelled remorselessly and the blue \n     helmets and representatives of humanitarian organizations are \n     dying.\n       Crimes have been committed with swiftness and brutality and \n     by contrast the response of the international community has \n     been slow and ineffectual.\n\n  Mr. President, these are not the words of a partisan spokesman. These \nare the words of a statesman who has devoted years to impartially \ninvestigating human rights abuses for the United Nations. I hope that \nPresident Clinton, the U.N. Secretary General, the NATO Secretary \nGeneral and other world leaders will hear these words and will heed \nthem.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11224-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, while driving to the Capitol this morning, \nI fell to thinking about what a calamity it would be if, all of a \nsudden, the hosiery manufacturing business in America were to shut \ndown. How many jobs would be lost? How would the economy be affected? \nHow would our country's trade balance with other countries be affected? \nAnd how many grandchildren would have to think of something else to put \nunder the tree for Grandpa next Christmas?\n  None of the above is an idle question, Mr. President, and I bring up \nthe subject because next week will mark the 24th annual observance of \nNational Hosiery Week. So, beginning Monday, August 7, will be a time \nto pay our respects to a great American example of free enterprise, the \nhosiery manufacturers of our Nation.\n  Now, regarding some of the questions I posed at the outset of these \nremarks: Last year, 1994, the U.S. hosiery industry made significant \nincreases in exports. To be precise, shipments overseas increased 34 \nper cent to 240 million pairs of socks and stockings. Total U.S. \nproduction totaled 362 million dozen pairs--or, if you want to break it \ndown, the total production comes to four billion 394 million pairs of \nhosiery. A mind-boggling number, indeed.\n  We are blessed with a great many hosiery manufacturers in North \nCarolina, Mr. President. All of these companies are good corporate \ncitizens--and the men and women employed in the hosiery industry are \nfine hard-working Americans. I am told that there are 455 hosiery plans \nin America, employing more than 65,000 people. Together these companies \nand these workers added more than $6 billion to the U.S. economy.\n  But, Mr. President, it is in the many smaller communities where the \nhosiery industry makes its most significant contribution, because it is \nthere that these companies constitute a large part of the local \neconomy. In so many cases, a hosiery company is the major employer in \nthe area, providing good, stable jobs for its employees.\n  Mr. President, I think it was Dizzy Dean who once remarked that \n``braggin' ain't braggin', if you can prove it.'' Well, I can prove why \nNational Hosiery Week is of special importance to me--it is because \nNorth Carolina is the leading textile and hosiery State in the Nation, \ngenerating more than half of the total U.S. hosiery production. I am \nproud of the leadership of the hosiery industry and the fine quality of \nlife that it has provided for over 40,000 people.\n  On behalf of my fellow North Carolinians, I extend my sincere \ncongratulations and best wishes to the hosiery industry and to its many \nthousands of employees for their outstanding contribution to our State \nand Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/02/senate-section/article/S11225-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R 714\n\n  Mr. COATS.
