Under the previous order, the time for debate \nuntil noon today is equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, several of my colleagues have expressed a desire to \nspeak on the term limits amendment. As they work their way to the \nfloor, I would like to make a couple of comments.\n  We have had a good debate in the last couple of days on term limits. \nIt has\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\ntaken about 50 years to get such a clear vote to the floor, and I can \nassure the President that it will not take another 50 years to get \nanother vote on it. It is an idea that is not only demanded by the \nAmerican people, but I think more and more the people in this body \nunderstand that we are incapable institutionally now of dealing with \nthe problems facing this country under the current setup.\n\n  One could not be anything but amazed and somewhat saddened to listen \nto that giant oak of a man, Senator Alan Simpson from Wyoming, \nyesterday as he recounted his experiences of three terms in this body. \nIt was with a twinkle in his eye--because he always has a twinkle in \nhis eye even under the most serious circumstances--but somewhat with a \nheavy heart as he is leaving this body after this year that he had to \nrecount one more time what everyone in this body knows behind closed \ndoors; that is, that we are bankrupting our country; that our Social \nSecurity system cannot survive as currently constituted; that Medicare \nwill fall; that within a relatively few years a handful of programs and \nthe interest on the national debt will take all of our revenues. He has \nseen this happen in his work on the entitlement commission, which is a \nbipartisan entitlement commission, and it comes to this same result, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. It was an almost unanimous report \ncoming out of there saying basically that we are on the road to \ndestruction for this country.\n  We probably cannot do enough wrong over the next 2 or 3 years, or \nmaybe even past that, to really run our ox totally in the ditch. But \njust as sure as I am standing here, catastrophe lies down the road, and \nwe are all fiddling while Rome continues to burn. That is what this \nconstitutional amendment for term limits is all about because we are \nputting reelection above all else. Reelection requires spending because \nthat is the way we buy votes with taxpayers' own money--by giving it \nback to them a little bit at a time. That is the cruel, hard truth. I \ndo not claim to be the first one that said it.\n  In looking over some old documents in books, I ran across a quotation \nfrom Senator Danforth of Missouri who served in this body, who had the \nrespect, I believe, of everyone on both sides of the aisle. As he left, \nhe said these words:\n\n       Deep down in our hearts, we believe that we have been \n     accomplices to something terrible and unforgivable to this \n     wonderful country. Deep down in our hearts, we know that we \n     have bankrupted America and that we have given our children a \n     legacy of bankruptcy. We have defrauded the country to get \n     ourselves elected.\n\n  Those are harsh words spoken by a gentle man just as Senator Simpson \ndid yesterday. All of the pundits and folks in the media who are only \nconcerned about wins and losses and numbers of votes will have their \nday perhaps this time because we will have a vote this afternoon. But I \ncan assure you that on down the road, as the consequences of our \nactions become clearer and clearer and clearer, the time will come with \nthe success of a constitutional amendment for term limits.\n\n  One of our distinguished colleagues took the floor yesterday opposing \nterm limits, and it seems that he took the matter somewhat personally. \nHe operated under the assumption that this amendment cannot possibly be \nanything other than an attack, a personal attack, on Members who have \nbeen here for a long time, and he seems to take it as such; it cannot \nbe anything but based on an assumption that everybody that comes to the \nU.S. Congress is coming to line their own pockets. He said that he \nthought basically that was the assumption for the term limits \nmovement--that we wanted to get even with somebody; that we wanted to \npunish somebody.\n  That is not it, Mr. President. That is not it. Had he listened to the \ndebate, listened to Senator Simpson, listened to Senator Brown, who \nserved in the House and the Senate--and he is also leaving this body of \nhis own volition to return to private life--Senator Ashcroft, and the \nother Members, I think he would have found a gentleness of approach, a \ngentleness of spirit, of sincerity, and a concern for the future of \nthis country.\n  This is not about getting even. This is not about besmirching the \nreputation of those who have served here before so gallantly. This is \nnot about defiling the names of the giants who have walked these \naisles.\n  As I said, yesterday, I used to sit up here in the galleries, not \nmuch more than a small boy, and look at these giants whose shoulders we \nstand on today, and listened to their debates. Back in a time not too \nlong ago when we had more time to debate, we had more time to reflect, \nthe Government had not grown quite so large. We were still balancing \nthe budget in this country as late as 1969.\n\n  A good argument can be made that our system has worked pretty well \nnow for a long period of time. The only problem is now that \ncircumstances have changed. Our Founding Fathers never could have \nanticipated a professional Congress, but our Founding Fathers could \nanticipate changes in society and circumstances. They could not \nprobably have ever guessed of the modern technological miracles we have \ntoday such as television, such as the fax machine, such as airplanes, \nand the vast numbers of things bringing people to Washington, DC, \nwanting more--wanting more programs, wanting more money, wanting a \nbigger share: ``Yes, I know you have to balance the budget but take a \nlook at ours; this is different,'' which we get day in and day out, day \nin and day out.\n  Over the past relatively few decades, it has resulted in a situation \nwhere, as I said before, a relatively few, a handful of programs are \ngoing to take all of the revenues that we have. Those who are concerned \nabout children, there will be no money for children's programs. Those \nwho are concerned about the elderly, there will be no money for that. \nInfrastructure, many thoughtful people in this country, with whom I \nagree, say that in some areas we ought to be spending more on \ninfrastructure--roads and bridges are falling into disrepair; research \nand development, things that will make us stronger in the future, we \nare not spending enough on that.\n  The reason, of course, is that there is no immediate political \npayoff. If you cannot send somebody a check in the mail before the next \nelection, there is no immediate political payoff, and it comes right \nback around again. Our desire for constant reelection pushes the \nspending, pushes the growth of Government, and pushes the next \ngeneration into bankruptcy just as surely as I am standing here.\n  That is what this is about, trying to come up with a system, \nadjusting under the Constitution as our Founding Fathers anticipated \nand as they provided for in the Constitution, a thoughtful \ndeliberation, which is very difficult to get. It has to pass here by a \ntwo-thirds vote and then be sent to the States, and the States have 7 \nyears to ratify it--a very long and difficult process. So it is not \nradical. It is a conservative process based on the principles of the \nFounding Fathers.\n  So that is what it is about, trying to come up with a system, trying \nto adjust our system in a way so that we are better equipped to deal \nwith the problems we do not seem to be able to deal with today.\n\n  Would it solve all of our problems? Certainly not. Would we \nimmediately start balancing the budget and would the prestige of \nCongress immediately change? Probably not. But we would be on the right \npath. If we try something long enough and keep getting the same \nresults, is it not, when the stakes are so high, incumbent upon us to \ntry something a little bit different? As much as most of us respect and \nrevere this institution--and I do--it has never made any sense to me to \nstruggle so hard and sacrifice so much to become a Member of a body \nthat you do not respect. But despite our respect, we must recognize \nthat among the American people it is not there anymore. It is not there \nthe way it should be.\n  So in our constant scramble to supposedly be responsive and give \npeople what they want, that is, money, programs, expanded in many cases \nat 10 percent a year ad infinitum, which we all know cannot be \nsustained, we are creating the enmity of the American people at the \nsame time, as if they were not aware of all of these wonderful things \nwe were supposedly doing for them.\n  It has been pointed out that we would lose the benefit of the \nservices of many people who have served long terms in this body before, \nand that is true.\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n There is no question but that term limits would deprive us of the \nservices of some good people. But I urge, Mr. President, that as we \ncontinue this debate we refrain from personalizing this debate. This \nhas nothing to do with myself. This has nothing to do with individual \nMembers who are currently serving in this body. We will be lucky if \nthey remember us 24 hours after we leave.\n  This has to do with the institution. This has to do with the country. \nThis has to do with the kind of institution that this country needs in \norder to carry us into the next century to cope with these terrible \nproblems. Certainly we would lose some valuable experience, but in all \ncandor the experience that we have has not shown or demonstrated the \nability to keep us out of the fiscal and reputation quagmire we see in \nCongress today.\n  We would lose some expertise, but what would we gain? We have 250 \nmillion people in this country. Under the current system where the \nincumbent has all of the advantages because of the spending I referred \nto and because of the reciprocation by those who have the money spent \non them, usually in terms of campaign support, incumbents even in \nrevolutionary years are reelected at the rate of 90 percent if they \nchoose to stand for reelection.\n  So we have a small fraction of 1 percent of the people who have a \nrealistic chance, a realistic opportunity to serve in this body. Most \ngood people now do not bother. If the system were opened up to these \npositions after 12 years, 12 years is by some measures not a great deal \nof time but by some measures it is not a short period of time either. \nIt is much longer than George Washington served. It is longer than \nThomas Jefferson served. They managed to make a name for themselves in \nless than 12 years. So it is not an onerous, punishing type of \nproposition. But look at what expertise and experience we would bring \ninto the system if people knew these positions were going to be open \nfrom time to time. We would have people coming in from the private \nsector. We would have people with acknowledged experience in business \nand labor, in farming, in being a mother and a father to mix and mingle \nwith those who have already been here for a while.\n  Senator Frist, my colleague from Tennessee, pointed out the number of \nphysicians we used to have in this body, a high percentage of \nphysicians when the country was first founded, members of the clergy. \nYou do not see that much anymore. I simply think that if we had the \nsystem open, it would encourage more people, knowing they could not \nstay forever when they came, that it would be not a career for them but \nan interruption to a career, and they would come in with that \nexperience, bring it to bear on their public service and, while they \nwere here, I think would be more likely to do what it would take to \nspeak the plain truth even if they risked the voters getting angry at \nthem and sending them home a little prematurely because they are going \nhome anyway. It would not be a catastrophic condition. I believe we \nwould see a little more courage, a little more ability to stand up to \nthe tough challenges that this country is going to face.\n  So just to attempt to refocus as we begin the morning--I see Senator \nByrd is in the Chamber--I reiterate this is not about vindictiveness. \nIt is not about personalities. It is not about quick fixes. It is a \nsincere effort on the part of many people around this country and in \nthis body to think in terms of how best can we be equipped.\n  The current system arguably has served us very well for a long period \nof time. But is it not incumbent upon us to make adjustments as we go \nalong to better equip ourselves to cope with the problems that we are \nleaving the next generation?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I compliment those Senators on both sides of the aisle \nand those on both sides of the question. Everyday we disagree about one \nthing or another, and so we can expect to disagree in this instance, on \nthis issue. I have nothing but the utmost respect, however, for those \nSenators who hold a different viewpoint from the one that I hold and \nthat I will undertake to express.\n  Mr. President, proposing to amend the Constitution of the United \nStates is one of the most serious and profound endeavors that this or \nany other Congress can undertake. It is not an act that any Senator or \nany Member of the House of Representatives, having sworn to support and \ndefend the Constitution, can take lightly or inadvertently or absent \ngreat deliberation. On the contrary, a constitutional amendment must be \nconsidered thoroughly and exhaustively if it is going to be adopted \nhere and ratified in the States. All of its ramifications must be \nrooted out and fully understood.\n  While some may believe that it is important to consider an amendment \nwith deference to the views of the American people--and I think that is \nimportant--I believe it is equally important that we also maintain a \ndeep respect for the wisdom and the vision of those Framers who \npainstakingly crafted the Constitution 209 years ago.\n  It is extremely important, then, particularly as we consider a \nconstitutional amendment to limit the service of Members of the House \nof Representatives and the Senate, that each of us looks beyond the \nopinion polls, beyond the radio talk shows, beyond the op-ed pages. We \nmust, as I believe our duty requires, go beyond the rhetoric, the \npolitical posturing and pandering and the 30-second sound bites that \nhave enveloped this issue.\n  Instead, we must look back, back to the history of the Federal \nConvention of 1787. Cicero said, ``To be ignorant of what occurred \nbefore you were born is to remain always a child.'' So, let us look \nback. It is paramount, I think, that we take the time to understand and \nreflect on what the Founding Fathers intended, but before proceeding \ndown that path, I think it is also important to point out the often \noverlooked fact that a limit on the terms of the Members of Congress \nalready exists in the Constitution.\n\n  Here in my hand is my Contract With America. I took an oath to \nsupport and defend it. I have taken that oath many times. It is the \nConstitution of the United States, and in article I, section 2, a limit \nis placed on the terms of the Members of the House of Representatives, \nand in article I, section 3 of the Constitution--not the so-called \nContract With America--the Constitution, article I, section 3, a \nlimitation of 6 years is placed upon the terms of U.S. Senators.\n  And so, Mr. President, by that very language that was written into \nthis Constitution, one can see that Members of Congress have already \nbeen subjected to limited terms--2 years in the case of the House and 6 \nyears in the Senate.\n  Consequently, what we are debating here with respect to this proposed \nconstitutional amendment is not a term limits amendment, per se, but \nrather an amendment that would limit the tenure, an amendment that \nwould limit the service of a Member of Congress; a vastly different \nproposition, a limitation on the service of Members of the Senate, a \nlimitation on the service of Members of the House.\n  I am hardly surprised that when proponents of the so-called term \nlimits amendment refer to the Framers, they do so to evoke the image of \na citizen legislator as a way of bolstering support for their cause. \nThey say we need to amend the Constitution in order to preserve the \nFramers' original vision of individuals who would set aside their \nplows--as did Cincinnatus in the year 458 B.C.--to serve this great \nRepublic, only to return to their fields as swiftly as possible. \nCitizen legislators! Well, I am a citizen. I am a citizen legislator. I \ndo not look at service here as a hobby, something I should engage in \nfor one or two terms. I look upon it as a service which I can \ncontribute to my State and my country.\n  When I think about those men who labored to write the Constitution--\nmen like James Madison who served in the other body four terms, not a \nmaximum of three terms, he served four terms in the House of \nRepresentatives--George Mason, James Wilson, Benjamin Franklin and \nothers who labored to write the Constitution--I have serious doubts \nabout the veracity of that claim. That such men could truly embrace \nthat bucolic notion is, at best,\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\ndubious, particularly in light of the fact that these were men who \ndevoted nearly all of their adult lives to public service. No one, \nthen, should be misled by this romanticized interpretation of the \nFramers' views.\n  The lack of a provision in the Constitution limiting the tenure of \nMembers of Congress was certainly no oversight. In fact, the issues of \nterms and tenure were discussed by the delegates on several different \noccasions.\n  As early as May 29, 1787, days after the requisite number of \ndelegates had taken their place in Philadelphia, the so-called Virginia \nplan was laid before the participants. May 29, that is my wedding \nanniversary. Next May 29, the good Lord willing, my wife and I will \nhave been married 59 years. So it is easy for me to remember the day on \nwhich Edmund Randolph submitted his plan--May 29, 1787. That plan, \nwhich would become the basis from which the convention worked, was \noffered by the State's Governor, Edmund Randolph, on behalf of his \nfellow delegates from Virginia. The Virginia, or Randolph, plan \nproposed 15 resolutions for the formation of a government, with the \nfourth and fifth resolutions directly addressing the issues of terms \nand tenure.\n\n  It is instructive to note that with respect to tenure for Members of \nthe House and Senate, both the fourth and fifth resolutions of the \nVirginia plan remained silent. Neither offered the assembled delegates \na specific recommendation. On the contrary, the spaces on the page \nstipulating how long it would be before a Member would be ``incapable \nof reelection,'' were simply left blank. Moreover, by June 12, after \ninitially debating the issue of term length, the Convention unanimously \nagreed to strike the clauses in both the fourth and fifth resolutions \nlimiting reelection. Here we have, then, the assembled delegates to the \nFederal Convention refusing to limit the number of terms a member of \nthe proposed national legislature could serve.\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding their unanimous agreement on the \nmatter of tenure, we also know from Madison's notes on the debates that \nthere was a wide range of views among the delegates as to how long a \nSenator's term should be. While there was a general consensus that, of \nthe two legislative bodies, the Senate was to be the one of greater \ndeliberation, greater stability, greater continuity, the duration of \nthat term was the subject of much debate.\n  On June 12, which happens to be my lovely wife's birthday--but she \nwas not around on the June 12 that I am talking about--on June 12, \n1787, for example, before striking the clause limiting tenure, the \ndelegates turned their attention to the issue of term length. While in \nthe Committee of the Whole, the first proposal for senatorial terms \ncame from Richard Spaight of North Carolina, who thought that 7 years \nwould be a proper amount of time. Roger Sherman thought 7 years was too \nlong, arguing that if Senators did their jobs well, they would be \nreelected, and if they ``acted amiss, an earlier opportunity should be \nallowed for getting rid of them.'' As a compromise, Sherman thought a \nterm of 5 years suitable.\n  Edmund Randolph, who offered the original Virginia plan, weighed in \non the matter with the observation that the object of the Senate would \nbe to control the House. If it were not a firm body, according to \nRandolph, the House, by virtue of its superior number of Members, would \noverwhelm the Senate. Madison agreed. He considered a 7-year term \nappropriate and not giving too much stability to the Senate. On the \ncontrary, Madison ``conceived it to be of great importance'' that a \nstable and firm government, ``organized in the republican form,'' was \nwhat the people desired. With that, the delegates adopted a 7-year \nSenate term by a vote of 8 to 1.\n\n  On June 25 and June 26, the delegates returned to the issue of \nsenatorial terms. Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts initially suggested \na 4-year term, with one-fourth of the Senate to be elected every year. \nRoger Sherman of Connecticut proposed a 6-year term. George Read of \nDelaware went so far as to suggest that Senators hold their offices \n``during good behavior,'' thus, in effect, constituting a lifetime \nterm.\n  Despite these differences, the delegates did, as we know, eventually \nagree to a 6-year term. But even that decision was tempered with a \n``check'' by requiring that one-third of the Senate stand for election \nevery 2 years, a provision aimed at ensuring the frequent participation \nin the electoral process of the State legislatures, whose members, \nprior to the adoption of the 17th amendment in 1913, were charged with \nselecting Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, clearly, the underlying issue for the delegates to the \nFederal Convention, as it should be for us here today, was the degree \nto which limited tenure, the degree to which limited service in office \nwould adversely impact on the level of experience gained by a Member of \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, one of the great advantages that comes from allowing \nvoters to return their Representatives and Senators to Congress again \nand again is that Members of Congress are able to gain experience in \nthe legislative process--the experience. It is a process that has \nbecome increasingly difficult to master. James Madison understood that. \nHe told us right there in Federalist No. 53 that a crucial part of \nexperience ``can only be attained, or at least thoroughly attained,'' \nby the actual experiences a person gains as a result of practicing his \ncraft.\n  I shall read from Federalist Paper No. 53 this excerpt:\n\n       No man can be a competent legislator who does not add to an \n     upright intention and a sound judgment a certain degree of \n     knowledge of the subjects on which he is to legislate. A part \n     of this knowledge may be acquired by means of information \n     which lie within the compass of men in private as well as \n     public stations. Another part can only be attained, or at \n     least thoroughly attained, by actual experience in the \n     station which requires the use of it.\n\n  No Senator, Mr. President, can garner more experience as a \nlegislator, and no Member of the House can become a more seasoned \nMember of that body, through the route of constitutionally mandating \nlimited service in the Senate or in the House.\n  I know of no other profession in which we actually consider \nexperience a disadvantage. Would anyone needing open heart surgery \nseriously consider going to someone who had never performed the \noperation? Or would one tend to seek out a seasoned surgeon who had \nperformed many such operations, perhaps hundreds?\n  I recently had the experience of having a root canal done. It was the \nsecond such that I had experienced. Would I have felt confident in the \nhands of someone who just walked in off the street or in the hands of \nsomeone who had practiced only, say, for 6 months? When that drill \nstarts twirling and whirling and cutting, throwing the dust, I feel \nbetter that the person who is handling that drill is a person long \nexperienced. The individual who performed my root canal had done \nperhaps 40,000 to 50,000 such operations over a long period of time. I \nsubmit that the answer is obvious. Only in the area of public service \nare the people being asked to believe that less is really more.\n\n  I do not like to fly. I never have liked to fly, and when I have been \non an airliner in a storm I have always felt better believing that that \npilot possessed the long experience that gave me the confidence that I \nneeded so much at that point in time.\n  Mr. President, we are discussing an amendment to the Constitution \nthat would, by definition, create a class of legislators who would, for \nvirtually all of their service, remain relatively inexperienced. \nPatrick Henry said in a speech delivered in the Virginia House of \nDelegates, in 1775, ``I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, \nand that is the lamp of experience.'' Benjamin Franklin, in ``Poor \nRichard's Almanac,'' said, ``Experience keeps a dear school, but fools \nwill learn in no other.''\n  There is no substitute for it--none! It takes years to master many of \nthe difficult issues with which this country must contend, but here we \nare, discussing an amendment to the Constitution that would, by \ndefinition, create a class of legislators who would, for virtually all \nof their service, remain relatively inexperienced.\n  Clear comprehension of national defense policy or the Federal budget \nor tax issues does not come without long, long years of study and \nexperience. Yet, this amendment implies that we can cure the Nation's \nills if only we can find a way to eliminate, or at least\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\nreduce, experience. It is really a turning of logic on its head.\n  Additionally, I wonder if the proponents of the amendment have \nconsidered the effect which limiting terms may have on the careful \nattempt by the Framers to balance the power of the small States and \nthose with larger populations. There has historically been a desirable \noffset, an advantage that such experience can bring to a State like \nRhode Island or North Dakota or Montana or my own State of West \nVirginia. As it is now, a small State can have confidence that if its \nMembers are in the other body long enough under the system of \nseniority, they may become chairmen of important committees.\n  Under this amendment, the small States will be at the mercy of the \nlarge States. The few large States will control the House of \nRepresentatives under this amendment. They would determine who would \nserve as chairmen of the committees. The small States will be at a \ngreat disadvantage. The large States will be able to control the \ncommittee chairmanships in the other body. The other States will not be \nin a position to control, but will be controlled by the large States. \nHow can a small State, stripped of even the advantage of an experienced \nlegislator, hold its own against the more populous States, which have a \nnumerical advantage in the House of Representatives?\n\n  Mr. President, I will also point out that the issue of experience \ngoes well beyond the ability of a single Member of Congress to offer \neffective representation to a State or district. Indeed, the lack of \nexperience on the part of the whole would affect each and every one of \nus in this Chamber or in the House of Representatives. For to whom is \nthe inexperienced legislator to look for guidance if all of his \ncolleagues are inexperienced? When we have our debates on national \ndefense, I listen to Sam Nunn. He has no equal in this body when it \ncomes to knowledge of military affairs--national defense. I listen to \nhim. I do not have that knowledge. I serve on his committee. I have \nbeen serving there 3 or 4 years. But Sam Nunn possesses the knowledge \nthat not only benefits him and his own constituents, but benefits me \nand my constituents, and benefits every other Member of this body. We \nlook to him for guidance.\n  What about a Pat Moynihan, when we think about legislation affecting \nSocial Security or welfare? He has been here 19 years, and he has \ngained through the experience. So I listen to him. With whom do Members \nof the Senate discuss defense issues if there is no Sam Nunn? Or \nforeign affairs, if there is no J. William Fulbright, or if there is no \nRichard Lugar? From whom do the less experienced Members seek advice on \nthe difficult issue of immigration? I go to Alan Simpson on matters \naffecting immigration. I do not serve on the committee that has \njurisdiction over that subject matter, so I go to someone who serves on \nthat committee and who, by virtue of his long service and experience, \nis in a position to advise me. The same thing can be said about the \nfreshman legislator who is concerned with the issue of Medicaid or \nMedicare. Again, I would look to Pat Moynihan.\n  So each of us seeks out the advice of senior colleagues on these \nother matters. Each of us looks to the more experienced Senator when \ntrying to understand the great issues that face this body. Each of us \nseeks advice. All of us benefit from that advice and that experience.\n  The problem with the issue of term limits is that it is but another \nquick fix in the growing list of quick fixes which have been advocated \nby those who seek easy answers to our Nation's complex problems. Well, \nthere is an easy answer to every problem. But, unfortunately, those \neasy answers are usually the wrong answers.\n\n  In each of the last six congressional elections, less than 40 percent \nof the voting age population in this country actually voted--less than \n40 percent. Interest in Government, generally, is not very high. I \nbelieve that putting congressional elections on a sort of automatic \npilot would very likely have the unintended effect of further lessening \nthat voter interest--meaning that Members of Congress would, instead of \ndrawing closer to the folks at home, likely become even more distant. \nVoters would, I fear, tend to not even bother to follow the views of a \nMember in his or her second term, since that individual could not run \nfor the same office again anyway.\n  Consider that what we may be doing here, in the case of the second \nterm for a Senator, should this amendment be adopted--which God avert--\nis to create an individual accountable to absolutely no one in his \nsecond term in the Senate. Once he is elected to that second term and \nwalks up there and takes the oath, he can forget about his \nconstituents. He need not be obligated to them. He cannot be elected to \na third term. He or she could vote any way they pleased, cutting a deal \nthat benefits them or rip off the Public Treasury with wild abandon, \nbecause there would be no election or voter scrutiny to worry about. \nWhy even bother to answer the mail in that second term? He will be \nlooking at every lobbyist who walks in the door of the office as a \npotential employer. ``That is the guy I will be working for, perhaps, \nafter this 6-year term is up. I cannot run again for reelection. So he \nis a potential employer. I should align myself with his interests and \nfeather my own nest in that fashion.''\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is the Senator representing that, because a person is \nterm limited he will automatically ignore his constituency? I ask that \nquestion because I spent two terms as Governor of my State. In my \nsecond term as Governor, I was term limited. But the kind of \nconsiderations which the Senator appears to be suggesting are really \nforeign to my mentality. I did not seek to rip off the public treasury, \nand I did not ignore my constituents. I did not view people who came to \nmy office as potential employers. I sought to serve the people of my \nState. I am just not sure what the line of reasoning is. I inquire of \nthe Senator, is this projection something that he thinks is an \ninevitable consequence of term limits?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I heard the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee [Mr. Thompson] say a little earlier today that it was his \nhope that we would avoid dealing in personalities. Of course, I do not \nimply anything of the sort of the distinguished Senator from Missouri. \nHe may read that implication into what I have said. But I do not intend \nto imply that. I wish that he would not infer such. I am simply saying \nthat Members who are elected to the Senate for a second term, under the \npending constitutional amendment, could--and in some instances would, \nhuman nature being what it is--tend to forget their constituents, the \npeople who sent them to this body, and look upon the lobbyist as a \npotential employer. That is plain language, and it should be easy to \nunderstand.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, one of the arguments put forth in favor of term limits \nis that Members of Congress, over a period of years, become corrupt as \nthey acquire power. Well, let us see. Bob Dole has been a Member of \nthis body 28 years. Has he been corrupted? If he has, why does some \nMember not take action to haul him up before the Ethics Committee? I \nhave never heard even a whisper of corruption directed toward Bob Dole. \nBut he has been here 28 years. What about Senator Russell, who was here \n38 years? Not a whisper. Not a whisper of corruption. According to term \nlimit advocates, the longer legislators stay around, the worse the \ncorruption. What about Henry Jackson? He was here 30 years in this \nbody, serving here the day he died. Was he corrupt? What about Everett \nDirksen, a great Republican leader. I served here when Everett Dirksen \nwas the Republican leader. He had been here 18 years when he died in \noffice. Was he corrupt? What about Ted Stevens, who has been here 28 \nyears. Is he corrupt? No. He is an experienced, dedicated legislator. \nHis constituents are fortunate in having a man like Ted Stevens here, \nwith all the experience he brings to bear in their behalf.\n  So to avoid this corruption, they say, limit legislators to a \nspecific number of terms. Well, no one doubts that some individuals \nwill abuse power. They always have since the beginning of the human \nrace. Whether they are in the private sector or in the public sector, \nin the legislative, executive, or judicial branches, the examples of \ncorruption are obvious.\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\n  It is highly specious, however, to jump to the conclusion that \ncorruption is a result of long service in office. Yes, of course, there \nare examples of legislators abusing their power over the years. But \nthere are many more examples of legislators using their office, tenure, \nand experience for the public good, without thought of private reward, \nother than the satisfaction of seeing a job well done.\n\n  If we believe that tenure breeds corruption, why not extend that \ntheory to other occupations? At the very moment when surgeons, \nengineers, teachers, carpenters, electricians, and other specialists \nmaster their jobs and hone their skills, down comes the decision to end \ntheir careers. ``Sorry, you might be good at your job, but you are apt, \nover the years, to abuse the trust we have placed in you and become \ncorrupt. We are replacing you with neophytes and amateurs.''\n  What a transparently arid theory. What a colossal loss of talent. \nWhat a lamentable waste of money.\n  If there had been a constitutional amendment limiting service in the \nother body to six terms, John Quincy Adams would not have served there \n17 years after he had been President of the United States--17 years, \nand he died while serving in that office. Trent Lott would not have \nserved in the House of Representatives for 16 years before coming to \nthis body.\n  Howard Baker would not have served 18 years in this body, had this \namendment been in place.\n  Sam Ervin, one of the great constitutional experts in our Nation's \nhistory, would not have served in this body 20 years and given to those \nof us who served with him, to his constituents, and to the people of \nthe country the benefit of his valuable service.\n  Ed Muskie, who was the father of the Clean Water Act and the father \nof the Clean Air Act, served 21 years in this body. But with this \namendment in place we would not have had an Ed Muskie.\n  Arthur Vandenberg, a great Republican statesman, who was steeped in \nforeign affairs, was able to give to the service of this country 23 \nyears in this body.\n  Look at Pete Domenici from the State of New Mexico. Nobody in this \nbody is his peer on budget matters when it comes to knowledge in depth \nabout the budget. Pete Domenici is a man who is, in my judgment, the \nbest informed on the budget of anyone in this Chamber. With this \namendment in place, he could not have served the 23 years by virtue of \nwhich he has acquired that knowledge.\n  Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri would not have served 30 years in this \nbody.\n  Moses would not have led the Israelites from Egypt through the \nwilderness to bring them to view the Promised Land--he led them for 40 \nyears--if there had been a limit on service. He would have been out a \nlong time ago. Cato would not have served long in the Roman Senate, and \nCicero would not have served long in the Roman Senate.\n  Winston Churchill served the people of England 50 years in \nParliament. I am told that Churchill served 50 years in the Parliament. \nWould the people of Great Britain have had the path of leadership of \nthat great giant Churchill in World War II, who talked about sweat, \nblood, and tears? Not if there had been a term limitation. If there had \nbeen a limitation on terms, they would not have had that leadership, \nnor would the free world have had it.\n  The awful simplicity of the term limits idea is even more obvious \nwhen we think about the practical results. Right now, Members of \nCongress can remain in office so long as their interest in public \noffice continues and they are successful in primary and general \nelections. Their thoughts are devoted to reelection and service in \noffice.\n  Mr. President, do you know how many Senators in this body today have \nserved less than two full 6-year terms? More than half--51 Senators--51 \npercent of the Senators, have served less than two full terms in this \nbody as of this moment. In the other body, almost half of the \nmembership has served less than 4 years--less than two full 2-year \nterms. One-hundred and ten came into the House in 1992, and six more by \nspecial election in between, and 87 freshmen last year.\n  So there are 203--almost half--218 would be half. Almost half of the \nother body has served less than two full terms.\n  Then why do we talk about term limits? The American people already \nhave it within their hands to limit the service, the tenure, of \nMembers. Look at the membership in both of these bodies, and you will \nsee that the scheme which was laid down by the Framers of the American \nConstitution has been working, and working well.\n  It takes little imagination to realize what happens when legislators, \nunder the shadow of term limits, meet with lobbyists and members of the \nprivate sector. No longer are these meetings limited to an exchange of \nideas and information. The agenda widens. Legislators look at lobbyists \nas potential employers after they leave Congress. Lobbyists treat \nlegislators as future members of their work force.\n  What could be more corrupting? Legislators would then be tempted, \nfrom the start, to perform their public jobs with an eye toward private \nemployment. Legislative decisions, trips, speeches, meetings, and other \nactivities would be carried out not by focusing on public policy but on \nprivate ends: the private ends of legislators seeking jobs and the \nprivate ends of people in industry seeking special favors.\n  Talk about corruption? There it is, front and center. Why should \nlegislators be concerned about the well-being of their own \nconstituents? Why not, instead, feather their own nests? Why not \nelevate private interests over the public good?\n  That will be the contribution of this amendment to the Constitution.\n  Madison warned us against amending the Constitution too often. And, \nsince that Constitution was written, there have been 10,869 \nconstitutional amendments proposed--10,869. How many have been adopted \nand ratified? Twenty-seven, and the first 10 of those 27 constituted \nthe American Bill of Rights.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Let me say that I intended to yield the floor soon \nbecause I see other Senators here who are wanting to speak.\n  Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to those who \nhave made their case, and the Senator from West Virginia, as always, \nmakes a compelling case against term limits. It occurs to me that the \nterm ``term limits'' is used to suggest somehow that it will limit \nthose in politics.\n  Is not the case that this proposed constitutional amendment really \nlimits the choices of the American people?\n  As I was thinking about that, there are very few examples, it seems \nto me, in the history of this country where we have changed the \nConstitution in a way that takes power away from the people. \nProhibition was one, for example, and, of course, the country changed \nits mind on that after discovering its failure. But there are only a \ncouple of instances in which proposed changes to the Constitution have \ndiminished the people's opportunities and the people's right of \nexpression.\n  This constitutional amendment, it seems to me, would say to the \npeople in Arizona, or in Minnesota, that you cannot have the service of \nBarry Goldwater, even if you want him, beyond 12 years.\n  You are prevented from selecting Hubert Humphrey to serve beyond 12 \nyears even if you choose to want that to happen. So is not this \nconstitutional amendment one that is one of those unusual circumstances \nproposing to limit the choices the American people can make?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is preeminently correct. It is a very \nundemocratic amendment. It is saying to the people: You are not smart \nenough to make a choice, so we are going to put into automatic pilot \nthe limitation on the service of your Senators or your Members of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. We are not going to leave to the people that choice. That \nchoice will be taken away from them.\n  Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. But is it not true that we often as a people place \nrestrictions on ourselves as a part of our process? Is it not true that \nif 51 percent of\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\nthe people or 60 percent of the people or 75 percent of the people want \nto abridge my speech, they cannot do that because of the Constitution, \nbecause of limitations we have placed on us, and specifically \nlimitations we have placed on Congress, our elected representatives, \nthat prohibit certain things regardless of how appropriate they may be? \nBut it is a deliberate decision of the American people to restrict \nthemselves. It is not that unusual. That is called the Bill of Rights \nand happens in other constitutional amendments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Let me comment on what has been said by the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  People may restrict themselves, but here we are talking about an \namendment that restricts the people from exercising their own good \njudgment as to selecting for additional terms men and women who have \nserved them honestly and well. So we are doing the restricting here \nthrough this amendment. Let us look at what the constitutional Framers \ndid and see how well it has worked. They discussed that restriction and \nrejected it.\n  Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. The point made by the \nSenator from Tennessee is an interesting one. I sat in the room in \nPhiladelphia where they wrote the Constitution, and those who visit \nthat room, called the ``Assembly Room,'' will see George Washington's \nchair still in the front of the room, Ben Franklin, Madison, Mason. You \nwill sit in there and experience the goose bumps, understanding what \nwas done there over a couple of hundred years ago.\n\n  The point I was making was that with respect to constitutional \nchange, it has been very rare that we would change the Constitution in \na way that would provide a limitation on people. The Constitution \nlargely sets out what are the powers of the Government specifically and \nall other powers vest in the people of this country. And so it has been \nonly very rarely that anyone has successfully proposed placing \nlimitations in the Constitution on the rights of the people--the right \nof the people from Tennessee to say to Howard Baker: We would like you \nto serve a third term. This change would say to the people of \nTennessee: You no longer have that right. We are going to take that \nright away from you by amending the Constitution.\n  That is the point I was making. We certainly have the capability of \nchanging the Constitution to do that. The point I was making is that we \nhave done that only rarely because in most cases proposed \nconstitutional changes are done to take rights away from Government and \nsay, no, there is too much encroachment here. This by contrast is to \nsay, no, we will diminish somehow the rights people now have. That is \nthe point.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I appreciate that. The Senator makes a very good point. \nBut I would ask, what do we say to those people who go to the ballot \nbox in their own States on a referendum and vote overwhelmingly to \nrestrict themselves and say we choose for our own good reasons to \nrestrict our Members as, what, 22 States have done? And now the Supreme \nCourt, of course, has said you cannot do that. That is the one of the \nreasons we are here today.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators. Not only is this \namendment undemocratic, but it also weakens the only branch of \nGovernment in which all of the members are elected by the people. Look \nat the executive branch and the judicial branch. Only two members, the \nPresident and the Vice President, are elected by the people, and they \nare not directly elected by the people. They are indirectly elected by \nthe people, who elect the electors, who, in turn, elect the President \nand Vice President. But in this body and in the body across the way, on \nthe other side of the Capitol, all Members are elected by the people. \nSo this amendment would weaken the only branch of Government that is \nwholly elected by the people. It is going to say: You can only elect \nthis person for two terms to the Senate, only three terms in the House.\n  I see in this ill-advised ``solution-for-everything'' called term \nlimits, yet a further weakening of the people's branch. Few Americans \nrealize how severely we have already tipped the checks and balances \ntoward the executive branch. Thousands of executive branch bureaucrats, \nelected by no one remain in their posts for 20 or even 30 years. \nCongress is supposed to be the watchdog of executive branch activity. \nWe are already badly outnumbered. Are we to totally cripple our ability \nto perform our oversight function by stripping ourselves of our one \npossible advantage, the ability of Members to become specialists, and, \nin many instances, experts in certain critical areas? This proposed \nchange will leave Members of Congress mostly dependent upon the advice \nof executive branch bureaucrats, because they will have the only \nreservoir of indepth knowledge around.\n  In a country that tends to lurch and knee-jerk on questions of public \npolicy, intentionally destroying any hope of institutional memory--and \nthis body is lacking in institutional memory, almost totally lacking, \nand it will be more lacking when some of our good Members retire this \nyear, and if this amendment is added to the Constitution it will be \ngone--seems to be a peculiar course to advocate.\n  As a matter of fact, the word ``peculiar'' fairly well sums up my own \npersonal view of the popularity of this term limits idea, for it seems \nto imply that voters are not intelligent enough to decide for \nthemselves when they wish to get rid of any single representative of \nthe Senate or the House and put someone else in that person's place. \nThis approach would make that decision for the voter, a sort of \nunfounded Federal mandate, if you will excuse the play on words. It \nwould say, whether you want this person or not for a third or fourth \nterm, you cannot make that decision. Whether or not a good job is being \ndone for your State is an irrelevancy.\n  Such an approach is arbitrary. Such an approach diminishes the \nquality and depth of our national leadership overall, and is based on \nvery little in the way of concrete evidence to recommend it. It is \ninstead, an idea rooted in popular anger, whipped up by demagogues who \npeddle simplicity for political advantage.\n  This so-called term limits idea is little more than an over-sold \nbromide, purporting to fix everything from budget deficits to corns and \nbunions. In reality, it will do none of the above and should be roundly \nrejected in this body as it has already been in the House of \nRepresentatives. I urge Senators to vote against cloture later today on \nthe resolution proposing this amendment to the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the passage of \nH.R. 3103, the health insurance reform bill, occur at 2:15 today, and \nfurther that immediately following that vote, the Senate resume \nconsideration of Senate Joint Resolution 21, with the vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture occurring at the hour of 3:45, with all debate \nprior to the vote equally divided in the usual form, for debate only.\n  I understand this meets with the Democratic leader's approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGrams and Senator Thurmond be listed as cosponsors of Senate Joint \nResolution 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAbraham be listed as cosponsor of amendments Nos. 3693, 3695, 3697, and \n3699.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  It is really not my purpose today to criticize the 104th Congress. I \nhave\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\nbeen a long-time advocate of congressional reform, and I think a number \nof important reforms have been undertaken and at least debated and \ndiscussed in this Congress. For the first time in my experience in \nCongress, we have actually addressed in a serious manner some of the \nreforms that I think the American people have advocated and that many \nof us who have studied the institution believe are necessary to respond \nto a more effective and efficient means of doing business.\n  We have finally applied those laws and regulations that we impose on \nothers to ourselves. I think that alone will bring about a fairly \ndramatic way in which we analyze and review those laws, because for too \nlong, we have followed the unconscionable practice of saying, ``It is \ngood enough for you but not good enough for us.''\n\n  We have also passed the line-item veto, returning accountability to \nthe budget process, an extraordinary transfer, voluntary transfer of \nauthority and power from the Congress to the executive branch in \nrecognition of our inability to grasp and get ahold of necessary \nspending limitations in order to be responsive to the principle of not \nspending more than we take in or ask from the people who we represent.\n  We have not only paid lip service to a balanced budget, but this \nCongress passed what I think was the most courageous budget in a \ngeneration, which, unfortunately, the President vetoed.\n  Some may argue that this issue of term limits is now less urgent or \neven unnecessary given these changes that we have made. But I argue \nthat this is not the case. We have learned that changes in our laws \nmust be accompanied by changes in the procedures of our institutions if \nchange is to be meaningful and if it is to be lasting. Term limits \nremain, in my opinion, the single most important reform that will \nrestore this institution to a position of public trust, and the trust \nin this institution is near an all-time low.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the most effective method for turning \nthe tide of public cynicism toward Congress to a positive vein is to \nbreak the tie between careerism and power.\n  Prior to the Civil War, it was the common conviction that the surest \nprotection from an imperial Congress--we hear a lot of words about an \nimperial Presidency here--but the best protection from an imperial \nCongress--and we have had imperial Congresses--was a frequent rotation \nof office.\n  Americans expected a Government of citizen legislators then, not \ncareer politicians. Though the principle was voluntary, it worked, \nbecause during the first half of the 19th century, between 40 and 50 \npercent of the Congress left office in every election. The theory is \nsimple: Public servants will pass better laws, or perhaps no laws at \nall, when they expect to go home and live under the product of their \nwork.\n  One delegate to the American Constitutional Convention warned, ``By \nremaining in the seal of Government, they would acquire the habits of \nthe place, which might differ from those of their constituents.''\n  Mr. President, I am certainly not opposed to professionalism, but \nlimits on a career would make the normal time-consuming, wasted \nbusiness of reelection less urgent, because no amount of effort would \nguarantee job security. This would leave more time to the serious work \nof Congress, and strengthen the trust of this institution in the minds \nof the citizenry.\n\n  In addition, term limits, by forcing representatives to have one foot \nin the real world, might help restore their ability to empathize and \ntheir capacity for outrage.\n  A story about a former Senator George McGovern, I think, is \ninstructive here. After retiring from public life, he opened an inn in \nConnecticut, a lifetime dream of his. After covering startup costs, \nmeeting payroll, complying with regulations, and the general ups and \ndowns in the free market, the inn, unfortunately, went belly up.\n  His comment on these events is instructive, and I quote him:\n\n       I wish someone had told me about the problems of running a \n     business. I have to pay taxes, meet payroll. I wish I had a \n     better sense of what it took to do that while I was in \n     Washington.\n\n  And, therefore, we are back to the concept of citizen legislator. \nThose who have had one foot in the real world, those who have \nexperienced the problems of meeting a payroll, running a business, \nperforming in a profession, being apart from the governmental process, \nhave learned lessons that are invaluable when they give to public \nservice and bring that experience with them.\n  Term limits serve two very important purposes: They rotate \npoliticians back into the private sector to labor under the results of \ntheir work, and they create more opportunity for people of broad \nexperience to come to Washington with the practical knowledge and \ninnovative ideas in the private sector, assuring that our laws pass the \nreality check. We need public servants connected to their community by \nexperience, not just by sympathy.\n  Do we risk losing the contributions of some very fine people? Without \nquestion, we do. However, as John Taylor said in 1814: ``More talent is \nlost on long contrivances in office than by a system of rotation.''\n  The hard fact is that our greatest problem is not the lack of \ntalented men and women waiting in the ranks to take the place of those \nwho leave; rather, it remains a surplus of entrenched power.\n  Some have argued that term limits would vest too much power with \ncongressional staff, and that is hardly true either. The average length \nof service for House staff is 5 years; for Senate staff, 5.7 years. \nThis is hardly a problem. Further, when you have new Representatives \nand Senators who come to office, they generally bring their own people \nwith them, rather than inherit an entrenched staff. Term limits would \nmore likely limit the tenure of powerful staffers who would lose their \nlong-time patrons.\n\n  Others argue that term limits would restrict the public's choice. The \nSenator from North Dakota just argued that a few moments ago. I think \njust the opposite is true. By denying the American people the \nopportunity through their States and their State legislatures to ratify \nunder the constitutional process what this Congress has done is a \nlimitation on the power of people, not as the Senator from North Dakota \nsaid, term limits being a limitation.\n  It is clearly a more democratic process to give the people the right \nto make this decision as to their elected representatives through a \nconstitutional ratification process than for 100 people to stand here \narrogantly and say, ``We're not going to give the people those choices. \nWe're going to deny them that opportunity. And even though they \nexercise those powers through their State legislatures and impose those \nrestrictions on us, we're going to draw an iron curtain across that \nprocess and say, `No, you cannot reach into the Federal level to impose \nthat.' ''\n  So I think it is just the opposite of what the Senator from North \nDakota has said. Well over three-quarters of the American people have \nchosen term limits. Opinion polls show that constantly. Aside from the \nbalanced budget amendment, which has always been denied to the American \npeople, there is no other issue that has so much popular support.\n  Only in Washington could an idea ensuring a rotation from office \ncreating entirely new choices for office be seen as a limitation on the \nAmerican people. It certainly is not seen that way by the people \noutside of Washington. It is an example, Mr. President, of the newspeak \nthat has produced so much cynicism on the part of the American people \ntoward their Government.\n  This measure may not pass the Senate. As the past year has \ndemonstrated, even with the revolutionary changes of the last election, \nthe system continues to be weighted against change.\n  We are now faced with a procedural process here where we need to \nobtain the 60 votes in order to just bring this issue to debate and to \na vote. The vote that will be taken this afternoon at 3:45 is not a \ndirect vote on the measure, it is simply a vote on whether or not we \nwill go forward to examine the legislation, to offer amendments, to \nmodify it, and then to bring it to a final vote, which appears we may \nnot get to that point.\n  We will, however, I believe, ultimately prevail in this battle. The \nquestion comes down to individuals. Will a candidate for Congress \ncommit to limited terms even if it is not the law?\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\n Will those of us in the Congress make the commitment to limited terms \neven though it is not in the law?\n  Mr. President, one of the first bills that I introduced in the \nCongress when I was a Member of the House of Representatives was a term \nlimits bill, a limitation of 12 years of service in the House, no more \nthan six 2-year terms, and 12 years in the Senate, no more than two 6-\nyear terms. I made an exemption in that legislation for those who \nserved partial terms, appointed because of a death of a sitting Member \nor the resignation of a sitting Member. I thought it was fair for them \nto be able to fill out that term and then have the full term limit \napply. I never realized that that would apply to me. A serendipitous \nact. I would call it an act of providence. I received an appointment to \nthe Senate to fill the unexpired term of the recently resigned Senator \nfrom Indiana, Senator Quayle, who then became Vice President. I \nfulfilled that unexpired term.\n  At the time I pledged to the people of Indiana that I was a strong \nadvocate of term limits and felt, whether or not it was the law of the \nland, I should abide by it. And I pledged to the people of Indiana that \nI would not serve more than two full terms in the U.S. Senate. I hold \nto that pledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute to conclude \nmy statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as I said, this is a procedural bill. Even \nthough this bill will not completely conform to my own legislation \nregarding unexpired terms, I do believe that the debate should go \nforward. If changes are necessary, amendments obviously can be offered. \nThis is too important an issue, too vital a reform to die in a \nprocedural vote here today. The American people deserve full \nconsideration, and only a vote of 60 Senators to invoke cloture will \nallow that full consideration to take place.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join with me in voting for cloture. \nHopefully we can garner 60 votes so that we can, in this important \ndebate, fulfill the wishes of more than 80 percent of the American \npeople, that we address this fairly, and give them a fair opportunity \nto weigh in, as I think they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Thompson and Senator Ashcroft for \ntheir diligent efforts in this and the additional time they have \nyielded me, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank Senator Thompson and Senator Ashcroft for taking the \nlead on this very important measure.\n  Mr. President, our Founding Fathers crafted a Constitution that was \nbuilt around balance. The checks and balances have made this \nConstitution endure for over 200 years. Part of the balance was that \nthe Federal Government would be limited, that Federal Government would \nhave very narrow responsibilities. It would be strong in its \nresponsibilities, but nevertheless the social programs, the education, \nthe time-consuming, more detailed areas of responsibility were clearly \nleft to the States and to the people.\n  So, Mr. President, our Founding Fathers intended for us to have a \nsmall Federal Government, made by citizen legislators, citizen \nlegislators who would come to Washington to do the business of the \nFederal Government, which was limited, and go home and have \nprofessions. The people that wrote the Constitution were not full-time \nwriters of the Constitution. The Congresses in the early days were not \nfull-time Congresses. They were made up of citizens who had vocations, \nwho understood what the problems of the States were, who came together \non a limited basis to correct those problems.\n  Mr. President, we have gotten out of kilter. The balance is no longer \nthere because we have a full-time Congress, because we have people who \nhave been here as a career for 20, 25, 30 years, some of whom are \nwonderful people.\n  This is not a personal attack in any way on those people. They are \ngood people. I think every Member of this Congress is sincere about \nwhat he or she is trying to do. But, nevertheless, because it is career \npoliticians who are making the laws, our Government has grown and \ngrown, and the Federal Government is out of control. Part of the reason \nis because we have a Congress that is out of touch with the real world, \nwith the small businessperson that is trying to make it, trying to make \nends meet with all of the regulations and the taxes and the litigation \nthat is complicating our lives today.\n\n  To bring back the balance, Mr. President, we need term limits because \nwe need citizen legislators. We need small businesspeople who have \nlived with the regulations and the taxes that keep them from growing \nand creating the new jobs that will really make this economy strong. We \nneed the working people of this country who know what it is like to go \ninto a workplace and not be sure if they can walk inside the line on \nthe factory floor or outside the line on the factory floor.\n  Mr. President, we need citizen legislators because we need people who \nhave experienced how hard it is to deal with the morass of Federal \nregulations, with the fines that come from minor infractions. Sometimes \nour small businesspeople think that Government does not want them to \nsucceed. They forget, people in Government, that the American dream is \nthat you can work hard and do better. The Federal Government should not \nbe there to tamp you down. It should be there to build you up, to let \nmore people have access to the American dream. If we can have term \nlimitations, Mr. President, we can get the balance back in our \nGovernment structure because we will have people who have come from the \nreal world and who are going back to the real world.\n  Mr. President, our seniority system is a waiting game. The average \nnumber of years of a Senate committee chairman is about 22; a House \ncommittee chairman is about 25. So when we talk about all this free \naccess that the voters have to vote somebody out of office, we are \ntalking about giving up this seniority system, and it does become a \ndilemma because even if someone is out of touch, they are powerful. \nThey are able to produce for their districts.\n  So it is a dilemma for someone going in the voting booth to say, \n``I'm going to oust someone who has been there 25 years, who is high in \nthe seniority system, who is a committee chairman,'' or whatever. It is \nvery difficult. It happens when there is a real movement like happened \nin 1994. The people did rise above that seniority system. But it is \nvery rare, Mr. President.\n  My distinguished colleague from West Virginia, who I admire greatly, \ntalked about Winston Churchill serving in Parliament for 50 years. Yes, \nbut back then and even to an extent now, Parliament was part time, \nexcept in the British system, of course. Members of Parliament are also \nthe Cabinet officers, if they are in the front bench, but if they are \nback benchers, they do something else. Winston Churchill at the time he \nwas a back bencher wrote, gave speeches. That was his vocation. Cicero, \nthe Roman Senator, also wrote a little bit. I think many of us remember \nmany of the things that he wrote.\n  We have had citizen legislators in our best Senates and Congresses \nthrough the ages. That is because it works best when the people who are \ntrying to make this country what we want it to be are the people who \ndecide to give a little time for public service and then go back out \nand live in the real world of business and commerce, working people \nthat understand best what it takes to get this country going in the \nright direction. They are the people that have the values. They are the \nSunday school teachers. They are the people that go to PTA meetings, \nthat work with their children in their schools. They give back to their \ncommunities.\n\n  Those are the kind of people that we want in Congress. That is why we \nare trying to have term limitations, so that we can bring back the \nconcept of a citizen legislator; so that we can meet a few months every \nyear, go home and be in a real vocation, so that we will not have new \nlaws with new regulations and new things that bureaucrats can dream up \nto do to tamp down the spirit of entrepreneurship that built this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\n  That is why we are fighting so hard today. It is why we have to have \na constitutional amendment, because we cannot do it by State law, \nbecause States have tried and the Supreme Court said last year that \nwill not work. You have to amend the Constitution. This was not Senator \nThompson's first choice. He would love to have gotten 51 votes because \nwe could pass it with 51 votes, but we will probably not be able to \nhave the two-thirds vote required to amend the Constitution. That is \nwhy it is so important for the people of this country to understand \nthat the fight is going to continue.\n  We will try to get cloture today. If we do not get cloture, I have a \nbill I have introduced that I will try to put on some other measure \ncoming down. It is going to be a national referendum on this issue. Let \nthe people speak. Let the Congress hear. Let people ask their Member of \nCongress that is running for reelection, or their Senator that is \nrunning for reelection how they feel on this issue, so that they get \ncommitted.\n  We are going to have to keep working at it. I hope I can get a \nnational referendum, if we do not get cloture today, to do what we \nought to do. That is, amend the Constitution. This is a basic tenet of \nthe balance of powers in our Government. A citizen legislator is a \nbasic part of the balance that is necessary to keep the Federal \nGovernment from getting so big and overblown that they start \nencroaching on States rights. The government that is closest to the \npeople at the State level--this is part of the balance. It is part of \nreform that is necessary to get this country back on track, so that \nmore people can realize the American dream, so that the immigrants who \ncome to our country, because it is the beacon of opportunity anywhere \nin the world, they come to this country for the American dream, which \nis if you work hard and you start a small business you can keep the \nfruits of your labor. In America, success that is gotten from someone \nby the sweat of their brow or by their hands or by their brains--\nworking, writing--we want those people to succeed. We do not look down \non success. We want everyone to have that opportunity.\n\n  If we are going to keep the American dream, Mr. President, it is \ngoing to be with people who are understanding that the Federal \nGovernment is limited and those people are going to be citizen \nlegislators, not career politicians.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Thompson and Senator Ashcroft \nfor bringing this to us. This is the first step in a very long march, \nMr. President. This is not going to end today, but we are going to be \nthere with the American people to fight for what we know will bring \nback the values and the dreams and the opportunity of this country \nthrough citizen legislators that will work with us to do it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if I could indulge you for just a moment \nthis morning, I would like to incorporate you in my discussion on term \nlimits, because I want to tell a little story to my colleagues who are \nhere and for the record.\n  A good number of years ago I engaged in a conversation with the \nformer Senator from Wyoming, Malcolm Wallop, who you followed to the \nSenate. We were talking about the advantage of freshmen, new people, \ncoming to the U.S. Congress. I alluded at that time that you can always \ntell the difference between a freshman and a more senior Member by this \nsimple adage: Freshmen were always going around asking why Government \ndid certain things, and more senior Members were going around saying \n``because.''\n  In other words, what has often happened as a result of seniority and \nlongevity of service in the U.S. Senate or the U.S. Congress in general \nis that Members of those bodies become advocates of Government, \ndefenders of Government, instead of responsible citizen critics of \ntheir Government.\n  One of the things that I know the chairman, the President, and I have \ntried to do, and I mean the President of the Senate, the presiding \nChair of the Senate and I have tried to do is be constant critics of \nGovernment, critics of Government.\n  Oftentimes we find out that the longer Members are here, while they \nmay serve well, they become the advocates of an ever-increasing \nGovernment. It was under that belief in my years of service, while I \nthink I remain a responsible critic, that I have grown to support term \nlimits, because I believe they are a rejuvenator of the system. It \ncreates, once again, the process that our Founding Fathers had \nintended. That was the citizen legislator coming to this Congress to \ndirect the affairs of Government, not to be the advocate but to be the \nfriendly critic.\n\n  Now that both the House and the Senate are under the control of a \nRepublican Congress, we are going to have votes on this issue. We are \ngoing to be able to stand up and express our wishes, hopefully \nreflecting the will of the American people, that has been spoken to by \nthe Senator from Tennessee, who has done such a fine job of bringing \nthis issue to the floor, and the Senator from Missouri, that 77-plus \npercent of the American people believe that term limits are a \nresponsible way of governing, and that those of us who seek to serve in \npublic life at this level be limited to a certain number of years in \nour public service, and in doing so, hopefully, retaining those \nconcerns or those issues that brought us to this Congress.\n  It is because of a Republican-controlled Congress that we will have \nthe privilege to vote today on this important issue. Hopefully, we can \ntake this issue to the American people. It is significantly important. \nWe are asking the American people to change the way their Government \nhas operated for well over 200 years.\n  That is why I am pleased that we are moving to the constitutional \namendment approach. Yes, the courts have said we must strike uniformity \nin the terms of Federal officers, and that is what we all are who serve \nin this body, and that all States must be served and represented \nequally. Beyond that court edict and the responsibility that is being \ntaken here today in the debating of and the voting on this \nconstitutional amendment, remember our civics lesson, to understand \nthat the Congress can only propose an amendment. That in proposing it, \nwhat we are really doing is sending it out to all 50 States for what \nwill be a fundamentally important national debate on term limits.\n  Every State legislator, if this passes the Congress, will engage in a \ndebate at the State level on the validity of term limits and the \nresponsibility of those limits and how they ought to be carried out \nunder the edicts of this constitutional amendment. That is what \nrepresentative Government is all about. That is why I recognize these \ntwo Senators for the work they have put in in the leadership of this \nissue.\n  While I have been a strong and outspoken supporter of term limits, we \nhave not had the opportunity to vote on them in previous years. Now we \nare guaranteed that opportunity. I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues in support of this amendment.\n  Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were ardent supporters of term \nlimits. Maybe they saw something that some of our other Founding \nFathers did not see. Maybe they recognized there could be a time when \nGovernment would grow to a point that those who served in it would \nultimately become individuals who would seek a lifetime of service \nhere.\n  While there are a tremendous number of dedicated Members of the U.S. \nHouse and the U.S. Senate who have served well beyond the limits that \nare proposed within this amendment, I believe the concept of term \nlimits, as I have spoken to, serve as a phenomenally rejuvenating \nfactor in what we believe to be the founding premises of this country, \nthat States would not have lost as much control as they have lost over \nthe last 200 years if we had term limits. Citizens who had served and \nwould serve in Congress would find themselves much more subject to the \nlaws they passed because they would not spend a lifetime here, a \nlifetime in an environment that was relatively sheltered, relatively \nprotected from the citizen on the street of America, who had to live \nunder the laws that the Congress had passed.\n\n  For 200-plus years, Congress has been exempt from all of those laws. \nIt is only in the last few years, under phenomenal pressure from the \ncitizens, that we are finally saying we are not special and we are not \nsomething different. Thank goodness we are saying\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\nthat. I have been pleased to support the fact that we now subject our \noffices to the same labor laws that the average employer must subject \nhis work force to and the average worker must be subjected to.\n  Why should we be different? Why should we be special? We should not \nbe. But it has been under a protected environment of continual service \nthat that kind of situation existed. It is my guess that if term limits \nhad been imposed some time ago, that would not have been allowed to \nhappen. The Congress would not have become the special, unique haven \nthat it was for so many years, while at that time it might have been \nobserved as the right thing to do. In an America of today that wants to \nsee a limited Government, to see a great deal more authority returned \nto the States, this amendment, and our debate on this amendment, fits \nthat approach in a most important way.\n  I look forward to an opportunity to continue to work on this, and I \nhope we can get the vote this afternoon. But as the Senator from \nTennessee admonished us when the debate began, this is an issue that \nwill not go away. If we are not successful this time, I am confident we \nwill be back, and I will be a supporter of that effort. If that cannot \noccur, you heard the Senator from Texas talking about the allowance of \na national referendum that causes this debate and a vote of the people \nof this country on this type of an issue.\n  So while a Senator from Wyoming chose, a few years ago, to limit his \nterms, which gave opportunity for the Presiding Officer to be a new \nface in the U.S. Senate, bringing new debate and new ideas, I believe \nthis is an issue that we ought to respond to in a representative way to \nthe citizens of our country, who have spoken so clearly on it.\n  While the issue of rotation in office--term limits--for elected \nFederal officials has been around as long as our country itself, this \ncurrent Congress will make history on the issue of term limits.\n  In prior Congresses, neither the House nor the Senate had voted on a \ncongressional term limits amendment, despite the efforts of myself and \nothers.\n  Finally those efforts have paid off. This Republican Congress has \nkept its promises, and is trying to pass a term limits constitutional \namendment.\n  It is the first U.S. Congress ever which the House and the Senate \nwill both have floor debates and recorded votes of all the Members on a \nconstitutional amendment to limit congressional terms.\n  The term limits constitutional amendment that I am an original \ncosponsor of will impose a uniform, national term limit of 12 years in \nthe House and 12 years in the Senate.\n  It is critical that if we impose term limit, we do it across the \nboard, State by State. No State should be singled out to be \ndisadvantaged by the loss of seniority in Congress.\n  My support of this grew out of my observation of how this business on \nCapitol Hill works--or does not work.\n  Why do I feel so strongly that congressional term limits are an \nimportant and fundamental step in restoring our Nation's political \nhealth?\n  The Governors of 40 States, including my State of Idaho, are subject \nto term limits. Why not Congress?\n  The State legislatures of 21 States, including Idaho, are subject to \nterm limits. Why not Congress?\n  Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were two ardent supporters of \nterm limits.\n  The issue of term limits for Members of Congress is favored by 77 \npercent of the American people, according to a national poll conducted \nin January.\n  Support for term limits never falls below 64 percent in any \ndemographic group; white, black, Hispanic, male, female, young, old, \nRepublican, Democrat, Independent, or geographic residence.\n  Term limits received more votes in the 14 States where it appeared on \nthe ballot in 1992 than Ross Perot received in all 50 States in the \n1992 Presidential election.\n  According to studies conducted by the National Taxpayers Union, the \nshorter the tenure of a Member of Congress, the more likely that Member \nof Congress is to vote against tax and spending increases for the \nFederal Government.\n  The bottom line is this: if we want to change the mindset in \nWashington, DC, we must change the players.\n  A limited central government and limited tenure in that government \nare essential elements on which our form of government is based.\n  We must embrace the principles articulated by the Founders of our \ncountry and supported today by an overwhelming number of American \npeople.\n  To do otherwise is to forget our roots and responsibilities as \nrepresentatives of the voters. We are not free agents doing whatever we \nwant in Washington.\n  When I joined in the battle for term limits years ago, I knew it \nwould not be a quick, easy process. My fight for a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution has showed me that.\n  But, like the balanced budget amendment, we must let the people of \nour country decide whether they wish to ratify the term limits \namendment. If Congress passes the term limits amendment, it must still \nbe ratified by 38 States.\n  That is my goal here today: to pass this legislation so that the \npeople of Idaho and everywhere else will be able to let their State \nlegislatures know whether or not to support this term limits amendment.\n  Let the people decide, not us. I will be proud to cast my vote in \nfavor of term limits on behalf of the people of the great State of \nIdaho.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senate has before it today an issue \nthat goes to the heart of our democratic system of government. Limiting \ncongressional terms has been one of the most consistently visible \nissues in our Nation's political arena for the past 6 years. In \naddition to being a significant plank of congressional campaigns, \nseveral States have voted to limit the terms of those elected to \nFederal offices. The Supreme Court ruled last year in the Thornton case \nthat statutory efforts by Congress or individual States to impose term \nlimits on Federal officials are unconstitutional.\n  In lieu of this recent action by the Supreme Court, the only \nremaining option is a constitutional amendment limiting the number of \nterms a Member of Congress may serve. The Senate has before it and will \nsoon vote on such a measure. I oppose amending the Constitution to \nlimit the number of terms a Member of Congress may serve and will vote \nagainst this resolution. I will, however, vote in favor of cloture on \nthis resolution so that debate on this important issue can be brought \nto a timely conclusion.\n  It should be recognized that, despite their recent visibility, \nproposals to limit congressional terms are not a new phenomenon. This \nis a debate that has been evolving for many years. Our Founding Fathers \nconsidered including term limits in the Constitution. They grappled \nwith the question and rejected the idea, preferring to allow such \nauthority to be exercised by the citizenry at the ballot box.\n  At the beginning of my career in the U.S. Senate, I introduced \nlegislation to restrict Senators to no more than two terms. When this \nmeasure did not pass and my own second term came to an end, I decided I \ncould be more effective for the people of Oregon by continuing my \nservice in the Senate. My constituents agreed with me and, at the \nballot box, chose to continue my term of service in this body.\n  During the years of debate over term limits, many have argued the \nonly way to remove entrenched incumbents from Congress is to override \nthe will of the voters by placing a mandatory limit on the number of \nterms a member may serve. However, the American voters currently have \nthe authority to limit the terms of any member of Congress during each \nelection. Voters in the 1992 election gave 110 new individuals the \nopportunity to serve in the House. In 1994 86 new Members were elected \nto the House of Representatives and 11 to the Senate. The 1996 cycle, \nat least for the Senate, has already achieved the distinction of having \nthe most retirements of any cycle in this century. An analysis of our \nrecent elections shows that over half of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and nearly a third of the Members of the Senate have \nbeen elected since 1990.\n  Mr. President, term limits are an important issue worthy of debate, \nbut\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nthey are not a panacea for reforming Congress or improving the public's \nperception of this institution. In fact, I believe they have the \npotential to cause significant damage by depriving voters and this \ninstitution of the best qualified candidates. Congressional turnover is \nsomething best left in the hands of the local voters.\n  The 1994 elections not only brought numerous new Members to Congress, \nbut they also gave the Republican Party control of both Houses for the \nfirst time in over 40 years. This drastic change was accomplished by \nthe American people exercising their constitutional right to vote for \nthe candidate of their choice. It was not accomplished by imposing a \nstructural change upon the electoral process so thoughtfully conceived \nby the Framers of the Constitution.\n  As the Nation deliberates the issue of term limits, I would encourage \nproponents of limitation to consider each candidate individually. The \ndifficulty in setting arbitrary limits is, simply, that they are \narbitrary. Citizens should not be denied the service of the effective, \nelected representative of their choice merely because that person had \nalready served them well.\n  Candidates should not be judged by a constitutional provision that \nlooks only at the length of their prior service. Rather, candidates \nshould be judged by their constituents, who invariably look at the \nquality of the service provided in past terms and the likelihood of \nsatisfactory representation over the next time-limited term.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senate Joint \nResolution 21, which provides for a constitutional amendment to limit \ncongressional terms.\n  Nearly 1 year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that State-imposed \nterm limits on Federal legislators are unconstitutional. The only way \nto institute such limits is, therefore, through a U.S. constitutional \namendment such as that embodied in Senate Joint Resolution 21. Altering \nour cherished Constitution in such a way would be a huge mistake in my \nopinion.\n  The idea of term limits for Members of Congress addresses the general \ndisapproval voters seem to consistently have for Congress as an \ninstitution. However, they do not address the issue of losing good, \nproductive leaders through arbitrary limits on their time of service. \nMany believe the experience gained from serving in Congress is a \nvaluable resource for serving effectively as a legislator and as a \nquestioner in an oversight role over agencies and departments of the \nexecutive branch of the Federal Government. This experience can only be \ngained over a period of years. Even those who support term limits \nacknowledge that the many years of service to our Nation by many long-\ntime Members of Congress have made a meaningful difference in countless \nlives.\n  In this body, leaders such as Senator Byrd, Senator Dole, Senator \nBiden, Senator Stevens, Senator Bumpers, Senator Leahy, Senator \nSimpson, Senator Hollings, Senator Nunn, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nKassebaum, and Senator Hatfield, to name only a few, would not be here \nif term limits were in effect today. This is not a partisan issue; term \nlimits would deny the Nation the service of outstanding leaders on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Term limits are an unwarranted restraint on democracy. I think the \nlimit on Presidential terms passed in the wake of Franklin Roosevelt's \nlong tenure in the Oval Office was a mistake. The most fundamental and \nbasic right citizens of this country have is the right to vote for the \ncandidates of their choice. This right should not be abridged just \nbecause some Government leaders are reelected with regularity and are \nlabeled as being bad because of that. If they are reelected, common \nsense would suggest that the voters are generally happy with the job he \nor she is doing. If not, they can vote for the opposing candidate. They \nalready have the right to limit the term of any officeholder they wish \nby voting.\n  In effect, term limits suggest that the ultimate judges in the \npolitical arena, the voters, are not competent to make decisions after \na public servant has served for a few years. Voters should view term \nlimits as a slap in the face that restricts their discretion and their \nright to be represented by those whom they so choose.\n  If term limits are instituted, what we will see is a Congress run by \na staff of unelected bureaucrats with no limits on the time they can \nwork in the legislative branch. Members will increasingly come to \ndepend on staff as the institutional memory and precedent that guide \nmuch of the work here are eliminated. Term limits will also shift more \npower to the executive branch and its legions of unelected and \nunaccountable careerists.\n  Simply put, there is no reason to deny voters the right to elect an \nindividual to Congress simply because of that person's previous \nservice. In their wisdom, the Founders correctly chose not to \nincorporate term limits in the Constitution for Members of Congress or \nthe President. Alexander Hamilton called them ``ill-founded,'' \n``pernicious,'' and ``a diminution of the inducements to good \nbehavior.'' The Constitution already provides a check on the power of \nMembers of Congress by requiring that each Member of the House and one-\nthird of the Members of the Senate be presented for reelection every 2 \nyears.\n  The clamoring for term limits is a byproduct of the bumper sticker \nadmonition to just ``throw the bums out!'' It is a populist slogan that \nin no way addresses the issue of making Congress more effective. This \nspecious argument is based on the notion that anyone who has been in \noffice for any length of time is automatically corrupt and incapable of \nbeing responsive to the views of their constituents. But, how \nresponsive will they be when they do not have to face the voters for \nreelection? They will be free to simply ignore the wishes of the \npeople.\n  The process of learning issues and policy takes time. Voters might \nprefer a long-distance runner over the sprinter, a representative for \nthe long haul, not just for the short term. Voters should have the \noption of electing a person who will work in the long-run for the best \ninterests of the district or State they represent and the Nation which \nthey serve. Voters can make up their own minds about the effectiveness \nand worthiness of a candidate regardless of the length of service. \nThere is no more effective or dependable means for applying term limits \nthan election day, the second Tuesday of November every 2 years. All \nAmericans should think carefully before this precious freedom is \nabridged by this amendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator from North Carolina wish to be \nrecognized?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield the Senator from North Carolina 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am delighted and proud to join with \nSenator Thompson and cosponsor Senate Joint Resolution 21, which would \nprovide for national term limits for 12 years for any Member of the \nU.S. House of Representatives or Senate.\n  In the past, Congress has avoided taking a vote on term limits. We \nhave tried to have it both ways--to tell the people at home that we \nsupport term limits, but we have simply bottled it up in Washington.\n  Under Senator Dole's leadership, with the support of many others, I \nwant to thank them for bringing this resolution to the Senate floor. It \nwill be the first-ever recorded vote, and it will be the right move. \nRegardless of the outcome of the vote, I think it is a historic moment \nthat we will all be proud to have participated in.\n  There are many reasons for limiting the terms of all Members of \nCongress. First, the Founding Fathers, led by James Madison, intended \nthat service in Congress would be that--a service, not a permanent job. \nWe would not have so many burdensome, expensive, and often useless \nrules and regulations if we had more people in the Congress who had \nspent some time in the workplace in the private sector.\n  The President of the United States has term limits, and the country \nis better off for it. So why should not the Congress have term limits? \nThe custom of voluntary rotation in office was once followed by the \nPresident and Congress alike. But it became necessary to pass a \nconstitutional amendment to restore\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\nthe two-term limit on the Presidency, and it certainly is clear now \nthat we need to do the same thing with the House and Senate to limit \nthe tenure.\n  A second reason for term limits is that a governing elite is more \nlikely to decide that what the citizens earn through their work belongs \nto the Government and not to the people that earned it. That is one of \nthe dismal results of career bureaucrats in the National Capital. They \nare so caught up in government and its activities that they have lost \nsight of the fact that our system was founded on the spirit of free \nenterprise and individual rights.\n\n  Third, the people of North Carolina and the rest of America \noverwhelmingly support term limits. One national poll of registered \nvoters in January 1996 found that 77 percent of the American people \nfavor term limits, and only 17 percent oppose them. Further, 62 percent \nof the American people say they wanted their Congressmen and Senators \nto vote ``yes'' on a constitutional amendment for term limits that \nprovides a 12-year limit.\n  Will term limits pass the Senate this time? Maybe not. I certainly \nhope so. As we all know, it is difficult to get a two-thirds vote, \nwhich will be necessary to adopt this. The Constitution was designed \nfor it to be difficult to amend it. So for term limit supporters, we \nknow that the upcoming vote is just the beginning of our efforts and \nnot the end. We will stay with it until we do get it passed.\n  By committing ourselves to supporting term limits for as long as it \ntakes to get the job done, we are committing ourselves to making the \nnational Congress the model of citizen representation it was intended \nto be, and restoring our Federal Government to its proper role, and \nlimited role, in our national life.\n  I strongly support this resolution and am delighted to be a cosponsor \non it. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator has 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3805-6", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3817-S3826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 3103, the health insurance reform bill, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3103) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to improve portability and continuation of health \n     insurance coverage in the group and individual markets, to \n     combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and health \n     care delivery, to promote the use of medical savings \n     accounts, to improve access to long-term-care services and \n     coverage, to simplify the administration of health insurance, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, to clarify, the term limits debate will \nresume again immediately after the health care vote, is that correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator it correct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. We will have a vote on term limits at approximately \n3:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Health \nInsurance Reform Act of 1995 and want to commend my colleagues, Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Kennedy, for their excellent work on this \nimportant subject. As a cosponsor of this bill, I believe that \nenactment of legislation improving health insurance coverage is long \noverdue. We owe it to the American people to pass this bill.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act represents the type of incremental \nhealth care reform which I have long supported. It targets the problems \nwith our current health care system while leaving in place a system \nthat works well for most Americans.\n  Mr. President, in June 1993, I had my own health problem when a \nmagnetic resonance imaging machine discovered an intercranial lesion in \nmy head. I was the beneficiary of the greatest health care delivery \nsystem in the world--the American health care system. That experience \nmade me ever more aware, knowledgeable of, and sensitive to the subject \nthan I had been in the past.\n  There are some who believed health care reform was dead and declared \nas much in the fall of 1994 when Congress failed to enact comprehensive \nhealth care reform legislation. I am hopeful that they will be proven \nwrong by the enactment of this bill. President Clinton was in error \nwhen he proposed health care by Government mandate and massive \nbureaucracy. But anyone who read the repudiation of the Clinton bill as \nan excuse to do nothing is equally in error. We still have a great need \nto correct the problems in our health care system for the 15.2 percent \nor 39.7 million Americans, for whom the system does not work. In my own \nState of Pennsylvania, there is even a greater need, because the number \nof uninsured under the age of 65 has grown from 10.8 percent to 13.4 \npercent of the population while we in Congress have done little but \ndebate the correct approach to take concerning health reform. It is \nhigh time that Congress takes a real step forward in health care \nreform, without big government and without turning the best health care \nsystem in the world on its head.\n  To be sure, health care reform remains a very complex issue for \nCongress to address. But it is not so complex that we cannot act on a \nbipartisan basis. This is something we should have done years ago. \nSixty-five Democrats and Republicans have agreed to cosponsor a bill \ncontaining policy matters we all agree on, such as the need to limit \nexclusions for preexisting conditions and make health insurance more \nportable for workers changing jobs. Of course, more can and should be \ndone. But this is what we can agree on now. We will be helping a great \nmany people who desperately need these critical changes in law by \nacting now.\n  By way of background, I would note that the legislation before the \nSenate today, S. 1028, contains provisions very similar to those \ncontained in title I of my own health care reform bill, the Health \nAssurance Act of 1995,--S. 18--which I introduced on January 4, 1995. I \nhave heard for years from constituents, friends, and family on how \nimportant it is that we pass basic insurance market reforms to protect \nthose who are not in perfect health but have some preexisting medical \ncondition. We all are aware of people who are afraid to leave their \njobs because they have a heart condition or another medical condition \nand therefore would be unable to obtain insurance for this problem \noutside of their present employer. Under the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, a \nperson can be assured that no preexisting condition exclusion can ever \nlast more than 12 months for conditions discovered in the 6 months \nprior to coverage. Equally important, the bill enables those workers \nthat were covered under a group health insurance plan to reduce this \n12-month preexisting condition exclusion for each month they were \ncovered by a plan. So if an employee with a medical problem is covered \nby a plan under her current job for more than 12 months, if she takes a \njob elsewhere, she will be covered under the plan of the new employer.\n\n  S. 1028 also contains language similar to my legislation which \nextends the COBRA health benefits options in a limited manner. S. 1028 \nspecifically extends this option when a former employee or family \nmember becomes disabled during the initial coverage period, and allows \nnewborns and adopted children to be covered immediately under a \nparent's COBRA policy. Also, S. 1028 provides individuals access to \naffordable insurance through purchasing groups, which was also allowed \nunder S. 18. This and the other elements of S. 1028 will give the 228 \nmillion workers who now have insurance the security of knowing that \nhealth coverage options exist if they change jobs, or become unemployed \nfor a limited period of time.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, I have been advocating \nincremental health care reform in one form or another throughout my 15 \nyears in the Senate, and have introduced and cosponsored numerous bills \nconcerning health care in our country since 1983. In my first term, I \nsponsored the Health Care Cost Containment Act of 1983, S. 2051, which \nwould have granted a limited antitrust exemption to health insurers, \npermitting them to engage in certain activities aimed at curtailing \nthen escalating health-care\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\ncosts. In 1985, I introduced the Community Based Disease Prevention and \nHealth Promotion Projects Act of 1985, S. 1873, directed at reducing \nthe human tragedy of low birthweight babies and infant mortality.\n  During the 102d Congress, I again pressed for Senate action on this \nissue. On July 29, 1992, I offered an amendment to legislation pending \non the Senate floor that would have increased the deductibility for \nhealth care insurance purchased by self-employed persons from 25 to 100 \npercent, and would have made health coverage more affordable for small \nbusinesses through insurance market reforms. This amendment included \nprovisions from legislation introduced by Senator Chafee, which I \ncosponsored, and which was previously proposed by Senators Bentsen and \nDurenberger. My amendment was defeated on a procedural motion by a vote \nof 35 to 60 along party lines, and the Senate did not consider \ncomprehensive health care legislation during the balance of the 102d \nCongress. The substance of that amendment, however, was adopted later \nby the Senate on September 23, 1992 as an amendment to H.R. 11, the \nbroader tax legislation introduced by Senators Bentsen and Durenberger \nand which I cosponsored. This latter amendment, which included \nsubstantially the same self-employed deductibility and small group \nreforms that I had proposed on July 29, passed the Senate by voice \nvote. Unfortunately, these provisions were later dropped from H.R. 11 \nin the House-Senate conference.\n  On August 12, 1992, I introduced legislation entitled the ``Health \nCare Affordability and Quality Improvement Act of 1992,'' S. 3176, that \nwould have enhanced informed individual choice regarding health care \nservices by providing certain information to health care recipients, \nlowered the cost of health care through use of the most appropriate \nprovider, and improved the quality of health care.\n  On January 21, 1993, the first day of the 103d Congress, I introduced \ncomprehensive health care legislation entitled the ``Comprehensive \nHealth Care Act of 1993,'' S. 18. This legislation was comprised of \nreform initiatives that would have improved both access to and \nthe affordability of insurance coverage, and would have implemented \nsystemic changes to lower the escalating cost of care in this country.\n\n  On March 23, 1993, I introduced the Comprehensive Access and \nAffordability Health Care Act of 1993, S. 631, which was a composite of \nhealth care legislation introduced by Senators Cohen, Kassebaum, Bond, \nand McCain, as well as my bill, S. 18. I introduced this legislation in \nan attempt to move ahead on the consideration of health care \nlegislation and provide a critical mass as a starting point. On April \n28, 1993, I proposed this bill as an amendment to the legislation then \npending on the Senate floor, the Department of Environment Act, S. 171, \nin an attempt to urge the Senate to act on health care reform. My \namendment was tabled by a vote of 65 to 33, largely along party lines.\n  As I mentioned earlier, on January 4, 1995, I introduced S. 18, the \nHealth Assurance Act of 1995, which improved upon many provisions \nincluded in my health care legislation from the 103d Congress and \nprovided a framework for targeted reform that could be built upon if \nneeded. In addition to addressing the portability issue, S. 18 has \nthree other important objectives: First, to provide affordable health \ninsurance for the 40 million Americans now not covered; second, to \nreduce health care costs for all Americans; and third, to improve \ncoverage for underinsured individuals and families. All of these \nobjectives are accomplished through initiatives that our health care \nsystem could readily adopt without creating an enormous new \nbureaucracy.\n  In total, I have come to the Senate floor on 14 occasions over the \npast 4 years to urge the Senate to address health care reform. As early \nas June 26, 1984, I stated that the issue of health care is one of the \nmost important matters facing the Nation today. That statement \ncontinues to ring true today, nearly 12 years later. According to the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, national health expenditures \ntotaled an estimated $949.4 billion in 1994, representing 13.7 percent \nof GDP. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] projected that national \nhealth expenditures will total an estimated $1 trillion for 1995, or \n14.1 percent of GDP. According to CBO, spending for health care grew \nabout 6 percent in 1994, and was expected to grow about 7 percent in \n1995.\n  I believe we have learned a great deal about our health care system \nand what the American people are willing to accept from the Federal \nGovernment as a result of debate over President Clinton's proposal in \nthe fall of 1994. The message we heard loudest was that Congress was \nacting too hastily, and that Americans did not want a massive overhaul \nof the health care system. Instead, our constituents want Congress to \nproceed more slowly and to target what isn't working in the health care \nsystem while leaving in place what is working.\n  As I have said both publicly and privately, I was willing to \ncooperate with President Clinton in solving the problems facing the \ncountry. However, there were many important areas where I differed with \nthe President's approach and I did so because I believed they were \nproposals that would have been deleterious to my fellow Pennsylvanians, \nto the American people, and to our health care system. Most \nimportantly, I did not support creating a large new government \nbureaucracy because I believe that savings should go to health care \nservices and not bureaucracies.\n  On this latter issue, I became concerned about the creation of such a \nbureaucracy, and asked my staff to review the President's 1,342-page \nHealth Security Act when it was transmitted to Congress on October 27, \n1993. My staff found an increase of 105 new agencies, boards, and \ncommissions and 47 existing departments, programs, and agencies with \nnew or expanded jobs. This chart received national attention after \nbeing used by Senator Bob Dole in his response to the President's State \nof the Union address on January 24, 1994. The response to the chart was \ntremendous, with more than 12,000 people from across the country \ncontacting my office for a copy. Numerous groups and associations, such \nas United We Stand America, the American Small Business Association, \nthe National Federation of Republican Women, and the Christian \nCoalition, reprinted the chart in their publications amounting to \nhundreds of thousands more in distribution.\n  In addressing our health care problems, let me be clear: In creating \nsolutions it is imperative that we do so without adversely affecting \nthe many positive aspects of our health care system which works for 85 \npercent of all Americans. The pending legislation, the Health Insurance \nReform Act, achieves this objective and should be viewed as the first \nstep of an incremental approach to health care reform. It is my hope \nthat we can accomplish some additional health care reforms that are \nequally necessary but would also not disrupt our system, such as \nincreasing the deduction for the health care of the self-employed. \nFurther, we should continue to pursue other initiatives to help reduce \nhealth care costs and increase the quality of health care that the \nmajority of this body can agree upon.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 deserves our strong support \nand I urge my colleagues to enact this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Kassebaum and \nKennedy for their leadership in putting together this bill which the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] estimates will help over 21 million \npeople.\n  I also want to talk today about a woman from Florence, MA, who wrote \nme about her daughter. She supports this bill, she said, because her \ndaughter has diabetes and the family had a terrible time finding health \ninsurance that would cover her. In her letter she told me, ``I think \nit's immoral for health insurance companies to cut off coverage even \nwhile the people they cover are paying their premiums. No health \ninsurance company should have the power to do this to their clients.''\n  Millions of Americans have medical histories or preexisting \nconditions that make it difficult to get comprehensive insurance \ncoverage. As many as 81 million Americans have preexisting medical \nconditions that could affect their insurability. Many people are locked \nin their jobs because they fear they will be unable to obtain \ncomprehensive insurance in new jobs. And many people\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\nwho work in small businesses often have trouble getting insurance \nespecially if one employee has medical problems.\n  I am hopeful that this important bill will pass Congress and will be \nenacted into law this year. It is time that we help the American people \nget the health insurance they rightfully deserve.\n  This bill takes very important steps forward. But we must do more, so \nthat ultimately we have coverage for all Americans. Currently, 40 \nmillion Americans live without health insurance, and 23 million of the \n40 million are workers, according to a study by the Tulane University \nSchool of Public Health. Furthermore, an average of more than 1 million \nchildren a year have been losing private health insurance since 1987. \nIn Massachusetts alone, there are more than 130,000 children--one-tenth \nof all the children in my State--who are without any health insurance, \nprivate or public, for the entire year. And many more children lack \nhealth insurance for part of the year. A recent study in the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association reported that almost one-quarter of \nU.S. 3-year-olds in 1991 lacked health insurance for at least a month \nduring their first three years, and almost 60 percent of those lacked \ninsurance for 6 or more months.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has an unacceptable record when it comes \nto addressing the real needs of American workers and families. \nPolitical divisions and Presidential politics have become an everyday \nfeature of Senate floor action, making it impossible for us to do much \nof the people's business. This bill still holds the promise of being a \nnotable exception.\n  I applaud the vision, commitment, and political savvy of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nSenator Kassebaum, whom I greatly admire, and the distinguished ranking \nmember of that committee who is the senior Senator from my State. They \nhave crafted a bill which will provide real help to meet the needs of \nreal Americans, and have brought it to the Senate in a form that can \nbecome law. I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill and the \nconferees to speedily send it to the President's desk for his \nsignature. I will proudly vote for passage this afternoon.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, for the past 5 years, the issue of health \ncare reform has been at the top of our national agenda. The need for an \noverhaul in our health care delivery system was a centerpiece of \nPresident Clinton's campaign, and our inability to enact comprehensive \nreform legislation 2 years ago was a profound disappointment.\n  The debate on the size and scope of the Federal budget and on various \nitems within the so-called Contract With America have dominated \ncongressional business for much of the last year and a half. \nNevertheless, there remains a firm national consensus that something \nmust be done to reform the health care system.\n  In light of all the money spent on the provision of health care in \nthis Nation, it is surprising that we have not already found a way to \ndeliver a sufficient level of care to the millions of citizens who do \nnot have health insurance. The Department of Health and Human Services \nestimates that between 32 and 37 million Americans have no health \ninsurance, and an additional 50 to 60 million are underinsured. As \ntranslated by the Office of Management and Budget, a total of 13 \npercent of all Americans are completely uninsured, with as many as 28 \npercent without insurance for 1 month or more. The Labor Department \nreports that each year, one million people lose their health insurance.\n  As currently structured, the private health insurance market provides \nan insufficient level of coverage for individuals and families with \nmajor health problems and makes it difficult for employers to obtain \nadequate coverage for their employees. This is especially true of small \nbusinesses.\n  The bill before us--S. 1028, The Health Insurance Reform Act--will \nreduce many of the existing barriers to obtaining insurance coverage by \nmaking it easier for people who change jobs or lose their jobs to \nmaintain adequate coverage. It will also provide increased purchasing \npower to small businesses and individuals. I am proud to support this \nlegislation, which is aimed at covering millions of those who do not \nhave insurance or who have an inadequate level by addressing the issues \nof portability and preexisting conditions.\n  S. 1028 builds upon innovative and successful State reforms and \nenhances the private market by requiring health plans to compete based \non quality, price, and service instead of refusing to offer coverage to \nthose who are in poor health and need it the most. Passage of this \nmeasure is being called a relatively modest first step toward the kind \nof comprehensive reform legislation we tried to pass in 1994. I agree \nthat it is only a first step, but feel instead that it is a rather \nmajor first step in that it goes a long way toward reaching the goal of \nuniversal health care.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that enactment of S. 1028 \nwould help at least 25 million Americans each year. This would be a \nmajor step in the right direction. It would also provide much-needed \nmomentum for future reform efforts. Equally important, it would not \nincrease Federal spending, impose new or expensive requirements on \nindividuals, employers, or States, or create new Federal layers of \nbureaucracy.\n  This measure enjoys wide bipartisan support in Congress and from a \nhost of organizations, including the National Association of \nManufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Governors \nAssociation, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, Independent Insurance Agents of America, and the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities.\n  Specifically, the bill does the following: Limits exclusions for \npreexisting conditions; guarantees insurance availability; guarantees \nrenewability; ensures portability; and allows small employers and \nindividuals to increase their purchasing power by negotiating for more \ncompetitive rates with health plans and providers.\n  S. 1028 was passed unanimously by the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee under the leadership of Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy. \nDuring this year's State-of-the-Union address, President Clinton \nchallenged Congress to pass it quickly, and described it as the very \nleast that can be done to help some of those 37 million with inadequate \ncare or no care at all. It is a sound, targeted, market-based reform \nmeasure that will make it easier for millions of Americans to change \njobs without the fear of losing their health coverage. It is a \nconsensus-building approach that can lead to comprehensive reform down \nthe road.\n  While it is true that this measure does not make all the necessary \nchanges we need in the health care system, it does make a series of \nvaluable reforms that will make a discernible difference in the lives \nof millions of our citizens. It does this without interfering with \nthose parts of the system which work and without taking away the \nability of States to implement their own reforms. I congratulate the \nbill's managers for their work and the majority leader for scheduling \nthis debate, and urge its swift passage.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to rise as a cosponsor of \nH.R. 3103, the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1996. Over the last few \nyears, the Senate has been on a long road on health care reform, and it \nis a matter of great satisfaction that we have finally reached this \nimportant milestone.\n  H.R. 3103, the so-called Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, represents the core \nof market-based health insurance reforms on which there has always been \nwide agreement. The provisions of H.R. 3103 were, in essence, the heart \nof the Republican Health Care Reform bill developed in 1994 as an \nalternative to the big-government top-down Clinton health plan.\n  The 1994 elections, which brought the first Republican majority to \nCongress in 40 years, provided a clear indication of the overwhelming \nrejection of President Clinton's plan by the American people. More than \nany other factor, it was the mandate of the 1994 election which shaped \nthe policy that has guided this debate.\n  I cannot praise highly enough the remarkable leadership brought to \nthis legislation by the chairman of the\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\nLabor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. \nHer careful management has been discreet, thoughtful, responsive, and \nthorough. With her partner for the minority in this endeavor, ranking \nmember Senator Edward Kennedy, they have shepherded a unique bipartisan \nmeasure--devoid of any real controversy--which could in itself extend \nhealth insurance access to an estimated 25 million Americans who, as we \nsay, have fallen through the cracks of health insurance coverage.\n  This is not a universal coverage bill. Nor does it prescribe specific \nbenefits. It does, however, provide the level playing field which the \nhealth insurance industry has long needed to eliminate the 50-State \npatchwork of different rules and standards for coverage of preexisting \nconditions, portability, and renewability. As insurance companies will \nno longer have broad discretion in excluding people from coverage, all \ncompanies will be accomodating the costs of high-risk employees.\n  When speaking of pre-existing condition problems, I always remember \nthe case of the young father employed at a lumber mill in northern \nVirginia. His wife gave birth to a severely disabled child resulting in \nabnormally high costs for his employer's health insurance company. At \nthe end of the year, that insurance company approached the mill owner \nwith an impossible choice: If you retain coverage for the disabled \nchild, your premiums will go up by 150 percent. If you exclude coverage \nfor the disabled child, your premium will only go up by 12 percent. The \nmill owner absolutely could not afford the higher premium and was \nforced to drop the young family with the disabled child.\n  So, here you had a case in which an employee wished to stay with his \ncompany but had to seek coverage elsewhere. Ironically, current \ninsurance coverage in this country may also cause the reverse: \nIndividuals who wish to move on to another employer but cannot because \na preexisting condition can preclude future coverage. They are \nessentially locked in their jobs for fear of losing their health \ninsurance.\n  These examples of discriminatory treatment are precisely what we are \ntrying to remedy with the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. The legislation is \ngood medicine for American health care.\n  For preexisting conditions, American workers would be required to \ncomply with a maximum 1 year waiting period for coverage by their \ninsurance plan. Were there no waiting period, individuals would be \ntempted to only purchase health insurance when they or their family \nmembers were ill--a practice which would understandably substantially \nundermine the fiscal strength of the insurance industry.\n\n  Once the preexisting condition waiting period has been met, and as \nlong as health insurance premiums are paid up, there should not be a \nlapse in coverage if you remain with covered employers.\n  If you should be required to seek individual rather than group \ncoverage, the legislation includes important safeguards for the \nindividual market from the costs of preexisting conditions. One must \nfirst have been in group coverage for a minimum of 18 months and then \nfully used and paid for an additional 18 months of COBRA coverage.\n  Upon meeting these conditions, the individual health insurance market \nwill be required to offer full benefits without a preexisting condition \nclause.\n  I commend the managers of the bill for their efforts to keep the \nlegislation as uncluttered as possible with unrelated or controversial \namendments. With the exception of the Dole-Roth Finance Committee \namendment, which I was pleased to cosponsor, the bill has the best \nchance of reaching the President's desk if it remains clean.\n  I regret that the Medical Savings Account [MSA] provision of the \nFinance amendment was not retained, but I understand that it might have \nprompted a Presidential veto. I did support and have cosponsored in the \npast Senator Domenici's successful mental health parity amendment. I \nsincerely hope that it too will be retained.\n  Above all, this legislation must pass. We can not allow this \nopportunity to pass us by. These are the vital health insurance reforms \nwe first learned of in the historic health care debate of the 103d \nCongress, and it is our job in the 104th to see the job through.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I must state that this bill is extremely \nsignificant to me on a personal level.\n  My father was a physician who cared deeply about his patients, \nregardless of their ability to pay. He died when I was only a young \nman, but I have always revered his legacy of caring for others. If, \nwith this bill, we can extend health insurance coverage to 25 million \nAmericans who now are being denied benefits, my father would be the \nfirst to urge its swift passage.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, when comprehensive health care reform went \ndown to defeat in 1994, many of us in the Senate were frustrated \nbecause we had let yet another opportunity for reforming the health \ncare system slip away.\n  At that time, there was wide agreement on some elements of health \ncare reform. I, for one, wanted to go forward with those items--even if \nthey fell short of addressing all of the problems in the health care \nsystem. Unfortunately, political considerations on both sides of the \naisle and at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue prevented us from passing \neven those things we all agreed on.\n  Today, it appears that cooler heads will prevail. Today, it appears \nthat the Senate will pass--and I will proudly vote for--the Kassebaum-\nKennedy health insurance reform bill.\n  Who would have believed less than 2 years ago that we would be on the \nverge of passing a bipartisan health care bill. And, who would have \nbelieved that the bill would provide real reform by addressing the most \npressing problem faced by middle-class Americans--the possibility that \nthey will lose their health insurance just because they change jobs or \nget sick.\n  Four years ago, a national survey showed that nearly one-third of all \nAmericans had at some time in their lives been the victim of ``job \nlock.'' Fearing the loss of health insurance, they stayed in a job they \ndid not want and did not like. Two years ago, I asked Delawareans that \nsame question--and in responding to my questionnaire, 21 percent of \nDelawareans said they had experienced job lock. Addressing this problem \nis long overdue. But, it may finally happen.\n  With the bipartisan Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, no longer will insurance \ncompanies be able to deny coverage for most pre-existing conditions. No \nlonger will Americans be locked in jobs they do not want because \nchanging jobs means losing health insurance. And, no longer will \ninsurance companies be able to cancel a person's policy just because \nthey get sick.\n  Last year, a General Accounting Office study showed that nearly 25 \nmillion Americans could benefit from legislation similar to what we are \nconsidering today. It will provide security and peace-of-mind to \nmillions of middle-class Americans and their families.\n  Mr. President, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill also provides some \nimportant help to small businesses--those who have been most devastated \nby the rapidly rising costs of health care. First, the bill would \nincrease the self-employed health insurance tax deduction to 80 \npercent. I am a cosponsor of legislation to increase the deduction to a \nfull 100 percent. This bill falls short of that goal, but it continues \nto move us in the right direction.\n  Second, the bill would make it easier for small businesses to join \ntogether to purchase health insurance. By pooling their employees, \nsmall businesses can spread the health risks among a large number of \npeople and get cheaper insurance rates as a result.\n  And, third, the bill guarantees that all small businesses will have \nhealth insurance available to them. It prohibits insurance companies \nfrom cherry picking the businesses with the healthiest employees and \nrefusing to sell to all other businesses. It says, if an insurance \ncompany sells to small businesses, it must sell to all small \nbusinesses. This sounds simple--even unnecessary. But, in the real \nworld, it is crucial. When just one employee in a small business has a \nproblem pregnancy, or has a disabled child, or suffers from some other \nmedical condition, it often means that no one that works in that small \nbusiness can get health insurance.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to address the provisions in the bill \nregarding health care fraud. This is something I have worked on for 4 \nyears now. In 1992, I introduced legislation to\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\ncrack down on the small number of health care providers who engage in \nfraud against their patients, insurance companies, and the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Those who perpetrate fraud are few in number, but their crimes are \nlarge in dollars. During a hearing I held in the Judiciary Committee in \n1992, it was reported that up to 10 percent of total health care \nspending in this country is fraudulent. That is over $100 billion in \nhealth care fraud this year alone.\n  My bill would have cracked down on these cynical manipulators of the \nsystem by increasing the number of Federal investigators and \nprosecutors going after health care fraud; doubling the penalties for \nthose found guilty; providing rewards for patients and health care \nworkers who come forward with information about fraud; and making sure \nthat the guilty make restitution to the victims. My legislation passed \nthe Senate in 1992 but was never taken up in the House.\n  A year later, with the leadership of Senator Cohen, health care fraud \nprovisions were included in the Biden crime bill. But, again, the House \nwould not go along, and they were dropped during the conference.\n  Now, they are back again. And, the fraud provisions in the Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill are very similar to the legislation I first introduced in \n1992. I want to commend Senator Cohen for his diligence in this area. \nBut, I wish to note that while the House health care bill also contains \nfraud provisions, some of those provisions would actually weaken the \nanti-fraud laws. I urge the Senate to insist that they be stripped \nduring the conference.\n  Mr. President, despite all of the good about this bill--protecting \nAmericans from losing their health insurance, helping small businesses, \nand cracking down on health care fraud--it will not solve all of \nAmerica's health care problems. And, it is not intended to.\n  The fact that it does not address a whole host of problems--including \ncomprehensive cost control and the nearly 40 million uninsured \nAmericans, including 100,000 in Delaware--does not mean these problems \ndo not exist and should not be addressed. Failing to deal with these \nmatters may be a weakness of the legislation. But, ironically, it is \nalso the bill's strength.\n  Precisely because the bill deals only with the most pressing health \ncare problems, we have a very real chance of passing a health care \nreform bill for the first time in my nearly 24 years in the Senate. We \nare on the verge of breaking the gridlock on health care reform.\n  The fact that it is an incremental--not comprehensive--bill is not a \nreason to vote against it. In fact, Mr. President, I would argue that \nit is a reason to vote for the bill. By passing the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nlegislation, we will have made a downpayment on health care reform--\naddressing some important problems and helping meet real needs of the \nAmerican people. If we show that responsible Government action can \nwork--and work well--we will have opened the door to possible future \nbipartisan agreements to solve other health care issues.\n  I hope that we will be back to address those issues. But, in the \nmeantime, I hope that we will not let another opportunity slip away. I \nhope that we will pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1028, the Health \nInsurance Reform Act. This is a good bill that will help millions of \nAmericans obtain health care.\n  Today, I would like to discuss four provisions that I believe are \ncentral to meaningful health care reform. For years, I have said that \nCongress should pass targeted reforms that take care of these core \nissues, and this bill does address three of them. They are: health \ninsurance portability, full tax deductibility for long term care \ninsurance, and deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed.\n  Let me just say for now that we missed a tremendous opportunity to \nenact tax deductions for medical savings accounts, or MSA's. I will go \ninto that issue in more depth later, but I am very disappointed about \nits removal from this bill. I can only hope it will prevail in \nconference.\n  Health care reform is a very complicated and sensitive issue. Before \nwe start restructuring one of the most important sectors of our \neconomy, we need to study the issue thoroughly. We must make sure we \napproach it in the proper manner, and listen to all concerns.\n  In 1994, I was host to a statewide health care conference that \nfeatured leading policy experts from every facet of the health care \nsystem. I invited doctors, providers, nurses, patients--everyone who \nwould be impacted by health care reform. From this, everyone who \nparticipated gained a greater understanding of the complexities of our \nhealth care system.\n  Since that time, I have held citizens' forums to discuss the issue in \neach of the 10 counties in New Hampshire. In addition to this outreach, \nI also met privately with every interested group to discuss their \nspecific concerns more deeply.\n  This is the way to approach this issue--open, public forums, where \nall of the interested parties get to voice their concerns and share \ntheir views. I think the lesson of the White House Task Force, which \nproduced the Clinton reform proposal, is that secret meetings and back \nroom deals are not the way to approach a critical issue like this. \nCongress must act from a position of genuine consideration and \nunderstanding.\n  The very best part about open forums is that you get a very good \nsense of what people want, and don't want. In my experience, I hear \noverwhelming opposition to a Clinton-style government-run health care \nsystem. At the same time, I also hear avid support for the four reforms \nthat I will now discuss.\n  The first concern is that health insurance should be ``portable.'' I \nfeel very strongly about this issue, as I know the rest of my \ncolleagues do. It is of particular concern to individuals who have \npreexisting conditions. These are people who are terrified of leaving \ntheir jobs, being fired or laid off, changing their jobs, or starting \ntheir own businesses--because of the risk of becoming uninsured.\n  The freedom to change jobs, or even to become self-employed, is one \nof the cornerstones of our free market economy. When we picture the \nAmerica dream, we think of a family, a home, children, a college \neducation. But, I think a big part of the American dream is finding a \njob that you enjoy, one that fits your interests and skills, and \nworking your way up the ladder of success.\n  This is not always easy. Some people get lucky early in life. They \nfind a good employer and work their way up the company ladder. This was \nthe predominant trend years ago. But for most of us today, the ladder \ndoes not go straight up. An individual works at a job for a while and \nfinds that it does not suit him. He may not get along with his boss. \nOr, maybe he wants to move. Perhaps he wants a larger salary. There are \ncountless reasons why people change jobs these days, and it is a very \nhealthy process. In fact, it has been reported that individuals today \nhold an average of seven jobs over the course of a lifetime.\n  I have held a number of different jobs throughout my career: teacher, \nreal estate broker, public servant. As I think back, I don't know \nwhether I would have been as comfortable making some of the career \ndecisions I did if I had to risk losing health coverage for myself and \nmy family.\n  The greatest fear that most Americans have in changing jobs is the \nfear of losing their health coverage. There is a term for it now: ``Job \nLock.'' It is the one concern that I hear about over and over again at \nmy citizen forums and constituent meetings.\n  And, it is a concern that applies to the people in our society who \nare the most vulnerable--people who have chronic health problems, \ndisabilities, injuries, or illnesses. For many of these Americans, \nfinding and holding a job that fits their abilities and interests is \nnot an easy task. For many of these people, there are additional issues \nrelated to daily living, caring for children, maintaining a home, \ntransportation, paying the bills, that are particularly challenging for \nthem. The last thing they need, on top of all that, is to be denied \nhealth insurance. Most of them have been paying into insurance plans \nfor their whole lives. Now, because they have left their employer, they \nrisk losing everything. It is unfair.\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\n  Mr. President, it isn't just the worker who benefits from portability \nreform. In the same way that an employee can become unhappy with his \njob, sometimes the employer has reasons to let one of his workers go. \nThese employers face tough decisions. It might be a small business \nowner who finds that he can't balance his books without making some \nreductions. It is always a tough situation to face, but these are the \neconomic realities of the business world.\n  But what if this same small business owner knows that an employee, \nperhaps a close friend, has a pre-existing condition of a family member \nwith one? This employer has a terribly difficult decision on his hands. \nHe can keep his employee on, just so that the employee can maintain his \nhealth coverage--perhaps risking bankrupting the business--or he can \nlay him off and let him go without insurance. Health portability is \nprobusiness, because it would allow a small business to make those \ntough decisions while having the peace-of-mind in knowing that the \nemployee and his family would not lose their health coverage.\n  I have said publicly for years that Congress should do something \nabout portability, and that we do not need socialized medicine to do \nit. This bill proves that. My State already has an extensive guarantee \nissue law, so the group-to-individual portability provisions would be \nsuperseded by the New Hampshire law. But, frankly, the Kassebaum-\nKennedy portability provisions are much more modest than those enacted \nin my State of New Hampshire.\n  Next, I would like to address the important provision in the bill \nthat provides for an 80 percent tax deduction for health insurance for \nthe self-employed.\n  Mr. President, in discussing the portability provisions, I briefly \ntouched on the issue of individuals who, for one reason or another, \nchoose to be a self-employed. Whether it is running a corner store, or \neven a family farm, many Americans rely on self-employment for their \nsurvival. Additionally, these are many Americans who, for a variety of \nreasons, from physical disability to spending time with their children, \nfind working at home to be the most appropriate and fulfilling way to \nearn their income.\n  For these self-employed Americans, health insurance can be a very \nexpensive proposition--so expensive that many choose to go without \ncoverage. There are three main reasons for this.\n  The first and most obvious reason is that the self-employed have to \npick up the full cost of the premiums. Most Americans get insurance \nthrough their employer. They pay a portion of the premium, but the best \nis paid by their employers. For these Americans, there is a big \nincentive to take advantage of this benefit. But the self-employed are \nforced to pick up the entire premium. This just goes with the \nterritory. The reason I am pointing it out is to highlight the fact \nthat tax deductibility is particularly important for these Americans.\n  The second reason it is so expensive is that individual insurance is \nmuch more expensive than group insurance. When I say group insurance, I \nam generally talking about employer-based insurance.\n  The reason that group plans are cheaper is because the risk is spread \nover a broad group of people, sick people and healthy people. But, due \nto the costly nature of individual insurance and the unfavorable tax \nsituation, healthy individuals are less inclined to buy individual \nplans. Many of them simply choose to go uninsured. Consequently, \nbecause there are fewer healthy individuals to spread the risk, \nindividual insurance is very expensive.\n  But the primary reason is the tax situation. And this is very easy to \nfix. Employers get a 100-percent tax deduction for their contribution \nto an employee's health premiums. Earlier their year, we did raise the \nself-employed tax deduction to 30 percent. But, I believe that this is \nstill unfair. It ought to be 100 percent for everyone--employers, self-\nemployed, and the individual policy buyer whose employer does not offer \nhealth insurance.\n  This bill raises the deduction for the self-employed insurance \npremiums to 80 percent. This will go a long way toward eliminating the \npowerful disincentives for self-employed Americans to buy insurance. It \nphases the deduction in over 10 years. While I still wish it were 100 \npercent, and I would like to see it changed right away, this is indeed \nprogress.\n  In addition to helping the self-employed, this bill has a provision \nthat is of great concern to Americans who wish to purchase long-term \ncare insurance. Just today, I had a constituent visit my office from \nthe Alzheimer's Association. Among her primary concerns was this \nprovision to amend the tax code to make long-term care insurance and \nexpenses tax deductible. I know this disease very well, because my \nfather-in-law had Alzheimer's, and I know how expensive long-term care \ncan be.\n\n  Health care is important, but for many, such as those with \nAlzheimer's disease, it is activities related to daily living that are \nthe problem. The bill specifically defines these activities to include \n``eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, and continence.''\n  Under current law, health insurance is tax deductible. But long-term \ncare insurance gets taxed. This bill would provide the same \ndeductibility for long-term care that is currently afforded to health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, the final provision that I would like to discuss is \nnot in this bill, and that is the tax deductibility for Medical Savings \nAccounts. It was in the Senate Finance Committee's amendment, and it \nwas in the House bill. Unfortunately, this vital provision was defeated \non the Senate floor by a vote of 52 to 46.\n  I have discussed the important provisions for self-employed \nAmericans, and employer-based benefits. But, there is another group of \npeople who are in desperate need of help, and that is individuals who \nare not self-employed, but whose employers do not offer an insurance \nplan. Many of them are restaurant workers, farm workers, or other \npeople who work for a small employer who cannot offer or chooses not to \noffer an insurance package.\n  Under current law, these workers get no tax deduction whatsoever. Not \n100 percent, not 30 percent--nothing. It is the same for Americans who \nare unemployed.\n  Huge corporations get a 100-percent tax deduction to subsidize their \nemployees' insurance premiums--from the CEO on down. But someone living \npaycheck to paycheck whose employer can not provide them with \ninsurance--or someone who is unemployed--gets taxed on the full \npremium.\n  There are provisions in both the House and Senate bills to allow \nsmall businesses join together and form purchasing pools in order to \nbuy insurance at lower rates. The House provisions were somewhat \nstronger than those in the Senate bill. I am confident that the \nconferees will work to produce a final version that would greatly \nincrease the number of small businesses that offer insurance to their \nemployees.\n  As helpful as these provisions will be in increasing access to \ninsurance, there will still be millions of Americans whose employers \ndon't offer insurance, or who are unemployed. For these Americans, \nthere is only one provision that would have helped them--and that is \nthe full tax deductibility for Medical Savings Accounts, or MSA's.\n  I can't understand why my colleagues would have voted against it. It \nwill obviously be an important issue in Conference, and I am hopeful \nthat it will make it into the final package.\n  Some have suggested that if we include MSA's in the conference report \nthat it will provoke opposition or even a filibuster by the Democrats. \nI find it very hard to accept the proposition that Senators would \nfilibuster health care portability reform solely on the basis that we \ngive tax relief for Americans to put money in a savings account for \nhealth expenses.\n  I believe that MSA's are vital to true health care portability. By \ndefinition, MSA's are the very essence of portability. When we talk \nabout insurance ``portability'' as it pertains to the underlying \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill, we are using the term figuratively. The \nemployee isn't really bringing his insurance with him, we are just \nproviding him the freedom to shift from one plan to another without \nbeing denied coverage.\n  So, lets take the example of an individual who works for a company \nfor 20 years, and becomes disabled or ill, and must leave his job and \ngive up his employer-based health insurance. Under\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\nthe bill, he would be able to buy an individual insurance policy. The \ninsurers would have to take him. But it says nothing about how much the \ninsurer could charge.\n  So, when he goes to the individual insurance company, the company is \ngoing to evaluate him in terms of the health risk that he poses to the \nplan. It does not matter if he was insured for 3 years or 30 years, the \ninsurance company would consider only his current health status in \ndetermining the premium he would pay. Those 30 years of payments mean \nnothing to the new insurance company.\n  The only provision that would allow him to transport at least a \nportion of his coverage is the medical savings account [MSA]. MSA's \nallow individuals to supplement their insurance policy by investing a \ncertain amount into a tax-free savings account and using that account \nto pay for their predeductible medical expenses. Any money that the \npatient has not spent at the end of the year would remain in his \naccount.\n\n  It is portability in its most pure form. Because it stays with the \nemployee if he change jobs, because it is his account. If he gets \nfired, and cannot find a job, he still has the MSA. He could even use \nthe MSA to pay his insurance premiums while he tries to find a job. If \nhe moves to a plan that provides a lower level of coverage, he would \nstill have his MSA money to pay for the uncovered expenses. I feel that \nhe should get a tax deduction for this account, just like Americans get \nfor their individual retirement accounts, mortgages, charitable \ncontributions, and health insurance.\n  But, there is another reason that MSA's are important to real health \ncare reform, and that is the increased use of preventive health \nservices. I really believe that preventive health care is the solution \nto many of our health problems.\n  Most insurance plans have a deductible that people need to meet \nbefore their insurance company pays for coverage. This acts as a built-\nin disincentive for individuals to use preventive health services, and \nI believe it needs to be at the center of health care reform.\n  For example, let us say a person has an illness such as diabetes. In \norder to avoid major health problems, they need to maintain an adequate \ninsulin balance, appropriate diet, and so forth. This can become very \ncostly when the patient must pay for needles, insulin, monitoring \ndevices, perhaps dietitian services, and other costs. If these services \nare not covered, the individual must pay out of pocket. This \ndiscourages the use of preventive health care.\n  The unfortunate result is major health problems for these people. For \ndiabetes patients, it might even mean a foot or leg amputation--major \nshort term and long term costs to the insurer, the individual, and his \nfamily. Of course, add to that the years of pain and hardship that \nresult from this perhaps preventable situation.\n  Let me explain why MSA's encourage preventive health care. The three \nmajor issues that result in individuals not getting preventive health \ncare are: deductibles, copayments, and uncovered or partially covered \nservices. In these three situations, the individual is forced to come \nup with the money on their own, without help from the insurer. In some \ncases, this forces the individual to choose between the expenses of \ndaily life--food, rent, heating bill--and paying for the preventive \nhealth services. Not surprisingly, it is the preventive services that \nare often pushed aside.\n  Millions of Americans believe that managed care, so-called health \nmaintenance organizations [HMO's], are the solution to cost control and \npreventive health care. I would concede that HMO's have done some great \nthings in controlling health care costs in our country. But HMO's still \nleave the issue of uncovered expenses. There is also the problem where \nmany Americans do not want to join the HMO because they might not be \nable to keep going to their family doctor, if the doctor does not \nbelong to the HMO.\n  With an MSA, there are no predeductible expenses, no uncovered health \nexpenses, no copayment as long as the individual still has money in his \nMSA. So the disincentives that discourage individuals from obtaining \npreventive health care are greatly diminished.\n  A March 14, 1995, policy analysis done by the Cato Institute \naddressed the successes of MSA's in the current system. Even without \nthe favorable tax treatment, the paper states that in its experience \nwith MSA's under the current system, Golden Rule Insurance Co.'s \nemployees increased their use of preventive care.\n\n       About 20 percent of the workers with MSAs reported that \n     they used their MSA funds to pay for a medical service they \n     would not have bought under the traditional health insurance \n     policy. That is because the MSA provided the funds at hand \n     that they could use to pay for such services, whereas the \n     traditional policy imposed deductible and coinsurance fees \n     that actually discouraged the use of such services. Moreover, \n     the traditional policy might not cover some services, and the \n     uncertainty alone discouraged workers from obtaining \n     preventive care. But workers know that MSA funds can be used \n     for whatever services they choose.\n\n  So we can philosophize all we want about why it happens, but I like \nto look at the hard evidence. When we look at the facts, MSA's increase \nthe use of preventive care.\n  Mr. President, recently this issue has somehow become a partisan \nissue. Some Democrats have put themselves in the awkward position of \nsaying that people should have to pay taxes on their predeductible \nhealth care expenses, copayments, prescription drugs, and other \nuncovered expenses. They can try to explain that to the voters when the \nelection comes around.\n\n  But, I think it is worthwhile to briefly review the record here, \nbecause historically, this has been a very bipartisan issue, and my \ncolleagues on the other side should be aware of this before they fall \non their swords over this so-called controversial provision.\n  I have a series of letters and a television transcript here from \nHouse and Senate Democrats in support of MSA's, including \nRepresentatives Andrew Jacobs, Robert Torricelli, and House Minority \nLeader Dick Gephardt, as well as Senators John Breaux, Sam Nunn, and \nthe distinguished Senate Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. I also \nhave a letter from the National Mineworkers.\n  These materials clearly show that MSA's have enjoyed broad bipartisan \nsupport in the past, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not perfect. I am sure all of us have \nchanges we would make. I know there are a number of provisions that I \nwould like to see added to the bill. But I am going to vote for it, \nbecause I believe it is a big step in the right direction. After the \nfailure of the Clinton socialized medicine plan, Republicans said that \nwe needed a change. We promised Americans that if they gave us a \nchance, we would give them a real health reform bill--without Big \nBrother, without the ``standard benefits package,'' without rationing \ncare. We promised them portability and tax relief for the self-\nemployed, and long-term care. We have made good on our promise to the \nAmerican people and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters and a television transcript to \nwhich I earlier referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President, The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: As original co-sponsors of Medical \n     Savings Accounts (MSA) legislation in the House of \n     Representatives, we urge your review of and your public \n     support for this wonderfully innovative idea.\n       The recent vote on the House Republican plan should not be \n     used to judge the Democratic Party's position on MSAs. As you \n     know, MSAs have become a major plank in Congressman \n     Torricelli's health care platform in his Senate race.\n       We cannot think of a more Democratic idea than MSAs. In \n     fact, it was originally our idea. We want Democrats to get \n     the credit for it. In the Senate, Democrats John Breaux, Tom \n     Daschle, Sam Nunn and David Boren initiated the idea.\n       Dick Gephardt included MSA's in the House Democratic \n     Leadership bill in 1994. There were 28 House Democrats who \n     cosponsored our initial MSA legislation. There are currently \n     three Democratic U.S. Senate candidates who have supported \n     MSA legislation: Dick Durbin, Tim Johnson and, of course, Bob \n     Torricelli.\n       You also should know that the current contract of the \n     United Mine Workers provides its members with MSAs. We do not \n     believe the UMW qualifies as healthier and\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\n     wealthier than the general population--a charge leveled by \n     uninformed MSA opponents.\n       MSAs will hold down health costs and be a boon to lower \n     income employees, single working mothers, as well as the \n     lower and middle income employees all across America. With \n     MSAs, people are rewarded for shopping around and can, in \n     many cases, for the first time spend first dollar health \n     insurance dollars (there are no deductibles or co-payments) \n     on dental care, vision, mammograms, alternative medical \n     therapies, etc.\n       Mr. President, we believe MSAs will be a huge benefit to \n     the American public. MSAs are not a partisan issue. Democrats \n     supported MSAs in the 102nd and 103rd Congresses and we \n     support them in this Congress because they are a good idea \n     that increases access, controls costs and extends options.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robert G. Torricelli,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                               Andrew Jacobs, Jr.,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.\n     Medical Savings Accounts\n       Dear Democratic Colleague: Many interest groups are \n     posturing on the health insurance reform issue. A few are to \n     draw an imaginary line in the sand on Medical Savings \n     Accounts. Medical Savings Accounts should not be a partisan \n     issue.\n       Please note:\n       1. Democrats were the initial sponsors of MSAs.\n       2. MSAs passed the House Ways & Means Committee unanimously \n     in May 1994--when Democrats were in control. Obviously, in \n     1994, we believed it was part of the solution.\n       3. MSAs are included as the ``sense of the committee'' in \n     the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n       4. MSAs do not favor the young and healthy any more than \n     optional conventional health insurance in the workplace. MSA \n     funds can be used for diabetic maintenance testing and other \n     procedures not generally covered by traditional health \n     insurance. MSA funds can be used for orthodontia care which \n     is also not generally covered.\n       Health insurance reform is too important to allow the \n     posturing of a few to kill it.\n           Sincerely,\n     Andy Jacobs, Jr.\n     Bill Lipinski.\n     Glenn Poshard.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1992.\n       Dear Colleague: The United States is faced with a crisis in \n     health care on two fronts: access and cost control. So far, \n     most of the proposals before Congress attempt to deal with \n     access but do not adequately address the more important \n     factor--cost control. We have introduced legislation that \n     will begin to get medical spending under control by giving \n     individual consumers a larger stake in spending decisions.\n       We have introduced a bill, the Medical Cost Containment Act \n     of 1992 (S. 2873), which would allow employers to provide \n     their employees with an annual allowance in a ``Medical Care \n     Savings Account'' to pay for routine health care needs. This \n     allowance would not be subject to income tax if used for \n     qualified medical expenses. Any money not spent out of a \n     given year's allowance could be kept by the employee in an \n     account for future medical needs during times of unemployment \n     or for long term care. In order to protect employees and \n     their families from catastrophic health care expenses above \n     the amount in the Medical Care Savings Account, an employer \n     would be required to purchase a high-deductible catastrophic \n     insurance policy.\n       Unlike many standard third party health care coverage \n     plans, Medical Care Savings Accounts would give consumers in \n     incentive to monitor spending carefully because to do \n     otherwise would be wasting their ``own'' money. That is, \n     money that they would otherwise be able to save in their \n     account for future needs.\n       Once a Medical Care Savings Account is established for an \n     employee, it is fully portable. Money in the account can be \n     used to continue insurance while an employee is between jobs \n     or on strike. Recent studies show that at least 50% of the \n     uninsured are uninsured for four months or less.\n       Today, even commonly required small dollar deductible \n     (typically $250 to $500) create a hardship for the \n     financially stressed individual or family seeking regular, \n     preventive care services. With Medical Care Savings Accounts, \n     however, that same individual or family would have this \n     critical money in their account to pay for the needed \n     services.\n       We feel that, while the Medical Care Savings Account \n     concept does not provide the total solution to the crisis in \n     health care access, it does begin to address the critical \n     aspects of increasing costs and utilization by consumers.\n       We hope that you will join us as cosponsors of this \n     legislation. If you have any questions please contact us or \n     have your staff contact Laird Burnett of Senator Breaux's \n     staff at 4-4623.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Breaux.\n     David Boren.\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Richard Lugar.\n     Dan Coats.\n     Sam Nunn.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From CNBC's ``Equal Time''--Aug. 2, 1994]\n\n       Mary Matalin. You think the Medical Savings Accounts are \n     going to make it through conference?\n       Dick Gephardt. Absolutely. This is an idea the Ways and \n     Means Committee has worked on for three or four years. It's \n     very popular. A lot of people like that option and I think it \n     will be in the final bill. I think it's a great option.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    July 29, 1994.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: An amendment to the Health Care Package \n     has been offered to add a medical care savings account \n     provision. The United Mine Workers have a similar provision \n     in our current contract that is anticipated to produce a \n     significant savings to our previous insurance. If the \n     amendment offered is consistent with the objectives of our \n     contractual health care provisions, the United Mine Workers \n     in Illinois would support it. The options of utilizing a \n     medical care savings account may assist in solving the Health \n     Care problems in this country.\n       Another concern of our members is the possible taxation of \n     benefits. Any provisions that allow for taxation of health \n     care benefits would be totally unacceptable. Over the years, \n     the United Mine Workers have negotiated a total package for \n     our members. Advances in wages and other fringe benefits have \n     suffered because of the high cost of health insurance. \n     Taxation of health care benefits would be a slap in the face \n     to the miners in Illinois who agreed to maintaining their \n     health care in lieu of other benefit increases.\n       I appreciate your efforts on behalf of our members as well \n     as all Americans during the health care debate. I believe \n     that everyone in the United States must be afforded quality \n     comprehensive health benefits without the fear of losing \n     these benefits through job loss.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Dan Reitz,\n                         COMPAC Coordinator, District 12, U.M.W.A.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I support the Health Insurance Reform \nAct, for the simple reason it will help provide more accessible and \naffordable health insurance to more Americans.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act helps those who are now unable, for \nreasons beyond their control, to buy health insurance. It prevents \ninsurance companies from denying coverage to individuals with \npreexisting conditions, while ensuring that individuals are not able to \ntake unfair advantage of the system by only purchasing coverage when it \nis actually needed. It prevents job-lock by guaranteeing that \nindividuals who are covered by an employer-sponsored policy will not \nlose their coverage by changing jobs. It also allows individuals and \nsmall businesses to join together to purchase insurance, thereby \nleveraging their negotiating power to gain better rates and/or \nbenefits. In addition, the bill makes health care more affordable by \ngradually increasing the deductibility of premium costs for the self-\nemployed to 80 percent--a move which will be of great benefit to the \nmore than 56,000 self-employed Idahoans. I am also pleased to note the \nbill allows for the cost of long-term care insurance and expenses to be \ndeductible--another of the reforms I have supported since before I \njoined the Senate. And the Health Insurance Reform Act achieves all \nthese goals without unnecessary Federal intrusion into the health care \nsystem.\n  This bill is the result of the heated and controversial debate over \nhealth care policy 2 years ago. You will recall Congress and the \nAmerican public rejected the proposed Government takeover of health \ncare, but recognized that targeted reforms were needed in health \ninsurance.\n  The crisis in health care is that too many people are being denied \nhealth insurance. That is why, 2 years ago I introduced legislation to \naddress those market reforms on which I knew there was broad agreement. \nWhile the details of my bill differ in many ways from the bill we \npassed, I am pleased to note many of the concepts I embraced then--\nincreasing access to health insurance, portability, renewability, and \nan end to preexisting conditions exclusions--are found in the Health \nInsurance Reform Act. The American public said they wanted us to keep \nthe Government out of health care, and to target our health insurance \nreforms to the market. With this bill, I can say the Congress listened.\n  I just had a clear example of why this legislation is needed. An \nIdahoan contacted my office last week asking if the Health Insurance \nReform Act would help him. He is currently receiving disability \nbenefits but would rather be working. His American dream is to start \nhis own business. But he fears that becoming more productive will\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\ncause him to lose the Federal benefits which now provide him with his \nonly access to adequate health care. If he knew that his disability, \nhis preexisting condition, would not prevent him from gaining access to \nhealth insurance, he could start that business, to provide for himself \nand his family without the Federal assistance he does not really want, \nanyway.\n  During the previous Congress many of us had the opportunity to learn \na great deal about the way health care is provided in this Nation. We \nsaw aspects of the system which worked, and I would point out that the \noverwhelming majority of the system works very well, providing most \nAmericans with the best health care in the world. We also learned about \nthose aspects which needed some adjustments. And that is what we are \ntrying to do--not rebuild health care in the United States, but make \nappropriate corrections to specific aspects of the system to make it \nwork even better. Most importantly, we are achieving more affordable \nand accessible health care through private sector reforms.\n  I must, however, express my disappointment with the vote to exclude \nmedical savings accounts MSA's from this bill. MSA's allow people to \nsave money, tax free, to cover medical expenses. In cases where an \nemployer provides health insurance, the employer contributes to the MSA \nand, again, these funds are not taxable provided they are used for \nmedical expenses. When combined with a high-deductible, catastrophic \ninsurance policy, MSA's provide individuals with low-cost health care \ncoverage which provides the maximum level of consumer choice and eases \nmany of the financial concerns which face those who need health care \nservices. MSA's are the responsible way to increase both accessibility \nand affordability in health care coverage.\n  States are the proving ground for many innovative ideas. Idaho is one \nof many States to have enacted MSA legislation in recent years and \nnumerous Idahoans have expressed their support for MSA's as a health \ninsurance option. While I believe Idaho, among other States, should be \ncommended for its efforts on this issue, regrettably, the full benefits \nof MSA's will not be discovered until they are recognized by the \nFederal Government and given appropriate treatment under the Tax Code. \nOnce again, the States have shown initiative and it is time for the \nFederal Government to get out of the way and give our citizens the \noptions for which they have asked. As a recent editorial in the Idaho \nStatesman noted, The nation loses if medical savings accounts are \nstripped out of the final legislation.\n  The bill is not perfect. Small insurers have shared their views with \nme that the provisions related to small group and individual coverage \nwill actually increase the cost of individual policies, thus adding to \none of the current insurance problems we face--the lack of \naffordability. As premium costs increase people will drop out of the \nsystem, leaving us with more uninsured and, with a shrinking market, \neven fewer options for those who continue to purchase health insurance \ncoverage. Obviously, this is not the result for which we are aiming and \naddressing these questions should be a priority.\n  That said, I support the Health Insurance Reform Act because I \nbelieve it steps in the right direction toward increasing accessibility \nto health care insurance. Allowing those with preexisting conditions to \nget and keep health insurance will help ensure coverage for Americans \nunfairly denied access to health insurance. Providing for portability \nof health care coverage will help end job-lock and will ensure that \nthose who have faithfully paid into the system will not suddenly be \ndropped from it. And providing for more favorable tax treatment of \ninsurance premiums for the self-employed, and for long-term care \ninsurance, will make insurance more affordable for numerous other \nAmericans. These are significant reforms which I believe all of us \nshould support, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, many Americans today, particularly middle-\nincome working families face the declining purchasing power of their \nwages. They are saddled with the high cost of child care, are trying to \nget a college education for their children, working to reach the \ntraditional American dream of home ownership and some security for \ntheir own retirement years. But perhaps most difficult is the struggle \nto keep up with the sky-rocketing costs of health care which many are \nforced to face without adequate health insurance.\n  Americans want health insurance which covers all Americans, which is \naffordable, protects the quality of their health care, and can never be \ntaken away. Today, the Senate, I hope, will take a first step in that \ndirection. This legislation does not address the costs, but takes a \nvery important step in protecting the availability of health insurance \nfor many Americans.\n  I support the legislation before the Senate today. I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of this health insurance reform measure, along with 55 of \nmy colleagues in the Senate. Although it does not solve and does not \nattempt to solve all of the problems of the present system, it does \naddress some of the most pressing concerns that middle-income Americans \nhave expressed about the diminishing availability and portability of \nhealth coverage for themselves and their families.\n  This bill makes important changes that will protect those who \ncurrently lose their insurance coverage because they lose their job or \nchange jobs. And, it protects those who are unable to attain health \ninsurance because of a preexisting medical condition, or who now lose \nit when they get sick.\n  One of the consequences of the present health insurance system is \nthat it creates what is often called ``job lock''; that is workers who \nwant to change jobs to improve their careers are forced to give up the \nopportunity because it means losing their health insurance. A quarter \nof all Americans say they have been forced to stay in a job they \notherwise would have left, because they were afraid of losing their \nhealth insurance. This bill ends job lock.\n  Under the Kennedy-Kassebaum reform bill, exclusion of a preexisting \ncondition will be limited. Employer-provided health plans will not be \nable to limit or deny coverage for new employees for more than a year \nbecause of a medical condition that was diagnosed or treated during the \nprevious 6 months for employees changing plans. No new limit on \npreexisting conditions may then ever be imposed on those who maintain \ntheir coverage, even if they change jobs or their employer changes \ninsurance companies. Cancellation of policies for employees who \ncontinue to pay their premiums will be prohibited. Employees coverage \ncan no longer be terminated because they become sick. No employers who \nwant to buy policies can be turned down because of the health of their \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased with significant improvements \nin coverage for pregnant women and newborn children. Under the bill, \npregnancy can no longer be considered a preexisting medical condition \nas is presently the case with some health plans. In some such \nsituations, the mother has no prenatal coverage for pregnancy related \nservices.\n  The bill also contains a special enrollment period for change in \nfamily composition. Under this provision, newborns whose parents wish \nto enroll them in their group health plan within 30 days of birth may \nnot be excluded from coverage under a group or individual health plan \nduring the child's first 12 months of life.\n  Additionally, as is the case with individuals who are previously \nenrolled, children cannot be subject to a preexisting condition \nexclusion once the condition has been diagnosed, if the condition was \npreviously covered. This provision is intended to ensure that children \nunder the age of 1 are not subjected to new preexisting condition \nexclusions when their parents change jobs or health plans simply \nbecause of their age.\n  Mr. President, this legislation helps real people. It will help Mike \nand Elizabeth Gregory of Gains Township, MI. When Mike Gregory was left \njobless due to his company's downsizing, his wife Elizabeth and their \ntwo daughters lost their health coverage. This situation primarily \nimpacted their youngest child, Danielle, who has cerebral palsy. Only \none of the three plans at Mike's new place of employment offers \ninsurance that will not limit coverage for Danielle's preexisting \ncondition, thereby limiting their choice and therefore their selection \nof benefits.\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\n  Barbara Barton of Grand Rapids suffers from MS. She was forced to \nleave her job in order to reduce the stress that worsened her symptoms, \nwhich included temporary blindness and difficulty walking. Ms. Barton \nwas forced to wait 6 months to get health coverage, since MS is \nclassified as a pre-existing condition. Under this bill, she would have \nbeen eligible to move to an individual health insurance plan \nimmediately.\n  Fear of losing health coverage for Mr. Al Miller's preexisting \ncondition prevents his wife from seeking a higher-paying job. The \nMillers are from Charlotte, MI. Mr. Miller has MS.\n  Mr. Michael Peel of Flint recently changed jobs and is covered under \nCOBRA has a 2-year-old son with a number of physical ailments. He and \nhis wife are expecting their second child and fear they will not be \nable to get coverage under Mr. Peel's new job that does not exclude his \npreexisting condition.\n  Steven West of Nashville, MI, spoke to me about problems he and his \nwife Lori have experienced in attaining health insurance coverage for \ntheir son, Jacob. Jacob has multiple birth defects. Steven has been \nable to negotiate coverage at his current job, but fears that he is \ntrapped there by Jacob's needs. Steven has an opportunity to move to a \nbetter job, but has been unable to do so because the health coverage \nwould not take care of Jacob.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few real people in my home State of \nMichigan who stand to benefit from this legislation, there are \nthousands like them. I want to commend my colleagues Senator Kassebaum \nand Senator Kennedy for forging a bipartisan approach to addressing \nthis critical issue. While I would prefer for the Senate to be passing \nmore far-reaching health reform today, perhaps covering all American \nchildren, for example, I believe this bill is an important step forward \nand I urge its enactment.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for \npostponing final passage of the Health Insurance Reform Act until my \nreturn. The legislation which we will pass today is the straightforward \nhealth insurance reform which my constituents have been telling me they \nwant for many years.\n  The American people rejected the big-government, big-bureaucracy \nsocial experiment which the Clinton administration developed--in \nsecrecy, I might add--in 1994. People don't want a one-size-fits-all, \ngovernment-controlled health insurance system. Americans won't tolerate \nhaving a Government board deciding for them which procedures are \nmedically necessary and appropriate. And we know from leading \neconomists that price controls produce shortages, black markets, and \nreduced quality. Therefore, most Americans and those of us who serve \nthem in Congress rejected the Clinton health care plan.\n  Two years later, under Republican leadership, we are addressing the \naspects of health insurance reform which most people outside the \nbeltway want us to address. We will provide portability of health \ninsurance, which will help put an end to job lock. Insurers will no \nlonger be able to deny coverage due to preexisting conditions. As a \ncancer survivor, I know personally how important this provision of \nhealth insurance reform is to patients.\n  The legislation ensures guaranteed renewability of policies, with the \nexceptions of fraud and nonpayment of premiums. It will help the self-\nemployed by increasing the deductibility of health insurance premiums. \nIt facilitates the establishment of voluntary coalitions of small \nbusinesses and individuals to negotiate and purchase health insurance. \nFinally, the legislation provides tax incentives for the purchase of \nlong-term care insurance, and tax-free treatment of accelerated life \ninsurance benefits for those with chronic or terminal illnesses.\n  I am especially grateful to Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy for \nagreeing to include genetic information in this important legislation.\n  I cochaired a hearing with Senator Feinstein last September to \nexamine the issue of genetic information and health insurance. We \nlistened to patients, researchers, biomedical ethics experts, consumer \nadvocates, and others who made the case that Congress must address this \ncomplex issue now.\n  Why now? Because the scientific data and technology for genetic \ntesting are here; but the social, ethical, and legal ramifications have \nonly begun to resonate beyond the scientific community. Put another \nway: The science of human genetics research is on the Concorde. Yet the \nlegal, social, and ethical debate about how to handle the information \nin our society has been stuck at Kitty Hawk trying to get off the \nground.\n  This legislation takes an important first step by clarifying that \nemployer-based plans cannot deny coverage, or charge higher premiums, \nto individual employees based upon their health status, including \nhealth status based upon genetic information. While this may not have \nsignificant implications today, it certainly will by the end of the \ndecade when international scientists complete the mapping of the entire \nhuman genome.\n  There is still more which needs to be accomplished in this area, such \nas ensuring the privacy of medical records and prohibiting employment \ndiscrimination based upon an applicant's genetic information. Senator \nHatfield, Senator Feinstein, and I look forward to working with our \ncolleagues to enact our legislation to address these concerns.\n  Today is an historic moment in our Nation's history. We will ensure \nthat all Americans have access to health insurance coverage while \nmaintaining the freedom to choose providers and benefits. We will \npreserve our system with the highest quality of care and continue to \nfoster research, innovation, and competition. We will provide employers \nwith the positive incentives to provide health insurance coverage for \ntheir employees, and provide tax equity for the self-employed to \nacquire insurance for themselves and their families.\n  All of this will be accomplished under the system which has served as \nthe bedrock of every great stride our Nation has made--not through \nhigher taxes, more Government, and more bureaucracy, but rather through \nfree markets and free choice.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I have been watching and listening with a \ngreat deal of interest to the debate on term limits. I think there are \na lot of us who believe that, regardless of the arguments that come \nforth on term limits, there are not many minds that will be changed in \nthis Chamber. But many of us have been concerned about the term limits \nissue long before we got to Congress. I know I became interested in it \nback in the 1970's, long before I was a Member of Congress.\n  I think a lot of the reason is that you look and you see the things \nthat are going on in this country, and you see that there is a \nnecessity to change the way we have been doing business.\n  One argument that has not been used during the course of this debate, \nthat I have heard anyway, is the argument that if we had term limits, \nit would deter a lot of people from getting into a legislative position \nfor perhaps the wrong reasons. I think quite often people with whom I \nhave served who came here to Congress directly out of college never \nreally had a real job in terms of the real world and did not have any \nidea of how tough it was out there.\n  I look at a lot of the things that passed, such as the deficit that \nhas piled up over the years. Certainly, in my position, I look at this \nas if this is a moral issue, and it is not going to be changed until we \nare able to change the type of individuals that serve here.\n  We have excellent people serving here in Congress, but the thing that \nhas always been a problem with me is that people who come to Congress, \nnever having been exposed to the real\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nworld, have a different set of values and have a different outlook on \nlife than we have.\n  I would agree with some of the previous speakers that we ought to \nhave a situation in America where Members of Congress should all have \nto go out and make a living under the laws that they pass, and we would \nnot have these problems.\n  Someone not too long ago said that we have an overregulated society \nhere. We certainly do. It is overregulation which mostly came about by \npeople who have been in Congress for their entire adult life. This is \nsomething that can be changed.\n\n  I am not optimistic that anything is going to happen with this today. \nBut I will say this. There is going to be a record that will be \nestablished so that people who are running for office will know that \nthe public will know how they stand on this very contentious issue. \nOver in the other body, in the House of Representatives, there is a \nContract With America; 9 of the 10 items were passed over there. The \ntenth one that was not passed was term limitation.\n  I believe it is something that is very healthy for our system, \nsomething that we all need to get on the record, and I think we will \nhave that opportunity today. I believe that is in the best interest of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3826-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3827-S3833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, first before we go to the closing \nstatements on the health insurance reform bill, I would like to yield \nthe floor 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Grams] is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support for the Health \nInsurance Reform Act, and I commend the distinguished chairman from \nKansas and the Senator from Massachusetts for drafting legislation \nwhich seeks to ensure affordable, accessible health insurance for all \nAmericans.\n  In September of 1993, President Clinton and the First Lady presented \na sweeping health care reform proposal which they believed would \nresolve the health care problems facing many in our country. They said \nwe needed to make insurance portable . . . they said we needed to \nprotect individuals with pre-existing conditions . . . and they said we \nneeded to bring down the rising costs of health insurance. I agreed \nwith the problems identified by the President, however, I strongly \ndisagreed with the solutions he proposed.\n  Crafted during a year of closed-door meetings by the White House's \nHealth Care Task Force, the Clinton plan set in place global budgets, \nprice controls, tax increases, reduced choice and rationing--all housed \nwithin a massive, new layer of Federal bureaucracy. Fortunately, \nAmericans recognized the President's plan for what it really was--a \ngovernment takeover of the Nation's health care system, and they had \nthe good sense to reject it.\n  Mr. President, I believe government-controlled health care failed in \n1994 because the President underestimated the ability and desire of \nAmericans to make their own health care choices, free from government \nintrusion or control. Only by empowering consumers, rather than the \nGovernment, will we allow the marketplace to evolve into a quality, \ncost-effective, and responsive health care provider, able to offer \naffordable insurance to all Americans.\n  While socialized medicine failed in 1994, Americans did embrace four \nimportant concepts which emerged from the health care debate: health \ninsurance should be accessible, it should be affordable, it should be \nportable, and pre-existing conditions shouldn't disqualify anyone from \nobtaining health insurance. Those principles lie at the heart of the \nHealth Insurance Reform Act.\n  It is estimated that 43 million Americans went without health \ninsurance in 1995. According to the Minnesota Health Care Commission, \nthe number of uninsured Minnesotans has remained stable for the last 5 \nyears at approximately 400,000 individuals, or nearly 9 percent of the \nState's population. That is below the national average of close to 15 \npercent uninsured but still too high.\n\n  Mr. President, what keeps health insurance out of the reach of so \nmany? The two main barriers are access and affordability.\n  A majority of Americans under the age of 65 are insured through their \nworkplace. Many job providers, however--small employers in particular--\nfind themselves shut out of the health insurance market when it comes \nto obtaining affordable coverage for their employees.\n  And even insurance obtained through a job doesn't last forever, \nbecause few Americans stay with a single employer throughout their \nentire work career. Each year, 18 million Americans change insurance \nwhen a family member moves between jobs, often stranding them without \ninsurance and usually forcing them to find new coverage. Many who are \nunwilling or unable to risk going without insurance just stay put. A \nWashington Post/CBS News survey found that one quarter of all American \nworkers experience ``job lock''--they are staying in jobs they would \notherwise leave because they are afraid of losing their health \ncoverage.\n  Another flaw of our insurance system is that it offers little \nprotection to individuals or their family members suffering from major \nhealth disorders. Because they are victims of what are known as \n``preexisting conditions,'' these Americans are denied insurance \nbecause of the cost they represent to the system.\n  Americans who play by the rules, who buy health insurance when they \nare healthy, should be allowed to keep it when they get sick. This is \nwhy I supported Senator Jeffords' amendment which would have raised the \nlifetime cap on insurance policies.\n  Individuals buy health insurance to not only ensure treatment for \nrelatively minor medical problems--strep throat and the occasional \nbroken bone, for example--but also to protect themselves against \ncrippling accidents or catastrophic illness. It is important that these \nindividuals continue to be covered by their private insurance company. \nIf they are dropped, their only alternative is to spend-down their \nassets in order to qualify for Medicaid.\n  This moves more patients into the Medicaid program, overloading the \ntaxpayers and a system that is already buckling under heavy costs.\n  This is unfair to those individuals who have played by the rules, and \nI will continue to work with the Senator from Vermont to address this \nissue.\n  Expanding access to insurance, allowing individuals to move between \njobs with insurance policies that can move with them, and preventing \ninsurance companies from denying coverage based on a preexisting \ncondition, is precisely what the Health Insurance Reform Act attempts \nto provide.\n  The Federal Government's General Accounting Office estimates this \nlegislation would open the door to health insurance for 25 million more \nAmericans.\n  Americans will no longer be forced to decide between taking a new job \nor losing their medical coverage--the Health Insurance Reform Act \nguarantees health care that is always there, regardless of where an \nemployee works or even if they work at all.\n  My own State of Minnesota embarked on reforming its health care \ndelivery system long before most of the rest of the country.\n  For three decades, we have debated these very same issues and worked \nlong and hard to achieve portability, renewability, and the elimination \nof preexisting condition exclusions, thereby increasing the number of \ninsured.\n  Minnesotans have been innovative and progressive in reform of our \nhealth care marketplace.\n  We have celebrated success and we have endured failure.\n  While our system is far from perfect, our legislators, our health \ncare community, and our constituents continue\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nto work to improve the delivery of quality health care and guarantee \nits affordability in Minnesota.\n  One of this bill's most beneficial aspects is the flexibility it \ngives States to create and administer their own health insurance reform \nprograms--away from Washington's control.\n  Under this legislation, States such as Minnesota, which have already \nimplemented reforms, are exempted from any changes established by the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n  Furthermore, Minnesota has already enacted laws in the large group, \nsmall group, and individual markets which go beyond what is laid out in \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation.\n  That includes guarantee issue, guaranteed renewability, limits on \npre-existing condition exclusions, a State risk pool for uninsurable \nindividuals, and reforms to enhance and encourage the bargaining power \nof small businesses.\n  The Kassebaum bill will have minimal effect on most of my \nconstituents, but it will provide new portability and access \nprotections for Minnesota employees and their dependents.\n  It does so by requiring insurers to guarantee issue coverage to plans \nwith 50 or more employees, which includes self-insured plans not \ncurrently providing these protections.\n  I am disappointed that medical savings accounts are not part of the \nSenate bill.\n  I am encouraged, however, by the large number of my colleagues who \nshare the majority leader's commitment to including MSA's in the \nconference report. I believe MSA's would substantially enhance the \nlegislation before us.\n  While this legislation will go a long way toward expanding access to \nhealth insurance, I am still concerned that the bill does not provide \nenough affordable access. Keep in mind that health insurance which is \naccessible yet unaffordable will not improve the current problems in \nour marketplace.\n  The inclusion of MSA's in this legislation is not a Republican issue \nor a Democrat issue--it is a Main Street issue. MSA's enhance \nportability and promote consumer choice, while they empower individuals \nwith the same tax equity large corporations receive under our Tax Code.\n  I am deeply concerned that many of those who claim to be advocates \nfor the so-called little guy want to deny lower income Americans the \nchoice of medical savings accounts.\n  I believe MSA's are the best way we can put low-income wage earners \non an equal footing with their corporate cousins in the health care \nmarketplace.\n  I received a letter last week from a coalition of rural Minnesotans \nbased in Fergus Falls called Communicating for Agriculture.\n  Comprised of farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses, and boasting a \nnational membership of 80,000, Communicating for Agriculture has been \nadvocating an MSA-type plan since 1978.\n  They write;\n\n       Managed care is not an option to hold down health care \n     costs since [rural Minnesota] has little or no competition in \n     health care. Without competition, you can't have managed \n     care. MSA's allow us to spend our medical dollars where it is \n     most convenient.\n       It also eliminates a great amount of administrative expense \n     which is a major contributor to health inflation over the \n     years.\n\n  A recent study by Blue Cross and Blue Shield revealed that 43 percent \nof employees would definitely or probably switch to an MSA if given the \nopportunity. In light of this broad, public support for MSA's, we \nshould at the very least allow individuals this choice. While the \nKassebaum legislation is good and worth passing on its own merits, I \ncertainly hope that the conference committee will adopt MSA's as part \nof the final version of our health insurance reform efforts this year.\n  As I conclude, I want to assure my colleagues and my constituents \nthat my position on the issues before us has not wavered since I first \nran for public office in 1992:\n  I strongly support legislation ensuring portability.\n  I strongly support legislation ensuring limiting preexisting \ncondition exclusions.\n  I strongly support legislation providing tax equity for all Americans \nthrough medical savings accounts, and increasing deductibility to 100 \npercent.\n  And I strongly support the efforts of this Congress to deliver these \ndesperately needed reforms to the American people.\n  As Congress prepares a final bill to send to the President, I will be \nworking to ensure that provisions promoting greater access and \naffordability are incorporated into the final bill.\n  Only through such comprehensive reforms will we encourage more \nAmericans to purchase health insurance, thereby expanding the ranks of \nthose with coverage and eventually making health insurance more \naccessible and affordable for all.\n  Again, Mr. President, I strongly support this bill. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas, [Mrs. Kassebaum].\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his support on \nthis legislation.\n  If I may speak for a few moments in closing before our vote this \nafternoon on the health insurance legislation. For a bill that is a \nvery modest bill with a broad consensus of support, the Health \nInsurance Reform Act certainly has attracted a lot of controversy. It \nis not a Trojan pony. It is a bill that was carefully put together, \nlearning from the mistakes of the past and building together in the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee legislation that we believed could \ngarner the broadest possible support and yet represent a meaningful \nstep forward in health care legislation.\n  During the debate in the last Congress on health care, there were \nmany questions raised of particular concern to most people. One was \nportability, a sense of insecurity where many Americans found they were \nnot able to maintain health insurance if they lost their job or changed \njobs. That is what we started with--something that is clearly, I \nbelieve, a small but important step forward. It is what I believe will \nbe very valuable to many people in this country. We recognized we were \nonly going to be able to achieve success if the bill had the broadest \nsupport possible. And indeed, the legislation has garnered over 60 \ncosponsors. From there, of course, the legislation has grown to be more \nexpansive than what we initially started with.\n  It has been our goal all along, Senator Kennedy as the ranking member \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee and myself, to say that \namendments which did not have broad-based support--amendments which \nwere controversial--were ones that we would have to object to, whether \nwe favored them individually or opposed them individually. And that is \nwhat we have tried to do throughout this debate.\n  This legislation now reflects, I think, two very positive amendments \nthat had unanimous support here on the Senate floor and that were \noffered by the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and \nSenator Dole, who has been a long supporter of these two initiatives. \nOne was to increase the percentage of deduction that would be allowed \nto those who are self-employed from 30 to 80 percent. The second was to \nprovide tax deductions for long-term care coverage, an issue which many \nof us have believed was very important and of which Senator Dole has \nlong been a leader. Those were valuable additions to the underlying \nbill.\n  As my colleagues know, Senator Kennedy has for many years in his \nlegislative career in the Senate, both as chairman of the Labor \nCommittee and as ranking member, been a strong advocate of improving \nthe health care system. This bill certainly does not go as far as \nSenator Kennedy would like it to go, but he was realistic about the \npossibilities of what we could achieve with a more limited bill.\n  Whether this legislation helps 25 million people, as has been \nestimated by the General Accounting Office, or whether it only helps 10 \nmillion people or if it helps 50 million people, the important fact is \nthat the Health Insurance Reform Act does provide some peace of mind \nfor those who desperately want to have some assurance that they will \nnot be excluded from coverage because of a preexisting medical \ncondition if they lose their job or change their job.\n  That is an important sense of security for many Americans, and I \nbelieve one of the main reasons this legislation has garnered such \nstrong support.\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that out of this bipartisan effort we \ncan go to conference and we can come through conference with a bill \nthat will be acceptable to everyone, because what we can accomplish \nwith this more limited legislation will be of value and far better to \nhave accomplished than to try for too much and to fail again.\n  Other aspects that have been added as amendments in both the House \nand the Senate, may have some value. But because they are extremely \ncontroversial, I would suggest that they need to be debated on their \nown merits at another time. The clear danger is that if we add too \nmuch, we will again fail to deliver real reform for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, this is an effort that has had a great deal of help \nalong the way from all sides--from consumers, from the medical \ncommunity, from the insurance community, from employers, and certainly \nfrom colleagues in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. I \nparticularly thank staff members who have worked tirelessly on this \neffort, certainly on my own staff, Dean Rosen, who has spent months and \nmonths trying to pull together a consensus of support, as well as Susan \nHattan, Rebecca Jones, and Ann Rufo, and all of the staff of the \nRepublican members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. I also \nthank David Nexon and Lauren Ewers of Senator Kennedy's staff for their \nhard work and dedication on this issue as well.\n  I do not think today's vote would have been possible without the \nefforts of Senator Kennedy, who has championed this legislation even \nthough, as I said earlier, his own interests would have been more \nexpansive than what we would have been able to achieve. It also would \nnot have been possible without the support of those on my side of the \naisle, as well, who have been willing to settle for what is possible \nand of greatest value to most people.\n  So it has been a collaborative effort. It has been an effort that \ngarnered unanimous support when it came out of the committee in August, \nand I believe will have if not unanimous support here in the U.S. \nSenate, close to that. I think it will be an important moment in \nadvancing health care efforts on the part of the U.S. Government today.\n  I want to thank the staff who worked countless hours on this \nlegislation. I want to thank Susan Hattan, Dean Rosen, Rebecca Jones, \nand Anne Rufo of my staff for their contributions and persistence in \nhelping to make this legislation a reality. I want to thank David Nexon \nand Lauren Ewers of Senator Kennedy's staff for their hard work and \ndedication. And I want to commend the Republican staff of the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee: Elaina Goldstein of Senator \nJefford's staff, Vince Ventimiglia of Senator Coat's staff, Kimberly \nSpaulding with Senator Gregg, Susan Ramthun with Senator Frist, Saira \nSultan of Senator DeWine's staff, Annie Billings of Senator Ashcroft's \nstaff. Greg Willhauck with Senator Abraham, and Tammi Brueske with \nSenator Gorton. I also want to thank Bill Baird with legislative \ncounsel for his patience and hard work, and Beth Fuchs of the \nCongressional Research Service for her invaluable guidance. Finally, I \nwould like thank Michael Gutowski and Mark Nadel of the General \nAccounting Office for their analysis of the impact of S. 1028.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 10 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nPryor be able to speak for not to exceed 10 minutes at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to express my \nappreciation to a number of our colleagues. I start with our chairman \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee, the leading sponsor of the \nbill, Senator Kassebaum. I think that when this legislation becomes \nlaw--and I believe that it will become law--the American people will \nowe her a debt of gratitude. I am proud to have joined her in \nrecommending to the Senate this legislation and to join her in \nrecommending the passage of the legislation, as well.\n  I think the entire Senate understands the extraordinary leadership \nthat she has provided on this legislation, and it is important, I \nbelieve, that the American people do as well.\n  When the Senate votes on the Health Insurance Reform Act today, the \nbill will pass overwhelmingly for many reasons. It will pass because it \nis broadly bipartisan. It will pass because it is solidly supported by \nover 200 organizations and a coalition of consumer groups, business and \nlabor and responsible insurance companies. It will pass because the \nSenate acted responsibly last week in rejecting a killer amendment that \nwould serve special interests rather than the public interest.\n  Senators have made important contributions to the construction of \nthis legislation, and I would like to mention several of my colleagues. \nThis is not a complete list, but those who I have had the chance to \nwork with most closely.\n  First of all, Senator Harkin, who was a leader in the effort to \nprotect people against health insurance discrimination based on genetic \ninformation.\n  Senator Wellstone worked hard to assure similar protections for \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  Senator Jeffords was a key leader on the provisions of the bill \nenabling small business to create purchasing pools to increase their \nbargaining power.\n  Senator Frist contributed key ideas to address the special needs of \nthe disabled.\n  Senator Dodd worked with the responsible insurance companies to see \nthat their concerns were addressed while protecting the interests of \nconsumers and gathering considerable support within the insurance \nindustry for this proposal on the basis of its merits.\n  Senator Abraham contributed to the State flexibility provisions which \nwas a matter of considerable concern and interest to many different \nMembers of this body.\n  Senator Rockefeller was an early supporter of this effort and \nprovided enormous assistance during the floor debate.\n  Senator Bennett worked hard to bring this bill to the floor and to \nbuild a consensus behind it.\n  Others contributed as well.\n  We are grateful for the additions that were made by Senator Dole and \nSenator Roth focusing on making the availability of insurance more \nattractive to small businesses, that provided the support for extended \ncare for many of our seniors, which is the great gap in the Medicare \nsystem today, and also for the initiatives for terminally ill patients \nto permit them greater flexibility to deal with some of their \nparticular financial interests.\n  So we are grateful for all of their support and for many others. For \nSenator Domenici and Senator Wellstone who offered their amendment \ndealing with mental health, that was accepted by the Senate. Senator \nKassebaum and I resisted that amendment on the basis of our earlier \nunderstandings and agreements that we would resist all amendments. But, \nnonetheless, I think there is great value of that particular provision \nas well.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will end many of the most serious health \ninsurance abuses and provide greater protections to millions of \nfamilies. It is an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss.\n  Before some final brief remarks about the legislation, I want to \nrecognize some of our very good staff people for their hard work.\n  On our side, my staff, Nick Littlefield, Dave Nexon, and Lauren Ewers \nwere particularly active; Susan Castleberry, Sara Thom, Brian Moran, \nRon Weich, and Melody Barnes.\n  For Senator Harkin: Peter Reineke and Anne Ford.\n  For Senator Wellstone: Alex Clyde.\n  For Senator Dodd: Jane Lowenson.\n  For Senator Pryor: Bonnie Hoque.\n  For Senator Rockefeller: Ellen Doneski and also Mary Ella Payne.\n  For Senator Daschle: Rima Cohen and Cybele Bjorklund. All of them \nwere involved and helpful.\n  Senator Kassebaum has mentioned those Republican staff who have been \ninvolved and worked very closely with us. But in this instance, as in \nmany others, some of them worked very closely with all of us, the \nMembers of the Senate, as well as our staffs: Susan Hattan; Dean Rosen, \nAnne Rufo, and Rebecca Jones.\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\n  For Senator Jeffords: Elaine Goldstein.\n  And for Senator Frist: Sue Ramthun.\n  We are grateful to all of them. They have a remarkable sense of \nknowledge and awareness in very special segments of this legislation, \nand their experience and knowledge and understanding of these nuances \nwere valuable to all of us. We are grateful for their help.\n  Finally, Mr. President, briefly, the abusive practices addressed by \nthis bill create endless, unnecessary suffering. It was our attempt to \naddress that unnecessary suffering by focusing on language to provide \nmillions of Americans with a new sense of hope in the workplace, \nAmericans who are today forced to pass up jobs that would improve their \nstandard of living or offer greater opportunities because they are \nafraid they will lose their health insurance.\n  Many others have to abandon the goal of starting their own business \nbecause health insurance would be unavailable to them or members of \ntheir families. We have tried to provide ways in which they can come \ntogether to provide coverage for their families and for the families of \nthose who work in many of the mom-and-pop stores and smaller businesses \nof this country.\n  Children who ``age out'' of their parents policies often find \nthemselves unable to obtain their own insurance if they have \nsignificant health problems. We have addressed that.\n  Early retirees can find themselves uninsured just when they are \nentering the years of highest health risks. We tried to address those \nissues.\n  Many other Americans lose their health insurance because they become \nsick or lose their job or change their job, even when they have \nfaithfully paid their insurance premiums for many years. This is \nperhaps the most difficult concept for people to understand, where they \nhave paid their premiums for 20, 25 years, suddenly have an illness and \nthey are either dropped from coverage or their premiums go up \nextraordinarily to the point where they cannot effectively afford it. \nWe have really provided some important reassurances to families.\n  More than half of all insurance policies impose exclusions for \npreexisting conditions and, as a result, insurance is often denied for \nthe very illness most likely to require medical care. The purpose of \nsuch exclusions is reasonable, to prevent people from gaming the system \nby purchasing coverage only when they get sick. But current practices \nare indefensible, and no matter how faithfully people pay their \npremiums, they have to start all over again with new exclusions if they \nchange jobs or lose their coverage.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act is a modest, responsible bipartisan \nsolution to many of the most obvious abuses in the health insurance \nmarket today. In fact, the only active opposition to the legislation \ncomes from those who profit from the abuses in the current system. In \nhis State of the Union Address last January, President Clinton \nchallenged the Congress to pass this bill. Now the Senate is poised to \nfulfill that pledge.\n  Mr. President, the only thing that stands between this bill and the \nPresident's signature are controversial provisions added in the House \nof Representatives. These objectionable provisions include the medical \nsavings accounts which we have debated----\n  Mr. President, I ask for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The federalization of multiple employer welfare \narrangements. A number of years ago we provided the States the power \nregulate these arrangements. It is rather strange now that those \nprovisions which permit the States to enforce these regulations are \neffectively being preempted so that the Federal Government will \nregulate them.\n  Repeal of the MediGap rules protecting senior citizens against \nprofiteers. That is a very dangerous provision. Up until 1984, we found \nthat many elderly people would buy 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 different programs \nwhich people thought would cover various gaps in their insurance--\ninstead the policies duplicated one another with no additional benefit \nto the individual. We found all kinds of abuses. We passed legislation \nto protect seniors against these abuses. It has been effective. We \nshould not go back to the earlier period.\n  The provisions making it more difficult to combat waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the current Medicare-Medicaid programs. I think that issue is \none that is not going to go away. There are many concerns that some of \nthe provisions that have been made in the House bill will lower the \nstandard, make it more difficult to prove the abuse and waste and \nfraud. I am not sure we want to go in those directions.\n  The malpractice issues were debated earlier in the Congress. I think \nthey ought to be addressed outside of this legislation.\n  We go to conference in a bipartisan spirit, committed to trying to \nget this legislation passed--obviously they have a right to pass their \nbills and we have a responsibility to work through the differences--but \nwe hope that, given the spirit with which this legislation started, \nboth in the House and the Senate, that we will be able to do it. Every \nday that is delayed, there are millions of our fellow citizens who are \ndenied the kinds of protections that this legislation will provide for \nthem. It is an extremely important piece of legislation, in many \nrespects I think maybe the most important piece of legislation that we \nwill pass in this Congress.\n  When the Senate votes on the Health Insurance Reform Act today, the \nbill will pass overwhelmingly for many reasons. It will pass because it \nis broadly bipartisan. It will pass because it is solidly supported by \nover 200 organizations in a coalition of consumer groups, business and \nlabor, and responsible insurance companies. It will pass because the \nSenate acted responsibly last week in rejecting killer amendments that \nserve special interests rather than the public interest.\n  I commend the chairman of the Labor Committee and the leading sponsor \nof the bill, Senator Kassebaum. She worked long and well to make this \nday a reality. Her leadership resulted in a unanimous vote for this \nbill in our committee. Her courage and commitment made it possible for \nthis bill to pass the Senate without crippling amendments. The American \npeople owe her a debt of gratitude, and I am proud to serve with her \nand join her and recommend passage of this legislation.\n  Other Senators have also made important contributions. Senator Harkin \nwas a leader in the effort to protect people against health insurance \ndiscrimination based on genetic information. Senator Wellstone worked \nhard to assure similar protection for victims of domestic violence. \nSenator Jeffords was a key leader on the provisions of the bill \nenabling small businesses to create purchasing pools to increase their \nbargaining power. Senator Frist contributed key ideas to address the \nspecial needs of the disabled. Senator Dodd worked with the responsible \ninsurance companies to see that their concerns were addressed while \nprotecting the interests of consumers.\n  Senator Abraham contributed to the State flexibility provisions. \nSenator Rockefeller was an early supporter of this effort and provided \nenormous assistance during the floor debate. Senator Bennett worked \nhard to bring this bill to the floor and to build consensus behind it. \nOthers contributed as well.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will end many of the most serious health \ninsurance abuses and provide greater protection to millions of \nfamilies. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.\n  The abusive practices addressed by this bill create endless \nunnecessary suffering:\n  Millions of Americans are forced to pass up jobs that would improve \ntheir standard of living or offer greater opportunities because they \nare afraid they will lose their health insurance.\n  Many others have to abandon the goal of starting their own business, \nbecause health insurance would be unavailable to them or members of \ntheir families.\n  Children who age out of their parent's policies often find themselves \nunable to obtain their own insurance if they have any significant \nhealth problems.\n  Early retirees can find themselves uninsured just when they are \nentering the years of highest health risks.\n  Many other Americans lose their health insurance because they become \nsick, or lose their job, or change their job--even when they have \nfaithfully\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\npaid their insurance premiums for many years.\n  Each year, the flaws in the private health insurance market become \nmore serious. More than half of all insurance policies impose \nexclusions for preexisting conditions. As a result, insurance is often \ndenied for the very illnesses most likely to require medical care. The \npurpose of such exclusions is reasonable--to prevent people from gaming \nthe system by purchasing coverage only when they get sick. But current \npractices are indefensible. No matter how faithfully people pay their \npremiums, they often have to start over again with a new exclusion \nperiod if they change jobs or lose their coverage.\n  Eighty-one million Americans have conditions that could subject them \nto such exclusions if they lose their current coverage. Sometimes, the \nexclusions make them completely uninsurable.\n  Insurers impose exclusions for preexisting conditions on people who \ndon't deserve to be excluded from the coverage they need. Sometimes, \ninsurers deny coverage to entire firms if one employee of the firm is \nin poor health, or at least exclude that employee from coverage. In \nother cases, entire categories of businesses, with millions of \nemployees, are redlined out of coverage.\n  Even if people are fortunate enough to gain coverage and have no pre-\nexisting condition, their insurance can be canceled if they have the \nmisfortune to become sick--even after paying premiums for years.\n  One of the most serious consequences of the current system is job \nlock. Workers who want to change jobs must often give up the \nopportunity because it means losing their health insurance. A quarter \nof all American workers say they are forced to stay in a job they \notherwise would have left, because they are afraid of losing their \nhealth insurance.\n  During the debate on this legislation, we have heard from Americans \nwho have been victimized by the abuses in the current system.\n  Robert Frasher, of Mansfield, OH, works for an employer who offers \nhealth coverage to employees, but the insurance company won't cover \nhim. Why? Because he has Crohn's disease.\n  Jean Meredith of Harriman TN, and her husband Tom owned Fruitland \nUSA, a mom and pop convenience store. They had insurance through their \nsmall business for 8 years, until Tom was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's \nlymphoma and their insurance company dropped them. When the Merediths \nasked why, they were told they were no longer profitable insurance \nrisks. Without health insurance, Tom Meredith had to wait a year to get \nthe surgery he needed. After spending $60,000 of his own funds, his \ncancer recurred and he died about a year ago. Tom Meredith might still \nbe alive today if he had not been forced to wait that year.\n  Diane Bratten, of Grove Heights, MN, and her family have insurance \nthrough Diane's employer. Because of a history of breast cancer now in \nremission, Diane and her family would not be able to get decent \ncoverage if she decided to change jobs or was laid off.\n  Nancy Cummins, of Louisville, KY, lost her health insurance when her \nhusband's employer went bankrupt. When their COBRA coverage expired, \nthey were uninsured for 3 years, until they qualified for Medicare. \nDuring this period, she suffered three heart attacks, which left their \nfamily with $80,000 in debts.\n  Jennifer Waldrup, of Massachusetts, was covered by her husband's \nhealth insurance until his employer went out of business. When she \napplied for coverage under her own employer, she was turned down \nbecause she had multiple sclerosis. Her employer tried to help, but \ncould not find an insurer who would offer coverage. Her husband had to \ncash in his life insurance to pay her medical bills.\n  Tom Hall, of Oklahoma City, faithfully paid his premiums for 30 years \nunder the group insurance policy of the construction business that he \nco-owned. When the company dissolved and he became self-employed, the \ninsurer refused to give him coverage because he had a heart condition. \nHe lives in fear that his life savings will be wiped out.\n  The legislation we will pass this afternoon will address these \nproblems effectively. The Health Insurance Reform Act is a health \ninsurance bill of rights for every American, and for every business as \nwell.\n  The legislation contains many of the provisions from the 1994 health \nreform debate which received broad bi-partisan support--such as \nincreased access to health insurance, increased portability, protection \nof health benefits for those who lose their jobs or want to start their \nown business, and greater purchasing power for small businesses.\n  Those who have insurance deserve the security of knowing that their \ncoverage cannot be canceled, especially when they need it the most. \nThey deserve the security of knowing that if they pay their insurance \npremiums for years, they cannot be denied coverage or be subjected to a \nnew exclusion for a preexisting condition when they change jobs and \njoin another group policy, or when they need to purchase coverage in \nthe individual market. Businesses--especially small businesses--deserve \nthe right to purchase health insurance for their employees at a \nreasonable price.\n  Our Health Insurance Reform Act addresses these fundamental flaws in \nthe private insurance system. The bill limits the ability of insurance \ncompanies to impose exclusions for preexisting conditions. Under the \nlegislation, no such exclusion can last for more than 12 months. Once \nsomeone has been covered for 12 months, no new exclusion can be imposed \nas long there is no gap in coverage--even if someone changes jobs, \nloses their job, or changes insurance companies.\n  The bill requires insurers to sell and renew group health policies \nfor all employers who want coverage for their employees. It guarantees \nrenewability of individual policies. It prohibits insurers from denying \ninsurance to those moving from group coverage to individual coverage. \nIt prohibits group health plans from excluding any employee based on \nhealth status.\n  The portability provisions of the bill mean that individuals with \ncoverage under a group plan will not be locked into their job for fear \nthat they will be denied coverage or face a new exclusion for a \npreexisting condition. These provisions will benefit at least 25 \nmillion Americans annually, according to the General Accounting Office. \nIn addition, the provisions will provide greater security for the 131 \nmillion Americans currently covered under group health plans.\n  The bill will also help small businesses provide better and less \nexpensive coverage for their employees. Purchasing cooperatives will \nenable small groups and individuals to join together to negotiate \nbetter rates in the market. As a result, they can obtain the kind of \nclout in the marketplace currently available only to large employers.\n  The bill also provides great flexibility for States to meet the \nobjective of access to affordable health care for individuals who leave \ntheir group health plans.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation guarantees that those who \nfaithfully pay their premiums will not have their insurance taken away \nor preexisting conditions imposed, even if they change jobs or lose \ntheir job.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act is a modest, responsible, bipartisan \nsolution to many of the most obvious abuses in the health insurance \nmarketplace today. The bill was approved by the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee last August by a unanimous vote of 16 to 0. It is \nsimilar to proposals made by President Clinton in his recent balanced \nbudget plan.\n  In fact, the only opposition to this legislation comes from those who \nprofit from the abuses in the current system.\n  In his State of the Union Address last January, President Clinton \nchallenged Congress to pass this bill. Now the Senate is poised to \nfulfill that pledge.\n  The only thing that stands between this bill and the President's \nsignature are controversial and harmful provisions added by the \nRepublican majority in the House of Representatives to their version of \nthe bill. These objectionable provisions include medical savings \naccounts, federalization of multiple employer welfare arrangements, \nFederal caps on malpractice awards, repeal of MediGap rules protecting \nsenior citizens against profiteers, and provisions making it more\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\ndifficult to combat the waste, fraud, and abuse in the current Medicare \nand Medicaid programs. Almost all of the 200 groups that support the \nlegislation have urged Congress to pass a clean bill, without these \ncontroversial amendments.\n  Each of these provisions represents a special interest agenda that \nhas no place in this legislation. Medical savings accounts are a $3.2 \nbillion Federal giveaway that provides special tax breaks for the \nhealthy and the wealthy at the expense of the average taxpayer. They \nraise premiums for the vast majority of Americans, by siphoning the \nhealthiest people out of the insurance pool. As premiums rise for those \nremaining in the pool, the number of the uninsured grows.\n  In fact, in the words of the Congressional Budget Office, medical \nsavings accounts ``could threaten the existence of standard health \ninsurance.'' They discourage the use of preventive care and raise \nhealth costs in this way as well. The House provision is also the first \nstep toward similar accounts for Medicare--a key part of the Republican \nplan to undermine Medicare by privatizing it.\n  Impartial health analysts agree that medical savings accounts are a \nbad idea. They have nothing to do with genuine insurance reform or \nhealth security for American families. They are in the House bill as a \nreward to Golden Rule Insurance Co. and other insurance companies that \nprofit from the worst abuses of the current system. Golden Rule alone \nhas made over $1.6 million in political contributions over the last 5 \nyears. Medical savings accounts should be dropped in conference, so \nthat this bill can be quickly signed into law.\n  Several other special interest provisions in the House bill also \njeopardize the hopes of American families for genuine insurance reform. \nThe House provision to exempt multiple employer welfare plans, or \nMEWA's from State regulation will turn back the clock to a time when \nthese arrangements were rife with fraud and abuse and millions of \nworkers and their employers were victimized. Inclusion of this \nprovision would seriously weaken the constructive small business \ninsurance reforms enacted by many States in recent years.\n  The other House provisions, such as those imposing Federal caps on \nmalpractice awards, opening new opportunities to defraud senior \ncitizens by unscrupulous insurance companies, and weakening Medicare \nprotections against fraud and abuse are equally counterproductive and \ncontroversial, and they have no place in this consensus bill.\n  Because of the importance of enacting the broad-based insurance \nreforms included in this bill, Senator Kassebaum and I announced early \nin the process that we would oppose all controversial amendments to our \nlegislation. Along with almost all of the more than 200 groups \nsupporting the legislation, we urge our colleagues in the House to \nsupport this approach.\n  The Senate has acted responsibility. None of these controversial \namendments are included in the bill that we will pass later this \nafternoon. Some were rejected but most were never even offered.\n  If the Republican majority in the House insists on including these \ncontroversial provisions they will kill this bill, and destroy the \nhopes of millions of Americans for the kind of modest but effective \nreform that is now well within our grasp, and that leaders and member \nof both parties have supported in the past. This measure is a test of \nthe Congress' seriousness and its ability to put the interests of the \nAmerican people ahead of the special interests.\n  Finally, this legislation is not comprehensive health reform. It will \nnot solve all the problems in the current system. But it is a \nconstructive step forward--a step that will help millions of Americans. \nAbove all, it is proof positive that progress is again possible on \nhealth reform, and that the ghosts of gridlock for the 1994 debate no \nlonger haunt our work on health care.\n  I urge the Senate to pass this bill by the largest margin possible. \nThe larger the margin, the louder the message, and the more likely the \nSenate-House conferees will send this bill to the President \nexpeditiously, without controversial amendments, and ready for his \nsignature. On this issue, every day we delay is a day that brings \nunnecessary misery to large numbers of our fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Senator from Kansas \nhow H.R. 3103 treats association plans which arrange to provide their \nmembers the option to buy group health insurance. These association \nplans frequently are made up of self-employed individuals or small \nbusinesses. Is it not correct that our legislation imposes no new \nregulatory requirements on association plans, other than the general \nrequirements affecting other health plans?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The bill establishes standards regarding portability, \nrenewability, and pre-existing conditions, but does not otherwise \ndisturb the association plan world. States will still regulate and \ncertify insured plans, and the Secretary of Labor will continue to \nregulate self-insured plans that are currently exempt from State \nregulation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is my understanding that the bill authorizes creation \nof health plan purchasing cooperatives, a concept discussed frequently \nin Congress over the past few years. The purpose of these cooperative \nprovisions is to provide clear statutory authorization and guidance to \ngroups of small employers and individuals who want to join together to \nbuy health insurance at a lower cost. Is there any provision that \nrequires these groups to join or create mandatory purchasing \ncooperatives?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. No. Health purchasing cooperatives are purely \nvoluntary. Subtitle D is intended to create special benefits for \ncooperatives that meet the standards in the bill. Congress does not \nintend that these provisions in any way affect the legal status or \nrights of purchasing cooperatives, employer coalitions, multiemployer \nplans, MEWA's, association plans, or other similar arrangements that do \nnot meet the standards of this subtitle. The statute clearly states \nthis intent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For example, could association plans sponsored by \nprofessional organizations or local chambers of commerce be forced to \nform or join a purchasing cooperative as the result of this bill?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. No. The bill does not require groups to form or join \na purchasing cooperative. Nor does the legislation preclude any other \ntype of groups purchasing arrangements from existing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So aside from having to meet the insurance reforms \ncontained in the bill and standards like portability, renewability, and \npreexisting conditions, your bill does not disturb association plans at \nall?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. That is correct. Congress intends that association \nplans may continue to do business as they always have, except that they \nmust meet the same insurance reform standards as other health plans \nunder the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. An additional matter that I would like to discuss is the \nprovisions under the bill forbidding discrimination in the provision of \nhealth insurance in the group market. Section 101(a)(1)(B) forbids an \nemployee health benefit plan or a health plan issuer from conditioning \neligibility, enrollment, or premium contributions for individual \nparticipants or beneficiaries on health status, medical condition, \nclaims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of \ninsurability, genetic information, or disability. The purpose of this \nprovision is to prevent health plans from denying coverage to \nindividuals or charging them higher premiums because the plan believes \nthey may have higher than average health costs. Is this correct?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes. This provision is meant to prohibit insurers or \nemployers from excluding employees in a group from coverage or charging \nthem higher premiums based on their health status and other related \nfactors that could lead to higher health costs. This does not mean that \nan entire group cannot be charged more. But it does preclude health \nplans from singling out individuals in the group for higher premiums or \ndropping them from coverage altogether.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We intend the words ``health status, medical condition, \nclaims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of \ninsurability, genetic information, or disability'' to have a broad \nmeaning, do we not?\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes. These words are meant to broadly preclude the \nuse of any of the categories insurance companies have historically used \nto deny people coverage based on health status and related factors--\nthat reasonably could lead a health plan to believe that an individual \nwould incur high health costs or be uninsurable. They are meant to \npreclude use of any of the categories insurance companies have \nhistorically used to deny people coverage based on their expected \nhealth costs--not only medical history or the presence of preexisting \nconditions, but also including such factors as family history, \nlikelihood of experiencing domestic violence--or actual experience of \ndomestic violence, genetic predispositions or other genetic \ninformation, or residence in a low-income neighborhood.\n  I want to just mention a few measures that we will have to address in \nthe conference. The Health Insurance Reform Act is a modest, \nresponsible bipartisan solution to many of the most obvious abuses in \nthe health insurance market today. In fact, the only active opposition \nto the legislation comes from those who profit from the abuses in the \ncurrent system. In his State of the Union Address last January, \nPresident Clinton challenged the Congress to pass this bill. Now the \nSenate is poised to fulfill that pledge.\n  Mr. President, the only thing that stands between this bill and the \nPresident's signature are controversial provisions added in the House \nof Representatives. These objectionable provisions include, again, the \nmedical savings accounts which we have debated, the federalization of \nmultiple employer welfare arrangements--Mr. President, I ask for 3 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The federalization of multiple employer welfare \narrangements. A number of years ago we provided the States the power \nfor the enforcement of those arrangements. It is rather strange now \nthat those provisions which permit the States to enforce it are \neffectively being preempted so that the Federal Government will support \nit.\n  Repeal of the MediGap rules protecting senior citizens against \nprofiteers. That is a very dangerous provision. Up to 1984 we found \nthat many elderly people would buy 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 different programs to \ncover various gaps in their insurance. We found all kinds of abuses. We \npassed legislation to deal with that. It has been effective. I am not \nsure that we ought to go back to the earlier period.\n  The provisions making it more difficult to combat waste, fraud and \nabuse in the current Medicare-Medicaid programs, I think that issue is \none that is not going to go away. There are many concerns that the \nprovisions that have been made in the House bill will lower the \nstandard, make it more difficult to prove the abuse and waste and \nfraud. I am not sure we want to go in those directions.\n  I think the malpractice issues have been debated earlier in the \nCongress. I think they ought to be addressed outside of this \nlegislation.\n  We go to that conference in a bipartisan spirit, committed to trying \nto get this legislation--obviously they have a right to pass their \nbills and we have a responsibility to work through the differences--but \nwe hope that, given the spirit with which this legislation started, \nboth in the House and the Senate, that we will be able to do it. Every \nday that is delayed, there are millions of our fellow citizens who are \ndenied the kinds of protections that this legislation will provide for \nthem. It is an extremely important piece of legislation, in many \nrespects I think maybe the most important piece of legislation that we \nwill pass in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I urge the passage of the legislation when the Senate \nvotes on it this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, a vote on passage of \nH.R. 3103, as amended, will occur at 2:15. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage of H.R. 3103.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Before I speak, Mr. President, on the subject that I have chosen here \nfor the next few minutes, I compliment my colleagues from Massachusetts \nand Kansas for the tremendously fine work they have done in this whole \nfield of health care over a long period of time. This, today, I think \nis the culmination of their sincere effort, their tedious effort, and \ncertainly demonstrates their commitment to improving the health care \navailable in our country. So, Mr. President, this Senator certainly \ncongratulates these two fine Senators for their commitment and their \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3827-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3833-S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AT WHAT COST?\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the Senate special Whitewater committee \nresumes its hearings tomorrow. The committee's tentative schedule is, \nas I understand--I am not on the committee--to have a hearing on every \nTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of each week until the authorization \nof the committee expires on June 17, 1996. As I have said before, the \ntime and money being spent by this special committee could be better \nspent on other issues of greater importance and magnitude to this \ncountry of ours.\n  Mr. President, I will take just a moment to discuss, if I might, the \namount of money and the time and the resources being spent on the \nWhitewater investigation, both here and in my home State of Arkansas. \nThe Senate has called 121 witnesses during its 47 days of its special \ncommittee review. In an earlier statement, Mr. President, I mentioned \nthe fact that in 1995 alone the Senate held 34 hearings on Whitewater, \nwhile we held only six hearings on Medicaid funding and only one \nhearing--only one hearing--on Medicare reform. After all the time we \nhave already spent on Whitewater, these types of issues are far more \ndeserving of our attention in the remainder of this session of the \nCongress.\n  However, Mr. President, it is not just the amount of time and money \nthat the Senate has spent on the Whitewater review that concerns me. \nThere is another side of this discussion, and it is the amount of \nmoney, the amount of resources, that our Government has spent on the \nissue of Whitewater.\n  The Senate has spent roughly $1.35 million on its Whitewater \ninvestigation in the 104th Congress. That is just the amount that the \nSenate has specifically appropriated to the Whitewater review panel. \nThis does not include, Mr. President, the money spent by the Senate \nBanking Committee on its Whitewater efforts. It does not include the \namount of money spent by the House of Representatives in its Whitewater \nreview.\n  Of course, it does not even begin to take into consideration the \namount of money spent by our special counsels. In addition to the \ncongressional efforts in this issue, I would also like to discuss the \nindependent counsel review. According to the General Accounting Office, \nRobert Fiske, the special counsel originally named to investigate the \nWhitewater issue, spent $2,498,744 from January 22, 1994, through \nSeptember 30, 1995, which was the latest date which the GAO had this \ninformation. I am sure more tallies will be coming in soon. On his \ninvestigation alone, almost $2.5 million was spent. Then he was fired \nfrom the case. The GAO also points out that Kenneth Starr, the \nindependent counsel appointed to replace Mr. Fiske, has spent \n$4,512,065 from August 5, 1994, through September 30, of 1995. We have \nno more recent figures, Mr. President, since September 30 of last year.\n  But today's Washington Post had an article, I must say, Mr. \nPresident, that caught my attention. It is an article which illustrates \nwhere some of this money is going. Sam Dash, the Watergate chief \ncounsel, famed, well known, well respected, is now being paid $3,200 a \nweek for his service as ethics adviser to Mr. Starr. I am going to \nrepeat that, Mr. President. Sam Dash, the Watergate chief counsel, is \nnow being paid $3,200 each week for his service as ethics adviser to \nMr. Kenneth Starr.\n  Mr. Starr is the first independent counsel in the history of our \nRepublic to see the need to hire an independent counsel that advises \nhim on ethics.\n  I think I echo, Mr. President, the statement made by Stephen Gillers, \na\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nlegal ethics professor and scholar at New York University, who recently \nsaid in a Baltimore Sun article:\n\n       When the public hears that the independent counsel--who is \n     there supposedly because of his distance from the traditional \n     prosecutorial office--needs an independent counsel for ethics \n     advice [at a substantial cost] it's almost impossible to \n     explain how that can be so. The perception is that \n     something's amiss.\n\n  Mr. President, that was Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics scholar from \nNew York University, who made that particular statement.\n  Mr. President, I have other concerns as well. I have recently asked \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation to share with me the five top cases \ncurrently being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \nMr. President, here are the top five cases. One is the Oklahoma City \nbombing. That makes sense. Second, the Unabomber. That makes sense. \nThriftcon--a national bank fraud and embezzlement case. Fourth, Mr. \nPresident, is Whitewater. Fifth is the World Trade Center bombing.\n  Now, this is based upon the number of personnel, the amount of \nresources, the number of dollars, and the establishment of priorities \nof our own Federal Bureau of Investigation. Whitewater, today, comes \nright after Thriftcon, Unabomber, Oklahoma City bombing, and before \nresources and dollars that the Federal Bureau of Investigation have \nused to investigate the World Trade Center bombing in the city of New \nYork. Mr. President, I do not know how in the world we could go home \nand explain such a poor allocation of priorities as the one \ndemonstrated by this particular chart.\n  Mr. President, the money spent by the independent counsel does not \ntell the whole story. Those numbers do not even include the moneys \nspent by the FBI and other agencies to support the independent \ncounsels.\n  Under the statute authorizing the independent counsel, each \nindependent counsel is able to request and receive assistance from \nFederal agencies. Mr. President, most of the independent counsels are \nusing the talents of the Federal employees and the resources of the \nFederal Government available to them. According to the figures supplied \nby GAO, the IRS has spent over $1 million to support the Fiske-Starr \nWhitewater investigation. The Justice Department, apart from the FBI, \nhas spent $86,000 on the investigation. However, Mr. President, the FBI \nhas spent far and away the most money of any agency working for Mr. \nFiske, the former independent counsel, and Mr. Starr, the present \nindependent counsel.\n  According to the numbers reported by the GAO, the FBI spent \n$3,473,000 in support of Mr. Fiske's investigation, and already has \nsurpassed $8,064,000 supplying staff for Mr. Starr's investigation. To \nget a sense of what these figures mean, Mr. President, I asked the FBI \nhow many people that number represents. They told me that the $11.5 \nmillion represents 41 special agents and 81 support staff.\n  Thus far, I know I have thrown around a lot of numbers and my time \nhas expired. When we add everything together, the Whitewater \nindependent counsels have spent $19,673,809, Mr. President, almost $20 \nmillion, in less than a year and a half, has been spent on the \nWhitewater investigation. That, Mr. President, is why I continue to \nhave grave concerns about appropriating any more money to start up the \nsecond phase of the Whitewater investigation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na story in this morning's Washington Post, dated April 23, 1996, and I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article of April \n15, 1996, as published in the Baltimore Sun.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 23, 1996]\n\n                           Say It Again, Sam\n\n                            (By Lloyd Grove)\n\n       He's the brilliant chief counsel of Senate Watergate \n     Committee fame and a drafter of the independent counsel \n     statute. He's an arbiter of professional conduct for the \n     American Bar Association and an oracle of criminal law, an \n     internationally acclaimed advocate for human rights and a \n     widely revered guru of legal ethics.\n       But it seems to have come to this for the distinguished \n     Samuel Dash:\n       ``I don't want to be in a situation where you're asking me \n     a lot of questions and I'm not commenting, and the story \n     makes me look like a Mafia figure who's pleading the Fifth \n     Amendment,'' says Dash, 71. He is beginning an interview \n     about his role as the highly paid ethics adviser to Kenneth \n     Starr, the Whitewater special prosecutor whose own legal \n     ethics come under searing attack.\n       ``Mafia figure''?\n       Surely Sam Dash not has not worked so hard, for so long, to \n     take a swift tumble from wise man to wiseguy. He has spent \n     much of his time in recent weeks mounting pained public \n     defenses of Starr's simultaneous work as a government \n     prosecutor--investigating President Clinton & Co.--and as a \n     private lawyer for an array of corporate clients opposed to \n     the president's policies. But Dash certainly hasn't \n     cultivated his envirable reputation to sell his birthright \n     for a mess of pottage--in this case, a consulting fee of \n     $3,200 a week.\n       In his memo-strewn office at the Georgetown University Law \n     Center, where he has been a full professor for the last three \n     decades, Dash expresses himself in bursts of nervous energy, \n     interrupting his questioner--and frequently himself--to spray \n     fusillades of self-protective verbiage and twist his winding \n     sentences into word-pretzels.\n       ``Once again, I do not want to do an interview,'' he \n     protests. ``It isn't that I haven't been available for \n     interviews. I have. I've helped set a policy now--not because \n     there's anything to hide. I think [Starr's] office has become \n     very visible as a result of these issues, and they have so \n     much important work to do, it's all distracting the work to \n     always--even when they to read about what I may be saying--it \n     distracts the work and calls for [phone] calls and things \n     like that, but I don't want, I really don't want to be \n     distracting anymore.''\n       Dash, whose regular public statements about the work of the \n     special prosecutor have made him something of a de facto \n     spokesman for the press-averse Starr, is providing more than \n     his share of distractions. In the past few weeks, he has been \n     forced to justify his recently revealed consulting fee-\n     astronomical by government standards. And he has been caught \n     defending Starr's behavior while, at the same time, appearing \n     to criticize it in publications ranging from the New York \n     Observer (with which he has tangled over the accuracy of \n     damaging quotes) to the New Yorker.\n       He may have had enough of the hot seat. Dash says he'll \n     suspend his Starr consultancy as of May 23, to spend two \n     months on a long-planned teaching vacation in Europe. He \n     won't commit himself to returning to Starr's employ. ``If Ken \n     asks me, I'll consider it,'' is as far as he'll go.\n       Dash presents himself as a man who wants, in so many words, \n     to have and eat his cake.\n       He was cited by the New Yorker's Jane Mayer as giving his \n     seal of approval to Starr's pursuit of a million-dollar \n     private practice--even though he wished Starr wouldn't to it: \n     ``If I had my own preferences, I'd hope he'd be a full-time \n     independent counsel. . . . What he's doing is proper. . . . \n     But it does have an odor to it.''\n       Dash explains that what he actually meant to say is that \n     others, but not he, might detect an ordor--as though recusing \n     his sense of smell. Trying to move away from another \n     published statement, he says, with an insistence on \n     precision: ``I didn't use the word `proper.' `Proper' is a \n     weasel word. I think what I tried to say--and maybe I \n     misstated--is everything he's doing is `legal' and `ethical' \n     and `lawful'--not `proper.' ''\n       On the issue of whether he wants Starr to be a full-time \n     prosecutor, Dash is equally microscopic. ``I didn't say, `I \n     wish he would be.' I say: `I prefer he would be.' No, no, no: \n     `My preference is . . .' ''\n       Why the hair-splitting? Isn't it all the same thing?\n       ``It is essentially the same thing,'' he concedes with a \n     deep breath. ``I'm not trying to split hairs. All I'm saying \n     is, I am expressing myself as an independent person. I'm not \n     saying I would do the same thing he would do.'' Yet a moment \n     later Dash draws another fine distinction. ``I'm not passing \n     on his judgment. I don't think I have the right to. If I were \n     a private independent professor . . . I could speak freely my \n     mind. But--''\n       Wait a minute. So he's not independent?\n       ``I may be constrained, but I'm only constrained because \n     when I speak I can't speak as Sam Dash, private [citizen]. I \n     am speaking as Sam Dash in the role of ethics counsel to Ken \n     Starr and the office. Therefore, I don't have a right . .  to \n     express judgments which I could have as an independent \n     person. I don't even know why it's relevant.''\n       Does Dash at least know the identity of all Starr's private \n     clients?\n       ``I'm not sure,'' he says. ``The relationship isn't one in \n     which, like coming to Mommy, he has to tell me. `Can I do \n     this? Can I do that? . . . He has to bring to my attention \n     any situation that he feels could possibly be considered a \n     problem. I would think as a lawyer, and he's been a federal \n     judge, he's been a solicitor general, with his reputation for \n     integrity--and he does have it--that he doesn't have to come \n     to me initially. His first screen is himself.''\n       In the New Yorker, Dash bemoaned the dismissal of Robert \n     Fiske, Starr's predecessor as Whitewater prosecutor. (Dash \n     went to work for Starr in the fall of 1994, initially for a \n     weekly fee of $1,600, long after Fiske was gone.) ``Should \n     Fiske have been reappointed? My answer is probably yes,'' \n     Dash mused to the magazine. ``It may have been a mistake'' to \n     remove him. ``But that's not Ken's fault.''\n       A month after signing him up, Starr doubled Dash's \n     compensation (billed as eight\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\n     hours of work a week at $400 per hour). And he broadened his \n     role from simply ethics to advising on prosecutorial strategy \n     and a host of other issues. The money is clearly a sore spot \n     for Dash.\n       ``I'm putting in not eight hours, I'm putting in 20 to 30 \n     hours,'' he says. ``If one were to take what I'm being paid \n     and divided it into the hours I'm working, I'm being paid at \n     what a paralegal earns in most law firms''--a debatable \n     claim, to be sure.\n       Last Wednesday, Dash had the novel (for him) experience of \n     receiving a hard editorial slap from the New York Times. The \n     paper demanded that Starr give up the ``major national \n     responsibility'' of Whitewater prosecutor because of his \n     ``conspicuously fastpaced and politically freighted private \n     practice,'' and added sharply: ``Mr. Dash is right about the \n     odor, but wrong about the propriety.''\n       ``I'll just say this to that,'' Dash says dismissively. ``I \n     testify all over the country as an expert [on legal ethics], \n     and judges ask me about the law and I answer. I don't recall \n     a single time when any judge of a federal court or a state \n     court ever asked me: `What does the New York Times think?' ''\n       He displays less equanimity when it comes to other critics, \n     such as Democratic spinmeister James Carvell--the public \n     voice of the White House's energetic campaign to undermine \n     Starr's integrity as the Whitewater special prosecutor.\n       ``If Sam Dash was my doctor, I'd be happy,'' Carville says. \n     ``If you wanna smoke, fine. High blood pressure? Fine. Eat a \n     lot of steaks and drink some whiskey! Go ahead, I'm not \n     worried. He's the Alfred E. Neuman of ethics counselors. he \n     doesn't worry about anything.''\n       ``What does he know? '' Dash demands with a frown. ``He \n     doesn't know what I'm doing, he doesn't know who I am. Maybe \n     he does know who I am. But he actually should be very \n     grateful that I am in this position--that at least somebody \n     like me is doing this. . . . But by challenging my \n     independence and the professional role I play, he in effect \n     is harming his own partisan interests. And I'm not a partisan \n     and my role is not to protect anybody, but it certainly is to \n     see that this prosecution is conducted fairly and objectively \n     without any political overtones to it.''\n       But that is quite impossible. The Starr matter has become \n     intensely political--for Rep. Martin Meehan (D-Mass.), a \n     harsh critic of Starr, the political overtones are all but \n     deafening. ``I thought it was a good political move by Starr \n     to pick Sam Dash, with his outstanding reputation. . . . \n     Clearly his role is to provide advice to Mr. Starr, and that \n     advice is interpreting technically the basis upon which Starr \n     can justify his representing a tobacco company and other \n     clients. And Mr. Dash makes statements giving technical, \n     legal interpretations on why it's okay.''\n       New York University Law School Professor Stephen Gillers \n     agrees.\n       ``I think Starr was wise, even brilliant, to choose Sam \n     Dash, because of Sam's prestige and credibility with the \n     media. That has given Starr some cover, which actually worked \n     for a while to stave off criticism. But Sam Dash has no \n     cover. Sam is exposed in ways that I don't think he fully \n     could have anticipated.''\n       Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Tribe is also \n     concerned about Dash's exposure. ``I would not have agreed to \n     play that role,'' he says. ``I would feel ethically \n     compromised. Providing legal consultation and trying to make \n     legal arguments on behalf of the independent counsel is one \n     thing. But I wouldn't want in effect to be allowing my \n     reputation to be used as a shield for someone whose \n     circumstances, in the end, I don't have the ability to \n     influence. That would make me feel extremely uncomfortable.''\n       Dash insists that such worries are misplaced.\n       ``I'm not giving Ken Starr my reputation,'' he says. ``I'm \n     giving him my expertise.''\n       He adds that Starr and others in the prosecutor's office \n     are following his advice. And Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell, \n     a longtime acquaintance, finds this claim persuasive.\n       ``Sam Dash isn't a shrinking violet,'' Lowell says. ``He \n     wouldn't have gotten involved in this if he didn't think he \n     could have an important impact. To say he's a fig leaf for \n     Ken Starr does an injustice to Sam Dash.''\n       For his part, Dash sees his current preoccupation as a \n     fitting capstone to a career in which he has been, by turns, \n     the district attorney in Philadelphia, a hero of Watergate, a \n     legal theoretician and international human rights activist, \n     the first American citizen to visit Nelson Mandela in a South \n     African jail.\n       ``I'm not a stranger to controversy,'' Dash says. ``And I \n     don't want to look like I run away from it. I think Harry \n     Truman's statement was correct: If you can't stand the heat, \n     get out of the kitchen. I like being in the kitchen.''\n       But the Cuisinart?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 15, 1996]\n\nEthics Insurance at $3,200 a week; Whitewater Counsel's Adviser Assumes \n                         a Larger Role in Probe\n\n                            (By Susan Baer)\n\n       Washington--Samuel Dash, the celebrated lawyer who was \n     hired by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr in \n     1994 to advise him on ethics issues, is now playing a much \n     broader role in the investigation--and collecting a sizable \n     government-paid fee for his services.\n       Mr. Dash said that while Mr. Starr hired him to work on \n     ethics questions, he is now weighing in on everything from \n     prosecutorial strategy to dealing with witnesses.\n       ``He's asked me to go beyond ethics issues,'' said Mr. \n     Dash, a 71-year-old full-time law professor at Georgetown \n     University who gained fame as chief counsel to the Senate \n     Watergate Committee.\n       For his part-time services--which include advising Mr. \n     Starr on how much of his $1 million-a-year private law \n     practice he may retain while leading the government's \n     Whitewater investigation--Mr. Dash is paid a flat fee of \n     $3,200 a week.\n       The professor, whose pay was raised by Mr. Starr from \n     $1,600 a week in July, said he works an average of 20 hours a \n     week, sometimes up to 30 hours, for the Whitewater \n     prosecutor, but is charging Mr. Starr for only eight hours a \n     week, at his regular consulting rate of $400 an hour.\n       ``This is pro bono,'' Mr. Dash said with a laugh, referring \n     to the public-interest work lawyers do for no pay.\n       When it was suggested to him that only by superlawyer \n     standards would $3,200 a week be considered ``pro bono,'' he \n     said, with apologies for immodesty, ``People of my stature \n     charge way more than I do.''\n       Mr. Dash, whose Whitewater pay was disclosed recently by \n     the Arkansas Times, was hired by Mr. Starr in October 1994, \n     two months after Mr. Starr was chosen to head the inquiry, \n     which reaches up to the Clinton presidency.\n       A highly respected lawyer and a Democrat, Mr. Dash was \n     retained to calm concerns about Mr. Starr's impartiality, \n     given his background as an active and partisan Republican, \n     and his selection by judges with ties to conservative \n     Republicans.\n       In the 1970s, Mr. Dash assisted Chief Justice Warren E. \n     Burger in devising the American Bar Association's ethical \n     standards for prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers.\n       Mr. Dash, who also helped draft the law that established \n     the independent counsel's office, noted that he is the first \n     person to be an outside ethics adviser to an independent \n     counsel.\n       ``This is somewhat unique,'' Mr. Dash said. ``Starr felt \n     when he was appointed, fairly or unfairly, there was quite a \n     bit of criticism because he was a partisan Republican. There \n     was some concern, at the White House and other places, that \n     he may not be objective.\n       ``My personal belief is he didn't need me. But he was \n     thinking of perception problems. He thought it was proper, to \n     preserve public confidence, to bring someone like me in. He \n     felt he needed somebody to assure the public that his \n     decisions are being made on the basis of the right \n     judgments.''\n       Mr. Dash's weekly fee would amount to an annual rate of \n     about $160,000 a year. But officials with Mr. Starr's office \n     have said he won't receive that much because they are \n     applying to Mr. Dash, an independent contractor, the same \n     salary cap of $115,700 that applies to employees of the \n     independent counsel's office. So far, Mr. Dash has been paid \n     $147,200 for the 16 months he has worked for Mr. Starr.\n       Many lawyers believe the hiring of Mr. Dash was a masterful \n     strategic move by Mr. Starr, insulating him from political-\n     bias charges by having a prominent Democrat look over his \n     shoulder each step of the way.\n       But some have questioned the need for such a sizable \n     expense, given that an independent counsel is hired precisely \n     because of his or her ostensible impartiality.\n       Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel in the Iran-\n     contra case, said he thought it was ``regrettable'' that such \n     an expense must be incurred to ensure the perception of \n     objectivity.\n\n\n                          a defensive measure\n\n       ``It's really a defensive measure,'' said Mr. Walsh, a \n     Republican former federal judge. ``But the question is, why \n     do you get in a position where you have to defend yourself? \n     The real thing [an independent counsel] brings that nobody \n     else can bring is his independence. That's the excuse for \n     this very expensive procedure.''\n       Mr. Walsh said that during the Iran-contra investigation, \n     he sought the help of Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law \n     professor, for ethics concerns about the publication of his \n     final report. But, he said, Mr. Tribe did not accept a fee.\n       Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York \n     University who was critical of Mr. Starr's appointment \n     because of his history as an outspoken Republican, said he \n     thought such a six-figure expense could be damaging.\n       ``When the public hears that the independent counsel--who \n     is there supposedly because of his distance from the \n     traditional prosecutorial office--needs an independent \n     counsel for ethics advice [at a substantial cost], it's \n     almost impossible to explain how that can be so,'' Mr. \n     Gillers said. ``The perception is that something's amiss.''\n       Mr. Starr did not respond to questions, submitted to him in \n     writing, regarding Mr. Dash's role and pay.\n       Terry Eastland, author of a book on independent counsels, \n     said he did not consider the expense for an ethics consultant \n     unreasonable. ``Lawyers are expensive,'' he said.\n       And other ethics consultants say $400 an hour is reasonable \n     for top-level experts, although they also say they bill far \n     less--and occasionally, nothing--if the government is the \n     client.\n       Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., a University of Pennsylvania law \n     professor and ethics consultant, called Mr. Dash's fee as a \n     part-time adviser ``pretty high pay.'' But, he added,\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\n     ``The value of having somebody just a little bit more \n     credible is very high.''\n       So far, the independent counsel's Whitewater inquiry has \n     cost about $26 million. Mr. Starr is spending about $1 \n     million a month on the investigation.\n       Mr. Dash said he may suspend has involvement this summer, \n     when he plans to serve as a visiting professor at the \n     University of Heidelberg Law School in Germany.\n       For now, Mr. Dash said, his work for the Whitewater office \n     includes such activities as advising Mr. Starr on whether \n     there is enough evidence to sustain a charge, reviewing all \n     cases referred to the grand jury, and consulting on issues of \n     fairness.\n       For example, when false reports surfaced that Gov. Jim Guy \n     Tucker of Arkansas had sought a plea bargain after being \n     indicted, Mr. Starr asked Mr. Dash for advice on whether the \n     usual policy of issuing a ``no comment'' to questions about \n     the case should be followed, according to Mr. Dash.\n       The ethics counselor advised Mr. Starr that the more proper \n     response, in fairness to Mr. Tucker, was to issue a statement \n     denying the accuracy of the reports.\n       Mr. Dash has also been advising Mr. Starr on the propriety \n     of the private work he has continued to do. Critics have \n     charged that Mr. Starr, who earned $1.1 million in private \n     practice in 1994, is spending too much time on lucrative \n     high-profile cases for his firm, some of which could \n     compromise--or appear to compromise--his independence as \n     special counsel.\n       For instance, Mr. Starr has argued a federal appeals case \n     on behalf of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., and has \n     represented Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a potential \n     Republican vice presidential nominee, in school-voucher case \n     before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\n\n                      conflict of interest alleged\n\n       Rep. Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote to Mr. \n     Starr last week, imploring him to end his representation of \n     the tobacco company on the ground that it created a conflict \n     of interest because President Clinton has been an opponent of \n     big tobacco.\n       A potential problem area--cited by those who believe Mr. \n     Starr should have taken a leave from his law firm, the \n     Chicago-based Kirkland & Ellis--is a lawsuit filed against \n     the firm by the Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency that \n     figures prominently in the Whitewater affair.\n       Defending his private work, Mr. Starr, in an address last \n     week in San Antonio, said: ``My ethics counselor is Professor \n     Sam Dash of Georgetown University, legend of Watergate fame, \n     and he has affirmed that it's completely appropriate.''\n       Mr. Dash said that while he has advised Mr. Starr that \n     there is nothing wrong, legally or ethically, with his \n     outside work, his own ``preference''--``because of questions \n     reasonable people ask'' about conflicts--is that Mr. Starr \n     not take on as much.\n       ``I have discussed with him that he should take heed, and I \n     think he will take heed,'' Mr. Dash said. ``He is concerned. \n     But he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong. I tell him \n     he's not doing anything wrong.''\n       Richard Ben-Veniste, the Democratic counsel for the Senate \n     Whitewater Committee who was an assistant to the Watergate \n     special prosecutor, said Mr. Starr's full plate of outside \n     work illustrates the need for Mr. Dash's services.\n       ``Given the list of things Mr. Starr is engaged in outside \n     of his job as independent counsel, he's kept Mr. Dash pretty \n     busy,'' Mr. Ben-Veniste said.\n       ``I think Sam's earning his money.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I heard the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas say something that struck me. All this money that is being \nspent is taxpayers' money?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Every bit is taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been reading a number of articles in the national \npress raising some very serious questions about the appearance of \nconflict of interest on the part of Mr. Starr, the special prosecutor. \nAs a former prosecutor myself, I feel strongly that there is at the \nvery least an appearance of a conflict of interest. But notwithstanding \nwhat appears to be conflict of interest, are you telling me that he is \npaying somebody out of tax money, on a part-time basis, the equivalent \nof about $160,000 a year to give him ethical advice?\n  Mr. PRYOR. This is the first time, I answer my friend from Vermont, \nin the history of all of the legal independent counsels that we have \nhad, that an independent counsel has felt the necessity of retaining an \nethics attorney or an ethics adviser. In this one, the taxpayers are \npaying $3,200 each week. I imagine that is more than a member--I do not \nknow what a member of the Supreme Court gets.\n  Mr. LEAHY. A member of a Supreme Court who works full time is paid \nless. The attorney retained as the ethics adviser is, I realize, a \nwonderful man and a good friend of mine, but this is extraordinary--\nthis ethics adviser is paid on a part-time basis with taxpayer money?\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is correct. He is a fine law professor. Mr. Starr \ngave him this job in order to advise Mr. Starr on ethics. I do not know \none time yet that Mr. Dash has not told Mr. Starr what he was doing was \nOK, including making $1.3 million last year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3833-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE \n                   COVERAGE FOR ALL CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health care coverage of mothers and children in the \n     United States is unacceptable, with more than 9,300,000 \n     children and 500,000 expectant mothers having no health \n     insurance.\n       (2) Among industrial nations, the United States ranks 1st \n     in wealth but 18th in infant mortality, and 14th among such \n     nations in maternal mortality.\n       (3) 22 percent of pregnant women do not have prenatal care \n     in the first trimester, and 22 percent of all poor children \n     are uninsured, despite the medicaid program under title XIX \n     of the Social Security Act.\n       (4) Of the 1,100,000 net increase in uninsured persons from \n     1992 to 1993, 84 percent or 922,500 were children.\n       (5) Since 1987, the number of children covered by \n     employment based health insurance has decreased, and many \n     children lack health insurance despite the relative \n     affordability of providing insurance for children.\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\n       (6) Health care coverage for children is relatively \n     inexpensive and in 1993 the medicaid program spent an average \n     of $1,012 per child compared to $8,220 per elderly adult.\n       (7) Uninsured children are generally children of lower \n     income workers, who are less likely than higher income \n     workers to have health insurance for their families because \n     they are less likely to work for a firm that offers \n     insurance, and if such insurance is offered, it is often too \n     costly for lower income workers to purchase.\n       (8) In 1993, 61 percent of uninsured children were in \n     families with at least one parent working full time for the \n     entire year the child was uninsured, and about 57 percent of \n     uninsured children had a family income at or below 150 \n     percent of the Federal poverty level.\n       (9) If Congress eliminates the Federal guarantee of \n     medicaid, an estimated 4,900,000 children may lose their \n     guarantee of health care coverage, and those same children \n     may be added to the currently projected 12,600,000 children \n     who will be uninsured by the year 2002.\n       (10) Studies have shown that uninsured children are less \n     likely than insured children to receive needed health and \n     preventive care, which can affect their health status \n     adversely throughout their lives, with such children less \n     likely to have routine doctor visits, receive care for \n     injuries, and have a regular source of medical care.\n       (11) The families of uninsured children are more likely to \n     take the children to an emergency room than to a private \n     physician or health maintenance organization.\n       (12) Children without health insurance are less likely to \n     be appropriately immunized or receive other preventive care \n     for childhood illnesses.\n       (13) Ensuring the health of children clearly increases \n     their chances to become productive members of society and \n     averts more serious or more expensive health conditions later \n     in life, and ensuring that all pregnant women receive \n     competent prenatal care also saves social costs.\n       (14) Although the United States has made great improvements \n     in health care coverage through the medicaid program, it is \n     still the only developed nation that does not ensure that all \n     of its children and pregnant women have health care coverage.\n       (15) The United States should not accept a status quo in \n     which children in many neighborhoods are more likely to have \n     access to drugs and guns than to doctors, or accept a status \n     quo in which health care is ensured for all prisoners but not \n     for all children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the issue of adequate health care for our mothers and \n     children is important to the future of the United States, and \n     in consideration of the importance of such issue, the Senate \n     should pass health care legislation that will ensure health \n     care coverage for all of the United States's pregnant women \n     and children.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AVAILABLE TREATMENTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate finds that \n     patients deserve to know the full range of treatments \n     available to them and Congress should thoughtfully examine \n     these issues to ensure that all patients get the care they \n     deserve.\n\n     SEC. 310.

the taxpayer during the 6 most \n     recent taxable years beginning before January 1, 1996. At the \n     election of the taxpayer who made such loans during each of \n     such 6 taxable years, the preceding sentence shall be applied \n     without regard to the taxable year in which such principal \n     amount was the highest and the taxable year in such principal \n     amount was the lowest. Such an election may be made only for \n     the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1995, \n     and, if made for such taxable year, shall apply to the \n     succeeding taxable year unless revoked with the consent of \n     the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate.\n       (E) Controlled groups.--In the case of a taxpayer which is \n     a member of any controlled group of corporations described in \n     section 1563(a)(1) of such Code, subparagraph (B) shall be \n     applied with respect to such group.\n       (5) Continued application of fresh start under section 585 \n     transitional rules.--In the case of a taxpayer to which \n     paragraph (1) applied and which was not a large bank (as \n     defined in section 585(c)(2) of such Code) for its first \n     taxable year beginning after December 31, 1995:\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n       (A) In general.--For purposes of determining the net amount \n     of adjustments referred to in section 585(c)(3)(A)(iii) of \n     such Code, there shall be taken into account only the excess \n     of the reserve for bad debts as of the close of the last \n     taxable year before the disqualification year over the \n     balance taken into account by such taxpayer under paragraph \n     (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection.\n       (B) Treatment under elective cut-off method.--For purposes \n     of applying section 585(c)(4) of such Code--\n       (i) the balance of the reserve taken into account under \n     subparagraph (B) thereof shall be reduced by the balance \n     taken into account by such taxpayer under paragraph \n     (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection, and\n       (ii) no amount shall be includible in gross income by \n     reason of such reduction.\n       (6) Continued application of section 593(e).--\n     Notwithstanding the amendments made by this section, in the \n     case of a taxpayer to which paragraph (1) of this subsection \n     applies, section 593(e) of such Code (as in effect on the day \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act) shall continue \n     to apply to such taxpayer as if such taxpayer were a domestic \n     building and loan association but the amount of the reserves \n     taken into account under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section \n     593(e)(1) (as so in effect) shall be the balance taken into \n     account by such taxpayer under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this \n     subsection.\n       (7) Certain items included as section 381(c) items.--The \n     balance of the applicable excess reserves, and the balance \n     taken into account by a taxpayer under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) \n     of this subsection, shall be treated as items described in \n     section 381(c) of such Code.\n       (8) Conversions to credit unions.--In the case of a \n     taxpayer to which paragraph (1) applied which becomes a \n     credit union described in section 501(c)(14)(A)--\n       (A) any amount required to be included in the gross income \n     of the credit union by reason of this subsection shall be \n     treated as derived from an unrelated trade or business (as \n     defined in section 513), and\n       (B) for purposes of paragraph (3), the credit union shall \n     not be treated as if it were a bank.\n       (9) Regulations.--The Secretary of the Treasury or the \n     Secretary's delegate shall prescribe such regulations as may \n     be necessary to carry out this subsection, including \n     regulations providing for the application of paragraphs (4) \n     and (6) in the case of acquisitions, mergers, spin-offs, and \n     other reorganizations.\n                      Subtitle C--Other Provisions\n\n     SEC. 621.

The clerk will now report Senate Joint \nResolution 21.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 21) proposing a \n     constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 3:45 is equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, who controls the time? I would like to \nspeak in favor of the matter before the Senate. My understanding is the \nSenator from Tennessee or the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is divided between the Senate \nmajority leader and the Senate minority leader or their designees.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I inquire of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee if I might have 5 minutes within which to speak in favor \nof the pending matter.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I intend to vote in favor of the \nconstitutional amendment limiting the number of terms Members of \nCongress can serve.\n  I voted for a similar sense-of-the-Senate amendment on October 17, \n1995, and despite the clarity of my position and the documented record \nthereof in the Senate, the official records of my votes are continually \ndistorted by my detractors. But that is nothing new in the life of a \nSenator. I wish to say exactly what I believe on this issue.\n  I think the public is entitled to a national referendum on this \nissue, and the procedures outlined by the Constitution of the United \nStates as to how the Nation addresses such an issue are very clear. It \nis not the duty nor the power of the Congress to enact this. It has to \nbe done by the requisite number of State legislatures, and I am highly \nin favor of that process beginning at the earliest possible date.\n  In my view, however, we already have term limits, and should this \ndebate unfold in my State and across America, I will take an active \nrole in it, and I will address my concerns about the adoption of such \nan amendment.\n  I feel the current constitutional procedures for the election of U.S. \nSenators and Members of the House of Representatives are themselves \nadequate protection that could be afforded by any constitutional \namendment. It gives the right of the electorate of the States to make \ntheir own decision, as they think best for their State at that point in \ntime, as it relates to their Senators and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Finally, I am concerned about if we were to adopt for the Nation such \na procedure that we would be shifting too much power to the executive \nbranch and also, too, I say candidly, to those individuals who have \nspent much time here in the U.S. Senate as very capable, very \nknowledgeable, well trained, dedicated and committed staff persons. If \nthey were to stay here for periods much longer than their respective \ncommittee chairmen, for example, or Senators themselves, it seems to me \nthat, too, adds to the imbalance of power.\n  Then it comes to the question of the seniority procedures and \ntradition in the U.S. Senate. Seniority is a very important part of the \nrules and traditions\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nfollowed by both sides of the aisle, particularly as it relates to the \nelection of committee chairmen or ranking members. That system was \nadopted because earlier procedures by the Senate were found to lend \nthemselves to what I call pleasing politics. In other words, an \nindividual would run for chairmanship of a committee and promise and \npromise to all the members of the committee that whatever they brought \nup, he or she would vote for.\n  Fortunately, in the period I have been privileged to serve in the \nU.S. Senate on behalf of Virginia, we have had very strong and resolute \nchairmen in the several committees on which I have served. I mention \nonly the Senate Armed Services Committee. Richard Russell, John \nStennis, John Tower, Barry Goldwater and now Strom Thurmond, Scoop \nJackson for a period and Sam Nunn. What finer men have ever served in \nthe U.S. Senate. But they had to make tough decisions, often inimical \nand in opposition to their own colleagues of their own party. But they \ncould do so knowing full well that the traditions of how one becomes \neventually a chairman could withstand what I call the politics of \ntrying to please everyone.\n  If a chairman has to please everyone, in my mind it is very doubtful \nthat you will have the strong leadership that is needed in the office \nof chairman and in the ranking member of our committees.\n  So I put that out as an open question, and I hope we might address it \nin the context of this amendment.\n  Madam President, I thank the distinguished floor leaders for the \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes in the absence \nof anyone else, and then 5 minutes to the Senator from California and 5 \nminutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Madam President, I think I can speak without anyone saying, ``He is \ntrying to help himself,'' because I am going to be retiring at the end \nof this year.\n  Government is complicated. No one here would go to the yellow pages \nof their phone book when they had plumbing difficulties and get a \nplumber and he advertises, ``I have no experience with plumbing, call'' \nwhatever the number is. If that is true with something as relatively \nsimple as plumbing, it is infinitely more true of the decisions that we \nhave to make in this body.\n\n  Bennett Johnston, for example, who is retiring, has huge knowledge in \nthe scientific area that I think is unequaled in this body. Meaning no \ndisrespect to whomever may succeed him, that person is not going to \nhave that kind of knowledge.\n  Senator Byrd brings a wealth of knowledge here from that experience. \nOn the other side of the aisle, a former colleague of yours and mine, \nMadam President, Henry Hyde--I differ with Congressman Henry Hyde on a \nlot of things, but he is a class act. He brings a wealth of experience, \nand he has improved the end product of the laws of our country because \nof what he has contributed. To cut off a Henry Hyde or a Bennett \nJohnston or a Robert Byrd arbitrarily and take that decision away from \nthe people of the Nation and of their respective States and districts, \nI think, is wrong. This is a constitutional amendment that should be \ndefeated.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President. I think the remarks \nof the Senator from Illinois are very important.\n  I want to put on the table my position on term limits which is, I \nsupport them if they are applied retroactively to all of us, to sitting \nofficeholders. I had planned to support an amendment which Senator \nLeahy had planned to offer to make these term limits apply \nretroactively. Unfortunately, through a series of parliamentary \nmaneuvers known as ``filling the amendment tree,'' the Republican \nleadership has made it impossible for us to amend this resolution. It \nis either up or down. So here we are unable to make these term limits \napply to us.\n  Advocates of this proposal assert that in its present form, it limits \nSenators to two terms. That is simply untrue. Without retroactivity, \nSenators in this Chamber--every one of us--can serve an additional two \nterms if this amendment passes.\n  That is very convenient for Members here, but it really, to me, does \nnot get at the issue of term limits.\n  Let me cite two specific examples. Under this proposal, the majority \nleader would be limited to seven terms, or 42 years, in the U.S. \nSenate. The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee will \nbe limited to nine terms, or 54 years, in the U.S. Senate.\n  I do not think that most supporters of term limits will be satisfied \nwith so-called limits that allow politicians to stay in office for more \nthan half a century.\n  One Senator now serving in this body was serving here before another \nsitting Senator was 2 years old. It is incredible that the Members who \nwould be serving over 50 years or 42 years are going to vote for this \nterm-limit proposal.\n  So I think the situation undermines the credibility of the Senate. We \ncannot offer amendments, we cannot make it apply to us, and I do not \nthink we should be congratulating ourselves for supporting term limits \nwhen it is obvious that the limits proposed are little more than what I \nconsider to be a sham for every Member serving in this Chamber. It is \nmore of ``do as I say not as I do,'' and I think the public is very \ntired of that.\n  So let us offer our retroactivity amendment and not exempt ourselves \nfrom this law. Perhaps the majority leader will allow us that chance if \nwe vote down cloture. Let me be clear. At that time, if we vote down \ncloture and the majority leader allows us a vote on retroactivity, I \nwill support cloture. I think it is very important that we be allowed \nto make sure that this amendment that so many are congratulating \nthemselves on applies to each and every one of us.\n  I thank the Chair very much. I believe Senator Bradley now has 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the cloture \nmotion. I oppose term limits at this time. I think the answer to the \nproblems of democracy is not less democracy, but is more democracy. Why \nshould we say to people in this country who want a particular Senator \nor Congressman to return to office that they arbitrarily cannot return \nthem to office?\n  I also regret the parliamentary circumstance here, the constitutional \namendment on term limits. Many of us believe that the problems of \ndemocracy have deeper root causes than Senators and Congressmen staying \nin office more than 12 years and that, indeed, money is at the root of \nthe problem in our democracy.\n  I had hoped to be able to offer a constitutional amendment as an \namendment here in these proceedings that would allow the Congress and \nthe States to limit what an individual may spend on his or her \ncampaign. In my view, it is money that is creating a much greater \nproblem for our democracy than somebody staying in office for 13 years.\n  I think fundamental campaign finance reform is what we need. I think \nit has to be radical. I think money and politics is a little bit like \nants in your kitchen--you either have to get them all out, block all \nthe holes, or some of them are going to find a way in.\n  A fundamental campaign finance reform proposal would be limits in \nprimaries and would be also, I think, financing the election in the \ngeneral election, dividing it equally among Republican, Democrat, and \nqualified independents, and it would mean a constitutional amendment. \nThat would allow the Congress and States to limit what an individual \nspends on his or her own campaign. Everybody knows that a wealthy \nperson has a microphone and everybody else has a megaphone here. The \nability to raise money is often the prerequisite for deciding to run \nfor Congress.\n  When everybody goes in to visit their campaign committee, whether it \nis Republican or Democrat, the first question that is asked them is \nnot, ``Gee, have you been a good citizen? Do you have a good record? Do \nyou have ideas on how to make the country better? Are you willing to \nput yourself on the\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\nline to do that? Are you willing to stand up for your convictions?'' It \nis, ``Can you raise $1 million?'' Better yet, ``Do you have $1 million \nto spend on your campaign?''\n\n  Imagine a world in which there are term limits, but without strong \ncampaign finance laws. How is democracy going to be improved? You will \nhave the Senators and Congressmen coming from the same cast, raising \nmoney from the same sources, in some cases financing their own \ncampaigns themselves, and will simply have a more active turnover of \nthe same problem that we have now. It will not solve the problem--money \nin politics--which is the root cause of a lot of our problems. It will \nsimply bring more people who are dependent on a special interest who \nhave to finance their own campaigns themselves.\n  On the other hand, imagine a campaign or situation where you had \nstrong finance laws but no term limits. Imagine general elections where \nRepublicans and Democrats divided the money in a fund and they each had \nequal amounts of money, and the money could only come from people in \ntheir own State, and that is all the money that they had to spend. You \nwould then have the possibility of a battle of ideas. There is no \npossibility of a battle of ideas where money dominates the process as \nmuch as it does today. Even if term limits passes but we do not address \nthe issue of money in politics, we are not going to have as vibrant a \ndemocracy as we otherwise could have. There are no two ways about that.\n  I rise today simply to make this point because I had hoped, as I said \nearlier, to offer an amendment, a constitutional amendment, that would \nallow the Congress and the States to limit what an individual can spend \non his or her own campaign as a part of an overall campaign finance \nproposal. Unfortunately, I cannot do that. I regret that I cannot do \nthat because of the parliamentary circumstance. I hope that I will \nbefore the end of this Congress. I think it is absolutely essential. \nAnything that fails to address the issue of money in politics and \nclaims to be the answer to the problems of democracy is false \nadvertising. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator. I thank him for his effort to bring \nthis issue to the floor. It is an issue certainly that all of us who \nwere elected in 1994 had a great interest in because that is what \npeople were talking about. Frankly, had it not been for the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and the Senator from Missouri and the leader, we would \nnot be here talking about it.\n\n  I rise in strong support of Senate Joint Resolution 21 as a cosponsor \nof the bill and a long-time advocate of responding to the voice of \nvoters and the voice of the people. I am pleased that the Senate will \nfinally go on record on this important issue.\n  Obviously, there are different points of view about it. We have heard \na number of things just in the last few minutes. Let me comment on some \nof them.\n  One of them is the idea of amending. That certainly, if I ever heard \na political response, is one. The Senator from California would not \nvote for this under any circumstances. So the idea that it cannot be \namended to be retroactive is simply an obstruction to what we are \ntrying to do.\n  Limiting dollars. We have talked about that a lot. I think it is a \ngreat idea. The only trouble is it does not work. How are you going to \ndo that? Reporting is the best issue. Talk about limiting dollars that \ncan be spent by candidates, we are looking this year at the AFL-CIO \nspending $35 million, which would not count because they are not in the \ncampaign.\n  You have heard a little bit about the idea of people having the \nchance to make their own choice. It makes some sense. They are going to \nhave a chance to make a choice. This is a constitutional amendment. The \nCongress does not pass this; it simply submits it to the States. The \npeople will have an opportunity to express their feeling on it. This \ncomes up from time to time.\n  I hear it at home, ``Well, you know, if the folks in that district \nwant someone to continue to serve, they should be able to.'' I thought \nabout that some. I was in the House before I came here. One of the very \ngood Members of the House just 2 years ago had been in the House since \nbefore Pearl Harbor. I simply want to make the point that that person, \nwho had a congressional district, as I did, had 10 times as much thrust \nin the Congress as I did because of the seniority. So the people from \nevery other congressional district had no input into that. But the \nfolks in that district are never going to change because here is a guy \nwho has more authority than anybody else in the Congress. Of course, he \nis going to continue to be there. That is kind of what we are up \nagainst, it seems to me.\n  In 1992, 77 percent of the Wyoming voters supported term limits, and \n70 to 80 percent of Americans support term limits. I think it is \nimportant to note that the majority and the freshmen who came in last \nyear support term limits, people who were elected last year when the \nvoters were saying, ``Yes, we're for term limits.''\n\n  I think it is important that we consider not just the term limits, \nbut what has to be done to make some institutional change in the \nCongress. If you do not like the way things have been done for 40 \nyears, if you want to see some fundamental change, then it is difficult \nto imagine that there is going to be change if we continue to do things \nthe same way.\n  That is what term limits is about. It is about the end of career \npoliticians in Congress. I happen to think that is a good idea. I \nhappen to think that is what the drafters of the Constitution had in \nmind, to return to the Founders' vision, to the extent possible, of \ncitizen legislators.\n  I was impressed this morning by someone's observation that one of the \nnecessary things to represent your constituents in this Congress is to \nhave had some experience in the private sector, to have had some \nexperience in the real world. I think that is terribly important.\n\n  We need fundamental change that has some impact on reducing the size \nof Government. I think it is pretty evident that the longer you are \nhere, the less likely you are to be enthusiastic about reducing the \nsize of the Government. Someone mentioned this morning, and I think it \nis exactly right, when people first come here they seem to have \nobjective questions. They seem to have ideas. How can we do this \nbetter? How can we change? After being here for a very long time, you \nare advocates for the status quo, sort of defensive about what has been \ngoing on. We do not need more of that.\n  I am very much in favor of term limits. I think that it is important. \nThere is, indeed, a considerable turnover. I think the point was made \nthis morning that 51 percent of the Senate has been here less than two \nterms. That is true. The same thing is true in the House. The \ndifficulty is that you live in the seniority system, and the other 50 \npercent has been here a very long time. They are the ones, of course, \nthat have all the leadership positions, so change does not come about. \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  Madam President, I am delighted that we are here. I suggest to my \nassociates here in the Senate that it is time to come to the snubbing \npost. We have talked about it. It is time to support what we think \npeople have said to us or not. It is time to support change that brings \nabout fundamental change here--smaller Government, less expensive \nGovernment, less restrictive Government. That is what we are voting on \ntoday--changing the direction that will take us into the next century. \nI urge support.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, was leader's time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for my leader time on this issue plus another issue I \nwill speak to briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, today the Senate takes a historic step on \nwhether to move forward to pass a constitutional amendment to limit the \nterms of Members of both the House and the Senate. I am proud this step \nis one promised by the Republican Party in our last two party \nplatforms. I am proud we made this promise in 1994. I am proud that the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives delivered on this promise \nthat the Senate will have a chance to do so in about 45 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\n  I acknowledge the fine leadership of our newer Members, such as \nSenators Thompson, Ashcroft, Inhofe, Thomas and others, who have joined \nother leaders like Senator Brown for fighting for this reform. After \nyears of rhetoric and stonewalling, this is a huge step forward for the \nAmerican people.\n  I am mindful this is not the last step. While the vast majority of \nRepublicans in both the House and the Senate support term limits, the \nfact is that this is a constitutional amendment. We cannot do it \nwithout substantial support on the other side of the aisle.\n  With President Clinton leading the opposition, it appears no such \nsupport exists on the other side of the aisle. It is pretty much like \nthe debate on the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget we had \nlast year. President Clinton not only has consistently opposed term \nlimits, but he sent his Solicitor General to the U.S. Supreme Court to \nargue against the term limits law that passed overwhelmingly in his own \nState of Arkansas. He should drop his opposition to term limits and \nhelp deliver the votes necessary to pass the constitutional amendment.\n  Madam President, I share my view of why I believe this is important. \nAs someone who has served this country for most of his adult life, I am \nnot one that subscribes to the notion that this is about the people who \nserve in representative democracy. I know it is fashionable to attack \npoliticians, but the truth is that those elected represent the people, \nat whatever level of Government, reflect both the strength and weakness \nof the electorate in a thousand different ways.\n  What this is about is the institution of representative democracy \nitself. I believe that the notion of a citizen legislator is an \nhonorable one. I believe that representing your constituents to the \nbest of your abilities is at the core of the success of the American \nexperiment over the last 200 years. It is not an effort to tear down \nthis relationship. Term limits certainly are not that. Instead, they \nare an effort to strengthen that bond.\n  This is an issue that not many Americans--in fact, not many \nlegislators, not many anybody--thought about until recently. Now, I \nthink it is clear that I have been lukewarm to the idea for some time \nand only started indicating 2 or 3 years that it seems to me if we want \nto send it back to the legislatures--the people send it back, want to \nratify--that is fine.\n  I think we are capable also of keeping up with the American people. \nThe American people, 75 to 80 percent, favor term limits. There clearly \nis a sense of something going wrong. We owe it to them and the future \ngeneration to think about whether the comfortable status quo is doing \nthe job.\n\n  For me, it has come down to this. We are a Republic founded on the \nrule of law. There are many ways to define what the rule of law means, \nbut it is the genius of republican democracy that those who make the \nlaws also live under them. That is what the rule of law means to me. I \nthink in some respects we sort of drifted away from that.\n  It was only last year in a Republican Congress that we insisted for \nthe first time that all those laws that apply to the private sector had \nto apply to Congress, as well. I think that is probably a pretty good \nstep in the right direction. When legislators leave Congress to start a \nbusiness or do whatever, they will have to bear the consequence of \nthose actions in a way that they may be insulated from if they served \n15, 20, or 30 years in Congress.\n  Now, obviously, I feel like I understand these consequences, and I'll \nbet most of my colleagues do too. But, studies that show that the \nlonger a legislator spends in Congress, the more readily he or she \nspends taxpayers' money, suggest that this is not always the case.\n  In such situations, I think it is wise to rely on the good sense of \nthe American people. They are the ones most affected, and that brings \nme to my final point on why I support a constitutional amendment.\n  The very nature of the process surrounding a constitutional amendment \nis that we let the people decide. Issues that go to the core of our \nRepublican institutions are properly the province of the people.\n  All we do when we pass a resolution on a constitutional amendment is \nallow the people in all of the States to decide--and, in fact, three-\nfourths of those States have to decide in the affirmative before an \namendment becomes part of our Constitution.\n  As I have said before, the Federal Government of today is not the \nsame as that envisioned by our Founders. We need to dust off the 10th \namendment, and return power back to the States and to the people.\n  I say, give those we represent this opportunity to debate, consider, \nand decide. It is particularly appropriate that we do so, when the \nissue before us goes to the core of the relationship between those \nelected and those represented. This is not an issue we should decide \nalone.\n  Mr. President, there should be no mistake about the importance of the \nvote today. The vote today is about whether we move forward and give \nthe people the opportunity to make that choice.\n  As with other constitutional amendments, you don't always succeed the \nfirst time. Nor should we necessarily. Constitutional amendments almost \nalways involve great issues.\n  But in State after State, the American people have already indicated \ntheir views on term limits. A vote today to end debate and move toward \nfinal passage is a vote to take the American people at their word and \nbuild momentum for support.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to end debate and support allowing the \nAmerican people we represent the opportunity to choose for themselves.\n  This is an opportunity for all of us who believe in sending power \nback to the States, back to the people. Also, it is an indication that \nwe listen. Yes, we can change our mind. We listen. We listen to the \nAmerican people. The American people have spoken, and I believe it is \ntime for us to speak.\n  I hope when the vote comes at 3:45, we will have a resounding vote \nfor cloture--maybe 100 to 0, like we had on the last vote here at 2:15.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank the majority leader. The fact \nof the matter is that we have not had a vote such as this--a \nconstitutional amendment on term limits--for almost 50 years in this \ncountry. Were it not for the majority leader, we still would not have a \nvote on a constitutional amendment for term limits. He is very right \nwhen he says this is not the last vote on it. This is really the first \nvote in a succession of votes. This will be with us from now on. He is \nalso right in pointing out that you could probably measure people's \ndesire for term limits with different fervor, but you cannot deny the \nfact that 75 percent of the people now are in favor of it.\n  What we are here about today is giving the States an option of \nconsidering whether or not they want to pass a constitutional \namendment. As we know, 22 States, on their own volition and for their \nown good reasons, have sought to limit themselves, even without other \nStates acting. So there can be no doubt about what the sentiment of the \nAmerican people is regarding this.\n  With regard to a couple of earlier comments by our colleagues in \nopposition to term limits, a statement has been made that we need the \nexpertise that long experience brings to us and that, if you are going \nto have surgery performed, you would want a surgeon with some \nexperience. I have no quarrel with either one of those propositions. \nCertainly, expertise and experience in any area, standing alone, in and \nof itself, is not a bad thing. In most cases, it is a good thing. But \nwhat we are suffering from, I respectfully submit, in this body is not \na lack of expertise. We have all of the know-how, all of the brain \npower that any such institution would ever hope to have.\n  Madam President, I simply suggest that we do not have the willpower \nthat is necessary. It has nothing to do with expertise and experience. \nIt has to do with motivation. It is not because of a lack of expertise \nthat we are bankrupting this Nation. It is not because of a lack of \nexpertise that we have the situation that Senator Simpson described, \nwherein it was demonstrated that Social Security only has another set \nnumber of days before it is going to be bankrupt and Medicare is going \nto be bankrupt.\n  Senator Danforth's comments, as he left this body when he retired, \nwere that we are doing something terrible to\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\nthe next generation. We are bankrupting them for the sake of our own \nreelection. That is at the root of the problem--the motivation of those \nwho serve here, on out into the next century. It will take years for \nthis to be ratified, and a person would have years to serve. It is not \nabout the Members serving today, and it is not about the Members who \nserved before in this body. Many, many good people have done so. It is \nabout what will equip us best to meet the challenges that we are \nclearly not meeting now because we do not have the willpower, because \nwe cannot resist the temptation to do those things which are necessary \nfor perpetual reelection. Those things usually translate into one word, \nand that is ``spending.'' Spending. People descend upon us from all \ndirections, from all walks of life, each wanting their programs funded, \nand you do not make friends and influence people by saying ``no,'' and \nyou do not perpetuate a professional political career by saying ``no.'' \nTherein lies the root of the problem.\n\n  I might also say, if I went to a surgeon, I would ask what his \nsurvival ratio was. I think if people came to this body and asked what \nour success rate is and looked at the numbers and what we are doing to \nthe next generation, our inability to even take the first step to \nbalance the budget, and even if we got everything that we on this side \nof the aisle wanted, at the end of the 7 years we would still be \nlooking at a $6 trillion-plus deficit, even if we did not have a \nrecession or a war, even if nothing really untoward happened. If we got \neverything we wanted--and we cannot even take the first step on that \nscenario, which would still put us in a hopeless situation because so \nmuch of the proposals are back-end loaded, which are simply hopes and \ndesires that future Congresses will have the courage to do what we do \nnot have the courage to do. We put the numbers down on the paper, \nsaying that future Congresses, when we are long out of office, will do \nthe right thing and, therefore, we balance the budget.\n  So we cannot even put this--to put it charitably--questionable \napproach into operation, much less go any further. That is what all \nthis is about.\n  One of my colleagues mentioned the role of money. As I am sure he \nwould agree, I have taken a very clear stance with regard to that in \ndisagreement. But some of my colleagues on my own side of the aisle \nsay--and I agree with them--that money plays a much too important part \nin our process. But money alone is not the process. The reason money is \nimportant is because money buys those television ads to tout how great \nwe are and how lousy our opponent is. Money is what keeps us up here. \nIt is the money and the desire for perpetual reelection that is getting \nus into the problem with the deficit and the debt and the ruination of \nthe next generation.\n  So, if we have campaign finance reform without term limits, we will \nnever have such reform that totally takes the role of money out of \npolitics. There is always going to be some money involved in politics. \nYou can have all the reform that you want, and if the motivation is \nstill there to use whatever the system would then give you to continue \nto perpetuate yourself, the situation would not really improve.\n\n  On the other hand, if you had term limits without campaign finance \nreform--and I assure you I am for both of them--as one example, in the \nU.S. Senate you could serve your second term, one full term of 6 years, \nwithout having to raise a dime. What would that be like?\n  One of the other Members implied that if we did not have the threat \nof voter sanctions, we would kind of steal and pillage and do all kinds \nof terrible things. I do not know what his feeling is with regard to a \nPresident who is term limited and has a lame duck 4-year term when he \nwins his second term. But I think it would be a very beneficial thing \nto have Members serving in the U.S. Senate under all of the scrutiny \nand all of the disclosure that you would always have, but not have to \nworry about raising one dime from one soul. That is what term limits \nwould do, even if you did not have campaign finance reform.\n  Finally, Madam President, I, again, echo the leader's comments \nbecause he gets to the heart of the problem.\n  He, above all--and all the other Members who have served this body so \nwell--would not imply in any way, or reflect in any way, on the service \nof those Members--valiant service over the years. We are talking about \nthe future. We are talking about a system over here that has served us \npretty well for a long period of time, but now it is not working \nanymore. We were balancing the budget up to 1969. But we are not \nanymore. The pressures are too great anymore with the growth of \nGovernment, the growth of programs, and the growth of spending.\n  What do we do? We do what the Founding Fathers envisioned. They could \nnot have envisioned all the technological advances, pressures, all the \ninterest groups and the way the political parties behave, but they \ncould envision change of circumstances that would need an amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  So we are talking about the future and something that would not \ndiminish Congress, something that would enhance Congress and enhance \nCongress in the eyes of the American people because we would once again \nbe a part of them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 21, a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution \nto limit congressional terms to two in the Senate and six in the \nHouse--12 years in each body.\n  Madam President, I want to begin my remarks by thanking the majority \nleader, Senator Dole, for making good on his promise to schedule Senate \naction on the term limit amendment this month. Without his support and \nhis commitment to term limits, this initiative probably would never \nhave seen the light of day.\n  It would have been easy to dodge a vote--as many opponents, no doubt, \nwould like to have been able to do--since the House already voted down \na term limit amendment last year. But Senator Dole followed through on \nhis commitment to ensure that there would be a full and fair debate and \nthat we would have an opportunity to vote on the issue. The American \npeople deserve to know where their Senators stand.\n  Madam President, term limits are no panacea. They will not guarantee \nthe election of sensible and honest individuals to Congress. They will \nnot put an end to the influence that special interests can sometimes \nwield on Capitol Hill. However, term limits will help.\n  They will help by ensuring regular turnover in Congress--guaranteeing \nthat the people who make our laws have to live under the laws they have \npassed. It is too easy for legislators, who have been on Capitol Hill \ntoo long, to forget what it is like to struggle in the marketplace to \nsurvive--what it means to try to meet a payroll when the Federal \nGovernment is constantly imposing new mandates on a small business. New \ntaxes, new regulations, more redtape. They forget what it is like for a \nfamily to try to make ends meet, when more and more is taken from their \npaychecks in taxes every week--higher gasoline and FICA taxes, for \nexample.\n  Members of Congress have learned a lot in just the short time that \nthe Congressional Accountability Act has been in place. The myriad of \nworkplace laws and regulations had little meaning before last year \nbecause they never applied to Congress. When we finally had to live \nunder the same laws and regulations as the rest of the country, the \npeople's frustrations took on a whole new meaning.\n  It is that kind of connection with what people have to endure from \ntheir government on a daily basis that term limits will foster. \nCongressional service should not be a life-long career.\n  Term limits would also help to disperse some of the power that has \nbecome concentrated in the hands of a few very senior Members of both \nbodies. It would also help to ensure that all of us make decisions that \nare in accord with the views of the electorate.\n  Take the Federal budget, for example. The American people have been \ndemanding less spending, lower taxes, and a balanced budget in more \nforceful terms every year. Newer Members of Congress tend to vote for \nless Federal spending than those who have served for a long time. In \nfact, a recent National Taxpayers Union [NTU] survey found a \ncorrelation between tenure in Congress and increased spending.\n  NTU found that the 88 freshmen members of the House who were elected\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nin 1994 voted for an average of $26 billion less in spending than non-\nfreshmen did. The 11 new Senators elected in 1994 supported an average \nof $26.2 billion more in spending reduction than their senior \ncolleagues.\n  That is not to say that all of the more senior Members voted for more \nGovernment spending. But as a group, newer Members more closely \nreflected the desires of their constituents for less spending and \nleaner Government. It is a trend that term limits would help to \npromote.\n  Madam President, 23 States, including my home State of Arizona, have \nattempted to impose term limits on their congressional delegations. But \na year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that all State term-limit laws \nthat apply to U.S. Senators and Congressmen are unconstitutional. The \nmajority held that the Constitution fixes the qualifications for \ncongressional service, and that neither Congress nor the States may \nsupplement them. That is why we have a constitutional amendment before \nus today--because all other legislative avenues have been foreclosed.\n  More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote a friend suggesting \nways that the newly drafted Constitution could be improved. Jefferson \nsaid three things were missing: a Bill of Rights, limits on the tenure \nof the Chief Executive, and term limits for Congress. Since then, we \nhave seen Jefferson's first two ideas implemented; the resolution \nbefore us today embraces the last.\n  Madam President, I urge support for the term limits amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today in support of term \nlimits. By overwhelming margins, the American people support term \nlimits for Members of Congress. In a democratic society, the people's \nelected officials have a responsibility to respond to what the people \nwant. Of course, we in Washington have a duty to exercise leadership--\nbut leadership means responding to the strongly held preferences of the \nAmerican people.\n  Although there is a long history both at the State and Federal levels \nin limiting the service of executives, term limits for legislators have \na short history. So, we are participating in a work in progress when we \ndebate this amendment.\n  It may be that term limits enhance the power of lobbyists, as some \nsay, or term limits may lessen the power of lobbyists. Term limits may \nweaken the legislative branch or they may strengthen it. Term limits \nmay cause the loss of valuable experience or it may lead to passage of \nreform legislation. There's no way to tell at this point. But with \nfresh faces with new ideas in Congress, it seems to me that reform and \ncommon sense change are far more likely.\n  And of course, the Constitution was made to be amendable. Since 1791, \nwe have amended the Constitution 17 times. Each of these amendments \nbrought about significant changes in the nature of American Government. \nSimilarly, I believe that a term limits amendment will make needed and \nbeneficial changes.\n  Prior to the Supreme Court's Thornton decision last year, I intended \nto introduce a statute to set term limits. That option is no long \nlonger possible. We are in a situation where the Supreme Court has \nunequivocally spoken--the Constitution as currently written does not \ngive Congress or the States the power to impose term limits by statute. \nSo, this is not a willy-nilly amendment we are debating. This amendment \nis the only way to have term limits.\n  If we do not vote to pass this amendment, the States won't even have \nthe chance to pass term limits. They won't even be able to consider the \nidea of term limits. This is an important debate, and I think that \nCongress should not stand in the way. Voting to pass this amendment \ndoesn't create term limits. It just lets the debate go forward. Let's \npass this amendment. The American people want it. They deserve it, and \nit would do much good.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I understand that much of what is driving today's debate is the \nbelief among the American people that Congress is out of touch with \ntheir needs and their concerns. And to some extent their frustration is \ngenuine and justified.\n  We spend too much of our time engaging in partisan political games \nand not enough time working together in a bipartisan manner to craft \nlegislation that benefits all Americans.\n  There are many things we could do to reform Congress and make this \nbody work more effectively. Term limits is not one of them.\n  If we truly want to renew the American people's faith in democracy \nand return their voices to our debates in Washington then we need to \nremove the corrosive influences of money on our campaign system.\n  I believe that all the goals proponents of term limits hope to \nachieve through this amendment, would be realized if we simply passed \ngenuine and comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  For example, public service is more and more restricted to those \nAmericans who have the deep pockets necessary to run for Congress. And \nterm limits would not change that.\n  Even if we passed this amendment, candidates would still be forced to \nraise millions of dollars in order to win election. And the aspirations \nof public service would continue to remain unachievable for the vast \nmajority of the American people.\n  In order to change the way Washington operates and level the campaign \nplaying field, we need to remove the pervasive, almost epidemic, role \nof money in our political system.\n  That is why I have long supported steps to reform our campaign \nsystem. And it's the reason I've sponsored the McCain-Feingold campaign \nfinance reform bill.\n  We need to change our campaign system and allow access to public \nservice for the American people. But, term limits is simply not the \nsolution.\n  We have term limits in this country. They're called elections. And \nthey are already enshrined in our Constitution. Look it up, article 1, \nsection 2; article 2, section 4; and of course the 17th amendment, \nwhich dictated the manner by which we as Senators would be chosen.\n  These provisions of the Constitution describe the specific process of \nhow our elected officials are chosen. And nowhere in the Constitution \nis there any mention of term limits, or the amount of time a Senator or \nCongressman must serve.\n  Over the past few days, I've listened to my colleagues invoke the \nname of the Founding Fathers in justifying their support for this \namendment.\n  Well, I would remind them to go back to their history books, to the \nConstitutional Convention of 1787, which debated the issue of term \nlimits and see what James Madison, the father of our Constitution said \nabout this issue:\n\n       Frequent elections; that's the answer, that a voter should \n     be able to decide whether he wants somebody new or whether he \n     wants somebody with experience.\n\n  Or look to the words of Robert Livingston, who said:\n\n       The people are the best judges who ought to represent them. \n     To dictate and control them, to tell them whom they shall not \n     elect is to abridge their natural rights. * * * This is an \n     absolute abridgement of the people's rights.\n\n  A years and a half ago the American people made an overwhelming \ndecision on who would represent them. Although I can't say that I \nagreed with their choice and while I would have preferred that they had \nselected different leaders, their ballot was a reflection of our \nfreedoms and rights as a people and a nation to choose our leaders.\n  And in the past few years the American people have loudly made their \nvoices heard. In fact, more than 50 percent of the current Members of \nthe House of Representatives were elected in the past 6 years alone.\n  And, in January 1997, there will be at least 38 new Senators, elected \nsince 1992.\n  That represents an enormous infusion of new people and new ideas to \nthis Congress. And, all this change came about without term limits and \nwithout a Constitutional amendment telling voters from whom they could \nor could not choose to represent them.\n\n  But even with these historic changes, proponents of this amendment \nwould still have us believe that we need term limits in order provide \ngreater choices for the American people.\n  Instead, term limits would limit the alternatives of the American \npeople,\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\nbecause they would be precluded from voting for an incumbent. \nAbrogating the right of the American people to freely choose their \nleaders subverts the democratic principles and full rights of franchise \nthat are every American's birthright.\n  Over the past few days, I've listened to the debate here in the \nSenate. And over and over I've heard the recurring notion that America \nneeds term limits in order to prevent lawmakers from being contaminated \nby special interests and institutional corruption.\n  I've served in the Senate for 16 years and my belief in the dignity \nof public service has not dissipated. And when I look around this body \nat my fellow Senators I see other dedicated public servants.\n  I see men and women who withstand personal attacks on their \ncharacter; I see men and women who give up both their privacy and a \nstable family life; I see men and women who labor tirelessly in these \nhalls for one reason and one reason only--because they want to make \nAmerica a better country.\n  Now, we may not agree on every issue. In fact, some of us may not \nagree on any issues. But whatever our personal beliefs, our goals and \nour reasons for being here are the same--to uphold our duty to our \nconstituents, the Constitution and most important the American people.\n  And what about all those who came before us? The great leaders from \nboth sides of the political aisle who have served in this austere body: \nHenry Clay, Daniel Webster, Everett Dirksen, Lyndon Johnson, Richard \nRussell, Sam Ervin and today Robert Byrd and Bob Dole, to name a few.\n  Were they corrupted by their tenure in the United States Senate? Or \nwas their experience integral in helping them pass legislation that \nmade this nation a better place to live? I for one think it is the \nlatter.\n  But, if we passed this amendment the hard-earned experience of \nlawmakers would be supplanted by a dramatic increase in the reliance on \npermanent staff, lobbyists and special interests.\n  Instead of ending careerism in Congress, we would create a permanent \nand unelected staff bureaucracy that would run the Federal Government.\n  They would have no responsibility to the American people because \nunlike the so-called career politicians they wouldn't be held \naccountable for their actions.\n  They wouldn't have to go to the town meetings, political rallies, \nChamber of Commerce banquets and the other events that politicians in \nthis body regularly attend to keep themselves in touch and culpable to \ntheir constituents.\n  What's more, small States like my home State of Connecticut would be \nirreparably weakened. Through the seniority system, elected officials \nfrom small States can make sure that their voices are heard when \nimportant policy decisions are being made.\n  But, if we enact term limits small States Would be shut out by larger \nStates with greater representation in Congress.\n  Consider that just nine States can command a voting majority in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Those nine States, through their voting power, could assure that the \nvast majority of Federal spending be concentrated in their locales at \nthe expenses of forty-one other States, with fewer representation and \nless clout.\n  I know that this amendment is popular among the American people.\n  But, the popular way isn't always the right way.\n  As Senators, we must always be cognizant and accountable to the will \nof our constituents. But, at the same time we are sworn to uphold the \nConstitution. And we owe the American people the wisdom of our best \njudgment in maintaining that solemn duty.\n  Adlai Stevenson once said that ``My definition of a free society is a \nsociety where it is safe to be unpopular.'' And I think we all need to \nbe reminded of those words when any one of us holds a view that runs \ncontrary to the popular opinion of the American people.\n  Today, I will cast a vote against the popular will of the American \npeople not because I reject their beliefs, but because I must cast my \nballot for what I think is best for the country.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in upholding our Constitutional oath and \nrejecting this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 21, which proposes a constitutional amendment to limit \ncongressional terms.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support term limits for both U.S. Senators \nand Representatives. The American people want term limits because they \nrecognize that service in Congress should not be a lifetime career, but \nrather a temporary stewardship. Term limits will bring fresh blood and \nnew ideas into the Congress and dilute the power of the seniority \nsystem.\n  Last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision on term limits made clear \nthat the goal of limiting congressional terms cannot be accomplished \nexcept by means of a constitutional amendment. This is consistent, of \ncourse, with the manner in which Presidential term limits were \nestablished more than four decades ago.\n  Madam President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senate \nJoint Resolution 21, which, in its original form, would have amended \nthe Constitution to limit service in the Senate to two terms of 6 years \neach and service in the House to three terms of 2 years each.\n  As we wait what I believe is the inevitable addition of a term limits \namendment to the Constitution, it is important to keep in mind that \nterm limits are already happening in different ways. Voters already can \nand do impose term limits in the voting booths. Moreover, voluntary \nretirements continue at a record pace. Already in 1996, a record 13 \nSenators have announced their retirements.\n  It is also important, Madam President, to keep in mind that term \nlimits are not a panacea. But they are a start--a start toward a \nCongress that is even more representative and responsive to ``We the \nPeople.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will vote against ending debate on the \nconstitutional amendment to limit congressional terms. Term limits is a \nserious matter which deserves serious debate. Amending the Constitution \nof the United States is always a serious matter and should not be done \nwithout adequate deliberation. The majority leader filed a cloture \npetition immediately upon calling the term limits amendment up for \ndebate even though there has been no effort to filibuster this issue. \nInvoking cloture at this stage would have the affect of cutting off \ndebate.\n  The Senate should have a full and open debate on this matter, and \nfully consider amendments which have been offered and other amendments \nwhich Senators wish to propose. For example, there is no amendment \nbefore the Senate which conforms to the language contained in the \nMichigan Constitution which calls for a limit on Representatives of \nthree terms in any 12-year period, and a limit on Senators of two terms \nin any 24-year period. That amendment would not be allowed, for \ninstance, if cloture is invoked. Ending the debate now would also \npreclude other amendments from being offered, including an amendment \nwhich would count the terms of office already served by those presently \nin office.\n  Madam President, I will oppose cloture which would prematurely cut \noff that debate and make it impossible to offer relevant modifications \nto the constitutional amendment on the ground that they are not \ntechnically germane. If there is a filibuster on this amendment, I will \nthen vote to cut off debate so that we can vote on the constitutional \namendment. In the absence of a filibuster, stopping debate will \nunfairly restrict consideration of possible modifications and a fair \nconsideration of the amendment itself.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms. I commend \nthe Senators from Tennessee and Missouri for their tireless efforts on \nbehalf of this measure and I also commend the majority leader for \nallowing us the opportunity to vote on this amendment. This is a truly \nhistoric debate and one that the American people would do well to note \nand remember.\n  The amendment before the Senate today is very simple. It would limit \nfuture Senators and House Members to two and six terms respectively and \nit further outlines the procedure for Members who assume office in mid-\nterm.\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\n  This measure's simplicity, Mr. President, is only matched by its \npopularity in the country and its exceeding difficulty to pass. The \nAmerican people have consistently indicated their overwhelming support \nfor term limits. This support remains solid regardless of who controls \nthe Congress or how much the issue is debated. I remain amazed that the \npeople's representatives continually refuse to do their bidding on this \nissue.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has considered this measure, \nnor will it likely be the last. The first proposal to limit \ncongressional terms was offered in 1789. In the modern era, hearings on \nterm limits were held in 1945, and the only straightforward Senate vote \non a term limits amendment in history occurred in 1947.\n  It is interesting to note, Mr. President, that Republicans controlled \nthe Senate at that time as well. At no time since have the Democrats \nattempted to constructively deal with the term limits issue. It is only \nbecause of the Republican majority that we stand here today. We made \nthe commitment to the American people in the last election to bring \nthis measure to the floor and we are keeping our word.\n  In the past year, we have seen several measures come and go on this \nfloor that--in one way or another--have attempted to curb Senators' and \nRepresentatives' appetites for continual public service. All failed.\n  Due to the utter lack of Democratic support for the concept of term \nlimits, it appears that the measure before us today will fail as well. \nThis is one more battle, however, in a larger--and longer--fight. In \nthe end, I remain confident that a meaningful, binding term limits \namendment will be passed by Congress and ratified by the necessary \nnumber of States.\n  Mr. President, we live in a democracy that thrives on the free \nexchange of innovative ideas. These ideas are the lifeblood of our \nprogress and it is critical to bring them into the political process \nand into the public arena. Term limits will ensure that the people's \nrepresentatives continually bring fresh, new perspectives to public \nservice and create a more responsible and respected government.\n  We suffer not from a dearth of new ideas in America, Mr. President; \nwe are lacking only in the opportunity to express them in public \nservice. The amendment before us today will change that, and I again \noffer it my unqualified support.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, today, the Senate considers a \nconstitutional amendment regarding term limits for Members of Congress. \nThe debate over the term limits constitutional amendment has shown that \nboth sides of this issue are passionate about the importance of \ncongressional service. The proponents of the term limits amendment \nargue that it is time to change our Constitution to address the length \nof congressional service. The opponents of the term limits amendment \nrespond that not only is a term limits constitutional amendment \nunnecessary, it threatens the foundation of our system of government \nand principles of democracy. I cast my vote against the term limits \nconstitutional amendment.\n  My service in the Senate began as a result of an election held in \nNorth Dakota in the fall of 1986. I won election to the U.S. Senate by \ndefeating an incumbent who served North Dakota for 6 years in the \nSenate and 17 years in the House. Because of this election, I can \nappreciate arguments about the power of incumbency. However, most \nimportantly, I appreciate the power of the voters. Voters have the \npower to vote for the candidate they feel best fits the elective \noffice, whether the person is an incumbent or a challenger. It concerns \nme that a term limits constitutional amendment would limit the voters' \nchoice to only those persons who are not disqualified because of this \namendment.\n  It is my view that in a democracy, voters should be able to choose \nwhomever they want to represent them. We should not deny voters the \nopportunity to vote for someone they believe best represents their \ninterests simply because that person has been in the office for 12 \nyears. According to the Congressional Research Service, at the \nbeginning of the 104th Congress, the average length of service of a \nMember of the House of Representatives was 7.75 years, while the \naverage length of service of a Member of the Senate was 10.2 years. So \ndespite the lack of a constitutional term limits amendment of 12 years, \nthe voters have successfully managed their own system of term limits, \ncommonly known as the elective system.\n  Term limitations might be more detrimental than beneficial. It takes \ntime to develop real expertise and experience on the wide variety of \nissues that come before Congress. Term limitations could result in the \nloss of this experience. In a sense, the voters already have the power \nof term limits in their hands: they can vote their elected \nrepresentatives out of office at any election, from their local sheriff \nto their U.S. Senator. Additionally, the loss of the seniority system \nwould prevent small States such as North Dakota from getting and \nkeeping clout in Congress. Large State delegations would dominate the \nleadership and become even more powerful, and small States would be \nhurt as a result. California has 54 seats in Congress; New York has 33; \nTexas has 32; Florida has 25; and Pennsylvania has 23. North Dakota has \nonly three.\n  Rather than impose arbitrary term limits, I believe we should focus \nour attention on campaign finance reform to allow a larger number of \npeople to enter congressional races. I supported campaign reform in \npast legislative sessions, and I will continue to support campaign \nreform in the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, congressional term limits are the most \ntoxic of the seemingly magical elixirs called reform. Alluring in their \nsimplicity. Enticing in their popularity. Term limits are the blunt ax \nof political reforms.\n  Conveniently, the term limits would not kick in until most current \nSenators, under recent rates of attrition, were long gone from this \nChamber. Prospective term limits such as are before us today have a buy \nnow, pay later appeal as nearly two decades would elapse between their \npassage, ratification, and the moment at which they began to clear the \ndecks in Washington.\n  If term limits are the medicine for what ails the Nation, it is \nludicrous to wait so long for their curative powers. Retroactive limits \nwould be in order.\n  Dissenting from the majority in my party is not something I relish. \nWhile I have often observed, with some irritation, that in the eyes of \nthe media it seems the only thoughtful Republican is a dissenting \nRepublican, it is not a role I seek. My colleagues, with whom I \ndisagree on this issue, arrived at their positions for a host of \nreasons. It is not my place or privilege, nor would I presume, to cast \naspersion on motives. But I must disagree as strongly and forcefully as \ndecorum, and facility with the English language, will allow.\n  Never more than in this instance, am I conscious of Edmund Burke's \neloquent assertion that: ``Your representative owes you, not his \nindustry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you \nif he sacrifices it to your opinion.'' All of us exercise this wisdom, \nthough rarely all in the same way, at the same time or on the same \nissue. Sometimes our judgment and popular opinion converge. Sometimes \nnot. And we answer to the voters, in any event. On this issue, the \npolls and my judgment are at variance.\n  Mr. President, in a bit of an aside but touching on the climate of \ncynicism in which term limit polls are conducted, I would like to draw \nattention to an article David Shaw wrote in the Los Angeles Times on \nApril 17 entitled ``A Negative Spin on the News.'' The subtitle is: \n``Many journalists are worried that cynicism is poisoning their \nprofession. Displaying such an attitude may erode respect for their \ncraft and also harm confidence in public institutions.'' A telling \npassage from the article:\n\n       The most scathing--and most widely publicized--indictment \n     of the news media by the news media has come from James \n     Fallows, Washington editor of the Atlantic Monthly, in his \n     book ``Breaking the News.''\n       ``Step by step,'' he writes, ``mainstream journalism has \n     fallen into the habit of portraying public life in America as \n     a race to the bottom, in which one group of conniving, \n     insincere politicians ceaselessly tries to outmaneuver \n     another.''\n       The journalistic implication--and often it's more than an \n     implication--that all politicians are liars and hypocrites \n     who invariably act out of self-interest and self-\n     aggrandizement rather than out of a commitment to the public \n     good, has created a self-fulfilling phenomenon.\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\n       As Fallows puts it: ``By choosing to present public life as \n     a contest between scheming political leaders, all of whom the \n     public should view with suspicion, the news media brings \n     about that very result.''\n\n  Mr. President, political reform debates, especially term limits and \ncampaign finance, should carry an advisory--``Warning: profoundly \ndisturbing to impressionable Americans who thought democracy was a good \nthing.'' Term limits and campaign finance reform proponents wrongly \nassume democracy as we have known it for 200 years, has failed. They \nmay characterize their proposals as fine-tuning democracy but I and \nothers see it as far more serious than that. Quite simply, we have gone \nwith such proposals from Let Freedom Ring to Rein Freedom In--in the \nname of reform.\n  For the past few years, there has been a furious race to embrace the \ndisaffected, disgusted and dissatisfied. Thoroughly probed by prolific \npollsters, the prognosis is in: people hate politicians, so go with it. \nPander or perish. This destructive phenomenon is not the exclusive \nprovince of any party. The essential point is that having for so long \nbeen a convenient receptacle for hateful bile from within and out, it \nshould surprise no one that all who serve in Congress are sullied. We \nare reaping what we have sown, with ample assistance from a cynical \nmedia.\n  Having examined the climate of cynicism which breeds demand for term \nlimits, I turn now to the merits of the proposal before us. What term \nlimits would do is restrict the freedom of voters to elect whomever \nthey please. Like them or not, term limits undeniably, fundamentally \nrestrict freedom. A Senator in the 21st century may be Daniel Webster \nreincarnate, but under two terms-and-out limits, merit, performance and \nvoter sentiment matter not after the first term.\n  Under term limits, merit, performance and voter sentiment hold no \nsway in the second term except to the extent Members are guided by \ntheir own morals and sense of place in history. That is sufficient \nrestraint for most Members now, and probably even in a term \nlimited future. But this lack of accountability under term limits \nshould greatly trouble people who believe that power breeds corruption.\n\n  The dominant theme of the term limit movement is populist--that term \nlimits will wrest the system away from the career politicians and \nreturn power to the people. Yet one of the most prominent term limit \nadvocates, conservative columnist George Will, supports term limits \nbecause they would establish a constitutional distance between people \nand politicians. Just this last Sunday, in the Washington Post, Will \nwrote that ``. . . term limits would make Congress less subservient to \npublic opinion. . .''\n  There is a news flash: the revolutionary motive behind term limits is \nto insulate Congress from popular accountability at the ballot box. \nRemove all concerns about reelection, the theory goes, and Congress \nwill do the right thing. The presumption is that the right thing must \nbe contrary to the will of the people. This confirms how anti-populist \nand undemocratic term limits really are.\n  That is why last year I introduced a bill to repeal the 22d amendment \nlimiting Presidents to two terms. In 1947, with great haste a \nRepublican majority--fresh from political exile--rammed through the 22d \namendment imposing presidential term limits. Fifty years ago, the zeal \nwas in response to the unprecedented tenure of President Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt. Not one Republican in the House or Senate voted \nagainst that proposal. Ironically, the only Presidents since limited by \nit have been Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.\n  We were very fortunate that those two-term Presidents were such \nhonorable men. But we should consider a bleak alternative. The prospect \nof a second term of a scoundrel, unconcerned with reelection to a third \nterm, is very disturbing. With the prospect of another election, even \nthe most scurrilous are more likely to at least pretend to be \nthoughtful, honest, and responsive to the concerns of voters. In my \nview, the 22d amendment was a mistake that should be repealed, not \ncompounded with congressional limits.\n  Alexander Hamilton was succinct in Federalist Paper No. 72--which \npresented the case against Presidential term limits:\n\n       There is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling \n     the people to continue in office men who had entitled \n     themselves, in their opinion, to approbation and confidence, \n     the advantages of which are at best speculative and \n     equivocal, and are overbalanced by disadvantages far more \n     certain and decisive.\n\n  Term limits make elected representatives less accountable to voters \nand public service less appealing to middle class citizens. Thus, would \nterm limits engender a new elitism and create ethical quagmires. People \nof moderate means, with family responsibilities and promising private \ncareers, would pass on a congressional career certain to be cut short. \nOnly the rich could afford such a brief dilettante fling with politics. \nAnd on the other hand, those who did interrupt private pursuits for a \nterm-limited stint in Congress would feel pressed to keep an eye on \npost-congressional employment--a conflict rife with ethical potholes \nand considered by Alexander Hamilton two centuries ago when he observed \nthat the prospect of reelection would promote better representation \nthan would term limits. Hamilton said, ``when a man knows he must quit \nhis station, let his merit be what it may, he will turn his attention \nchiefly to his own emolument.''\n  Term limits would transform Congress into an exclusive haven for the \nindependently wealthy, the comfortably retired, and those who see \npublic service as nothing more than a profitable resume-builder.\n  I put this forth in jest, but if the goal is to make Congress older \nand richer, we should just raise the minimum age requirements set in \nthe Constitution. Two hundred years ago, when the limits were set at 25 \nfor the House and 30 for the Senate, the average life expectancy was \n34. Perhaps age requirements should be doubled--just as life expectancy \nhas--and made retroactive. An argument could be made that the problem \nis not that members serve too long but that they arrive too young.\n  Congressional term limits would make Government overall less \naccountable by vesting far more power in unelected and un-term limited \nstaff, bureaucrats, the judiciary and lobbyists, rather than in the \npeople's elected representatives. This is self-evident and surely is \nnot a desirable effect in the minds of most Americans. As a former \nstaffer I do not say this to denigrate staff, but it has been my \nexperience that courage is not a staff-driven quality. Staff--in their \ndesire to serve and protect their boss--is far more likely to opt to \ntrim the political sails, so to speak. This is conjecture on my part \nbut certainly warrants serious consideration when increasing staff \ninfluence is contemplated.\n  As a Senator from Kentucky, I am very concerned about the power shift \nfrom small and medium-sized States to more populous States, resulting \nfrom the diminution of seniority under term limits. Since the power of \nsmall States is greatly amplified by the Senate's seniority system, \nthey stand to lose the most when the sheer size of a State's House \ndelegation becomes the principal congressional power gauge. David \nBroder explored this side effect in the Washington Post (12/6/95):\n\n       Large-state delegations are not nearly as subject to the \n     caprice of resignation or political defeat. Their leverage \n     lies in their numbers, and they would not be nearly as \n     disadvantaged should term limits be imposed someday. Indeed, \n     there is good reason to speculate that, in the constant \n     bargaining for leadership positions that would probably take \n     place in a term-limited Congress, the mega states like \n     California and Texas would use their numbers to grab off the \n     best spots for themselves and install their allies in the \n     rest.\n       You can make a selfish argument for term limits if you come \n     from one of the mega states. But there is every reason for \n     small-and medium-sized states to oppose that change in the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Mr. President, term limits are premised on an illusion of rampant \ncareerism. The fact is, voters already are limiting tenure--\nselectively. And many members have bowed out voluntarily. Over half of \nthe House of Representatives arrived since 1990 and over half of the \nSenate was elected since 1984. The right to vote is the right to limit \ntenure. Much ado is made over the high reelection rates of those \nincumbents who choose to run for reelection. However, this ignores the \nself-selection element inherent in those rates. Some members--it can \nonly be speculated which ones--choose to retire rather than risk \ndefeat. Particularly, those wounded by\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nscandal. Moreover, incumbents--but for the few who were first appointed \nto office--were first elected as challengers or in open seats. It \nstands to reason that the qualities which made them admirable in their \nfirst election would often propel them to victory in subsequent \nelections.\n\n  And what of competition, post-term limits? It is persuasively argued \nthat competition would actually decrease because able candidates would \nbide their time until a seat opened up rather than risk an uphill fight \nagainst an incumbent. This is a phenomenon we see on occasion in the \ncurrent system. I expect the frequency would increase dramatically \nunder term limits.\n  People should not be denied the right to vote for someone simply \nbecause of an arbitrary term limit. As Robert Livingston noted two \ncenturies ago: ``The people are the best judges who ought to represent \nthem. To dictate and control them, to tell them whom they shall not \nelect, is to abridge their natural rights.''\n  Yet at its root, term limits conclude that people are capable of only \nlimited self-governance. I wonder, do people in these polls that are \ncited fault themselves in their support of term limits or are they \npassing judgment on the irresponsibility of other electorates, in \nstates and districts other than their own? It has been argued by term \nlimit proponents that voters' inability to vote against candidates in \nother states and districts cries out for arbitrary term limits. \nEvidently, voters in other states and districts are not trustworthy. \nTake that premise and run with it.\n  Perhaps Americans should be able to vote in every election everywhere \nbecause lawmakers at all levels of Government can increasingly affect \npeople outside the scope of their own electorate. That is a reform that \nsurely, and correctly, would be rejected. In any event, citizens in one \nState can affect election outcomes in another by participating in \npolitics through campaign contributions. That is a laudable, legal and \nconstitutional manner in which to hold accountable lawmakers one cannot \nlegally vote against.\n  In hindsight, among the most interesting observations made by term \nlimit supporters two hundred years ago was that they were necessary \nbecause the Federal City would be an Eden from which Members and their \nfamilies could not bear to part.\n  The reality hardly needs elaborating. At best, Washington, DC--with \nits crime, potholes, filth, and corruption--has become a sort of \npurgatory from which most of us can hardly wait to flee and go home to \nour States.\n  Where is the logic in the absurd notion that Government is the only \narena in which experience is a bad thing? Experience is desirable in \nevery other venue--professional and otherwise--that I am aware of. \nExperience certainly did not impair Henry Clay, John Sherman Cooper, \nHoward Baker, Everett Dirksen, Sam Rayburn, Arthur Vandenburg, and Sam \nErvin's commitment to serve the national interest. To name just a few.\n  There are many in this Senate today who have served far more than two \nterms whose service has been nothing short of heroic. Experience has \nmade them better and braver. It steels them against many shortsighted \nproposals. But I will not name names because in this environment to \nhighlight a Member's lengthy service on national television could be \nconstrued as a rule 19 transgression. In a term limited future, we \nwould see fewer of their caliber.\n  God willing, the Senate will never again be confronted with a war \nresolution. But if it is in, say, another generation, I hope there are \nsome Members who experienced the Persian Gulf war debate. And who had \nto cast that vote. It was a debate which itself benefited from the \npresence of Members who served in the Vietnam-era Senate.\n  Senators, no matter how bright, educated, eager, or accomplished, do \nnot know anywhere near all they need to when they arrive here. \nParliamentary procedure is mastered with experience. Defense, commerce, \nfinance, environment, energy, and agriculture issues take time to \nlearn. Does any nonincumbent candidate even know upon which committees \nthey will serve?\n  Term limits, however well-intentioned, are terribly dangerous. We \nwould do the American people no favor in passing this constitutional \namendment and would cause great harm in the future. Constitutional \namendments such as this one are forever. Only one--the 18th instituting \nprohibition--has ever been repealed. And we cannot presume to ever be \nmissed so much as Americans missed their bourbon.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I want to begin by commending the \nSenator from Tennessee, the Senator from Missouri, and others, who I \nbelieve are sincere in their belief on the need for fundamental reforms \nin Congress.\n  I disagree with their approach on this issue, but it would be nearly \nimpossible to dispute that the American people expect the Congress to \npass meaningful reforms of this institution and they are expecting \nthose reforms soon.\n  Madam President, it is a troubling reality that more and more \nAmericans are finding it difficult to trust their Government and their \nelected officials. Trusting your Government and having faith in your \nelected leaders is perhaps the most fundamental tenet of American \ndemocracy.\n  Unfortunately, this trust and faith has been shattered by a culture \nof special interest influence that has convinced the American people \nthat their elected representatives are no longer working in the \npeople's interest, but rather for their own and special interests.\n  But the proposed solution to changing those negative perceptions that \nwe are debating today would, I believe, represent a profound retreat \nfrom the principle of representative government itself.\n  Moreover, what we are debating is yet another proposed fundamental \nchange to the U.S. Constitution. Consider that already in the 104th \nCongress we have debated and voted on a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget and a constitutional amendment to prohibit \nindividuals from dishonoring the American flag.\n  It should be pointed out that in the entire 209-year history of our \nNation that, excluding the Bill of Rights, we have amended the \nConstitution just 17 times. Just 17 times Mr. President, in over 200 \nyears.\n  And yet in the 104th Congress alone, almost 140 constitutional \namendments have been introduced, from issues ranging from the balanced \nbudget, to tax increases, to flag burning, to school prayer, to the \nabortion issue and so on.\n  Madam President, I do not believe that we should seek to solve every \nsocial ill in our country by making radical alterations to a document \nthat was so carefully crafted 200 years ago and that has provided \nremarkable guidance to our Nation for so long. We must find alternative \nsolutions.\n  It has, in fact, been well established that the Framers of the \nConstitution did not believe congressional term limits would be \nbeneficial to the new nation.\n  Let me quote James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, in \nFederalist Paper No. 53. He wrote the following about his vision of a \nCongress:\n\n       A few of the members, as happens in all such assemblies, \n     will possess superior talents; will, by frequent re-\n     elections, become members of long standing; will be \n     thoroughly masters of public business. . . . The greater the \n     proportion of new members and the less the information of the \n     bulk of the members, the more apt they will be to fall into \n     the snares that may be laid for them.\n\n  It is this point of Madison's that I would like to underscore and \nthat I believe illustrates why it is so important to have a mix of \nindividuals--some experienced and seasoned, others newly elected--\nserving in the U.S. Senate. Moreover, it is important for us to \nconsider how the history of the U.S. Senate and this Nation might have \nbeen different had term limitations been in effect for the past 200 \nyears.\n  We have had some truly outstanding individuals serve in the U.S. \nSenate. Republican or Democratic, Conservative, or Liberal, these \nindividuals, whether you agreed with them or not, were defined not only \nby their tremendous legislative accomplishments but also by their \ncharacter and the principles they often stood and fought for.\n  Had we had term limits, a great number of these individuals would \nhave been needlessly forced out of office.\n  I am sure that all of my colleagues at one time or another have spent \ntime in the Senate reception room, just outside this Chamber, and \nnoticed the magnificent portraits hanging in that room.\n  In 1955, the U.S. Senate established a commission headed by Senator \nJohn F.\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\nKennedy, charging that commission with the responsibility of \ndesignating the five greatest U.S. Senators in our Nation's history.\n  After substantial input from other Senators and the academic \ncommunity, the commission chose Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. \nCalhoun, Robert M. LaFollette, Sr., and Robert A. Taft, Sr., Portraits \nof these five Senators are hanging today in the Senate reception room.\n  Clearly, the great legislative and oratory skills exercised by these \ngreat figures can be directly attributed to their extended years of \nservice in the U.S. Senate. Interestingly, not a single one of these \nfive greatest Senators served in the Senate for less than 12 years. \nTaft was the novice, having served only 14 years. Calhoun served 19 \nyears, LaFollette served 22 years and Clay and Webster each served 24 \nyears.\n\n  And these five Senators are certainly not alone. The history books \nare full of names such as Humphrey, Dirksen, Goldwater, Hart, and so \non.\n  I believe that having experienced Senators in this body is not only \nhealthy for our democracy, but critical to our ability to responsibly \ncarry out the constitutional duties of the legislative branch of \nGovernment.\n  Madam President, as a relatively new Member to this body, it has been \npersonally beneficial and an honor to serve with some of the more \nsenior Members, such as the senior Senator from West Virginia, whose \nmere presence reminds us all of the importance of maintaining a sense \nof respect and civility and the need to pay deference to this \ninstitution and the traditions associated with it that have enduring \nvalue.\n  And think about so many effective and honorable Members of the \ncurrent U.S. Senate whose services would be lost if a term limits law \nwas in effect.\n  In all, 44 current Members of this body--almost half--would not have \nthe ability to continue as U.S. Senators because they have been here \nfor more than 12 years.\n  Mr. President, judging an elected official's commitment, their \ndedication and their competence by an arbitrary time limit is \nsenseless. Term limits supporters seem to suggest that representing the \npeople is the one profession in America in which having experience \nmakes you underqualified for the job.\n  We must remember that what term limits supporters are asking us to do \nis to take away the cornerstone of a representative democracy--the \nright to vote for the candidate of your choice. More than anything \nelse, the freedoms associated with the right to vote are what make \nAmericans the envy of the modern world. We should not take that right \naway from the American people.\n  We have heard a lot of talk, Mr. President, during this Congress \nabout the importance of devolution, and returning control over local \nmatters to State and local governments. The majority leader wants to \n``dust off the 10th amendment'' and we have been told time after time \nthat the Federal Government should stay out of State and local \ndecisionmaking.\n  Well, Mr. President, the legislation before us today makes a mockery \nout of that principle. The legislation before us provides that the \nFederal Government will automatically disqualify certain individuals \nfrom representing their States and local communities.\n  I believe, and the Framers clearly believed, that neither residents \nof other States nor elected representatives of other States have the \nright to tell the people of Wisconsin who they can and cannot vote for, \nother than the qualifications that are enumerated in the Constitution.\n  And that is what term limits is all about--telling the American \npeople that they are prohibited from voting for a particular \nrepresentative because that individual has bumped up against some \narbitrary deadline.\n  Supporters of term limits argue that if elected officials know that \nthey are only serving for a set amount of time and do not have to be \nconcerned with frequent campaigning, these representatives will be more \napt to work in the public's interest, and not their own.\n  Quite frankly, I find this hard to believe. Numerous historical \ndocuments demonstrate that the Framers included the concept of frequent \nelections to the Congress to make representatives directly accountable \nto those they represent.\n  The rationale was, if a legislator did his job, and adequately \nrepresented his constituents and advanced what was in their collective \nbest interests, that representative would be rewarded by reelection. If \nthe legislator was irresponsible, did not perform or fulfill his \nduties, the voters would exercise their right to replace that \nparticular representative. The ballot box, as it was intended to be by \nthe Framers, is essentially a job performance review for Members of \nCongress.\n  But term limits would nullify this check, taking these sort of \ndecisions out of the hands of the voters.\n  Moreover, if a Senator is in their final term, knowing they cannot be \nreelected, it would seem to me that they would be less likely to \nrepresent the best interests of their constituents and more likely to \nrepresent their own self-interests.\n  After all, they can no longer serve in Congress, they will have to \nseek future outside employment--maybe with a Washington DC, special \ninterest group or lobbying firm. The argument that term limits would \nmake elected officials more responsible legislators was raised over 200 \nyears ago at the New York ratification convention, to which Alexander \nHamilton replied, ``When a man knows he must quit his station, let his \nmerit be what it may, he will turn his attention chiefly to his own \nemolument.''\n\n  Supporters would have us believe that our current system would be \nsupplanted with a class of citizen-legislators, who are less concerned \nabout a career of politics and more concerned about being a truly \ndeliberative body than they are with responding to the whims of the \nelectorate.\n  This line of reasoning sounds like an attempt to reinvent the wheel. \nFirst of all, the Congress of the United States is already comprised of \na diverse groups of individuals with unique backgrounds in a variety of \nfields, including education, law, business, journalism, medicine, and \nyes, politics. Virtually every one of us held jobs in the private \nsector before we ran for public office, and we will all eventually \nreturn to the private sector either when we decide to retire or when \nour employers, the voters, believe we have overstayed our welcome.\n  I would like to briefly respond to those who suggest that seeking a \ncareer in public service is somehow an inherent character flaw. First, \nlet me say that the list of ``professional politicians'' begins with \nnames such as Madison and Jefferson, and ends with figures such as \nRoosevelt and Kennedy. We should remember that these individuals were \ntruly public servants, and gave little thought to what Alexander \nHamilton referred to as ``personal emolument.''\n  They inspired many of us to enter into public service because we too \nthought it was a noble and honorable thing to do.\n  Madam President, as I said from the outset, I agree with many of the \nassumptions and concerns that term limits supporters put forth in their \narguments.\n  The election scales today are unquestionably weighted unevenly toward \nincumbents, and challengers do not have an adequate opportunity to \nunseat sitting Members of Congress.\n  One very viable alternative to term limits that does not require \namending the Constitution--and what I believe represents one of the \nmost important issues facing us today--is the opportunity to reform our \ncampaign finance laws. I am convinced that fundamental campaign finance \nreform would cure the ills of incumbency that have been derided by term \nlimits supporters and what have unquestionably contributed to the \ndeterioration of fair and competitive congressional elections.\n  That is why I have joined others, including some very noted term \nlimits supporters such as the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, and others in \noffering the first bipartisan and bicameral campaign finance reform \nbill in nearly a decade.\n  This bill has an enormously broad range of bipartisan support. Fifty-\nsix Members of the 104th Congress, including 25 Republicans and 31 \nDemocrats, have signed on to the House and Senate bills. The President \nsupports it. The Ross Perot organization supports it. Common Cause, \nPublic Citizen and\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nnewspaper editorials from around the country have endorsed the McCain-\nFeingold-Thompson legislation.\n  And while only 45 Senators voted earlier this year for a sense of the \nSenate that we should consider term limits legislation, 57 Senators \nvoted for the resolution I offered last year stating that we should \nconsider campaign finance reform legislation prior to the conclusion of \nthe 104th Congress.\n  This body recently demonstrated on the issue of health reform that \nSenators from the two parties can set aside their partisan and \nideological differences, compromise when necessary and produce a \nmeaningful piece of legislation that will help a great number of \npeople.\n  Campaign finance reform is no different, and I am convinced that \nthere are enough Senators who care about this issue, including many of \nthe supporters of term limits, who can come together and pass a \nmeaningful and comprehensive reform bill.\n  Term limits are no doubt a popular idea, but so is comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform. And if we can solve a problem that all parties \nseem to agree exists--that is, the unfair advantages held by \nincumbents--by means other than a constitutional amendment, we should \naggressively pursue that avenue before considering such a fundamental \nchange to our Constitution.\n  In a society that considers the right to vote its national treasure \nand most sacred natural resource, term limits may be the ultimate form \nof an intrusive and overreaching Federal Government. I urge my \ncolleague to reject this latest proposed change to our Constitution.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nJoint Resolution 21 proposing a constitutional amendment to limit the \nterms for Members of Congress to two terms in the Senate and six terms \nin the House of Representatives.\n  This Congress has passed some critical pieces of legislation, many of \nwhich effectively limit the role of the Federal Government in the \neveryday lives of citizens and shift power back to the States. Members \non both sides of the aisle worked together in a bipartisan manner to \nenact legislation such as the Congressional Accountability Act, the \nUnfunded Mandate Reform Act, and even the Line-Item Veto Act, all which \nimprove the responsiveness of Congress to the people. In this same vein \nof limited government, accountability, and States rights I strongly \nsupport passage of Senate Joint Resolution 21 before us today.\n  Term limit legislation is an important issue to the voters of Idaho. \nSince 1990, 23 States, including Idaho, have clearly voiced their \nsupport for limiting congressional terms. In 1994, Idahoans \noverwhelmingly approved a ballot measure supporting term limits. \nHowever, on May 22, 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court, in U.S. Term Limits \nversus Thorton ruled that State-imposed term limits are \nunconstitutional. With the Supreme Court decision against State-imposed \nterm limits, the only avenue left to implement the will of the people \nis through passage of a constitutional amendment.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned a citizen legislature where Members \nwould do their civic duty and then return home. Individuals from all \nwalks of life could bring new ideas and special talents to this body. \nThe natural rotation in office was what was expected by the public and \ndemonstrated by the public servants. But over the years, this practice \nhas changed.\n  The Framers of our Constitution pictured private citizens--not career \npoliticians--who took time to serve their country. A rotation of \nservice in Congress allows for new people to participate in the \nlegislative process. As Thomas Jefferson stated about tenure for \ncongressional Members, he said, ``(m)y reason for fixing them for a \nterm of years, rather than life, was that they might have an idea that \nthey were at a certain period to return into the mass of the people and \nbecome the governed instead of the governors * * *.''\n  Far too many Members stay in our Nation's Capital too long, losing \ntouch with their constituency. The time is here for Congress to pass \nlegislation to constitutionally limit the tenure of Members of \nCongress. I believe we should let the States have the opportunity to \nratify a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of Members of \nCongress.\n  As we discuss term limitations, we are not without precedent for \nFederal term limitations. We are a co-equal branch of Government with \nthe executive branch. But with the ratification of the 22d amendment in \n1957, the American people imposed term limits on the executive branch. \nIf service for the President of the United States should be limited, \nwhy shouldn't the legislative branch be treated equally?\n  In 1992, on the 4th of July, in fact, as a candidate for the U.S. \nSenate, I pledged my support to constitutionally limit the length of \ntime a citizen may serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and the \nU.S. Senate. I have kept my promise. During my first year in the U.S. \nSenate I cosponsored term limit legislation. And last year, I \ncosponsored Senate Joint Resolution 21, which is before us today, to \npropose a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of Members of \nCongress.\n  Not only do I believe I have kept my promise to the people of Idaho, \nI believe I have kept an unspoken promise to the Framers of our \nConstitution.\n  In fact, as presented in the Federalist Papers, No. 57, James Madison \nwrote,\n\n       The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, \n     first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to \n     discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of the \n     society; and * * * to take the most effectual precautions for \n     keeping them virtuous whilst they continue to hold their \n     public office.\n\n  James Madison continued to write, that the most effective way to \nprevent degeneracy of representation is that ``a limitation of the term \nof appointments * * * will maintain a proper responsibility to the \npeople.''\n  In conclusion, I believe we can achieve this ideal envisioned by our \nFounding Fathers by enacting 12-year term limits within each Chamber of \nCongress--two terms in the Senate and six terms in the House. It is \nthis Senator's view that term limits would improve the efficiency of \nthe Congress and make it more responsible to the people of this great \nNation. Let us pass Senate Joint Resolution 21 and give the States the \npower to decide if there ought to be term limitations on Members of \nCongress.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is on this side, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am told it is 22 on the Democratic side, and \n12 minutes and 15 seconds on the Republican side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Missouri do not mind, I will yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I hope that the American people are not \nbeing fooled by what is going on in connection with Senate \n``nonconsideration'' of this proposed constitutional amendment to \nimpose term limits. Basically, the way it was zipped through the \nJudiciary Committee and called up here with a protective series of \namendments and a cloture petition was done in such a way that you \ncannot even attempt to amend it. It is bumper-sticker politics. It is \ncampaign fodder. But it is not a serious debate. I say that meaning no \ndisrespect for the handful of Senators--and it really is only a handful \nof Senators--in this body who actually do want a constitutional \namendment on term limits.\n  The way this has been set up almost guarantees that there will be no \ncloture voted. Certainly guarantees that my amendment, which would make \nit apply to each of us and thus make it real term limits, could not be \nvoted on. Some want to be able to stand up and say, ``I was for term \nlimits. Gosh, what a shame we did not get to vote on it.'' And they \nwill blame everybody else.\n  I suspect that we will probably see the Whitewater prosecutor coming \nin and blaming the President and the First Lady for this. Lord knows, \nhe is blamed for just about everything else, from tornadoes to whether \nthey made $1,000 or lost $1,000.\n  Frankly, I feel sorry for my good friend from Tennessee, whom I know \ndoes believe strongly in favor of term limits but is being put through \na charade. The charade is this: In the first 5 minutes of consideration \nlast Friday,\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nthe Republican leadership acted to ensure two things--that the proposal \nwould not be fully debatable and amendable, and that there would be no \nvotes on the merits in the Senate this year.\n  I regret that the American people have to endure this surreal display \nby a body that is yet to complete action on the budget, or \nappropriations, for the fiscal year that is more than half over.\n  Debate has been cut out. This constitutional amendment is really an \nincumbent's protection limit bill. Understand, Madam President, what it \nmeans. The American people think that we are voting for term limits. We \nare not.\n  If we were to pass this in the House and Senate and send it to the \nStates for ratification, do you know what this means? It means that a \nfive-term Senator in this body who voted for term limits could have \nthree more terms. They are not limited to two. They could have eight. I \nknow that there are Senators who say they are for term limits, and \napparently, on at least one occasion, have been for term limits before \nI was born. But they will keep on being here. They will keep on \nrunning. This does not limit them.\n  For example, consider a fourth-term Senator under this provision. The \nSenator could have at the very least two more terms and probably have \nthree more terms under this amendment for a total of six or seven, not \njust two terms. That Senator could end up voting for term limits and \nbecome a seven-term Senator.\n  What the proposed amendment does say is that somewhere way out into \nthe next century those men and women running for office could be \nlimited, but not those of us who are here. We protect ourselves under \nthis.\n  What we have is a case where you could say you are voting for a \nconstitutional amendment to consider limits on everybody else, but we \nend up protecting ourselves.\n  So it is like Moliere's ``Tartuffe.'' In that play, a hypocrite \nsucceeds for a time in fooling others and profiting from their naivete \nand trust. In the play, as here, in the end the hypocrisy is revealed \nand justice is done.\n  The fundamental hypocrisy in this term limits debate is that is has \nbeen orchestrated to include a special exemption for current Members of \nCongress. It has been designed expressly to disregard the full terms of \nservice of current Members. This is guaranteed.\n  For example--I only take these out as examples--I have great respect \nfor our distinguished President pro tempore who was first elected to \nthe Senate some 40 years ago--some 40 years ago, when I was 15, and has \nserved in the Senate since I was 15. He would be able to run for at \nleast three more terms. Knowing him, I suspect that he would be healthy \nenough to do it.\n\n  Our Judiciary Chairman observed in his additional views to the \nCommittee report: ``[I] have no personal interest in the prospects of \nsuch an amendment. Even were it to be passed by Congress and ratified \nby the States in relatively short order, it likely would not bar me \nfrom running for reelection until the year 2012, when I would be a spry \n78 years of age. There are many things that I hope to be doing in the \nyear 2012. Running for reelection is not on the list.''\n  I want to commend the House Judiciary Committee Chairman and our \nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman for being honest in their views and \ndeclaring their opposition to term limits from the outset. Chairman \nHyde made an impassioned speech on the House floor during their debate \nlast year and Chairman Hatch observed in his additional views in the \nCommittee report his ``strong reservations'' against the proposal and \nhis reasons for them.\n  I just worry that what much of the Senate is saying is one thing but \nwhat we are doing is something entirely different. In his column over \nthe last weekend, George Will may have said it best when he noted that \nthe Republican majority is ``deceiving the country about a principle of \nconstitutional dimension.''\n  If people really want to take this seriously, they would be moving to \nvote on the Leahy amendment, which would say any constitutional \namendment would take effect immediately upon ratification without a \nspecial exemption for sitting Members. Obviously, you could finish \nserving the term you were in, but if that was your second or greater \nterm, you could not run again. Instead, the way this is set up, a \nSenator can be in his fourth or fifth term, and run for as many as \nthree more terms.\n  If we intend to consider term limits, let us make it a real term \nlimit. If not, then what we are doing is simply playing games.\n  When I look at my own State, my predecessor Republican was elected \nthe year I was born and served until I got here. The people in each of \nour States make up their minds about what makes sense in term limits. \nAs the representative of a small State, I am acutely aware that we \nfulfil the purposes of the Senate and the best interests of our States \nwhen we obtain a bit of seniority and a track record on the issues. I \nurge all of our colleagues from smaller States to consider on this \npoint the additional views of Senator Biden and Senator Hatch from the \nCommittee report. As Senator Biden eloquently noted, the Connecticut \nCompromise and the equality of small States are put at issue by this \nproposed constitutional amendment. Term limits were viewed by the \nFounders as both ``pernicious'' and ``ill-founded''.\n  I have an enormous amount of respect for the distinguished majority \nleader. I have served with him throughout my whole Senate career. But \nhe would have had to leave at the end of my first term had there been a \n2-term limit in effect. The distinguished majority leader is one of the \nmost able legislators of either party with whom I have served. I think \nthat the country is better off because he is here. I hope that does not \nhurt his standing back home, but I mean it most sincerely.\n  This could be said of all of the majority and minority leaders we \nhave had here in both parties. These have been extremely able people--\nSenator Mansfield, Senator Baker, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, \nSenator Dole, and Senator Scott. These are people that we would not \nhave seen under term limits.\n  I must oppose what I perceive to be a growing fascination with laying \nwaste to our Constitutions and the protections that have served us well \nfor over 200 years. The First Amendment, separation of powers, the \npower of the purse, the right of the people to elect their \nrepresentatives, should be supported and defended. That is the oath \nthat we swore when we entered this public service. That is our duty to \nthose who forged this great document, our commitment to our \nconstituents and our legacy to those who will succeed us.\n  The Constitution should not be amended by sound bite. This proposed \nconstitutional amendment evidences a distrust not just of congressional \nrepresentatives but of those who sent us here, the people of our \nStates. Term limits would restrict the freedom of the electorate to \nchoose and are based on disdain for their unfettered judgment. These \nare not so much term limits as limits on the electorate to choose their \nrepresentatives.\n\n  To those who argue that this proposal will embolden us or provide us \nadded independence because we will not be concerned about reelection, I \nwould argue that you are turning our democracy on its head. This \nproposal would have the effect of eliminating accountability, not \nincreasing it.\n  It is precisely when we stand for reelection that the people, our \nconstituents, have the opportunity to hold us accountable. This \nproposal would eliminate that accountability by removing opportunities \nfor the people to reaffirm or reject our representation. It would make \neach of us a lame duck immediately upon reelection.\n  My fundamental objection to the proposed constitutional amendment is \nthis: It is, at base, distrustful of the electorate. It does not limit \ncandidates so much as it limits the rights of the people to choose \nwhoever they want to represent them. We should be acting to legislate \nmore responsively and responsibly, not to close off elections by making \nsome candidates off limits to the voters. I will put my faith in the \npeople of Vermont and keep faith with them to uphold the Constitution.\n  Now, let me ask, Madam President, I would like the opportunity to \ncall up my amendment. I filed it to the underlying bill and to the \nvariety of procedural alternatives filed by the Republican majority. It \nis my understanding\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nthat in the procedural posture that we have been put, I cannot call up \nmy amendment as Leahy amendment Nos. 3700, 3701, 3702, or the four \nsecond-degree amendments I filed earlier this afternoon.\n  Is my understanding correct that no Leahy amendment is in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point, there is no amendment in order, \nand the Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  Madam President, would my amendments be in order if cloture was \nvoted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until an amendment is acted upon, no further \namendment is in order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. At some time, Madam President, when my amendments are \nstill pending and all other amendments have been acted on, would they \nbe in order under cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the pending amendments are not acted on \nwithin the 30 hours, no other amendments would be in order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it the Chair's ruling that if you had an amendment \npending and the 30 hours ran out, that it would not be voted on even \nthough there was no time for debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the pending amendments could be acted \non but no further amendment could be called up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what the Chair is saying, for a layman, \nis that the Republican leadership has set up a way to make sure that \nnobody would be able to vote on a true term limit amendment, that is, \none that was retroactive in the sense that it would apply to us. \nRather, the situation we are in is one in which we could only vote on \nsomething that would allow a fourth or fifth or sixth-term Senator to \nstill run for as many as three more terms.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I yield the remaining time to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I thank you very much for this \nopportunity to speak. I express my deep appreciation to the majority \nleader for scheduling this historic opportunity for the Senate to act \nin a way which will allow the States to make a decision about whether \nor not to amend the Constitution of the United States to limit the \nterms of those of us who serve in the Congress.\n\n  Senator Dole, by bringing this issue to the floor when no other \nleader has been willing to do so for the last several decades, has \nstaked himself clearly on the side of the American people, the 70 to 80 \npercent of the American people who have endorsed term limits. And they \nhave done so knowingly. They have done so having had experience. They \nunderstand that the President of the United States has been term \nlimited since the early 1950's, that the Governors of 41 States are \nterm limited, that legislatures in a number of States are term limited, \nthat city councils are term limited from New York to Los Angeles and \nmany cities in between, and State officials in addition to the \nGovernor. What we find is that there is a tremendous exception that has \nbeen carved out for the Congress.\n  The suggestion that somehow the proposal before the Congress today \ndoes not involve real term limits because they are not retroactive \nreally flies in the face of what the people across this country have \ndone regarding term limits at home, for their city councils, for their \nGovernors, for their State legislatures. It flies in the face of their \nefforts because none of their efforts really provide for all this \nretroactivity.\n  When the people have spoken, they have decided that our laws should \noperate prospectively. This amendment would say that after its \nenactment, if it were to be embraced by the States, no person could be \nelected more than twice.\n  I believe that is a step in the right direction. It is a step in the \nright direction, and it is a necessary step because it reflects the \nwill of the people. We need to accord to the people the opportunity to \nmake a judgment about whether they want to amend the Constitution of \nthe United States so as to impose term limits on the Congress.\n  There have been those who have come to say that this is an idea of \npassionate demagogs, who as a result of frustration in the body politic \nhave now somehow embraced this issue because it is one for demagogs.\n  This issue was close to the heart of Thomas Jefferson. It was close \nto the heart of Richard Henry Lee. It was part of the debate at the \nfounding of our Republic. And then when they find out they do not want \nto call Thomas Jefferson a demagog and they do not want to say that \nRichard Henry Lee was a passionate individual just trying to play upon \nthe passions of the voters, they say, well, they decided against term \nlimits for the Senate and House and therefore the decision has been \nmade and we must respect it.\n  In all honesty, we have to understand that the Senate is a different \nbody than it was when the Founding Fathers created it. When the \nFounding Fathers assembled our Constitution and when it was embraced by \nthe colonies which were States, the Senate was not composed of people \nelected in popular elections. It was composed of individuals who were \nsent here by the State legislatures. None of the problems with \nelections, none of the problems with campaign financing, none of the \nincredible value to incumbents had surfaced. The Founding Fathers could \nnot possibly have anticipated that the Senate would need term limits \nbecause none of them really anticipated the popular election of \nSenators.\n  So for us to say that we need to give States the opportunity to \nimplement or employ term limits is for us to allow the people of the \nUnited States to fine tune a change they have already made to the \nConstitution. The change already made was to provide for the popular \nelection of Senators which resulted in the campaigns we see, resulted \nin the influence of resources in the campaigns, and it is high time \nthat we be able to correct an adjustment which we already made.\n  It is an adjustment which has tilted the playing field so \ndramatically toward incumbents that incumbency is a virtual guarantee \nof reelection. Nine out of every 10 incumbents end up being reelected. \nIt is no wonder then when there are incumbencies the number of people \nwho are running for office is constricted. People do not bother to try \nto get involved. That offends a fundamental value of America which is \naccess and participation.\n  It is kind of interesting to look back. Two years ago I was running \nfor the Senate. One of my opponents was a Member of the House. In the \nyear before he chose to step down and run for the Senate, there were \nonly two candidates. This year there are only two candidates for his \nseat. But in the year it was an open seat, there were 11 candidates. \nSome people say that to have term limits would reduce the number of \nchoices. If you reduce it from 11 to 2, I think it is an exponential \nexplosion in the number of choices. So the real choice would be \nexpanded by term limits, not limited.\n  Then there are those who say we have to have experience in the House \nand Senate. Nothing would keep us from having experience. People who \nare experienced in State government, people experienced in the House \nmove to the Senate. People experienced in the Senate move to the House. \nThey would not have the value of incumbency to tilt the playing field.\n  More importantly, I think it is essential that we recognize there is \nexperience in this life that counts every bit as much as experience in \nthe House or the Senate, and the people of America know about that \nexperience. It is the experience of raising families. It is the \nexperience of living under the laws. It is the experience of the \nprivate sector.\n\n  One of our colleagues said that we needed the experience of one \nSenator who is particularly good in the area of scientific awareness. \nWell, for Heaven's sake, the Senate is not the repository of science in \nAmerica. We need to welcome people from outside who know about science. \nAnd as I think about my colleague from Tennessee, who is a surgeon in \nheart transplantation, that is the kind of experience you cannot get in \nthe Senate. When we talk about things relating to medical challenges \nand how we are going to solve problems of access for people regarding \nhealth care, we have to listen carefully to experience that comes from \nbeyond Government. People of America know that\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nthe future of this country is far too important to trust to Government \nalone or to those who are experienced in Government alone. We need to \nwelcome experience from far beyond just the governmental sector. I \nthink it is important to listen to what George Washington said. \nWashington said:\n\n       Nor can the Members of Congress exempt themselves from \n     consequences of any unjust and tyrannical acts which they may \n     impose upon others for in a short time they will mingle with \n     the mass of the people.\n\n  It was anticipated that Members of the Congress would shortly mingle \nwith the mass of the people. One of those who has debated in this \nChamber suggested that the anticipation of mingling with the mass of \nthe people might somehow undermine the commitment of a person for \nservice.\n  George Washington saw it absolutely opposite. He thought that people \nwho knew they were going to have to go out there and live with the \npeople would render better service, not render lesser service; that \ntheir service would be more noble. And how do you measure nobility? By \nwhether or not it makes it better for the general public, whether it \nelevates the general welfare. George Washington said beware because you \nwill have to be mingling with the public. I think every Member of the \nHouse and Senate should look forward to mingling with the public. They \nshould look forward to going home. They should look forward to being in \na situation at a time and place when they live under the laws that we \nnot only propose but under the laws which we enact.\n  So we have a tremendous opportunity. It is an opportunity which will \nreinforce fundamental values of America,\n  The people's will must be served. Let me just reinforce this point. \nSeventy to 80 percent of Americans, with the knowledge of 50 years of \nexperience of term limits, say, ``It is something we want, we like.''\n  I think we ought to represent the people to the extent we are saying, \n``If you think you like that, let us give you a choice,'' not impose \nterm limits on them, but let us send it out to the States and create a \ngreat debate about it and let States determine whether or not they want \nterm limits. Let the people participate.\n  Seventy-four percent of the American people, according to one poll, \nsupport term limits. Twenty-three States, almost all of which had the \ninitiative so that people could start the movement for term limits \nthemselves with petitions, have enacted term limits.\n  We have the new ``electronics to petition the Congress.'' Over 50,000 \npeople visited the home page for term limits here in the U.S. Senate. \nWell over 7,000 people signed the petition. Of those--it was \noverwhelmingly in favor of term limits.\n  I believe that, in a democracy, we should accord to the people the \nopportunity to make decisions. We should trust them.\n  Then there is this idea, ``Oh, somehow we have to be careful that we \ndo not find ourselves absent the talent.'' There has been a wonderful \nparade of public figures oratorically through the Chamber of all the \npeople who were here and who might not have been able to serve for life \nor for extended periods had we had term limits.\n  If George Washington had thought that he was the only person who \ncould lead America, he would not have walked away after two terms. If \nThomas Jefferson had thought that there was a limited pool of talent, \nthat the American people were a very shallow pool and you could not \ntrust anyone else but them, he would not have walked away. President \nafter President walked away for the first 100 years of this Republic \nbecause they had a different kind of confidence in the American people \nthan we have heard expressed all too often here. They had a confidence \nthat there was greatness in this Republic and it was not limited to a \nfew who had been elected.\n  I was interested in what those people who wrote me on the Internet \nhad to say. One was ``7100'' who communicated, who said:\n\n       I see that you're a Republican. I'm not. This is one issue, \n     however, more important to me than the success of any party.\n\n  Another said:\n\n       Serving the public was never meant to be a way to amass \n     power and money. Our Founding Fathers would be ashamed. \n     Please stop the insanity and pass term limits now.\n\n  I think what we have is a great opportunity to say to the people, \n``We welcome your participation in Government.'' We hope that more \npeople will find their way into elections, and they will if there are \nfewer incumbencies that are extremely well funded. We hope that more \npeople will find their way into office to bring the wisdom of America \nto Washington, DC.\n  We do not distrust the talent of the American people. We think there \nare plenty of people who are capable of serving.\n  We think that the nature of real choice will be expanded, and we \nthink that there will be the evidence of a discipline in the Senate \nwhich will come from individuals who expect to return to mingle with \nthe public.\n  There are those who have said, ``Well, unless we make term limits \nretroactive so that we will virtually say anybody who has already \nserved two terms will be out from the date of enactment forward, we \nwill not have real term limits.'' Let me tell you, that is not the way \nterm limits have ever worked. The American people know how term limits \nwork. They have seen it work in their city councils, they have seen it \nwork in their States, they have seen it work for 40-plus Governors, and \nthey have seen it work for the President of the United States. The \ntruth of the matter is, so many of those individuals who suggest they \nwant that kind of term limits are opposing term limits altogether.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute in which to \nconclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, the fundamental values of the American \npeople compel us to accord them the opportunity to evaluate an \namendment to the Constitution proposing term limits, the value of \nchoice, the value of representing the people, the value of access and \nparticipation in politics and the value of limited power.\n  All of these components of American history, all of these principles \nby which we have stood are the principles which call upon us now in the \nvoices of 70 to 80 percent of the population in saying to us, ``Give us \nthe opportunity to participate in Government by ratifying an amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution which would limit terms of Members of the U.S. \nCongress.''\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired for the majority side. Is \nthere anyone seeking recognition from the minority side?\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I am informed that we have permission \nto yield back the time of the minority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3864-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3878-S3879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I think most of our colleagues know, \nMrs. Christine Mikulski, the mother of our dear friend and colleague, \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, passed away on March 31, during our Easter \nrecess.\n  My wife and I were fortunate to know ``Miss Chris,'' as she was known \nto all, for many years, and were privileged to call her our friend.\n  Miss Chris was enormously proud of the accomplishments of her \ndaughter, our colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, as indeed are we \nall. Miss Chris played a key role in all of Barbara's campaigns, and a \nkey role in Barbara's life, to really be very explicit about it. She \nwas an effective and enthusiastic volunteer in Senator Mikulski's \nconstituent service office in her home neighborhood of Highlandtown in \neast Baltimore. Indeed, she became known as Miss Chris, the First Lady \nof Highlandtown. And, indeed, she was a first lady.\n  Miss Chris was an extraordinary woman beloved by her family and \nfriends. She was part of that immigrant generation--her father was born \nin Poland--that built our Nation over the early decades of this \ncentury. She reflected that determination of spirit, courage and \nstrength of character, which are exactly the values we hold out to our \nyoung people to emulate today.\n  In an eloquent and heartfelt tribute at the funeral service on \nWednesday, April 3, Senator Mikulski spoke movingly about her mother \nand about the many ways in which her mother was so special to her \nfamily, her community, her church, and all who were privileged to know \nher. I simply wanted to take this opportunity to share with my \ncolleagues Senator Mikulski's eloquent tribute to her mother on that \noccasion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her tribute be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows\n\n                 Remarks of Senator Barbara A. Mikulski\n\n       My mother would have been pleased by this gathering. She \n     would have been honored that so many people came today. She \n     would have been pleased to have her family here today. She \n     would have been honored that the Governor and the mayor were \n     here.\n       My mother would have been honored that Senator Paul \n     Sarbanes, members of Congress, and the Baltimore City Council \n     were here today. She would have loved that members of her \n     clubs and organizations were here.\n       She would have also loved the fact that she made the \n     headlines in the Baltimore Sun and the Washington Post. That \n     she was on radio and television. That Richard Scher announced \n     her favorite name--the First Lady of Highlandtown.\n       She would have been touched by the fact that the President \n     of the United States called to express his condolences and \n     that Vice President Al Gore called because he very much \n     wanted me to bring my mother to lunch at their home in \n     Washington. He was sorry that he and Tipper never met my \n     mother.\n       My mother, as you know was a very determined lady. She \n     always planned ahead. She had very specific instructions \n     about today and the way she wanted to be remembered. In her \n     final days, with the illness fast overtaking her, she gave me \n     some very specific instructions about today.\n       One of those was to be sure to thank everybody. You know my \n     mother was an enormously courteous and considerate woman. So \n     there were certain thank you's she wanted me to give for her. \n     I'd also like to say they are from me and my family.\n       First she said be sure to thank the priests. Thank the \n     priests of Loyola College. Other priests in the audience.\n       My mother particularly wanted me to thank the priest of \n     Holy Rosary, where she was baptized, went to school, and \n     married. She also wanted me to thank the priests here at \n     Sacred Heart, her home parish for more than 50 years. She \n     said say thanks to the priests at Sacred Heart for their \n     prayers, where we made our first communion, graduation, and \n     where we went to school.\n       Father Ed Foley, she particularly wanted me to thank you \n     for bringing her communion every day throughout the days she \n     was shut-in. As she would always say to you when you left, \n     ``Father, I am very grateful.''\n       She wanted me particularly to thank the nuns. All of those \n     who are here, who taught my sisters and me. The holy nuns who \n     ran the day care center, she wanted to say thanks to you all \n     for the good work that you do and for what you meant to our \n     family.\n       My mother wanted me to thank the Sisters of Mercy. The \n     Sisters of Mercy who educated my sisters and me, who ran the \n     hospital where my sisters and me were born. My mother said \n     thank you. It was there that we were born, it was there that \n     she died. It was there she went during so many emergencies \n     and was rescued. And she was very grateful for your comfort \n     until the end. So she asked me to thank you.\n       She also said to say thank you to the Polish Women's \n     Alliance ladies, who were her honorary pall bearers today. \n     She loved being a member of the Alliance. She was very proud \n     of her Polish heritage. She was very proud to be a member of \n     a Polish Heritage Association. She loved the friendship. She \n     loved the fellowship. She loved the bingo. She loved you, \n     Lorraine. She loved your mother, Miss Viki.\n       She asked me to remind you that when she was 16 years old, \n     she won an essay contest run by the Polish Falcons. The prize \n     was a trip to Poland. She was very proud of that and very \n     thankful for the opportunity to go to the land of her \n     heritage.\n       She wanted me to thank the ladies at the Altor Society, who \n     gave her a candle light honor guard today. She wanted me to \n     give a special thanks to the ``Cheer-up Club,'' of which she \n     was a perpetual member.\n       My mother also wanted me to thank the neighbors. To Rosie, \n     to Pat, to Mel--thanks for helping out and being there during \n     the hard days. But, she said, remember the good days and the \n     grocery store.\n       As you know my mother and my father, Willie, ran a grocery \n     store in Highland. They saw many people through hard times. \n     My mother asked me to thank all the people for coming to the \n     store. There were so many of you who told so many stories to \n     me about going to the store.\n       My mother was Miss Chris and my father was Mr. Willie. My \n     sisters and I were known as little Willies. We heard all the \n     stories about the extra candy my mother distributed to the \n     children. She was known a the lollipop lady. Also she was the \n     lady who, along with my father, would give extra store credit \n     to families during those hard times.\n       My mother would stand at the back of the store by the cash \n     register and give tips to the homemakers and favorite \n     recipes. She always pretended she liked to cook, but as my \n     sisters and I know, my mother really liked carry out. She was \n     a woman of the 90's--in the 1950's and the 1960's.\n       She and my father were a fantastic team running that \n     grocery store. And as you know, they brought a tremendous \n     amount of goodness and generosity into this community.\n       My mother and father were also wonderful parents. My \n     sisters and I could not have had a better mother than our \n     mother. She saw to it that we had a good home.\n       They worked very hard so that we would have a good \n     education, and that we would also have the extras. Whether it \n     was the ballet lessons or whether it was the trip for \n     leadership training. Whatever it was--slumber parties, the \n     prom, all of those things--they wanted us to have a very good \n     life. They didn't realize though that the greatest gift they \n     gave us was themselves and their love.\n       My mother really loved her family. She loved her husband, \n     her daughters, her brothers, her sisters, her in-laws.\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\n       She remembered the great times when we would all go down to \n     my grandfather's shore. We played scrabble and canasta. My \n     mother loved the lottery. You have to know that over the last \n     days, my mother had five of us buying her little lotto \n     tickets. Why? Not because she liked to gamble. She liked \n     the action. She loved being involved.\n       When our grocery store closed in the 1970's, mother \n     volunteered in my office. That's where she got the great \n     name--Miss Chris, The First Lady of Highlandtown.\n       She helped run my neighborhood office. She worked with me \n     in the City Hall when I served on the City Council. Then she \n     worked in my Congressional office on Eastern Avenue and then \n     my Senate office on Highland Avenue.\n       She ran my neighborhood office. Whenever people would call \n     she would say, ``Hi. I'm Barb's mother. What can I do to help \n     you?''\n       If anyone asked where I was, my mother would say, ``Don't \n     worry about. I'll take care of it. I'll tell her tonight, \n     because I talk to her everyday.'' And she did.\n       When I looked at the flowers at the funeral home, I noticed \n     that many of the flowers were from workers. They were from \n     the workers at General Motors. They came from the workers at \n     the Coast Guard Yard. They came from the workers at Goddard. \n     Why? Not because of me, but because many of them knew her. \n     They often spoke to her on the phone.\n       When Congress threatened to close Goddard, the workers \n     called my mother looking for me. They came last night to the \n     funeral home. They brought a poem. They told me they had a \n     great time talking to my mother. She told them I loved the \n     space program. My mother didn't know I ever loved the space \n     program, but she made them feel special, feel valued and \n     reassured like she did for so many.\n       Well for all of us, my sister, her grandchildren, she \n     always loved us. She would leave us little messages on the \n     answering machine. She would leave us little notes. She would \n     send us notes in the mail that said, ``Be aware.'' And then \n     she would ask about them.\n       My mother would also send us prayers. Because she believed \n     that for every problem, there wasn't always a solution, but \n     for every problem, there was always a prayer that helped us \n     get to the solution. She was devoutly religious. It was her \n     faith and her prayers that sustained her.\n       Mother had a very keen mind, incredible attention to \n     detail, and was a superb organizer. She had an enormously \n     strong presence.\n       Now, as we come close to the end, and we can all think back \n     to the wonderful days and years we had together. She was a \n     wonderful neighbor. She was always taking care of someone. \n     She was always taking care of her family. She was always \n     taking care of people in need.\n       But I want you also to know that our mother was a lot of \n     fun. She had a great sense of humor. She loved getting out \n     with her friends. She loved family outings and social \n     occasions. She loved going to political events.\n       My mother loved hearing about the new restaurants with \n     names like ``Wild Mushroom.'' And she loved the old favorites \n     that she and my father went to like Haussner's. She loved \n     going to Eastern House with her friend Ethel.\n       Mother was so outgoing. She was so strong. She had \n     incredible presence. And because of this presence and because \n     of her outgoingness, we all wondered with some apprehension \n     how she would cope with being a shut in.\n       Two years after my father's death, she was so ill, she \n     could no longer go out. Diabetes had given her diabetic \n     neuropathy. Illness had taken its toll. She was to stay at \n     home--most often in a wheelchair.\n       Once more, our mother surprised us. She amazed us. And she \n     inspired us. Though she had to give up going out or going to \n     the office, she just didn't give up. Her presence was strong \n     to the end.\n       In her wheel chair, or welcoming visitors or being on the \n     phone, she was full of great cheer. She called me to tell us \n     what was happening and always wanted us to do the same.\n       My mother was intellectually inquisitive until the last \n     days, reading The Paper. She wanted a subscription to People \n     magazine so she could be ``up on it'' and be able to talk to \n     her grandsons and granddaughters. Even when her eyes were \n     going, she would read with a magnifying glass with a light so \n     that she could be involved.\n       My mother faced her illness the way she faced life itself--\n     with great dignity and with great courage. My mother was \n     incredible. She had great spirit, great stamina and great \n     spunk.\n       She insisted on being self-sufficient. Whenever we wanted \n     to help, she would say, ``let me do it myself, that's how I \n     keep going.'' And she did, right up to the end.\n       Mother's faith inspired us all. She adopted a prayer \n     ministry when she was at home with her illness, praying for \n     the sick, for a special intention someone had requested, for \n     her family, friends and her country.\n       She took it very seriously. Like everything else, she \n     believed in doing her duty. She did it with a combination of \n     great determination, great devotion and great love.\n       My mother had a good life. She celebrated her 50th wedding \n     anniversary with my father, who was still well enough to \n     participate. She saw my two sisters, Chris and Fran, marry \n     two wonderful men, both named Ed. She had five fantastic \n     grandchildren. One is a Captain in the United States \n     military. She has a granddaughter who is a nurse at Johns \n     Hopkins. Another soon will be a nurse. A grandson planning on \n     medical school. And another grandson contemplating about what \n     he can do to bring about social change.\n       She saw me elected to the United States Senate. She was \n     very proud that I was the first women of Polish heritage ever \n     elected to Congress and the first Democratic woman elected to \n     the Senate in her own right. So she saw many good things. She \n     loved life.\n       So in closing, we ask you to remember our mother. We ask \n     you to remember the good times. To her friends of many years, \n     remember her young and dancing. To those who were her \n     neighbors and her constituents, remember her at the store and \n     at the office, helping out with a helping hand.\n       We, her family, will remember her playing with us, playing \n     with her grandchildren. We'll remember her playing cards and \n     just having a good time. We'll remember her being there for \n     us in so many ways.\n       We ask that you remember her during the holidays and the \n     Holy days. She and my father would have been getting ready \n     now for Easter. Now she is with her own mother, and with our \n     dear father. I know she will remember us in paradise.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to, in the most heartfelt way, \nthank Senator Sarbanes for the very kind words he said about my mother \nand for his gracious generosity in putting that statement in the \nRecord. My mother thought the world of Senator Sarbanes, but she also \nthought the world of the U.S. Senate and was very honored that I was in \nit. I thank the Senate for its courtesy at this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

But it is an indication that term limits will not go \naway. I want to commend my colleagues, as I have done before, \nparticularly the freshmen on this side, many of whom have pledged to \nserve only two terms. They have made their point. They have made it in \na very objective way and a nonpartisan way. They have listened to the \nAmerican people.\n\n  I congratulate Senator Thompson, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Thomas, \nand others who worked so hard, and also Senator Brown, who has been \npursuing this matter for some time, and thank all of my colleagues who \nvoted, in effect, with us on cloture.\n  That would not have determined whether or not we would have term \nlimits, but we could have gone on to the debate on term limits.\n  Perhaps there will be another day. There will be another day, not \n``perhaps.'' There will be another day. I believe the American people \ncan now sift through the records and make a determination on who was \nfor and who was against even debating or going to term limits.\n  I think that is very significant. I think the vote just held in the \nU.S. Senate is a most significant vote, and it will have a far-reaching \nimpact.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a week ago today the last of the United \nStates troops who had been sent to Haiti came\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\nhome. These brave soldiers, as well as others from countries around the \nworld, helped bring enormous changes to that troubled nation, that \ntroubled neighbor of the United States. Last Tuesday's withdrawal \nprovides us an opportunity to reflect upon what has been accomplished, \nwhat is left to be done, and what special role the United States--and \nparticularly those of us who have a responsibility in the National \nGovernment of the United States--will play in this next series of \nchapters of the nation of Haiti.\n  There has been considerable attention focused on the problems that \nremain in Haiti, and any observer would admit that there are very \nsubstantial challenges yet to be overcome in that nation. But I believe \nthat an analysis would also require some comparison of what is the \ncircumstance in Haiti today, in April of 1996, as compared to the \nrecent past.\n\n  Let us take the period of 1993. Haiti in 1993 was a scene of anarchy \nand lawlessness. Haiti's military dictatorship ruled by machete. There \nhad been an estimated 3,000 political killings per year during the \nreign of terror of the military dictatorship.\n  I remember, Mr. President, visiting a Catholic church in downtown \nPort-au-Prince where a Government official had been removed from a mass \nin front of his terrorized family and friends, taken into the street, \nand summarily executed.\n  A few weeks later, with a delegation from the United States, I had \nthe honor of placing a wreath at the point at which that brave citizen \nof Haiti gave his life. For that action and others, I was declared \npersona non grata and was not allowed to reenter Haiti as long as the \nmilitary dictatorship was in control.\n  Haiti continues as a violent society. It has been a violent society \nsince the establishment of the republic, the second republic--second \nonly to the United States of America--in the Western Hemisphere.\n  But since the arrival of United States troops and other international \nmilitary and civilian participants in an effort to restore democracy to \nHaiti, 30,000 weapons have been removed from the streets. Today there \nis the fledgling beginnings of civilian law enforcement and a judicial \nsystem.\n  In 1993, there was no independent law enforcement capability in \nHaiti. Law enforcement was an adjunct of a corrupt military. There was \nno semblance of an independent judiciary. The judiciary was subservient \nto the autocratic military dictatorship. While there is a long road to \ntravel to bring Haiti to a mature justice system, the first steps have \nbeen taken.\n  In 1993 and again in 1994, thousands of refugees left Haiti headed \nfor the United States in man-made rafts. Mr. President, 25,600 persons \nwere rescued at sea during the first half of 1994 alone--25,600 persons \nrescued at sea during a 6-month period. Countless others were less \nfortunate. They died of dehydration or were eaten by sharks.\n  After the United States-led operation, the flow of refugees from \nHaiti has plummeted. In 1995, the Coast Guard intercepted only 5 \npercent of the number that had been intercepted in 1994, the first 9 \nmonths of 1994 having been under the rule of the military regime. The \ntotal numbers intercepted in 1995 were 1,204 individuals.\n\n  On democracy, Haiti has been an independent Republic with the \npretense of democracy for 192 years. But during the first 191 of those \n192 years, there has never been in the history of the country a \ntransition of power peacefully from one democratically elected \nPresident to a successor democratically elected President--191 years in \nwhich the democratically elected President was either toppled by a \nmilitary regime, beheaded, forced into exile, or in some other manner \ninvoluntarily relinquished political responsibility and another, often \nnondemocratically elected, successor took his place.\n  In February of this year, for the first time, that historic event \noccurred. President Aristide voluntarily, peacefully, pursuant to the \nHaitian Constitution, transferred the power to the new President. The \nUnited States, during an equivalent period of time of our history as a \nRepublic, had 40 peaceful democratic changes of administration. This \nwas the first time that had occurred in the history of Haiti.\n  So, Mr. President, as we talk about the things yet to be done, I \nthink we as a democratic nation, we as a nation which has had a long \nand intimate history with Haiti, we as a nation which decided that it \nwas intolerable to have old-style military autocratic regimes using \ntheir power of the machete, power of the sword, and power of the gun in \norder to displace a democratically elected government, we who are \nwilling to organize the international community in an effective effort \nto restore democracy to Haiti, I think should take some pride in the \nchanges that have occurred and the steps, beginning though they may be, \ntoward respect for human rights and democracy in Haiti.\n  But much remains to be done. Since Operation Restore Hope, the United \nStates troops and their civilian counterparts have given the people in \nHaiti the chance to rebuild their country. Some of the things that \nremain to be done include poverty and unemployment, which continue to \nplague the Haitian people. The estimates are that unemployment now is \nin the range of 80 percent plus. With an uncertain future, the Haitian \npeople lack a sense of optimism for what the future holds for \nthemselves and their children. International investors have been wary \nabout returning to Haiti and continuing the rebuilding of the economy.\n\n  I applaud those of my colleagues who are dissatisfied with actions \nthat have occurred in Haiti such as the limited investigation of some \nof the political killings. We must insist upon continued progress in \nthis area. This Congress and this Federal Government have special \nresponsibilities to help the Haitian people maintain their momentum \ntoward democracy and respect for human rights and an improved economic \nfuture.\n  Some of the things that are particular responsibilities of this \nCongress include a role to play in training the new Haitian Parliament, \nthe first Parliament that truly justifies the characterization of being \nan independent legislative branch in the history of the Republic of \nHaiti.\n  The Haitian police force needs continued guidance. We have assisted \nin selecting and training some 5,000 Haitian police officers who will \nbe the beginnings of an independent police presence in that nation. It \nis like having a police force made up of 5,000 rookie police, each with \napproximately 4 months of training before being placed on the streets. \nWe now have a role to play in the maturing of that police force, the \ndevelopment of a leadership cadre, the development of a culture of how \na police force maintains itself in that democratic society.\n  Probably the most difficult task that we face is in assisting the \nHaitian people in the revitalization of their economy. We must work \nwith President Preval, and we must assure that there is a movement \ntoward a marketplace, privatized economy in Haiti. For too long the \nHaitian people have suffered under an economy which has been highly \ncentralized, highly socialized, and enormously corrupt and inefficient. \nThe Haitian Government must also work with international financial \ninstitutions to create a climate that will make it again receptive for \nforeign investment.\n  President Aristide established the goal of Haitian economic progress \nwhich was to move from misery to poverty with dignity. The Haitian \npeople should have a friend and partner in the United States in that \nroad that they have yet to walk.\n  Mr. President, a concern that I have at this juncture is the ability \nof the United States to build on the progress that has been made and to \nassist the Haitian people in overcoming the challenges that still \nremain. It has become bogged down in domestic partisan politics, and we \nhave been less constructive than we need to be in assisting our \nneighbors in Haiti. We have wasted valuable energy and time trying to \neither establish the grandeur of the gains that we have made or to \npoint out each shortcoming. As difficult as those shortcomings may be, \nthey have been given a proportion which is out of relationship to the \ntotality of the circumstances in Haiti.\n\n  Both the Congress and the administration, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, have some legitimate opportunity to share in the successes \nthat have been achieved in Haiti and to accept the responsibilities for \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\n We will do a disservice to the United States ability to influence the \nprogress and future of a country which is important enough to us that \nwe have just invested almost $2 billion and the lives of thousands of \nU.S. uniformed and civilian personnel, and we will have lost the \nopportunity to demonstrate our serious commitment to assisting a \ncountry which is trying to go through some of the most difficult \ntransitions--from tyranny to democracy, from anarchy to a civilized \nsociety, from misery to poverty with dignity.\n  Those are our challenges. Those challenges are only going to be met \nif we do it on a bipartisan basis. This Senate met that challenge in \ntimes past. In 1948, when many felt it would be impossible for a \ndivided Government--with a Republican-controlled Congress and a \nDemocrat in the White House, a Democrat who appeared to be vulnerable \nand therefore should be exploited by emphasizing differences--men of \nthe stature of Senator Arthur Vandenberg recognized that the American \nnational interest was in unifying behind policies that would serve our \nNation's need to constrain the expansion of communism. We followed the \nenlightened leadership of Senator Vandenberg, and now, 50 years later, \nwe see the fruits of that policy by the collapse of the Soviet Union \nand our ability, through almost a half a century of bipartisan \ncommitment to that policy, to have avoided the need to use nuclear \npower and an excessive amount of United States military force in order \nto achieve that objective of the collapse of the Soviet Union and \ncommunism. We need to use that example as our standard as we set our \npolicy for Haiti.\n  Mr. President, there are very real consequences if we continue a \npolicy of treating Haiti as a partisan domestic political issue rather \nthan an American foreign policy opportunity. We do not need to ask \nourselves what will happen if we allow the progress that has occurred \nin Haiti to wither. We have already seen what will happen. We will see \nit again on our beaches with the dead bodies of Haitians who tried but \nfailed to make it to our shores. We will see it at the tarmac of \nGuantanamo with hundreds of tents of refugees who have been able to \nsurvive and are awaiting their fate in limbo as they were just 3 years \nago. We are not playing our role today in termination of a constructive \nAmerican policy toward Haiti.\n\n  I am concerned that within the Senate we see a blocking of \nhumanitarian assistance which will be critical to this next stage of \nHaiti's development. Assistance in the form of health care, funding \nthat will be needed to procure essential medical supplies, vaccines, \nand for the operation of health clinics throughout Haiti is being held \nup by this Congress. The shutting down of humanitarian programs will \nexacerbate adverse conditions in Haiti and could contribute to further \neconomic and political instability.\n  Equally disturbing, it has become fashionable to denounce Haiti's \nefforts to make a transition to democracy. If the question is, were the \nelections that were held in 1995 a standard of perfection by a mature \ndemocracy, the answer is clearly no. If the question is, were they the \nfairest, most accurate reflections of the opinion of the Haitian people \nin the 192-year history of that country, the answer is, with as much \nenergy and confidence, yes.\n  We need to build on these successes, and we must do so in a \nbipartisan manner. I support the efforts of Congress to assist and \ndemand that there be performance, performance in areas such as \ninvestigation of political murders. But I also ask us to recognize the \nreality of the situation. We are asking a government, whose President \ntold us in person-to-person communication in this very Capitol just a \nfew days ago, that his government had reached the point of financial \nstringency, that it could not pick up the garbage. To now expect that \nthis government is going to have American or Western European standards \nof sophistication in forensic investigation is to ask what is not going \nto exist.\n  We must work with the people of Haiti and with their government. If \nwe fail to do so, we will, again, see the kind of pictures that we saw \nin the very recent past of U.S. Coast Guard ships picking up overladen \nsmall wooden boats with refugees reaching out for salvation. We will \nsee, again, the pictures of the butchered citizens of Haiti, like the \nman dragged from the Catholic church during mass.\n  At that point, we will ask ourselves not whether we scored \nappropriate political points, but whether we serve the national \ninterest.\n  It is ironic that at the very time Congress is about to turn again to \nthe question of illegal immigration and how to frustrate its imposition \non the United States, that we are close to bringing about a crisis on \nan island which has been the source of so much of that illegal \nimmigration. Clearly, one of the most fundamental things that the \nUnited States can do to reduce the amount of illegal immigration is to \nturn serious attention to assist in the social and economic development \nof those countries which are the most likely sources of illegal \nimmigration.\n  We have made progress on that front as it relates to Haiti. Illegal \nimmigration is down by over 20 times in the last 3 years. The question \nis, are we going to lose this momentum or are we going to build on the \nprogress that we have made?\n  During the period of military rule in Haiti, as has been the case for \ndecades previously, Haitians, in a time of desperation, stripped the \ncountry's hilly terrain of trees in order to make charcoal for heat and \nfor cooking.\n  Today, actions by the Federal Government and the White House and the \nCongress threaten to cause a mud slide that will bury the progress that \nHaiti has made with our cooperation and assistance over the past 2 \nyears. It is our challenge to see that we can plant trees and stabilize \nthe soil of Haiti so that, together, the people of Haiti, the people of \nthe Western Hemisphere, and particularly the people of the nation which \nhas been their longest and truest friend, the United States of America, \ncan look forward to a new century of prosperity, a new century in which \nat least the people of Haiti have realized the goal of moving from \nmisery to poverty with dignity.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, since March 19, I have been delivering a \nseries of statements on the Senate floor. The common thread of my \nstatements is my observation of the President's performance in office. \nI have concluded that he is not setting a good example for the people \nwhom he serves. Basically, I mean that he does not perform in office \ncommensurate with the rhetoric.\n  This also soon becomes an issue of the failure to show moral \nleadership, which basically means that you do what you say you are \ngoing to do. It is the single most important attribute of any \nPresident. I have quoted Franklin Delano Roosevelt on the floor of this \nSenate on this issue many, many times. One of his President leadership \nflaws is the fact that he says one thing and yet does another.\n  Last night, I had an opportunity to talk about a clue that I \ndiscovered as to why the President of the United States might say one \nthing and do another. I quoted from last week's Time magazine article, \nwhich quoted the President's senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos. His \nquote was just three words: ``Words are actions.'' So if the President \nsays something, that means that is what people know he is going to do. \nIn other words, you say something, the President either thinks it is \nhappening or he wants us to think it is happening. I have not quite \ndiscovered which one it is, Mr. President.\n  Yesterday provided a further case in point to illustrate what I am \nsaying.\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\n Yesterday, we celebrated Earth Day across the country. There is \nnothing wrong with celebrating Earth Day. There has been great progress \nmade in this country on the environment, and maybe it would not have \nbeen made without annually remembering the things that come about \nthrough Earth Day and the movements connected with them.\n  Also, it has become kind of a political event, as well. The TV news \nshows were full of slick photo ops of President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore cleaning up the C Canal outside of Washington and \nvisiting a national park. They also took the opportunity to campaign \nagainst Republicans on the issue of the environment.\n  Never have I seen an Earth Day used for such pure politics as it was \nyesterday by the President. The President would have us believe that \nthe only thing standing between the public and dirty air and dirty \nwater is President Clinton himself. If you would listen long enough to \nthe President, you would think that his environmental record is \nunblemished. Unfortunately for the President, the facts belie the image \nthat he is trying to present.\n  I want to briefly show this by discussing two items that were brought \nto my attention yesterday that clearly illustrate that President \nClinton's deeds are different from his rhetoric. First, the director of \nthe Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Mr. Larry Wilson, sent a \nletter to my office regarding President Clinton's fiscal year budget \nproposals for the Army Corps of Engineers. The letter states: ``The \nPresident's proposal will have substantial adverse impacts on several \nenvironmental programs important to my State. One of these programs \nfocuses on habitat restoration, which is vital to supporting endangered \nspecies. This program will be shut down due to the President's \nadministration budget proposals.'' This is an environmental issue, and \nthe President is cutting the budget. That belies the fact that \nyesterday he was out saying the great things he was doing about the \nenvironment.\n  As President Clinton demagogs against Republican programs to reform \nthe Endangered Species Act, he is shutting down an existing program \nthat has actually been successful in saving endangered species. Again, \nhis rhetoric does not match his words.\n  Other programs that will be shut down affect the wetlands in my \nState. There are several wetland restoration and enhancement projects \nthat will be terminated if the President's budget is adopted. According \nto the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, these projects not only \nprovide critical habitat for wildlife, but they also provide hunting, \nfishing, and other outdoor recreational opportunities for all Iowans. \nAs the President talks about his initiative to protect national parks, \nhe is jeopardizing these same resources in Iowa with his budget \nproposals.\n  The second item that I will discuss concerns an article in this \nmorning's Washington Post. It says that the President, out on the C \nCanal, talking abut the good he does for the environment, is saying one \nthing, but there is an Agency of his Government, in his administration, \nthat is causing environmental damage in another place.\n  This is where the Sierra Club alleges that the U.S. Government is \nresponsible for illegal dumping of PCB's, lead, mercury, and arsenic in \nthe Anacostia River right here in Washington, DC. The Sierra Club is a \ngroup that often supports the President on his environmental \ninitiatives and is often critical of Republican proposals. So, it is \nvery unusual that this organization would question this administration \non an environmental issue.\n  Yet, the Sierra Club is alleging that the Washington Navy Yard and \nSoutheast Federal Center are violating the Clean Water Act and \npolluting this local river.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you that if a family farmer was thought to \nhave violated the Clean Water Act, that farm would be shut down \nimmediately. I know of cases in Iowa where the EPA showed up armed and \nwithout warning to close down small businesses because of potential \nviolations of environmental laws. Yet, the Federal Government remains \nthe biggest polluter in the country and is not subject to the same \nrules that apply to small businesses and family farms. This is \nhypocrisy. This is a double standard.\n  President Clinton should stop playing politics with the environment. \nThe public health is too important to be used as a campaign issue. The \nmore politics he plays, the less he is able to bring fairness and \nuniformity to our Nation's environmental laws. I urge the American \npeople to look behind the political demagoguery that was characterized \non Earth Day and take a good look at the deeds of this administration. \nYou my find that, once again, President Clinton's action falls short of \nhis rhetoric.\n  This country is suffering from a severe bout of cynicism. That is \nexactly why we have this legislation on the floor regarding term \nlimits, because term limits are the people's expression of \ndissatisfaction with Washington, DC, with the Congress, and with other \ninstitutions of Government. The cause of this is that politicians say \none thing and do another. This has reflected an absence of moral \nleadership over time of our elected officials. Usually the public does \nnot discover this until they have come and gone. I want to lay the \nrecord out right now because we need accountability right now. We need \nleadership right now.\n  What we do not need now is the same old ``say one thing and do \nanother'' routine. To stop the growth of cynicism and the fact that we \nmust restore trust of the American people in our institutions of \nGovernment, we in Washington need to show the American people that they \ncan trust our words, that our words not only can be trusted, but our \nwords are followed up by actions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two documents I referred \nto be printed in the Record, the newspaper article and the letter from \nthe director of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 23, 1996]\n\n      New Medicare Trust Fund Data Show Unusually Large Shortfall\n\n       Washington, April 22,--Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust \n     Fund lost $4.2 billion in the first half of the current \n     fiscal year, according to new Government data, which suggest \n     that the financial condition of the program is worse than \n     projected by Administration officials last year.\n       The trust fund, which pays hospital bills for the elderly \n     and disabled, lost money last year for the first time since \n     1972. But the loss for all of last year was only $35.7 \n     million.\n       The new data show that the losses are growing. In the first \n     half of the current fiscal year, from October 1995 through \n     March of this year, the trust fund spent $60.5 billion and \n     took in $56.3 billion, a shortfall of $4.2 billion, the \n     Treasury said.\n       There is little chance that the trust fund will actually \n     run out of money. It still contains more than $120 billion, \n     and Congress would almost surely act to rescue the program \n     before it ran out of money. But the new data provide fresh \n     evidence that, after months of acrimonious debate between the \n     White House and Congress, Medicare remains a budget problem \n     of immense and growing proportions.\n       Chris Jennings, a special assistant to President Clinton \n     for health policy, said today that the new numbers were not \n     surprising. ``They indicate the need to move forward, balance \n     the budget and enact some changes in Medicare that will \n     strengthen the trust fund,'' he said. ``Republicans and \n     Democrats should work together to address the problem.''\n       In a letter to Congress last week, Treasury Secretary \n     Robert E. Rubin suggested that Congress and the \n     Administration resume discussions to reach an agreement on \n     Medicare and the budget.\n       Republicans proposed many changes in Medicare last year to \n     help control costs, but President Clinton said the changes \n     would hurt beneficiaries. Republicans may hesitate to put \n     forward new proposals after they were bloodied in that \n     battle. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who \n     is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ``The \n     President preferred to scare seniors and play politics \n     instead of saving Medicare.''\n       It is not entirely clear why the hospital trust fund is \n     running out of money faster than expected. One factor, \n     Administration officials said, is an unanticipated \n     increase in the number of admissions of Medicare patients \n     to hospitals, but that does not explain all of the \n     discrepancy.\n       The new losses accelerate a trend that started several \n     years ago, when spending by the hospital trust fund began to \n     increase faster than the money coming into the fund. The \n     Administration had predicted that the amount of money in the \n     trust fund would increase by $4.7 billion in the 1995 fiscal \n     year, which ended Sept. 30, but instead the trust fund spent \n     $35.7 million more than it took in.\n       Likewise, the Administration predicted last April that the \n     trust fund would take in\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\n     $45 million more than it would spend in the current fiscal \n     year. But that now appears highly unlikely. Treasury \n     Department data show that the trust fund has lost money in \n     five of the last six months.\n       In the first half of the last fiscal year, from October \n     1994 to March 1995, the trust fund lost $135 million.\n       Any trust fund money not immediately needed to pay hospital \n     bills is invested in Government securities. The amount of \n     such holdings has declined, to $126.1 billion on March 31 \n     from $129.9 billion on Oct. 1, 1995.\n       If nothing is done to change the financing and design of \n     Medicare, losses from the trust fund are expected to grow \n     from year to year. Payroll taxes account for most of the \n     trust fund's income, and no tax increases are scheduled under \n     current law. Unless President Clinton and Congress arrive at \n     a long-term budget deal, Federal officials said, there is no \n     reason to expect a significant reduction in the rate of \n     growth of Medicare spending.\n       But no such deal is in sight. In this election year, \n     lawmakers and Administration officials are wary of any action \n     that might offend elderly voters by restricting Medicare \n     spending.\n       Last year, Republicans proposed vast changes in Medicare to \n     slow the program's growth. But the proposals were included in \n     a bill to balance the Federal budget, and Mr. Clinton vetoed \n     that bill in December, saying it contained ``the biggest \n     Medicare and Medicaid cuts in history.''\n       Republicans said their proposals were needed to prevent \n     Medicare from going bankrupt, but Democrats said the changes \n     would devastate the program and push beneficiaries into \n     health maintenance organizations.\n       The new Treasury data do not indicate when Medicare's \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will run out of money. In April \n     1995, the Administration predicted that the trust fund would \n     be depleted at some point from October to December 2002, but \n     it now appears that the money could run out earlier because \n     the trust fund is spending more than expected and is taking \n     in less than expected.\n       Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is \n     chairman of the Budget Committee, said he believed that the \n     trust fund would run out of money by May 2001.\n       Roland E. King, former chief actuary of the Health Care \n     Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said today \n     that he believed the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund ``will run \n     out in late 2000 or early 2001.'' Richard S. Foster, who \n     succeeded Mr. King as chief actuary, said he could not \n     discuss the financial condition of Medicare without \n     permission from top officials at the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, and such permission was not given today.\n       Under Federal law, the trustees of the Medicare trust fund, \n     including four Administration officials, were supposed to \n     submit a report to Congress on the financial condition of the \n     program by April 1. But Administration officials say that \n     report has been delayed because of Government shutdowns and \n     snowstorms last winter and will probably not be issued until \n     late May or early June.\n       Some Democrats have played down the significance of the \n     losses from Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. \n     Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said, \n     ``The past is littered with inaccurate forecasts of \n     Medicare's demise.'' Moreover, he said, ``The Democrats will \n     not let Medicare go insolvent.''\n       Hospital executives and Medicare officials said they were \n     puzzled by the recent increase in admissions. James D. \n     Bentley, senior vice president of the American Hospital \n     Association, said tonight, ``Hospital admissions of Medicare \n     patients are rising more than could be explained by growth in \n     the number of beneficiaries--but not enough to account for \n     all of the unexpected increase in Medicare spending.''\n                                 ______\n\n\n   [From the U.S. Senate--Republican Policy Committee, Apr. 23, 1996]\n\n  Today's New York Times Demonstrates Urgent Need to Solve Medicare's \n                         Impending Crisis, Now\n\n       Today's New York Times front-page article (on the reverse \n     side) once again reveals the Medicare Part A trust fund's \n     uncontrolled hemorrhaging. It remains uncontrolled because \n     the Clinton Administration decided to play ``Medi-Scare'' \n     with Medicare last year. Clinton vetoed the plan from \n     Congress that would have allowed it to grow at twice the rate \n     of inflation and would have kept it solvent for the next \n     generation. In contrast, President Clinton's latest \n     unbalanced budget--his ninth, scored last week by CBO--would \n     barely keep the current trust fund solvent through fiscal \n     year 2002.\n       Medicare's Hospital Insurance trust fund, commonly known as \n     ``Part A,'' has lost $4.2 billion in the first half of FY 96 \n     [says the New York Times, citing government data].\n       This compares with a loss in the first half of FY 95 of \n     $135 million, and the Clinton Administration's prediction \n     that Part A would run a $45 million surplus for FY 96.\n       These losses indicate that Medicare's bankruptcy is even \n     closer than the 2002 date the Administration reported April \n     3, 1995.\n       Because the Administration has still not produced a report \n     this year, we must rely on outside estimates. Budget \n     Committee Chairman Domenici has stated Part A could be \n     bankrupt by May of 2001; former chief HCFA actuary Roland \n     King predicts bankruptcy as soon as late 2000.\n       Clinton's latest budget would only push bankruptcy back a \n     year beyond its last year's estimate. According to CBO under \n     his budget--without utilizing for gimmick of cost-shifting \n     $60 billion to the taxpayer--Part A would be barely solvent \n     in FY 2002 ($1.5 billion) and would be bankrupt by FY 2003.\n       In contrast, Congress' Balanced Budget Act would have \n     preserved Part A beyond 2010--when Baby Boomers begin \n     retiring--while allowing spending to grow at twice the \n     inflation rate.\n       While the Republican party in Congress wants to protect \n     Medicare for the next generation, Clinton wants to abandon it \n     to the next Administration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     Department of\n\n\n                                            Natural Resources,\n\n                                  Des Moines, IA,, April 10, 1996.\n     Re Mississippi River Environmental Management Program (EMP) \n         and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife (F) Mitigation--\n         Affects in Iowa of the President's FY 1997 Budget \n         Request.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I want to alert you to the impacts \n     that the Administration's FY 1997 budget proposal will have \n     in Iowa with regard to two programs administered by the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers: (1) Missouri River Fish and Wildlife \n     Mitigation and (2) Mississippi River EMP. The President's \n     proposal will have substantial adverse impacts on both of \n     these programs which in recent years have been operating at \n     close to full authorized funding and providing long-awaited \n     benefits to Iowans. I urge you to do whatever you can to \n     restore the appropriations in FY 1997 to levels that equal or \n     at least come closer to the amounts available in prior years.\n       The Corps has explained their priorities for funding which \n     are navigation, flood control, and environment projects. \n     While we understand how the Corps developed these priorities, \n     their application results in a disproportionate impact on \n     projects that are important to Iowa. For example, funding of \n     only $100,000 for mitigation projects on the Missouri in the \n     Omaha District, means projects on hold for years while \n     habitat restoration is viewed as a key way to resolve \n     historic conflicts between uses while enhancing support for \n     endangered species. The Mississippi River EMP is slated for \n     cuts of nearly $4 million in FY 97, and projections are for \n     cuts of about $7 million for FY 98 and nearly $11 million in \n     future years. These levels will delay projects for years \n     while threatening the viability of an essential long-term \n     monitoring effort.\n       It has been difficult for us to obtain information as to \n     whether the Administration's budget cuts are greater for the \n     North Central and Omaha Divisions than for other regions. If \n     these divisions suffered proportionally greater reductions \n     than other divisions, it could help to explain the difficulty \n     that they have had trying to meet all of their obligations \n     and ensure the timely completion of Iowa projects.\n\n\n              missouri river fish and wildlife mitigation\n\n       Mitigation was authorized in the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 1986 to satisfy the federal requirement to \n     mitigate for the loss of fish and wildlife habitat with the \n     construction of the navigation and flood control works on the \n     river in Iowa and the other lower basin states. \n     Appropriations commenced in 1989. While the program includes \n     land acquisition, that has been less important in Iowa \n     than habitat development. The state already owns numerous \n     sites along the river that can be improved by the \n     mitigation program. The Corps of Engineers has purchased \n     some land adjacent to existing public land as required to \n     make the habitat development projects work. Mitigation is \n     critical on the Missouri River if the Corps is going to \n     make progress in supporting endangered species. There is a \n     terrible shortage of fisheries habitat in the lower river. \n     These conditions have economic consequences as well, since \n     the lack of habitat reduces the quality of the fishery. \n     The net result is less recreational opportunity on the \n     river, which impacts businesses that provide goods and \n     services along the river.\n       Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Mitigation has received as \n     much as $8 million a year, which was fairly evenly split \n     between the Kansas City and Omaha Corps Districts. The \n     administration's budget for FY 1997 includes $1.6 million for \n     mitigation, of which $1.5 million is programmed for the \n     Kansas City District and only $100,000 for the Omaha \n     District. Iowa projects are in the Omaha District, so \n     Missouri River fish and wildlife mitigation will essentially \n     come to a halt in Iowa. The discrepancy among the two \n     districts is based upon individual district priorities. Fish \n     and wildlife mitigation requires more than a token $100,000 \n     in the Omaha District.\n       The following are the specific projects programmed for work \n     in FY 97 that will not happen if current funding levels \n     remain:\n       Blackbird/Tieville/Decatur Bend near Onawa is an $8.8 \n     million project that includes 3,500 acres and 11.8 miles of \n     wetlands and river side channels. The definite project report \n     (DPR) is complete, design and engineering is near completion, \n     and construction was programmed in begin in Fall 1996 and be \n     completed during FY 97.\n       California Bend near Missouri Valley just north of Council \n     Bluffs is a $785,000 project to restore a running side chute \n     connected to the Missouri River. The plans and specifications \n     are close to completion and construction was scheduled for FY \n     96 and 97.\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\n       Winnebago Bend near Sloan is a $1.3 million project to add \n     water into a rapidly disappearing wetland. It too was \n     programmed for FY 96 & 97 construction.\n       In addition to the improvement or creation of critical \n     habitat, all of these projects would provide hunting, angling \n     and outdoor recreation opportunities to Iowans along the \n     Missouri River.\n       The Corps' report proposing these projects was completed in \n     1981. With nearly two decades of delays, the lack of habitat \n     continues to frustrate efforts to maintain several fish \n     species. It would be most unfortunate to lose the momentum \n     that has developed as these projects have moved this close to \n     construction.\n\n\n        mississippi river environmental management program (emp)\n\n       EMP was also authorized in the Water Resources Development \n     Act of 1986 and has become a model program for the \n     restoration of fish and wildlife on big rivers. \n     Its authorized funding is $19.4 million per year and it \n     has been receiving that amount in recent years. It too is \n     a program that has taken a long time to attain solid \n     momentum, but is now providing increasing benefits. EMP \n     contains two primary components; (1) habitat \n     rehabilitation and enhancement projects (HREP) and (2) \n     long-term resource monitoring (LTRM). The Administration's \n     budget contains $15.6 million for EMP in FY 97, which is \n     not devastating in itself. Our concern lies with the \n     Corps' projections in FY 98, 99, and 00, which are $12.4 \n     million, $8.7 million, and $9.8 million, respectively. \n     Reductions of that magnitude will have serious adverse \n     implications in Iowa.\n\n\n                Examples of completed HREPs in Iowa are:\n\n       Bussey Lake dredging near Guttenberg--Dredging will improve \n     the fishery by providing deeper water, diversity of habitat \n     and wintering-over areas.\n       Brown's Lake restoration near Green Island--This area has \n     been protected from sedimentation by dike improvements and a \n     water control structure. A deeper channel through the project \n     and dredging in the lake have improved the fishery, while the \n     dredge spoil was collected on site to create terrestrial \n     habitat. This project along with the improvements at Green \n     Island will be beneficial for both hunting and fishing.\n       Big Timber backwater rehabilitation and pothole creation \n     near Muscatine--Dredging at this site restored an area that \n     was nearly completely filled in with sediment.\n       Lansing Big Lake side channel closures--This project is \n     designed to decrease sedimentation and flow rates in the lake \n     to maintain its currently very popular panfishery. We are \n     currently proposing some follow-up work in Lansing Big Lake \n     to further assure project objectives are obtained.\n       Iowa's Princeton HREP project near Princeton is hit the \n     hardest by the proposed change in funding. This project is \n     designed to create new wetlands and improve the dike system \n     for waterfowl management. The construction contract was close \n     to being let to a minority contractor. Our local DNR \n     biologist was ready to issue a news release explaining to \n     local hunters that Princeton would be closed this fall due to \n     construction. The Corps is considering delaying construction \n     until late 1997. Making this decision at the last minute is \n     inefficient and will cost time and money if the Corps decides \n     to shelve the project. Because of great interest in this \n     project by local hunters and others who live along the river, \n     the delay will cause many to become extremely upset.\n       Iowa's Lake Odessa EMP project near Wapello is currently \n     undergoing planning, engineering, and design. The Corps has \n     informed us that it will complete this work, but will not \n     construct the project under current EMP authorization. The \n     Lake Odessa HREP project would therefore only become reality \n     if authorization for EMP is extended beyond 2002.\n       HREP projects for Huron Island near Burlington, Molo Slough \n     near Dubuque, and Peosta Channel also near Dubuque were also \n     programmed to be completed under the current EMP \n     authorization. The Corps is now considering deletion of \n     these projects completely from EMP.\n       The Long-Term Resource Monitoring (LTRM) element of EMP is \n     collecting data on Mississippi River water quality, aquatic \n     and floodplain habitat, microinvertebrates, and fisheries. \n     LTRM also evaluates the physical, chemical, and biological \n     responses of habitat projects. This program was designed to \n     identify trends and support decisions about river management \n     including such projects as the current navigation study.\n       Iowa DNR operates one of six monitoring stations that are \n     located throughout the river. Iowa's station is in Bellevue \n     and is staffed by six permanent employees and typically hires \n     up to five seasonal workers during summer months. These are \n     all state employees, but funding for their salaries and \n     operations comes totally from federal EMP dollars. Reductions \n     in the LTRM budget will likely occur because of overall EMP \n     cutbacks, which means that Iowa's station in Bellevue and its \n     employees will be affected. It is important that data \n     gathering not be curtailed to the extent that the integrity \n     of the data base created over the past several years is \n     jeopardized. In addition, the loss of jobs at the station \n     will impact the economy in Bellevue due to the loss of \n     employment. Bellevue along with other cities along the \n     Mississippi will see reduced recreational activity as the \n     maintenance of the natural resources of the river are \n     neglected.\n       Budget reductions are difficult, and we understand that \n     there will be some impacts on programs that we believe to be \n     important to the long term viability of the natural river \n     systems. It appears that the Missouri River Fish and Wildlife \n     Mitigation and Mississippi River Environmental Management \n     Programs are expected by the Administration to bear \n     proportionally greater budget reductions than other programs. \n     We also fear that the North Central and Missouri River \n     Divisions are taking a greater share of cuts than those in \n     other parts of the country. This further harms Iowa projects. \n     If budget reductions that are currently being proposed \n     happen, Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Mitigation in Iowa \n     will come to a complete halt, Mississippi River EMP habitat \n     projects in Iowa will be delayed and some will be eliminated. \n     The Bellevue monitoring station will face cuts that could \n     mean its demise with the added cuts proposed in future years. \n     As noted above, reductions in these efforts will have \n     economic as well as natural resource consequences that should \n     not be underestimated given the Corps' own study showing an \n     annual value of recreation in the Upper Mississippi River \n     basin of over $1 billion. We ask for your help to do whatever \n     you can to assure these programs and their respective \n     projects in Iowa are not forced to take on more than their \n     fair share of setbacks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Larry J. Wilson,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.

Mr. President, about a year ago the President appointed \ntrustees for the Medicare fund to study Medicare, to project its \nproblems, its solvency, and everything like that. A year ago, six \ntrustees of the Medicare fund--and these are four people in the \nPresident's Cabinet and two citizens, one Republican and one Democrat, \nso altogether there would be five Democrats and one Republican--\nunanimously said that the Medicare program would be bankrupt in the \nyear 2002. They also said that Congress should take immediate action to \nkeep the long-term viability of Medicare. They asked the Republican \nCongress to take action to do that. We did that.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 is this 1,800-page bill, which took \n13 committees over an 8-month period of time to put together, the first \nBalanced Budget Act passed by Congress in a quarter of a century, to \nbalance the budget in 7 years. Part of this document is not only doing \nwhat President Clinton's trustees of the Medicare system asked us to \ndo, to save it from bankruptcy, but we also gave senior citizens of \nAmerica a choice that if they did not want to have traditional \nMedicare, we would pay for other forms of health care delivery. We \nwould take their money and pay for it, so that they could have \nsomething if they wanted something different than Medicare. That is all \nin this document.\n  In November of last year, we presented the President of the United \nStates not only the balanced budget, but also provisions to save \nMedicare, to strengthen Medicare, and to give people on Medicare, for \nthe first time in 30 years, a choice of their medical care.\n  The President vetoed it. The President vetoed those Medicare reforms. \nHe wanted people to believe that we were cutting Medicare. He was on \ntelevision every day on these paid ads saying that ``Republicans are \ncutting Medicare.'' Under the Balanced Budget Act, Medicare would have \ngrown at 7 percent every year. What we are spending on Medicare per \nbeneficiary is $4,900 this year, and in 7 years we would have been \nspending $6,700 per Medicare recipient. Maybe it is even closer to \n$7,000 per Medicare recipient. So, obviously, we were not cutting \nanything. We were saving Medicare from bankruptcy. We were extending \nthe life of it for another 9 or 10 years.\n  Well, the President vetoed it. One person is standing in the way of \ndoing what his trustees said should be done, what the people want done, \nand what the Congress did. The President of the United States vetoed \nthe first balanced budget act passed in a quarter of a century, \nbalancing the budget in 7 years, and saving Medicare, as his trustees \nsaid. Well, the President kind of ignored what his trustees said.\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\n  But, more importantly, even before last year was out, we were finding \nout that Medicare was coming up short of expectations of what the \nincome and outgo of it was, to a point of where it was going to be \nbroke before the year 2002.\n  Senator Pete Domenici says that it is going to be May of the year \n2001, just 6 years from now. Roland King, former chief actuary of the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, says that it will run out in late \n2000--that is 4 years from now--or early 2001, 5 years from now. There \nis a Richard S. Foster, who succeeded Mr. King as chief actuary, who \nsaid that the top officials at the Department of Health and Human \nServices would not give him permission to talk about this issue. What I \nam referring to here, Mr. President, is the New York Times article of \ntoday that is headlined ``New Medicare Trust Fund Data Shows Unusually \nLarge Shortfalls.'' The subheadline is: ``Program is Solvent, But Gap \nShows Weakening.''\n  What has happened in the 12 months since the last report? Instead of \nMedicare starting to spend out more than the income in 1996, it \nactually started to happen in 1995, and it is happening at a much \nfaster rate than we anticipated. So, Medicare will be broke not in 7 \nyears, not in 6 years, but maybe in 5 years.\n  What is kind of special about this article is this. Normally this \nreport would be out in April every year by the trustees. It is not out \nyet, I imagine because it is an election year. This is bad news for \nthis administration, which was told 12 months ago that Medicare was \ngoing to be bankrupt in the year 2002, and they vetoed the only bill \npresented to extend the life of it. Not only that, but the situation is \nworse than the report said it was 12 months ago.\n  It says here that Chris Jennings, a special assistant to President \nClinton for health policy, said today that the new numbers were not \nsurprising: ``They indicate the need to move forward to balance the \nbudget and enact some changes in Medicare that will strengthen the \ntrust fund. Republicans and Democrats should work together to address \nthe problem.''\n  Get that--``Republicans and Democrats should work together to address \nthe problem.'' Immediately after Labor Day last year, constantly \nSenator Dole and Speaker Gingrich were inviting the White House to sit \ndown and reach some sort of an agreement with us, a long time before we \never put this together and finally passed it. But, no, they did not \nwant to sit down and talk about it. Yet, we are being admonished by the \nWhite House that ``Republicans and Democrats should work together to \naddress the problem.''\n  A letter to Congress last week from Treasury Secretary Robert E. \nRubin suggested that Congress and the administration resume discussions \nto reach an agreement on Medicare and the budget. Well, we do not have \nthat report. They say it might come out in June or July.\n  Do you know what they are blaming for the delay? The fact that we had \nsnow in January. We have snow every January in the Midwest, and it does \nnot slow down the deadlines that we have to get reports out. But the \nlonger this report can languish in the bureaucracy downtown, as long as \nsome faceless bureaucrat can keep it under control, then it is less out \nthere for public consideration and for the shots that it is going to \ntake because of that.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the administration will forget the fact \nthat we had snow in January, because what is news about that? This \nreport that is supposed to be issued in April, that was issued in April \nof last year, would be issued, and I will bet we will see the same \nPresidential appointees to the trustees tell us that Congress should do \nsomething about it. Well, if you ever wonder as part of the cynical \npublic about Washington, DC whether Congress will ever balance the \nbudget, it is right here in these 1,800 pages. We passed that last \nyear. The President vetoed it. It saved Medicare from bankruptcy. We \nwould not have to be dealing with this issue. Instead of Senator \nDomenici saying that we will run out of money in May of the year 2001, \nwe would be saving that deadline for another decade down the road.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that the President of the United States will \ncome forth with his report. The longer you wait to make public bad \nnews, the worse it is for the people that are giving the bad news.\n  It would seem to me that the right thing to do is to simply state \nwhat the facts are, and the fact is that the situation with Medicare is \nmuch worse. It could be bankrupt in 5 more years--at the most, 6 \nyears--and the situation is deteriorating considerably because this \nadministration vetoed the bill that we passed last year to save \nMedicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3885-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3886-S3888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OUR PRESIDENT AND EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair very much for recognizing \nme, and I will not belabor this issue very long. I know the Senate is \nleaving early this afternoon, and I do not want to delay the departure \nof our staff members who have been so loyal in helping us this \nafternoon and today. It has been an interesting day in the U.S. Senate.\n  I just was listening to one of the monitors and watching one of the \nmonitors. I happened to note my very, very good friend from Iowa, the \nHonorable Senator Charles Grassley, a wonderful long-time friend of \nmine, someone I have worked with very closely on the issues of \noversight and overstepping of the Internal Revenue Service, of defense \nspending, which we thought at the time had gotten out of hand and was \nvery unfair. We worked on several issues over these years together. I \nlook forward to the remainder of my term in working with him further on \nvarious matters that affect our respective States and certainly our \ngreat country.\n  But I was a little taken aback when my friend from Iowa got up and \nstarted talking about our President, Earth Day, and what happened \nyesterday nearby, just a few miles away, I think, on the upper reaches \nof the Potomac River. My friend from Iowa sort of took our President to \ntask and the Vice President to task I guess for even appearing at an \nEarth Day event. I do not know what his concern was. But if in fact the \nPresident did mention that the other political party's proposals on \nsome of our environmental concerns were in fact lacking, then, Mr. \nPresident, I am going to have to disagree with my friend from Iowa, and \nI am going to have to, yes, agree with our President. For example, \nlegislation recently circulated to rewrite the Clean Air Act by our \ngood friends on the other side of the aisle would repeal the toxic air \npollution standards and would absolutely cripple the enforcement of the \nClean Air Act.\n\n  I do not think that is a piece of legislation we can go to future \ngenerations with and say we were very proud of ourselves when we \nattempted to cripple the enforcement of the Clean Air Act.\n  I think our President was right when he said that there is a \ndifference between the two political parties and the way that they look \nat the environment and legislation that would perhaps undo all of the \nprogress that has been made in cleaning up the air we breathe under the \nClean Air Act over the last 25 years.\n  Some 25 years ago, when I first came to the House of Representatives \nas a young Member, as a new Member of that great body, I remember \nduring that time I had three small sons, and from time to time on a \nSunday afternoon or Saturday afternoon, perhaps, we would get a fishing \npole or swimming suit and we would go down to the banks of the Potomac \nRiver, and I will never forget--and this was not long ago--there were \nsigns up and down the banks of the Potomac River: no swimming allowed; \ndo not eat any fish, the fish will be contaminated if caught in this \nriver.\n  Mr. President, in this quarter of a century what we have done as a \nbody, Republicans and Democrats alike, has not only helped to clean up \nthat river, but we are helping today to clean up our air, and we cannot \nmake a retreat, especially in a political year when it might have a \nshort-term appeal to\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nsome local interests, maybe some local business interests that want to \ncompromise and that want to sacrifice the environment we have to pass \non to future generations.\n  I think the President was right when he implied yesterday that some \nof the legislation as proposed--we call them riders--to the VA \nappropriations bill would delay the issuance of toxic standards, air \nstandards, that is, and would allow for the exemption of industries, \nexempt industries--just say we are sorry; we are going to apply this to \nsome industries, but the rest of you are going to get off; you do not \nhave to comply with the law; you do not have to obey the law; there is \nno law that impacts you.\n  As we speak today, Fort Smith and Van Buren, AR, Sebastian and \nCrawford Counties in Arkansas, 48 hours ago were hit with massive \ntornadoes, two dead, hundreds of homes damaged. At this very moment, as \nwe stand in the Senate Chamber and talk about clean air and clean \nwater, because of necessity we are dumping raw sewage into the Arkansas \nRiver. We have no other option. Senator Bumpers and I will be calling \nin the morning Carol Browner of the EPA to say that we have an \nemergency; we have to do something.\n\n  We have emergencies all over this country not caused by a recent \nnatural disaster but emergencies that are existing today where we are \npolluting our streams and our air and where we have to do something \nabout it. This generation cannot back away. Our President yesterday was \ntalking sincerely and earnestly about what we can do together as \npolitical parties.\n  The Republicans, by the way, at that Earth Day event yesterday, \nseveral Republican Representatives from Congress were agreeing with our \nPresident. I hope that we can make this a nonpolitical issue and talk \nabout the facts, those facts being we do have a difference of opinion, \nbut we do need to join together and do what is right for the \nenvironment.\n  Budget cuts--and I know the Presiding Officer realizes this--and the \nGovernment shutdowns, what have they done? What have they accomplished? \nHave they saved any money? Probably not much. What have they really \ndone? They have delayed the EPA's issuance of new standards for toxic \nindustrial air pollutants--new standards for toxic industrial air \npollutants. Those standards are now on hold. Why? Because of Government \nshutdowns and budget cuts.\n  The delay in the issuance of air toxic standards has resulted in the \ncontinued release of harmful chemicals--mercury, chromium, \nformaldehyde, and lead--into our air. More than 45 million people, Mr. \nPresident--the distinguished occupant of the chair realizes this--in \nour country still live in areas with unhealthy levels of ground level \nozone or smog. I did not know this until just lately, but the EPA \nreports that the United States refineries alone, and I quote, ``emit \nmore than 78,000 tons per year of established hazardous air pollutants, \nor 9 tons of toxics emitted into the air every hour nationwide.''\n  How can we repeal some of these rules? How can we say that some \ncompanies and some industries are exempt and do not need to comply with \nmaking progress in eliminating this unclean air and unclean water.\n  My good friend from Iowa also talked about another issue. I am going \nto come back to this issue of the environment in a moment. I was hoping \nthat my friend from Iowa was going to be here because he made reference \nto not only the President of the United States, but he made reference \nto another gentleman, a gentleman who is very close to my heart. His \nname is Chris Jennings. He says, who is this man, Chris Jennings? He \nsaid that this Chris Jennings, whoever he is, said, and then he quoted \nsomething that Chris Jennings had said.\n\n  First, Chris Jennings for many years worked for the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging, probably one of the finest staff people who ever \nworked for that particular committee or has ever worked in the Senate, \nand I would daresay that most of the Members on this side of the aisle \nat one time or the other have worked closely with this so-called man \nnamed Chris Jennings. I would say that Members on the other side of the \naisle have worked closely with Chris Jennings. If I could only jog the \nmemory of my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who has been for years \na loyal member of the Special Committee on Aging, I am sure that Mr. \nJennings has not only worked for Senator Grassley in many capacities, \nhas served him in many capacities, but also I am sure that should Mr. \nGrassley see Mr. Jennings and reacquaint himself with him, he would \nknow him and would respect him, as all of us do in the Senate.\n  Chris Jennings is a remarkable individual, a splendid and dedicated \nservant. But, somehow or another, I did not quite appreciate the tone \nof my friend from Iowa. I know he did not mean in any way to be \ndisparaging of our friend, Mr. Jennings, I am sure, today. I hope our \nfriend, Senator Grassley, will realize the dedication of this fine \nformer member of our Senate Special Committee on Aging staff. I am sure \nhe knows his great qualifications and his great commitment.\n  Our friend from Iowa was talking, of course, about the Medicare \nfunding. We think it is very important to point this out. Absolutely. \nWe know what the dollars and cents are. I do not think we are arguing \nwith those figures. But I think we also need to point out there remains \ntoday over $120 billion in the trust fund for Medicare. There is no \nimminent danger that claims are not going to be paid--absolutely none. \nThere is no imminent danger that these claims are not going to be paid.\n  The updated information should not be used to scare the 37 million \nelderly citizens in this country or people with disabilities. They \nshould not be used for partisan political purposes. The trust fund will \npay out the claims. I repeat, the trust fund will pay out the claims, \nat least through the turn of this century, no matter what, and much \nlonger if the Congress would only enact the President's balanced budget \nproposal.\n  We think it is very, very important to lay on the table the facts, as \nI have stated. We think there is equal importance not to intentionally \nscare the seniors of this country and to lead them to believe, or to \nimply, that their checks may not be paid and their claims will go \nunnoticed.\n  We think, too, the information validates the President's position on \nMedicare that he has maintained during his Presidency. The latest \ninformation simply provides additional validation for the President's \nposition that we should move forward and balance the budget to \nstrengthen the trust fund. In fact, I have not talked to the President \nabout this matter in a long time, but I would imagine, when the \nPresident read the Post or the New York Times or wherever this appeared \nthis morning, about the trust fund, I imagine that the President said, \n``Those are not very pretty figures, but we think that those figures \nwill put people to thinking and start people to believing that we have \nto do something about our budget.''\n  The President has offered a proposal that achieves $124 billion in \nMedicare savings that would extend the life of the trust fund by at \nleast 10 years from now. This proposal builds on the President's \nsuccesses in strengthening the Medicare trust fund.\n  Let me say this, and I hope I will not be accused of being too \npartisan. In 1993, let me remind my good friend from Iowa and the \ndistinguished Members on the other side of the aisle that in 1993, \nwithout one Republican vote, not one, the President signed into law \nMedicare savings and other financing charges that extended the life of \nthe trust fund from 2 to 3 years. That was a major accomplishment.\n  So, as we enter now the real meat, I guess you would say, approaching \na Presidential election, I think we should inform the citizenry of this \nwonderful country of ours that from time to time there will be \nskirmishes in this body because of necessity, because of beliefs, \nbecause of different ideologies. We will see those debates.\n  I never thought this particular Chamber should become a political \nconvention hall. I hope it does not. But I do think it can become the \nproper forum for us to discharge our obligations and certainly to \ndebate the issues of our time and our generation.\n  I would like to say I am sorry my friend from Iowa was not here. I do \nnot mean in any way to be disparaging of him or question his sincerity. \nI just\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nwanted to sort of set the record straight, after I heard my good \nfriend's remarks.\n  I hope in the coming days, again, we will have ample opportunity to \nlay these issues out on the table, out in the public, let the sunshine \nshine among them, and let us, at that time, bring to the people what we \nconsider important questions of today.\n  Mr. President, I see no Senator seeking recognition. Therefore, I \nyield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3886-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3888-S3892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BOSNIA, SERBIA, AND THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on a trip which I made recently, earlier this month to The \nHague, Serbia, and Bosnia for the purpose of taking a look at the \nsituation with our military forces in Bosnia and taking a look at what \nis happening at The Hague with the War Crimes Tribunal. I would like to \nhighlight a few of my observations because there are a few moments \navailable on the Senate floor this afternoon.\n  In visiting Tuzla on April 4, which followed the visit to Serbia on \nApril 3 and the visit to The Hague on April 2, before returning to \nParis en route back to the United States, in Tuzla, I saw the presence \nof the U.S. Army of which people of the United States can be very, very \nproud.\n  The United States moved in as part of the NATO force, the IFOR force, \nshort for the Implementation Force, with an overwhelming strength to \nstop the fighting and preserve the peace. It is a truly remarkable \nscene to see an army moved halfway around the world with the power and \nforce of the United States, really the one remaining superpower in the \nworld.\n  As I have had the opportunity to travel abroad, to see the great \nrespect and admiration in which the United States is held, it is \nsomething that we ought to focus on in this country. A mark of our \npower is our military force. When we spend as much as we do on the \ndefense budget, some $243 billion this year, we see it in operations; \nwe have gone in there with overwhelming force. All of the participants \nto the conflict have stopped fighting and are observing the rules and \nregulations set up by IFOR, the NATO forces and U.S. forces.\n  We had the opportunity to talk to many in the military there on a \ntour provided by General Cherrie. We visited a military installation on \nMount Viz, 450 meters through solid mud, virtually straight up, \ntraveling on a tracked military vehicle in order to climb an incline 60 \ndegrees on terrain which did not seem possible to move up. But the \nmechanism of the military force carried us to the top where we had a \nbriefing on the military operation where we were briefed by military \npersonnel and where I visited with quite a number of military personnel \nfrom Pennsylvania, my State, as well as from other States. They had \nvery high morale and were glad to see a visitor from the United States. \nWe had an excellent lunch prepared in the field.\n  I talked to a young lieutenant colonel who was in command of the \noperation. The lieutenant colonel told us about taking over the mount \nfrom a Serbian major who talked about the killing, the military \ncasualty of his brother-in-law in the fighting which had occurred prior \nto the time the United States and NATO forces took over. As a matter of \nfact, in a professional way, with no animus, at least by all surface \nindications, the Bosnian Serb major said to the U.S. colonel, ``Take \ncare of my mountain. I intend to take it back.'' It was sort of \nforeboding as to what may occur after the United States and the NATO \nforces depart the premises.\n  But as of the moment, there is peace there. I had heard, and was glad \nto have repeated, that we have had only two casualties. Of course, two \nis two too many, but the casualties occurred, one from a motor vehicle \naccident and the other when someone was dismantling a landmine contrary \nto regulations.\n  When we arrived in Tuzla, we heard about the visit just the day \nbefore of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. General Cherrie, who met us \non our arrival there, midmorning of April 4, told us that Secretary \nBrown had been there the day before, arriving at about 6:20 in the \nmorning and departing shortly before 2 p.m. when the tragic accident \noccurred.\n  We had seen Secretary Brown the night before in Paris at a reception \nat the residence of Ambassador Pamela Harriman. We renewed our \nlongstanding friendship, talked about possibly meeting in either \nSarajevo or in Zagreb. Of course, that was not to be.\n  When I flew out of Paris on the morning of April 3 and went to \nBelgrade, we had planned to fly to Sarajevo. Because of the weather \nconditions, the very high winds, our plane was grounded. We did not \nundertake the flight. I think those may have been the same weather \nconditions which caused or related to the fatality involving Secretary \nBrown, whose presence will be sorely missed, as will the presence of \nall those 34 people who were on board with him on that ill-fated \nflight.\n  We had an opportunity to talk to the people in Bosnia about the \nefforts to gather evidence, which is very important for the War Crimes \nTribunal. They have drawn a fine line. That is, IFOR will protect the \npersonnel of the War Crimes Tribunal, but they will not protect the \nevidence itself. But the War Crimes Tribunal personnel are engaged \nthere and are taking a look at a lot of the grave sites, gathering \nevidence for prosecutions. So long as the personnel from the war crimes \nprosecution team are there gathering evidence, then military personnel \nwill protect the prosecution team.\n  We discussed with the military personnel, General Cherrie, the issue \nabout the potential of taking into custody the Bosnian Serb President \nKaradzic and General Mladic. The word was that individuals, such as \nthose two people, under indictment would be taken into custody if the \nNATO and U.S. forces came upon them, but they would not be sought out \nor hunted.\n  While we were there at the headquarters at Tuzla, we saw posters, \ncandidly not very good identifying pictures, but, as to the major \npeople under indictment including Bosnian Serb President Karadzic and \nGeneral Mladic.\n  We heard about an incident where IFOR forces had come upon General \nMladic, but he was surrounded by many of his own military personnel, \nand to attempt on that occasion to take him into custody would have \nprecipitated a battle. Since the IFOR forces were outnumbered, they did \nnot seek to take him into custody at that time.\n  But I think it is very important that, ultimately, President Karadzic \nand General Mladic be taken into custody so they can be prosecuted at \nthe War Crimes Tribunal. I believe prosecutions at the War Crimes \nTribunal are a very, very important aspect of what the United States \nand NATO are doing there. That may be the event of the decade or \nperhaps the event of the century if international legal precedence can \nbe established that genocide and the atrocities will not be tolerated \nand they will in fact be prosecuted by an international tribunal.\n  The establishment of the rule of law as an outgrowth of what has \nhappened in Bosnia would be an enormous step forward in international \nlaw, and is something which has to be pursued.\n  I had traveled to the Hague on January 4th this year and talked to \nthe prosecution team at that time. I found that there were a number of \nvery serious problems and I undertook to write to the Secretary of \nState, the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, the Director of \nthe CIA, and the Secretary of Defense. Their letter replies are \nattached and I ask that they be printed at the conclusion of my remarks \nalong with the full text of my statement.\n  A great deal has been done. The prosecution team was much more \nencouraged when I met with them on April 2; I was impressed with their \napproach back on January 4. I am pleased to say that CIA Director John \nDeutch has been very cooperative in working hard to make information \navailable which is necessary to obtain the convictions of those under \nindictment at the War Crimes Tribunal.\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\n  Mr. President, a very fundamental issue is what will happen with \nBosnia, when our forces are due to withdraw by December 1996. The \nIntelligence Committee, which I chair, heard from General Pat Hughes \nabout the problems which exist there at the present time and the \nprognosis is that if there is not a significant improvement in the \ninfrastructure, the economy and the local police forces in Bosnia, \nthere is likely to be a problem of fighting erupting again. We heard \nabout the implementation of the Dayton accord, that it is proceeding on \nschedule, as detailed in the statement that I will introduce into the \nRecord. I was pleased to see in the press Sunday April 21, statements \nby the military commanders in Bosnia, Adm. Leighton Smith and Lt. Col. \nBen Barry, about the compliance by the warring faction in withdrawing \ntheir military forces and complying with the Dayton accord. That is \ncertainly good news. A great deal more has to be done in terms of \nfulfilling the commitments which have been made by the major Western \ndemocracies, by Japan and by other countries, to see to it that local \npolice forces are established, that the infrastructure is built up, \nthat the economy is supported, so that there is a realistic opportunity \nfor peace to prevail there.\n  Mr. President, that is a brief summary of the highlights. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record certain letters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nreport on my recent visit to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague on \nApril 2, Serbia on April 3, and Bosnia on April 4. The primary purpose \nof this trip was to assess the progress being made on implementation of \nthe Dayton accords, particularly the prosecution of war criminals, and \nthe degree of intelligence support to the War Crimes Tribunal and the \nImplementation Force [IFOR].\n  Our first stop was The Hague, where the International War Crimes \nTribunal sits. There, we met with Judge Antonio Cassese, the President \nof the Tribunal prosecuting crimes against humanity committed in the \nformer Yugoslavia. Judge Cassese stated that the first trial of \nindicted war criminals will commence on the 7th of May. At this time, \nthere are five other trials planned against six indictees--two Moslems, \none Bosnian-Croat, and three Bosnian-Serbs, all of whom are being held \nin custody.\n  The Tribunal is in the somewhat delicate position of needing to \nmaintain judicial independence while relying heavily on the political \nsupport of the former Yugoslavian adversaries and the IFOR countries. \nOne of the issues I discussed with Judge Cassese was the role of IFOR \nsupport of the tribunal. While some progress has been made in this \neffort, there is apparently still some disagreement between the Court \nand U.S. force commanders on the degree of IFOR support. Of particular \nimportance is the issue of United States support for the apprehension \nof indicted war criminals, especially Bosnia-Serb President Karadzic \nand General Mladic. Judge Cassese indicated that the Europeans believe \nthat only the Americans have the capacity to arrest Karadzic and \nMladic. Neither the French, British or Italians appear ready to arrest \nthese individuals for various unspecified reasons.\n  President Cassese advised that he had initiated a meeting with the \nRussian Foreign Minister who urged the War Crimes Tribunal not to \nproceed against Mladic or Karadzic until after the September elections. \nThe judge commented that he advised the Russian Minister that he would \ntake his views into account but would not be influenced as to what \naction the Judicial Tribunal would take. As evidence of the conflicting \npressures on the tribunal, at least one NATO country has reportedly \nurged that as many suspected war criminals as possible should be \nindicted before the elections in order to preclude their running in \nthose elections, but that no additional suspects should be indicted \nafter elections so that there is no risk of indicting newly elected \nofficials.\n  We also met with the one American judge on the tribunal, Judge \nGabrielle McDonald, formerly a U.S. District Court judge in Texas, who \nis currently the presiding judge on two trials. Judge McDonald \nhighlighted the difficulties the tribunal faces in attempting to move \npromptly against indicted war criminals. For example, she pointed out \nthat while the first trial is scheduled for May 7, 1996, against a \nBosnian-Serb by the name of Tadic, there may be a delay if the tribunal \ndoes not receive some key equipment--simultaneous translation equipment \nwith a 2 to 3 second broadcast time delay--by April 23 and if the U.N. \nfails to accept this equipment as a gift. The delayed transmission is \nrequired to ensure there is no inadvertent broadcast of names. Judge \nMcDonald also expressed her view that there are not enough tribunal \ncourtrooms to try all the cases and attempting to try multiple \ndefendants won't work in this particular situation.\n  We also met with the prosecution team which is assisting Judge \nGoldstone in investigating and prosecuting the war crimes. Included in \nthis group are representatives from the Department of Justice, \nDepartment of State, Defense Department, and the FBI. The 10 \nindividuals with whom I met were very impressive and very dedicated to \nthe task of trying to bring justice to this great tragedy in current \nhistory.\n  I had met with this team earlier this year, on January 4, 1996. After \nassessing their needs at that time, I wrote to the President, the \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the \nDirector of the CIA, the Director of the FBI and the Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations.\n  When I met with the prosecution team on January 4, they were \nconcerned with cooperation by IFOR and the various agencies of the U.S. \nGovernment in supplying personnel and assistance in carrying out the \nefforts of the tribunal investigators. At the April 2 meeting, attended \nby many of the same people who were present on January 4, there was \nconsiderably more optimism because they had received assurances of \nsupport, including replacement personnel for the team, and assistance \nwas being given to the gathering of evidence in Bosnia.\n  To date the United States has been the biggest supporter of the \ntribunal and its chief contributor. By the end of this fiscal year \n1997, the U.S. will have contributed nearly $35 million to the court. \nIncluded in this figure is $3 million in services from more than 23 \nprosecutors, investigators and other experts from the departments and \nagencies of the U.S. Government.\n  It is clear, however, that this U.S. support alone is not sufficient. \nInternational pressure is needed on all parties to the Dayton accords \nto abide by that agreement to force them to turn over indicted \npersonnel to the tribunal. The tribunal team reported that there is a \nprevailing view among potential witnesses that the tribunal will not be \ncontinually supported and this is affecting witness willingness to step \nforward.\n  The prosecution team highlighted one particular set of indictments in \nwhich greater Serbian cooperation is needed. A Serbian army colonel by \nthe name of Veselin Sljidancanin and two other Serbians have been \nindicted for ordering the mass killings of 260 Croatians near Vukovar, \nCroatia after they forcibly removed these people from a hospital on \nMarch 20, 1991. Sljidancanin is free in Serbia and there is no \nindication that the Serbian Government intends to extradite him to the \ntribunal.\n  I advised the prosecution team that I would raise this issue with \nSerbian officials. The next day, April 3, I raised the issue with \nSerbian Foreign Minister Milutinovic and Assistant Foreign Minister \nJovanovic. I discussed the charges which had been filed against three \nmen and gave the Foreign Minister a copy of the indictment and the \ntranscript of the argument made by the prosecutor before the War Crimes \nTribunal on this issue. I ask unanimous consent that the indictment and \nthe transcript of the argument be inserted in the Congressional Record.\n  Foreign Minister Milutinovic said that Serbia could not extradite \nColonel Sljivancanin because it was prohibited by the Serbian \nconstitution. It appears that the other two men, Mrksic and Radic, are \nnot in Serbia at the present time.\n  I responded to Foreign Minister Milutinovic that a legal analysis had\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nbeen made showing that the Serbian constitution only prohibited \nextradition to another nation but the constitution did not prohibit \nextradition to the War Crimes Tribunal. Foreign Minister Milutinovic \nshowed little interest in having his government assist in bringing \nColonel Sljivancanin to the trial.\n  I asked Foreign Minister Milutinovic if his government would \ncooperate in bringing Bosnian Serb President Karadzic and General \nMladic to trial before the War Crimes Tribunal. While Foreign Minister \nMilutinovic said that Karadzic and Mladic should be ousted from power, \nhe would not assist in taking those men into custody so they could be \ntried under pending indictments issued by the War Crimes Tribunal.\n  On April 4 we traveled to Tuzla, the headquarters of the American \ncontingent of IFOR. Our military operation there was enormously \nimpressive. The United States had moved an army of nearly 18,000 men \nand women with spectacular results. I noted that women comprised \nbetween 10 to 15 percent of the American force serving in a variety of \njobs including military police and senior intelligence.\n  Our host was Brig. Gen. Stan Cherrie. Due to weather, we were unable \nto visit one of the mass grave sites that was being investigated by the \nWar Crimes Tribunal. Instead, we visited one of the intelligence \nsurveillance outposts at the top of Mount Vis. The purpose of our force \non Mount Vis is to monitor the perimeter areas to be sure there are no \nviolations of the accords. Getting there in knee-deep mud was \naccomplished riding in a track vehicle up the mountainside. This turned \nout to be an adventure in itself.\n  Foremost in my mind during this visit was what happens in December \n1996 when U.S. forces, which make up approximately one-third of the \nImplementation Force, are scheduled to withdraw from the region. By \ncoming in with overwhelming force, IFOR has been able to dominate the \nentire scene. The United States has suffered only two deaths; one was \nan individual who was dismantling a mine without following instructions \nand the other was a motor vehicle fatality. It is problematic what will \nhappen when IFOR leaves.\n  Of particular concern is the prospect that while IFOR may have \ncompleted its mission to stabilize the area militarily and allow \npolitical, economic and law enforcement initiatives to generate peace \nto the region, the civil mission to rebuild the economy and \ninfrastructure will not have made sufficient progress.\n  In testimony on March 27, 1996, before the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, Gen. Pat Hughes, the Director of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, stated that violence is likely to resume in Bosnia unless \nallied forces quickly help improve living conditions and provide the \nbasis for a stable economy.\n  The message I heard in Bosnia was similar: there is a need for \neconomic development to take hold. One senior military officer \nhighlighted the danger of not providing sufficient incentive to \nmaintain the peace, noting that the region is marked by the greatest \nlevel of hatred and distrust that he has ever seen. There is some \nevidence that the fighting forces on all sides are tired. There are \nother indications that fighting will resume once IFOR leaves. Many at \nthe scene predict that stability can be maintained if the economy and \ninfrastructure are developed and the local authorities are able to put \ntheir police forces into operation.\n  Some of our military personnel in Bosnia were more optimistic about \nBosnia's future. One ranking officer noted that if the September \nelections result in moderates replacing the current corrupt regime, \nthen the prospects for peace were good. He further advised that the \nschedule of confidence-building measures is proceeding according to the \nDayton accords. On day 1, a one kilometer zone of separation was \nestablished. On days 30 to 45, both factions--Bosnians and Bosnians \nSerbs--gave the locations of their heavy weapons to the United States \nand to each other. On D+90, the Dayton accords called for the \nconsolidation of air-defense weapons systems into approved sites. \nSeventy-five percent of those weapons were located and moved into those \nsites by the deadline. Now it's up to 90 percent. On D+120 days, which \nwill be on April 20, all armed forces are to be in their containment \nand barrack areas. Inspection teams will visit those areas. Any \ndeployments from containment areas will give IFOR a warning of \nintentions to initiate possible military action.\n  I raised with General Cherrie the role of IFOR in assisting the War \nCrimes Tribunal. He stated what he understood to be IFOR's mission: \nU.S. forces in IFOR would not seek out those indicated, such as General \nMladic, for example, but would be prepared to arrest him if IFOR forces \ncame upon him. All checkpoints have picture posters of those indicted. \nWe saw one of those posters. Regrettably, the photographs on many of \nthem are nearly impossible to make a clear identification.\n\n  I also asked General Cherrie for more details on IFOR's tasking in \nregard to support for the War Crimes Tribunal investigators examining \nthe sites of atrocities. He answered that it was to protect the War \nCrimes Tribunal personnel but not the war crimes sites. When War Crimes \nTribunal personnel leave a site, IFOR will leave. If the War Crimes \nTribunal personnel were to remain overnight, then IFOR would remain to \nprotect them.\n  At the top of Mount Vis we were treated to lunch with the military \npersonnel. There we found their morale to be very high. They are doing \nan excellent job under an extraordinarily difficult situation. Wherever \nwe turned, the mud was ankle deep. One quip which seemed particularly \nappropriate was that Bosnia was Latin for mud.\n  I also had a chance to meet several soldiers from Pennsylvania; \nincluding one young man from Philadelphia, S.Sgt. Michael J. Smith, \nanother from Pittsburgh, Christopher Klauer, and a third from \nAllentown, M.Sgt. Douglas Sleeth.\n  We departed Tuzla by 2:15 p.m. and headed for Aviano Air base in \nItaly where we received an operational and intelligence brief on air \nsupport capabilities to the Bosnia area. Air support and air strikes \nmay be one option in which military force can be brought to bear after \nthe pullout of IFOR forces.\n  We had been scheduled to travel to Zagreb, where we were to meet with \nCroatian President Tudjman, but that part of the trip was canceled \nafter the tragic crash of the plane carrying Secretary of Commerce Ron \nBrown and his delegation.\n  Instead, we held a series of meetings on April 5 with officials in \nour Embassy in Paris. These discussions also focused primarily on the \nsituation in the former Yugoslavia, where France is a key player.\n  Ambassador Harriman noted that France is now probably the most \nimportant United States ally in Europe. She is concerned that a planned \n40-percent cut in the U.S. embassy in Paris will severely hamper her \nability to deal with the political and economic requirements of this \nincreasingly important relationship. She noted that, in spite of press \naccounts to the contrary, there is excellent United States-French \ncooperation in the evolution of NATO, on the Former Yugoslavia, arms \ncontrol issues, terrorism, and organized crime. The Ambassador further \nnoted that the implementation of embassy cuts also will affect their \nability to encourage free trade and to promote U.S. exports.\n  We also discussed with Ambassador Harriman the issue of economic \nespionage and the impact of the recent controversy when France accused \nthe United States of using spies based at the Embassy to attempt to \nrecruit French government officials to gather information on economic \npolicies. We talked with the Embassy team about the history of French \nactivities targeting United States economic information, including \nproprietary information of United States firms. I sought their views \nregarding legislation we are considering on the Intelligence Committee \nto criminalize theft of trade secrets, as well as a bill to prevent \ncorrupt trade practices by foreign firms along the lines of the \nprohibitions currently in place for U.S. firms.\n  As amplified in a floor statement on April 17, we were very favorably \nimpressed by the operation of the U.S. Embassy in Paris.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: When you called me on November 25, 1995 \n     seeking support for\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\n     your Bosnian policy, we had an opportunity to talk briefly \n     about the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \n     Yugoslavia.\n       On January 4, I had an opportunity to meet with the \n     prosecution team in The Hague and was enormously impressed \n     with what they are doing.\n       In my view, these prosecutions are of historic importance. \n     I strongly believe that the United States government should \n     do everything in its power to assist in the prosecutions. \n     Toward that end, I have written the various Department and \n     Agency heads urging cooperation in a number of specific ways. \n     I believe that support by the American people and by the \n     Congress could be enhanced by successful prosecutions by the \n     War Crimes Tribunal.\n       I am sending to your National Security Council head, Tony \n     Lake, a copy of this letter and copies of my letters to the \n     respective Department and Agency heads.\n       I look forward to an opportunity to discuss this issue with \n     your further at your earliest convenience.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for your recent letter \n     expressing your support for the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I agree with you that its \n     work is of historic importance. The United States government \n     will continue to assist the Tribunal in its work.\n       The United States already has contributed more to the \n     Tribunal than any other nation--upwards of $14 million. This \n     includes the services of more than 22 prosecutors, \n     investigators and other experts. Assistant Secretary of State \n     for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor John Shattuck has \n     traveled to the former Yugoslavia eight times since July \n     1995--most recently in January 1996--to investigate and \n     communicate news of the serious violations of human rights \n     that occurred around Srebrenica and Zepa last summer.\n       The IFOR Commander, Admiral Leighton Smith, and Justice \n     Goldstone met on January 22 and agreed on how they can \n     coordinate their respective missions under the Dayton \n     Accords. Admiral Smith expressed his satisfaction that IFOR \n     will be able to provide appropriate assistance to ensure \n     security for Tribunal teams carrying out investigations at \n     mass grave sites. Justice Goldstone expressed his \n     satisfaction with the level of support offered by Admiral \n     Smith recently when he met with my National Security Advisor, \n     Anthony Lake.\n       Your continuing support and ideas are greatly appreciated, \n     as always. I look forward to discussing with you the \n     implementation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia as we \n     work together to restore peace to the Balkans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We regret the delayed response to your \n     letters of January 18, 1996 to Secretary Christopher and \n     Ambassador Albright, in which you underline the importance of \n     pursuing defendants indicted by the International Tribunal \n     for the former Yugoslavia.\n       Demanding an accounting for injustices perpetrated in the \n     former Yugoslavia is a fundamental tenet of our policy there. \n     In the long term, peace can be secured only through justice.\n       The Parties to the Dayton Agreement obliged themselves to \n     cooperate fully in the investigation and prosecution of war \n     crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law \n     in Article IX of the General Framework Agreement. This \n     obligation has been reaffirmed several times since, most \n     recently in a meeting held among the Parties in Rome on \n     February 18 when the Parties agree to provide unrestricted \n     access to places, including mass grave sites, relevant to \n     such crimes and to persons with relevant information. At this \n     meeting, IFOR repeated its readiness to work to provide a \n     secure environment for the completion of these tasks.\n       The Parties also acknowledged in Rome that persons other \n     than those already indicted by the Tribunal, would be \n     arrested and detained for serious violations of international \n     humanitarian law only pursuant to a previously issued order, \n     warrant or indictment that has been reviewed and deemed \n     consistent with international legal standards by the \n     International Tribunal. Although IFOR will not pursue persons \n     indicted by the Tribunal, it will detain any persons indicted \n     by the International War Crimes Tribunal who come into \n     contact with IFOR in its execution of assigned tasks and will \n     transfer these persons to the Tribunal.\n       You mentioned that the Tribunal's prosecution staff \n     expressed concerns about adequate financing and the need for \n     the help of more U.S. Government detailees. The United States \n     is the leading supporter of the Tribunal, having contributed \n     since 1994 over 12 million dollars (of a total 19 million) \n     and 22 U.S. government detailees to the Tribunal. We are \n     arranging to send in the near future an additional \n     investigative team of nine (seven investigators and two \n     translator) to aid the prosecution staff of the Tribunal for \n     Rwanda. We understand that the Department of Justice is also \n     detailing two prosecutors to the Tribunal.\n       The Yugoslav Tribunal is preparing its 1996-97 budget. We \n     understand that the preliminary two-year estimate is in \n     excess of 85 million dollars for operations related to the \n     former Yugoslavia. The UN has adopted a funding formula that \n     covers half of the Tribunal's cost through unencumbered UN \n     peacekeeping balances and half through the normal UN scale of \n     assessments--a rate of 25 percent for the U.S. Of course, \n     actual expenses will depend in large part on the demands \n     placed on the Tribunal--especially trials--in the next two \n     years. Our ability to pay our UN assessment in full in 1996 \n     and 1997 is dependent on Congressional approval of funds for \n     U.S. contributions to international organizations.\n       We appreciate your strong and ongoing commitment to the \n     work of the Tribunal and hope this information is responsive \n     to your concerns. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we \n     can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary,\n     Legislative Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your letter of January \n     18, the Department of Defense (DoD) is participating with \n     others in the Intelligence Community (IC) to provide U.S. \n     intelligence support to the International Criminal Tribunal \n     for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTFY). IC participation is guided \n     by the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research \n     (INR), which acts as the point of contact for the IC with the \n     Office of the Prosecutor.\n       The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is the focal point \n     for DoD support to the ICTFY. The initial search of DoD data \n     bases was designed to locate all intelligence information \n     which might be of evidentiary value to the Office of the \n     Prosecutor. As a result of that search, and others in \n     response to specific requests from the Office of the \n     Prosecutor, DIA initially identified over 3,000 documents, \n     the majority of which were Information Intelligence Reports \n     (IIRs). Approximately 1,000 documents were determined to be \n     of no value to the ICTFY. Of the remainder, 444 IIRs were \n     forwarded to State INR and have been delivered to the Office \n     of the Prosecutor. The remaining 1,550 IIRs are undergoing \n     review, and those with information responsive to the ICTFY \n     requests will be delivered to the State Department by 15 \n     March.\n       The Office of the Prosecutor, through State INR, has given \n     assurance that our responses to their various requests have \n     been concurrent with their needs. Adequate resources are \n     assigned to the job. You may be assured we are monitoring \n     requests from the Office of the Prosecutor, through the State \n     Department, on a daily basis and are prepared to increase our \n     efforts if necessary. We are committed to continuing both \n     intelligence and Judge Advocate support to the Office of the \n     Prosecutor within the scope of available resources.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter to the \n     Attorney General regarding the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n       At the outset, I would like to convey the Department's deep \n     appreciation for the critical role you have played in this \n     area. We are grateful for your efforts in passing legislation \n     that gives the United States full authority to obtain \n     evidence for, and to extradite offenders to, the Tribunal.\n       The Department of Justice remains firmly committed to \n     supporting the important work of the Tribunal. We share your \n     pride in the work done by the Department's prosecutors \n     currently detailed to the Tribunal, and it is our goal to \n     carry that work forward.\n       In addition, as Director Freeh states in his separate \n     letter on this topic, the Department remains committed to \n     continuing to provide Federal Bureau of Investigation agents \n     to the Tribunal. The United States also has already provided, \n     and will continue to provide, information to the Tribunal.\n       Finally, we have on occasion been contacted by the Tribunal \n     on witness protection issues. As you know, however, the \n     federal Witness Security Program is designed to protect \n     persons who are expected to testify in proceedings in the \n     United States. While there has been one relocation of a \n     witness in connection with Tribunal proceedings, that was a \n     most unusual case. Yet, the Department remains willing to \n     work with Tribunal authorities on alternative solutions to \n     this problem.\n       Thank you again for you efforts and your support. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\n     this office if we can be of further assistance with regard to \n     this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Thank you for your letter of January \n     18, 1996. I appreciate the interest and support that you \n     expressed in the FBI's involvement in the United Nation's \n     International War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague. As \n     background, in June 1994, three FBI Special Agents were \n     assigned to the Tribunal for a one-year assignment. The \n     Department of State requested our investigative expertise to \n     help in ``jump starting'' the investigative arm of the \n     Tribunal. In June 1995, the Department of State petitioned \n     Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick for a one-year \n     extension of these resources. I remain committed to continue \n     this level of support in the work of the Tribunal.\n       As you are aware, the efforts of the Tribunal have yielded \n     indictments against war criminals. I share your opinion that \n     the work of the Tribunal must continue and they must bring \n     the individuals responsible for these atrocities to justice.\n       As you are aware, the Witness Security Program is \n     administered by the U.S. Marshals Service under the aegis of \n     the Department of Justice. I have been informed by the U.S. \n     Marshals Service that there is no statutory or budgetary \n     authority to use this program for witnesses of the Tribunal. \n     I am aware, however, that they have relocated one witness \n     from Bosnia with the assistance of the Department of Justice \n     and the Marshals Service. I have been advised that this \n     relocation involved extraordinary circumstances. The FBI \n     Special Agents assigned to the Tribunal have been advised by \n     FBIHQ that any requests for witness assistance should be \n     brought to the direct attention of the Criminal Division.\n       You may be aware that the Department of State has put forth \n     a plan to establish an international, unarmed law enforcement \n     contingent to develop civilian law enforcement programs in \n     Bosnia. The protection of witnesses developed by the Tribunal \n     may be addressed as a function of this proposed police force.\n       If I can be of any further assistance to you, please do not \n     hesitate to call upon me.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Last week, Vice President Gore stated that Republican \ncriticism of Clinton-appointed judges was misguided--A ``smoke \nscreen,'' as he put it, ``to hide our own poor record on crime.''\n  While the Vice President is off-base with his smoke screen comments, \nhe is absolutely right to suggest that it is important to look at the \nrecord.\n  The record is that the number of prosecutions initiated by the \nClinton Justice Department for crimes involving guns and drugs has \ndropped significantly since the Bush administration.\n  The record is that the Clinton Justice Department has virtually \nignored the enforcement of the Federal death penalty, established by \nthe 1994 crime bill.\n  The record is that the Clinton administration's top lawyer has \nactually argued in favor of narrowly interpreting and weakening the \nFederal child pornography laws.\n  The record is that President Clinton has vetoed legislation that \nwould help stop the thousands of frivolous lawsuits filed every year by \nconvicted criminals that serve only to clog the courts and waste \nmillions of taxpayer dollars.\n  Of course, there is the Clinton record on drugs. Drug enforcement is \ndown. Drug interdiction is down. And the antidrug bully pulpit has been \nall but abandoned. Just say no has become just say nothing. Not \nsurprisingly, teenage drug use has nearly doubled since President \nClinton first took office.\n  Yes, Vice President Gore is right: It is important to look at the \nrecord.\n  Then there's the issue of Federal judges. With all due respect to the \nVice President, I suggest that he take a close look at the decisions of \nJudge Martha Craig Daughtrey, a former member of the Tennessee Supreme \nCourt and a Clinton appointee to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  In an important search and seizure case, Judge Daughtrey ruled that \nthe police acted improperly when they searched the trunk of a car that \nthey had pulled over early one morning after the car made a left turn \nwithout signaling. At the time of the stop, the police suspected that \nthe driver might have been driving under the influence of alcohol. \nDuring the search, the police frisked the car's passenger for weapons \nand found a cellular phone, a pocket beeper, and $2,100 in cash. The \npolice then asked the car's driver and passenger whether they could \nsearch the trunk. The driver and the passenger consented--consented--\nand the police found a shopping bag containing a baggie with a large \namount of crack cocaine.\n  Yet, Judge Daughtrey ruled that the police acted unreasonably and she \nvoted to suppress the crack cocaine evidence. Judge Ryan, a Reagan \nappointee, dissented on the grounds that the police acted \nappropriately.\n  In another fourth amendment case, Judge Daughtrey dissented from a \ndecision upholding a police search that led to the discovery of a large \nstash of vicious child pornography. The two Republican-appointed judges \nupheld the constitutionality of the search, saying that it was fully \nconsistent with fourth amendment precedent.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Daughtrey is not an aberration. Last year, in an \nimportant case before the D.C. Court of Appeals, two Clinton-appointed \njudges dissented from the court's majority opinion upholding the FCC's \nregulations prohibiting the transmission of indecency on television and \nradio during certain hours of the day. The purpose of these regulations \nis, obviously, to protect our children from images that would be \nharmful to their moral and psychological development. Yet, the two \nClinton judges on the court joined with the two Carter appointees in \narguing that these regulations somehow violate the first amendment.\n  So while President Clinton touts the V-chip and holds high-profile \nWhite House conferences with television executives, his judges are \nattempting to strip the very protections that he supposedly supports. \nPresident Clinton may talk a moderate game, but his appointees to the \nFederal bench are attempting to stamp their own brand of stealth \nliberalism on America.\n  And that is my point: Selecting who sits on the Federal bench is one \nof the most critical responsibilities of any President. Long after a \nPresident has left office, the judges he appoints will leave their mark \non American society. While the Vice President may say that the Clinton \nadministration appoints judges on the basis of excellence, not \nideology, the facts--regrettably--tell a much different story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3892-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3892-S3893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT, NO UNITED STATES FORCES IN LIBERIA\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, 18 American soldiers were \ngunned down in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia. What happened October \n3, 1993, in Somalia was another one of those tragic mistakes. U.S. \nservicemen should not be asked to risk their lives in so-called \npeacekeeping missions where there is really no peace, and where no U.S. \nnational interests are at stake.\n  As the last of United States forces pull out of Haiti, the American \npeople\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\nare learning that Operation Uphold Democracy was not the resounding \nsuccess President Clinton led us to believe. The bottom line, it seems \nto me, is that America's military cannot achieve what the people and \nleaders of Somalia and Haiti refuse to do. This so-called nation \nbuilding is fanciful rhetoric for fleecing the American taxpayers.\n  I had hoped and prayed that President Clinton had learned his lesson \nfrom Somalia, and Haiti, but President Clinton has already landed \nseveral hundred Marines, from Camp Lejeune, NC, inside Liberia. More \nthan 1,600 Marines and 1,900 sailors on warships are awaiting further \norders.\n  But, Liberia is in, quite literally, a state of anarchy, and I fear \nthere is little the United States can do about it. Consider, Mr. \nPresident, that since 1990, American taxpayers have given Liberia--a \ncountry of 3 million people--at least $429 million of foreign aid, \naccording to A.I.D.--and President Clinton proposes to forgive Liberian \ndebt to the American taxpayers. And what has all this assistance \naccomplished? Since the outbreak of the civil war in 1989, intensive \nfighting has been the cause of the United States having to evacuate \nAmericans and others from the country on three separate occasions. tens \nof thousands of Liberians are dead and thousands more fled.\n  Tragically, the lives saved by $429 million in U.S. foreign aid are \ntoday being gunned-down at the hands of heavily armed drunken \nteenagers, looting the capital city of Monrovia, raping and killing for \nsport. The so-called leaders in Liberia, as in Somalia, are \nbloodthirsty warlords who are more vicious criminals than national \nleaders. In fact, one warlord, Charles Taylor, escaped from Plymouth \nCounty Jail in Massachusetts in 1985.\n  Mr. President, on April 15, the Foreign Relations Committee was \nassured that if United States Marines went into Liberia, they would \nonly be protecting the United States Embassy and assisting with \nevacuations, although all Americans who have asked to leave are already \nevacuated. The Sunday Washington Times, however, reported that several \nhundred Marines landed in Liberia over the weekend, and that they \n``would be able to provide humanitarian assistance.'' This makes me \nvery concerned about mission creep.\n  Congress does not want United States Marines hunting down Liberian \nwarlords, as in Somalia, or picking up trash on the streets of \nMonrovia, as in Port-au-Prince. Mr. President, there are no United \nStates interests in Liberia worth the life of even one United States \nservice man or woman.\n  I have written President Clinton to raise a number of questions about \nhis policy. Congress and the American people deserve answers. Of \ncourse, I pray the President does not get the United States into \nanother Somalia or Haiti.\n  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the President \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In response to the most recent outbreak \n     of violence in Liberia and the mass evacuation that followed, \n     I note that the Administration has undertaken a comprehensive \n     review of its policy toward Liberia. Congress is also fully \n     aware of the likelihood of further humanitarian tragedy in \n     Liberia.\n       With the unnecessary deaths of eighteen U.S. servicemen in \n     Somalia (October 3, 1993) lingering on our minds, the landing \n     of several hundred U.S. Marines in Liberia over the weekend \n     has Congress to be all the more concerned about developments \n     in Liberia--and, frankly, the Administration's response to \n     that crisis.\n       Administration officials briefed Congressional staff this \n     past week about the situation in Liberia, but a number of \n     important questions went unanswered. The Foreign Relations \n     Committee will appreciate prompt answers to the following \n     questions:\n       (1) What is the exit strategy for the U.S. troops currently \n     in Liberia?\n       (2) Under what rules of engagement are U.S. servicemen in \n     Liberia operating?\n       (3) As humanitarian concerns are necessarily incidental--as \n     important as they may be--what the U.S. national interests in \n     Liberia, besides protecting U.S. citizens?\n       (4) What interests in Liberia are worth risking the life of \n     one American citizen?\n       (5) Inasmuch as Liberia is in anarchy, why should any U.S. \n     Embassy personnel remain?\n       (6) To whom is the U.S. Embassy accredited?\n       (7) If U.S. Embassy personnel remain, what kind of security \n     will they have?\n       (8) Has the U.S. Government received any assistance with \n     evacuations or security from France, Britain or any other \n     country?\n       (9) What countries have overseas bases in African countries \n     in proximity to Liberia?\n       (10) How many people, and from which countries, have been \n     evacuated from Liberia by U.S. forces?\n       (11) How many private Americans and U.S. citizens working \n     at the Embassy remain in Liberia?\n       (12) Do any United Nations Development Program personnel \n     remain in Liberia?\n       (13) Are personnel from any United Nations agency on the \n     ground in Liberia?\n       (14) To date, what is the total cost of the evacuation \n     effort?\n       (15) How many U.S. Navy vessels have arrived off Liberia, \n     and how many Marines and sailors does this represent?\n       (16) Under what circumstances would these Marines go into \n     Liberia?\n       (17) Is an expanded role for U.S. military forces being \n     contemplated? If so, please explain.\n       (18) If a contingent of U.S. forces goes into Liberia, from \n     where will they be supported?\n       (19) What would such an operation cost?\n       (20) Given the state of anarchy in Liberia, and the \n     individuals with whom diplomats are forced to deal, how does \n     the Administration expect to influence events?\n       (21) To date, how much U.S. funding has ECOMOG received, \n     including equipment, and how effective has it been?\n       (22) To date, how much U.S. funding have the countries of \n     ECOWAS received, including equipment, and how effective has \n     it been?\n       (23) As Nigeria has been decertified on account of \n     noncooperation in the fight against illegal narcotics, how \n     does the Administration intend to provide funding to Nigerian \n     troops, which make up a majority of ECOMOG in Liberia--will \n     the Administration seek a waiver in order to provide funding \n     or equipment to Nigerian forces?\n       (24) How much money and equipment does the Administration \n     propose giving ECOMOG and ECOWAS, and from where will the \n     funds come?\n       (25) Since the outbreak of the civil war in 1989, how much \n     U.S. Government assistance has gone to Liberia?\n       (26) Since the outbreak of the civil war in 1989, what is \n     the total amount of international assistance that has gone to \n     Liberia, including from United Nations agencies and all \n     international financial institutions?\n       (27) Have any of the Liberian warlords ever been wanted, or \n     are currently wanted, in the United States for any violation \n     of law?

Mr. President, 2 years ago, the Medicare trustees--three of \nwhom are members of the President's Cabinet--reported to President \nClinton and Congress that Medicare would be bankrupt by the year 2002.\n  From the day the Medicare trustees issued their report, Republicans \nhave worked to preserve and strengthen Medicare. We proposed to do this \nnot by cutting Medicare--but by slowing its rate of growth. Under the \nRepublican plan adopted by Congress, annual spending per Medicare \nbeneficiary would increase from $4,800 this year to more than $7,200 in \n2002.\n  If you believed what President Clinton and some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle had to say, however, you would have thought \nthat instead of increasing Medicare spending from $4,800 per \nbeneficiary to $7,200 per beneficiary, Republicans were trying to throw \nAmerica's seniors out on the streets. And to the President's credit as \na public speaker, a lot of Americans believed what he was saying.\n  There is, however, a very big difference between leading and \nmisleading. Republicans chose to lead--and we suffered in the polls \nbecause of it. President Clinton chose to mislead--and he gained in the \npolls because of it.\n  But as a story in this morning's New York Times makes very clear, the \nPresident's gain came at the expense of the millions and millions of \nAmericans who depend on Medicare.\n  The story reveals the fact that Medicare's hospital insurance trust \nfund, which pays hospital bills for the elderly and disabled, lost $4.2 \nbillion--that is billion with a ``B''--in the first half of the current \nfiscal year. Those losses are more than 100 times larger than the $35.7 \nmillion loss the trust fund experienced all last year.\n  The $4.2 billion loss is also in stark contrast to the rosy scenario \ncoming out of the White House last year. As part of their attempt to \nlead the public\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nto believe that Republicans concern with Medicare was ``much ado about \nnothing,'' they predicted that the Medicare trust fund would take in \n$45 million more than it would spend in the current fiscal year. \nObviously, the White House was as off base in its economic projections \nas they were in their political accusations.\n  The article also reports that Roland King, former chief actuary of \nthe Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said \nthat after analyzing these new numbers, he believes the hospital \ninsurance trust fund will not run out in 2002 as the trustees \noriginally projected. Instead, it will run out in 2000 or 2001.\n  I am sure that a number of Republicans are tempted to say ``I told \nyou so,'' this morning. But saying that will get us no closer to the \nsolutions necessary to save Medicare from bankruptcy.\n  And so, Mr. President, this Senator stands ready to work on a \nbipartisan basis to save, preserve, and strengthen Medicare. It is my \nhope that in the face of these alarming new numbers, the President will \nchoose the path of leading rather than the path of misleading.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3893-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3894-S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATOR EDMUND S. MUSKIE: THE SENATE'S FIRST ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. As all senators know, former Senator \nEdmund S. Muskie passed away on March 26, two days before his 82d \nbirthday. Senator Muskie served in this body from January, 1959, until \nMay 1980, when he resigned to become Secretary of State in the Carter \nadministration.\n  As a freshman Senator, Ed Muskie ardently desired a position on the \nForeign Relations Committee. He was disappointed to be appointed to the \nPublic Works Committee instead. But his loss proved to be the Nation's \ngain. As a member of the Public Works Committee, later the chairman of \nthe Environmental Pollution Subcommittee, Senator Muskie became the \nchief architect of America's first environmental laws.\n  At the funeral service for Senator Muskie, his protege and former \nchief of staff, George Mitchell, who took Muskie's Senate seat and went \non to become the Senate majority leader, delivered a wonderful tribute \nto Senator Muskie's environmental leadership. I would like to share his \nremarks with the Senate today by asking unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Congressional Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Remarks of George Mitchell\n\n       Jane, Steve and Lexi, Ellen and Ernie, Melinda and Eddie, \n     Martha, Ned and Julia, and other members of the family, \n     Cardinal Hickey, Bishop Gerry and other members of the \n     clergy, President and Mrs. Carter and other distinguished \n     guests and friends of Ed Muskie. Senator Muskie once said \n     that he didn't like being called ``Lincolnesque'' but it fit. \n     With his lanky frame, his long and craggy face, his powerful \n     voice, he was an imposing figure. He was loved and trusted by \n     the people of Maine because they saw in him the qualities \n     they most admire, independence, fairness, the lack of \n     pretense, the willingness to speak the truth even when it \n     hurt. He was plain spoken even blunt at times and they \n     admired him for it. He had his faults and he made mistakes \n     as do all human beings but he conquered his faults and he \n     learned from his mistakes and as a result, he became the \n     greatest public official in Maine's history and one of the \n     most effective legislators in our nation's history. He \n     accomplished much in a long and distinguished career. In \n     that impressive record, nothing surpasses what he did to \n     protect America's natural environment.\n       Harry Truman once said that men make history, not the other \n     way around. In periods where there is no leadership society \n     stands still. Progress occurs when courageous skillful \n     leaders seize the opportunity to change things for the \n     better. Ed Muskie changed things for the better. When he went \n     to the Senate, there were no national environmental laws, \n     there was no environmental movement, there was hardly an \n     awareness of the problem. Industries and municipalties dumped \n     their wastes into the nearest river and America's waters \n     were, for the most part, stinking open sewers. The air was \n     unhealthy the water polluted, Ed Muskie changed that.\n       It's one thing to write and pass a law, its another thing \n     to change the way people live, it's yet another and a far \n     more difficult thing to change the way people think. Ed \n     Muskie did that. With knowledge, skill, determination and \n     patience he won approval of the Clean Air Act and the Clean \n     Water Act and America was changed forever for the better. Any \n     American who wants to know what Ed Muskie's legacy is need \n     only go to the nearest river. Before Ed Muskie it was almost \n     surely not fit to drink or to swim or to fish in, because of \n     Ed Muskie it is now almost surely clean. A source of \n     recreation even revenue. Despite the efforts of some to turn \n     back the clock, these landmark laws will survive because the \n     American people know what a difference he has made in their \n     lives\n       It has been said that what we do for ourselves, leaves this \n     world with us, what we do for others remains behind. That's \n     our legacy, our link with immortality. Ed Muskie's legacy \n     will stand as a living memorial to his vision. It is his \n     immortality.\n       Each of us could say much more about Ed Muskie's public \n     career but we are here today to pay tribute to Ed Muskie the \n     man, so I would like to say a few words about the man who was \n     my hero, my mentor, my friend. Thirty-four years ago this \n     week, I received a telephone call that changed my life. It \n     was from Don Nicoll, Senator Muskie's Administrative \n     Assistant and close friend who is here today. he invited me \n     to come up to Capitol Hill to meet the Senator who was \n     looking for someone from Maine to fill a vacancy on his \n     staff. To help him evaluate me, Don asked that I prepare a \n     memorandum on the legal aspects of an issue that was then \n     being considered by the Senate. I prepared the memo and went \n     up for the interview. I thought the memo was pretty good, but \n     unknowingly I had made a huge mistake. I reached a conclusion \n     that was the opposite of the Senator's. I had never met him \n     but he didn't bother with any small talk. Within minutes of \n     our introduction, he unleashed a ferocious cross-examination. \n     He came out from behind his desk, he towered over me, he \n     shook his finger at me and he took my memo apart, line by \n     line. I was stunned, so intimidated that I couldn't control \n     the shaking of my legs even though I was sitting down. I \n     tried as best as I could to explain my point of view and we \n     had what you might call a lively discussion. As I left he \n     said the next time you come in here, you'll be better \n     prepared. That's how I learned I'd been hired and I sure was \n     better prepared the next time.\n       Ed Muskie was even more imposing intellectually than he was \n     physically. He was the smartest person that I ever met with \n     an incisive analytical mind that enabled him to see every \n     aspect of a problem and instantly to identify possible \n     solutions. He challenged everyone around him to rise to his \n     level of excellence. No one quite reached his level, but \n     those who took up the challenge were improved by the effort. \n     Those who know him learned from that relationship, those of \n     us who worked for him, most of all. just about everything I \n     know about politics and government I learned from him. Just \n     about everything I have accomplished in public life, can \n     be traced to his help. No one ever had a better mentor or \n     a better friend.\n       No discussion of Ed Muskie would be complete without \n     mention of his legendary temper. After he became Secretary of \n     State, a news magazine in an article described his temper as \n     entirely tactical, something that he turned on and off at \n     will to help him get his way. I saw him a few days later, he \n     showed me the article, in fact he read it to me, and then he \n     said laughingly, ``all these years you thought my temper was \n     for real.'' Well, I said, you sure fooled me, and a lot of \n     other people. I think the reality is that it was both. When \n     he yelled at you it was terrifyingly real, but you could \n     never be sure that it wasn't also a tactic to move you his \n     way, to get you to do what he wanted done and that's the way \n     he wanted it and liked it.\n       Almost as unnerving as one of his eruptions was the \n     swiftness with which it passed and was forgotten. He was a \n     passionate man and expressed himself with emotion. His point \n     having been made, he moved on, he didn't believe in looking \n     back or nursing grudges and maybe that's how he got past the \n     disappointments he suffered. It surely also helped that he \n     was a secure man, confident in, and comfortable with his \n     values. Those values were simple, yet universal in their \n     reach and enduring in their strength. They were faith, family \n     and country. He was constant in his faith. He was comforted \n     by it and he was motivated by its message. The prayer printed \n     on the back of the program today written by Senator Muskie \n     more than a quarter century ago with its emphasis on \n     compassion and tolerance was the essence of his faith. He was \n     totally devoted to his family, especially to Jane. They would \n     have celebrated their 48th anniversary in May and for all \n     those years, she supported him, she comforted him, she helped \n     him. He was a passionate believer in democracy and especially \n     in American democracy.\n       I have the privilege of traveling all over Maine and all \n     this country with him. Back when I was on Senator Muskie's \n     staff we didn't have the resources available today so we used \n     to share a motel room in small towns all across Maine as I \n     drove him from one appearance to another. And I can recall \n     the many times he spoke of his Father who he greatly admired \n     and who he was very much influenced by. His Father was a \n     Polish immigrant who, like many others who fled from tyranny, \n     flourished in the free air of this blessed land. No person I \n     have ever heard and few in our history could match Ed \n     Muskie's eloquence on the meaning of America. Once in public \n     office, his profound respect for American democracy led him \n     to act always with dignity and restraint, lest he dishonor \n     those he represented. As a result, he was the ideal in pubic \n     service, a man who accomplished much without ever \n     compromising his principles or his dignity. Character is\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\n     what you are when you are alone in the dark as well as with \n     others in the daylight. Ed Muskie's character was strong. \n     Strong enough to light up other people's lives. He taught us \n     that integrity is more important than winning. That real \n     knowledge counts more than slogans or sound bites. That we \n     should live our values rather than parading them for public \n     approval.\n       Many years ago, Maine's greatest poet, Henry Wadsworth \n     Longfellow, wrote of another great man these words: ``Were a \n     star quenched on high for ages would its light still \n     traveling downward from the sky shine on our mortal sight. So \n     when a great man dies for years beyond our kin, the light he \n     leaves behind him lies upon the paths of men.'' A great man \n     has died and for years his life will shine upon our paths. \n     Goodbye Ed, may God bless you and welcome you.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Finally, Mr. President, I would also like to share with \nmy colleagues a beautiful prayer, written by Senator Muskie for the \noccasion of the Presidential Prayer Breakfast in January, 1969. The \nmessage of this prayer--a plea on behalf of all public officials for \nmutual trust and understanding, cooperation and compassion--is more \nrelevant today than ever. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe prayer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Presidential Prayer\n\n(Written by Senator Edmund S. Muskie and delivered at the Presidential \n           Prayer Breakfast January 30, 1969--Washington, DC)\n\n       Our Father--we are gathered here this morning, perplexed \n     and deeply troubled.\n       We are grateful for the many blessings You have bestowed \n     upon us--the great resources of land and people--the freedom \n     to apply them to uses of our own choosing--the successes \n     which have marked our efforts.\n       We are preplexed that, notwithstanding these blessings, we \n     have not succeeded in making possible a life of promise for \n     all our people in that growing dissatisfaction threatens our \n     unity and our progress toward peace and justice.\n       We are deeply troubled that we may not be able to agree \n     upon the common purposes and the basis for mutual trust which \n     are essential if we are to overcome these difficulties.\n       And so, Our Father, we turn to you for help.\n       Teach us to listen to one another, with the kind of \n     attention which is receptive to other points of view, however \n     different, with a healthy skepticism as to our own \n     infallibility.\n       Teach us to understand one another with the kind of \n     sensitivity which springs from deeply-seated sympathy and \n     compassion.\n       Teach us to trust one another, beyond mere tolerance, with \n     a willingness to take the chance on the perfectibility of our \n     fellow men.\n       Teach us to help one another, beyond charity, in the kind \n     of mutual involvement which is essential if a free society is \n     to work.\n       We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3894-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE COLLARDS FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I am proud to pay tribute today to a dear \nfriend to me and several members of my staff, James L. Jones. Jimmy is \na long-time employee of the Senate Superintendent's Office of the \nArchitect of the Capitol, where his friendliness, dedication, and warm \npersonality have become familiar to many of us. On April 26, Jimmy will \nbe retiring from his position with the Superintendent's Office after 31 \nyears of service to the U.S. Senate. He started out working on the \ngrounds and worked his way up to become the Senate garage attendant \nforeman. For many years, he has headed up the entire Senate parking \ngarage operation.\n  Jimmy Jones is one of those individuals who takes extreme pride in \nhis work and who truly loves the Senate as an institution. He and his \ncapable staff are welcome sights to those who routinely park in the \nvarious garages in the Senate office buildings. He is fun to joke \naround with and he really goes the extra mile to take care of those who \nuse the parking facilities. He is a Maryland native, and his delicious \ncrabcakes have been most appreciated over the years. He never fails to \ngreet us with a joke or humorous story to brighten our day, and his \nspecial brand of generosity and humor never fail to uplift our spirits \nand provide a welcome reprieve from the rigors of Senate business.\n  Jimmy Jones is one of those colorful Senate institutions who will be \nsorely missed after he retires. His friendliness, cheerfulness, and \nwillingness to accommodate are genuine. He is a person of character. I \njoin my colleagues in thanking him, commending him, and wishing him all \nthe best as he embarks upon a well-earned retirement. I do hope he will \ncontinue to bring us his crabcakes from time to time. Since he is such \nan avid stock car racing fan, I also expect to see him at the Talladega \nInternational Motor Speedway on occasion after my own retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3895-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3895-S3896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF MEL BAILEY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Jefferson County Sheriff Mel Bailey \nannounced earlier this month that he will be retiring after a \ndistinguished 33-year record as the county's chief law enforcement \nofficial. This means that for the first time since the early days of \nthe Civil Rights Movement, Jefferson County will have a new sheriff. He \nis the dean of Alabama law enforcement officers.\n  Mel Bailey has provided outstanding leadership, guidance, and service \nto the State of Alabama as Jefferson County's sheriff since 1963. \nThroughout his terms in office, he has made tremendous strides in \npreparing the sheriff's department for its fight against crime and in \nserving the citizens who elected him. In the process, he has become \nknown as a symbol of law and order in Alabama.\n  Since he has been in office, Mel Bailey has come to epitomize the \noffice in the minds of many citizens. He joined the Birmingham Police \nDepartment in 1946 and was promoted to detective in 1953, resigning in \n1962 to successfully campaign for sheriff. He didn't draw an opponent \nuntil 1978, when he still received 70 percent of the vote.\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\n  When Sheriff Bailey began his tenure, there were 77 sheriff's \ndepartment employees working within a $735,000 budget. Today, the \ndepartment has about 600 workers and a $28 million budget. He began the \nTurn in a Pusher [T.I.P.] program, the United Narcotic Detail Operation \nProgram, and developed one of the first SWAT teams in the United \nStates. He also initiated a countywide radio network that linked 34 \ncities with the sheriff's department.\n  Many give Sheriff Bailey credit for creating a modern, professional \nlaw enforcement agency. He put deputies in uniforms and into marked \ncars, and got his department to start investigating automobile \naccidents and keeping records. During the 1960's, he dramatically \nimproved working conditions for deputies. In the 1970's, he established \nthe county's substation system and the special deputies program. A \ntraining program for jailers was implemented in 1982. He worked to \nprovide his deputies with the best equipment possible and began a \nstandard training procedure which provided them with the expertise \nnecessary to meet any threat. He has been instrumental in obtaining \ninnovative equipment for use in fighting crime.\n  For example, he implemented a radio-controlled toy airplane which can \nbe used to drop tear gas or small bombs to stop a sniper lodged in a \nprotected place. He also added a robot which police agencies can send \ninto a building to dismantle a bomb. In both of these cases, a highly \ndangerous problem can now be handled without threat to the life of an \nofficer.\n  The outstanding contributions Sheriff Mel Bailey has made during his \nlong tenure in office are the result of his great capabilities, his \nability to delegate responsibility, and by his professional attitude. \nHe has also surrounded himself with outstanding people who hold the \nsame qualities of professionalism and commitment to fighting crime. He \nis a prominent symbol of law and order throughout Alabama. He has \nenjoyed the full confidence of the people of Jefferson County for good \nreason: his fundamental effectiveness in battling crime, as evidenced \nby the fact that he was named Alabama's Law Officer of the Year in 1971 \nand was inducted into the Alabama Peace Officers Hall of Fame in 1991.\n  I commend and congratulate Sheriff Mel Bailey for his many years of \nservice to the cause of law enforcement in Alabama's most populous \ncounty. All are proud of his achievements and thankful for his long \nperiod of excellent service. He has done an outstanding job and I wish \nhim well as he enters retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3895-5", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM MANSEL LONG, SR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, my dear friend William Mansel Long, Sr., \npassed away on March 31, 1996, at the age of 92. Mr. Long was an \noutstanding civil rights leader and senior citizens advocate and was \none of the founding members of the Alabama Democratic Conference. His \nson, William Mansel, Jr., has been on my staff ever since I came to the \nSenate, and has been my legislative director for several years.\n  Mansel Long made his mark on society in many ways during his long \nlife. His tenacity and accomplishments were an inspiration to so many \nwho knew him. His was a life of struggle, but also one of extraordinary \nachievement spurred by an unusual devotion to duty. He dedicated \nhimself to improving the quality of life for his fellow citizens and to \nenriching his community and society as a whole. His life was marked by \nmany varied accomplishments--he excelled on both a professional and \npersonal level. Even late in life, he continued to be a vital force in \npolitical and religious affairs.\n  Mr. Long received the certificate of appreciation from the Northwest \nAlabama Council of Local Governments Area Agency on Aging; the Quality \nof Life Award, presented by the Mental Health Association; the \nCommunity Leadership Award, presented by the Shoals National Bank; and \nawards of appreciation for his long years of service to Lesley Temple \nChristian Methodist Episcopal Church. He was my appointee to the 1981 \nWhite House Conference on Aging, where he helped formulate the \nrecommendations for developing national policy on aging.\n  Mansel Long was a gifted orator, organizer, and a moral force in his \ncommunity. Over the course of several decades, he fought for civil \nrights and for social and economic equality for all people. In addition \nto helping establish the Alabama Democratic Conference, he was a member \nof the board of directors of the Alabama Legal Services Corporation; \nserved as president of the Colbert County League of Voters; a member of \nthe Council on Human Relations; a member of the board of directors of \nthe Young Volunteers in Action; and was chairman of the Board of \nStewards and a leader of the trustee board of his beloved Lesley Temple \nchurch in Tuscumbia.\n  After serving for 30 years as a chemical analyst with the Tennessee \nValley Authority, Mr. Long began a career as an advocate of the rights \nof the elderly. His record of accomplishment in this field was awesome. \nHis many, many years of tireless leadership in the North Alabama \ncommunity are unmatched in time and in scope. He commanded the respect \nof all those who met him and was one of the most hard-working, \ndedicated, and selfless individuals I have ever known. He was not only \nan exemplary citizen and community leader, but also a loving husband, \nfather, grandfather, and great-grandfather. As the patriarch of his \nfamily, he passed on his legacy of community involvement and concern \nfor others to his children and grandchildren.\n  One of the most moving stories about Mansel Long which I will always \ncherish is how he graduated from college in 1985 at the age of 81. He \nhad entered Alabama's Talladega College in 1925 at the age of 22 after \nworking 4 years to save enough money to pay his tuition. He studied \nbiology and chemistry there for more than 3\\1/2\\ years, but had to \nleave to take a job in order to help his family financially. Sixty \nyears later, his life-long goal of being a college graduate was \nfulfilled as he received his bachelor of arts degree.\n  Mansel Long was a prime example of those ideals that we hold dear in \nour country. He was a model to emulate and one of Tuscumbia's and \nAlabama's most revered citizens. He was a credit to his family, church, \ncommunity, state, and country who will be solely missed by all of those \nfortunate to have know him. His legacy of service and duty will serve \nas an inspiration to many future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3896-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3896-S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

The notices announce the issuance of final \nregulations on these matters with an effective date of April 16, 1996. \nThe Congressional Accountability Act specifies that the notices and \nregulations be printed in the Congressional Record. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that the notices and issued regulations be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \nExtension of Rights and Protections Under the Family and Medical Leave \n                              Act of 1993\n\n\n                NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n       On January 22, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance adopted and submitted for publication in the \n     Congressional Record final regulations implementing section \n     202 of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'') \n     (2 U.S.C.

On April 15, 1996, pursuant to section 304(c) of the \n     CAA, the House and the Senate agreed to resolutions approving \n     the final regulations. Specifically, the Senate agreed to S. \n     Res. 242, to provide for the approval of final regulations \n     that are applicable to the Senate and the employees of the \n     Senate; the House agreed to H.

\n     (CAA) (2 U.S.C. 1312) applies the rights and protections of \n     sections 101 through 105 of the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     of 1993 (FMLA) (29 U.S.C. 2611-2615) to covered employees. \n     (The term ``covered employee'' is defined in section 101(3) \n     of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1301(3)). See Sec. 825.800 of these \n     regulations for that definition.) The purpose of this part is \n     to set forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of \n     section 202 of the CAA.\n       (b) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors, \n     Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 202(d) and 304 of \n     the CAA, which direct the Board to promulgate regulations \n     implementing section 202 that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 202 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n     rights and protections under this section.'' The regulations \n     issued by the Board herein are on all matters for which \n     section 202 of the CAA requires regulations to be issued. \n     Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment, based on \n     the information available to it at the time of the \n     promulgation of these regulations, that, with the exception \n     of regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no \n     other ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary \n     of Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsection (a) [of section 202 of the CAA].''\n       (c) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n\n Subpart A--What is the Family and Medical Leave Act, and to Whom Does \n          it Apply under the Congressional Accountability Act?\n\n     Sec. 825.100  What is the Family and Medical Leave Act?\n       (a) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as \n     made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA), allows ``eligible'' employees of an employing office \n     to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued \n     it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 months \n     because of the birth of a child and to care for the newborn \n     child, because of the placement of a child with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, because the employee is needed \n     to care for a family member (child, spouse, or parent) \n     with a serious health condition, or because the employee's \n     own serious health condition makes the employee unable to \n     perform the functions of his or her job (see \n     Sec. 825.306(b)(4)). In certain cases, this leave may be \n     taken on an intermittent basis rather than all at once, or \n     the employee may work a part-time schedule.\n       (b) An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to have \n     health benefits maintained while on leave as if the employee \n     had continued to work instead of taking the leave. If an \n     employee was paying all or part of the premium payments prior \n     to leave, the employee would continue to pay his or her share \n     during the leave period. The employing office or a disbursing \n     or other financial office of the House of Representatives or \n     \\1\\ the Senate may recover its share only if the employee \n     does not return to work for a reason other than the serious \n     health condition of the employee or the employee's immediate \n     family member, or another reason beyond the employee's \n     control.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Italicized language is in only the House and \n     Instrumentalities versions of the regulations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (c) An employee generally has a right to return to the same \n     position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, \n     benefits and working conditions at the conclusion of the \n     leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of \n     any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.\n       (d) The employing office has a right to 30 days advance \n     notice from the employee where practicable. In addition, the \n     employing office may require an employee to submit \n     certification from a health care provider to substantiate \n     that the leave is due to the serious health condition of the \n     employee or the employee's immediate family member. Failure \n     to comply with these requirements may result in a delay in \n     the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly applied \n     policy, the employing office may also require that an \n     employee present a certification of fitness to return to work \n     when the absence was caused by the employee's serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.311(c)). The employing office may \n     delay restoring the employee to employment without such \n     certificate relating to the health condition which caused the \n     employee's absence.\n     Sec. 825.101  What is the purpose of the FMLA?\n       (a) FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance their \n     work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for \n     medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and \n     for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The FMLA is intended to balance the demands \n     of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the \n     stability and economic security of families, and to promote \n     national interests in preserving family integrity. It was \n     intended that the FMLA accomplish these purposes in a manner \n     that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers, and \n     in a manner consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment in minimizing the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex, while \n     promoting equal employment opportunity for men and women.\n       (b) The enactment of FMLA was predicated on two fundamental \n     concerns the needs of the American workforce, and the \n     development of high-performance organizations. Increasingly, \n     America's children and elderly are dependent upon family \n     members who must spend long hours at work. When a family \n     emergency arises, requiring workers to attend to seriously-\n     ill children or parents, or to newly-born or adopted infants, \n     or even to their own serious illness, workers need \n     reassurance that they will not be asked to choose between \n     continuing their employment, and meeting their personal and \n     family obligations or tending to vital needs at home.\n       (c) The FMLA is both intended and expected to benefit \n     employers as well as their employees. A direct correlation \n     exists between stability in the family and productivity in \n     the workplace. FMLA will encourage the development of high-\n     performance organizations. When workers can count on durable \n     links to their workplace they are able to make their own full \n     commitments to their jobs. The record of hearings on family \n     and medical leave indicate the powerful productive advantages \n     of stable workplace relationships, and the comparatively \n     small costs of guaranteeing that those relationships will not \n     be dissolved while workers attend to pressing family health \n     obligations or their own serious illness.\n     Sec. 825.102  When are the FMLA and the CAA effective for \n         covered employees and employing offices?\n       (a) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to certain Senate employees and \n     certain employing offices of the Senate since August 5, 1993 \n     (see section 501 of FMLA).\n       (b) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to any employee in an employment \n     position and any employment authority of the House of \n     Representatives since August 5, 1993 (see section 502 of \n     FMLA).\n       (c) The rights and protections of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to certain employing offices and \n     covered employees other than those referred to in paragraphs \n     (a) and (b) of this section for certain periods since August \n     5, 1993 (see, e.g., Title V of the FMLA, sections 501 and \n     502).\n       (d) The provisions of section 202 of the CAA that apply \n     rights and protections of the FMLA to covered employees are \n     effective on January 23, 1996.\n       (e) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee eligibility.\n     Sec. 825.103  How does the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n         CAA, affect leave in progress on, or taken before, the \n         effective date of the CAA?\n       (a) An eligible employee's right to take FMLA leave began \n     on the date that the rights and protections of the FMLA first \n     went into effect for the employing office and employee (see \n     Sec. 825.102(a)). Any leave taken prior to the date on which \n     the rights and protections of the FMLA first became effective \n     for the employing office from which the leave was taken may \n     not be counted for purposes of the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. If leave qualifying as FMLA leave was underway prior \n     to the effective date of the FMLA for the employing office \n     from which the leave was taken and continued after the FMLA's \n     effective date for that office, only that portion of leave \n     taken on or after the FMLA's effective date may be counted \n     against the employee's leave entitlement under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) If an employing office-approved leave is underway when \n     the application of the FMLA by the CAA takes effect, no \n     further notice would be required of the employee unless the \n     employee requests an extension of the leave. For leave which \n     commenced on the effective date or shortly thereafter, such \n     notice must have been given which was practicable, \n     considering the foreseeability of the need for leave and the \n     effective date.\n       (c) Starting on January 23, 1996, an employee is entitled \n     to FMLA leave under these regulations if the reason for the \n     leave is qualifying under the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, even if the event occasioning the need for leave (e.g., \n     the birth of a child) occurred before such date (so long as \n     any other requirements are satisfied).\n     Sec. 825.104  What employing offices are covered by the FMLA, \n         as made applicable by the CAA?\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, covers all \n     employing offices. As used in the CAA, the term ``employing \n     office'' means--\n       (1) the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator;\n       (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee;\n       (3) any other office headed by a person with the final \n     authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of the employment of an employee of \n     the House of Representatives or the Senate; or\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Capitol Police Board, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol, the Office of the Attending Physician, the \n     Office of Compliance, and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (b) [Reserved]\n       (c) Separate entities will be deemed to be parts of a \n     single employer for purposes of the FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA, if they meet the ``integrated employer'' test. A \n     determination of whether or not separate entities are an \n     integrated employer is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be reviewed in its totality. Factors considered in \n     determining whether two or more entities are an integrated \n     employer include:\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\n       (i) Common management;\n       (ii) Interrelation between operations;\n       (iii) Centralized control of labor relations; and\n       (iv) Degree of common financial control.\n     Sec. 825.105  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.106  How is ``joint employment'' treated under the \n         FMLA as made applicable by the CAA?\n       (a) Where two or more employing offices exercise some \n     control over the work or working conditions of the employee, \n     the employing offices may be joint employers under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. Where the employee performs work \n     which simultaneously benefits two or more employing offices, \n     or works for two or more employing offices at different times \n     during the workweek, a joint employment relationship \n     generally will be considered to exist in situations such as:\n       (1) Where there is an arrangement between employing offices \n     to share an employee's services or to interchange employees;\n       (2) Where one employing office acts directly or indirectly \n     in the interest of the other employing office in relation to \n     the employee; or\n       (3) Where the employing offices are not completely \n     disassociated with respect to the employee's employment and \n     may be deemed to share control of the employee, directly or \n     indirectly, because one employing office controls, is \n     controlled by, or is under common control with the other \n     employing office.\n       (b) A determination of whether or not a joint employment \n     relationship exists is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be viewed in its totality. For example, joint employment \n     will ordinarily be found to exist when:\n       (1) an employee, who is employed by an employing office \n     other than the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator, is under the actual \n     direction and control of the Member of the House of \n     Representatives or Senator; or\n       (2) two or more employing offices employ an individual to \n     work on common issues or other matters for both or all of \n     them.\n       (c) When employing offices employ a covered employee \n     jointly, they may designate one of themselves to be the \n     primary employing office, and the other or others to be the \n     secondary employing office(s). Such a designation shall be \n     made by written notice to the covered employee.\n       (d) If an employing office is designated a primary \n     employing office pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, \n     only that employing office is responsible for giving required \n     notices to the covered employee, providing FMLA leave, and \n     maintenance of health benefits. Job restoration is the \n     primary responsibility of the primary employing office, and \n     the secondary employing office(s) may, subject to the \n     limitations in Sec. 825.216, be responsible for accepting the \n     employee returning from FMLA leave.\n       (e) If employing offices employ an employee jointly, but \n     fail to designate a primary employing office pursuant to \n     paragraph (c) of this section, then all of these employing \n     offices shall be jointly and severally liable for giving \n     required notices to the employee, for providing FMLA leave, \n     for assuring that health benefits are maintained, and for job \n     restoration. The employee may give notice of need for FMLA \n     leave, as described in Sec. Sec. 825.302 and 825.303, to \n     whichever of these employing offices the employee chooses. If \n     the employee makes a written request for restoration to one \n     of these employing offices, that employing office shall be \n     primarily responsible for job restoration, and the other \n     employing office(s) may, subject to the limitations in \n     Sec. 825.216, be responsible for accepting the employee \n     returning from FMLA leave.\n     Sec. 825.107  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.108  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.109  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.110  Which employees are ``eligible'' to take FMLA \n         leave under these regulations?\n       (a) An ``eligible employee'' under these regulations means \n     a covered employee who has been employed in any employing \n     office for 12 months and for at least 1,250 hours of \n     employment during the previous 12 months.\n       (b) The 12 months an employee must have been employed by \n     any employing office need not be consecutive months. If an \n     employee worked for two or more employing offices \n     sequentially, the time worked will be aggregated to determine \n     whether it equals 12 months. If an employee is maintained on \n     the payroll for any part of a week, including any periods of \n     paid or unpaid leave (sick, vacation) during which other \n     benefits or compensation are provided by the employer (e.g., \n     workers' compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.), the \n     week counts as a week of employment. For purposes of \n     determining whether intermittent/occasional/casual employment \n     qualifies as ``at least 12 months,'' 52 weeks is deemed to be \n     equal to 12 months.\n       (c) If an employee was employed by two or more employing \n     offices, either sequentially or concurrently, the hours of \n     service will be aggregated to determine whether the minimum \n     of 1,250 hours has been reached. Whether an employee has \n     worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined \n     according to the principles established under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA) , as applied by section 203 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. 1313), for determining compensable hours of work. \n     The determining factor is the number of hours an employee \n     has worked for one or more employing offices. The \n     determination is not limited by methods of record-keeping, \n     or by compensation agreements that do not accurately \n     reflect all of the hours an employee has worked for or \n     been in service to the employing office. Any accurate \n     accounting of actual hours worked may be used. For this \n     purpose, full-time teachers (See Sec. 825.800 for \n     definition) of an elementary or secondary school system, \n     or institution of higher education, or other educational \n     establishment or institution are deemed to meet the 1,250 \n     hour test. An employing office must be able to clearly \n     demonstrate that such an employee did not work 1,250 hours \n     during the previous 12 months in order to claim that the \n     employee is not ``eligible'' for FMLA leave.\n       (d) The determinations of whether an employee has worked \n     for any employing office for at least 1,250 hours in the \n     previous 12 months and has been employed by any employing \n     office for a total of at least 12 months must be made as of \n     the date leave commences. The ``previous 12 months'' means \n     the 12 months immediately preceding the commencement of the \n     leave. If an employee notifies the employing office of need \n     for FMLA leave before the employee meets these eligibility \n     criteria, the employing office must either confirm the \n     employee's eligibility based upon a projection that the \n     employee will be eligible on the date leave would commence or \n     must advise the employee when the eligibility requirement is \n     met. If the employing office confirms eligibility at the time \n     the notice for leave is received, the employing office may \n     not subsequently challenge the employee's eligibility. In the \n     latter case, if the employing office does not advise the \n     employee whether the employee is eligible as soon as \n     practicable (i.e., two business days absent extenuating \n     circumstances) after the date employee eligibility is \n     determined, the employee will have satisfied the notice \n     requirements and the notice of leave is considered current \n     and outstanding until the employing office does advise. If \n     the employing office fails to advise the employee whether the \n     employee is eligible prior to the date the requested leave is \n     to commence, the employee will be deemed eligible. The \n     employing office may not, then, deny the leave. Where the \n     employee does not give notice of the need for leave more than \n     two business days prior to commencing leave, the employee \n     will be deemed to be eligible if the employing office fails \n     to advise the employee that the employee is not eligible \n     within two business days of receiving the employee's notice.\n       (e) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee's eligibility.\n       (f) [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.111  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.112  Under what kinds of circumstances are employing \n         offices required to grant family or medical leave?\n       (a) Employing offices are required to grant leave to \n     eligible employees:\n       (1) For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the \n     newborn child;\n       (2) For placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's \n     job.\n       (b) The right to take leave under FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA applies equally to male and female employees. A \n     father, as well as a mother, can take family leave for the \n     birth, placement for adoption or foster care of a child.\n       (c) Circumstances may require that FMLA leave begin before \n     the actual date of birth of a child. An expectant mother may \n     take FMLA leave pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section \n     before the birth of the child for prenatal care or if her \n     condition makes her unable to work.\n       (d) Employing offices are required to grant FMLA leave \n     pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section before the \n     actual placement or adoption of a child if an absence from \n     work is required for the placement for adoption or foster \n     care to proceed. For example, the employee may be required to \n     attend counseling sessions, appear in court, consult with his \n     or her attorney or the doctor(s) representing the birth \n     parent, or submit to a physical examination. The source of an \n     adopted child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement agency \n     or otherwise) is not a factor in determining eligibility for \n     leave for this purpose.\n       (e) Foster care is 24-hour care for children in \n     substitution for, and away from, their parents or guardian. \n     Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State \n     as a result of a voluntary agreement between the parent or \n     guardian that the child be removed from the home, or pursuant \n     to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, \n     and involves agreement between the State and foster family \n     that the foster family will take care of the child. Although \n     foster care may be with relatives of the child, State action \n     is involved in the removal of the child from parental \n     custody.\n       (f) In situations where the employer/employee relationship \n     has been interrupted, such as an employee who has been on \n     layoff, the employee must be recalled or otherwise be re-\n     employed before being eligible for FMLA leave. Under such \n     circumstances, an eligible employee is immediately entitled \n     to further FMLA leave for a qualifying reason.\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\n       (g) FMLA leave is available for treatment for substance \n     abuse provided the conditions of Sec. 825.114 are met. \n     However, treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an \n     employing office from taking employment action against an \n     employee. The employing office may not take action against \n     the employee because the employee has exercised his or her \n     right to take FMLA leave for treatment. However, if the \n     employing office has an established policy, applied in a non-\n     discriminatory manner that has been communicated to all \n     employees, that provides under certain circumstances an \n     employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to \n     that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the \n     employee is presently taking FMLA leave. An employee may also \n     take FMLA leave to care for an immediate family member who is \n     receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employing office \n     may not take action against an employee who is providing care \n     for an immediate family member receiving treatment for \n     substance abuse.\n     Sec. 825.113  What do ``spouse,'' ``parent,'' and ``son or \n         daughter'' mean for purposes of an employee qualifying to \n         take FMLA leave?\n       (a) Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized \n     under State law for purposes of marriage in the State where \n     the employee resides, including common law marriage in States \n     where it is recognized.\n       (b) Parent means a biological parent or an individual who \n     stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the \n     employee was a son or daughter as defined in (c) below. This \n     term does not include parents ``in law''.\n       (c) Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person \n     standing in loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age \n     18 or older and ``incapable of self-care because of a mental \n     or physical disability.''\n       (1) ``Incapable of self-care'' means that the individual \n     requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily \n     self-care in three or more of the ``activities of daily \n     living'' (ADLs) or ``instrumental activities of daily \n     living'' (IADLs). Activities of daily living include adaptive \n     activities such as caring appropriately for one's grooming \n     and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating. Instrumental \n     activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, \n     shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, \n     maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, \n     using a post office, etc.\n       (2) ``Physical or mental disability'' means a physical or \n     mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of \n     the major life activities of an individual. See the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by section \n     201(a)(3) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)).\n       (3) Persons who are ``in loco parentis'' include those with \n     day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially \n     support a child or, in the case of an employee, who had such \n     responsibility for the employee when the employee was a \n     child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.\n       (d) For purposes of confirmation of family relationship, \n     the employing office may require the employee giving notice \n     of the need for leave to provide reasonable documentation or \n     statement of family relationship. This documentation may take \n     the form of a simple statement from the employee, or a \n     child's birth certificate, a court document, etc. The \n     employing office is entitled to examine documentation such as \n     a birth certificate, etc., but the employee is entitled to \n     the return of the official document submitted for this \n     purpose.\n     Sec. 825.114  What is a ``serious health condition'' \n         entitling an employee to FMLA leave?\n       (a) For purposes of FMLA, ``serious health condition'' \n     entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:\n       (1) Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, \n     hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any \n     period of incapacity (for purposes of this section, defined \n     to mean inability to work, attend school or perform other \n     regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom), or any subsequent \n     treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or\n       (2) Continuing treatment by a health care provider. A \n     serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a \n     health care provider includes any one or more of the \n     following:\n       (i) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery \n     therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days, and \n     any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to \n     the same condition, that also involves:\n       (A) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (B) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       (ii) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (iii) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (A) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care \n     provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider;\n       (B) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (C) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (iv) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the continuing \n     supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment \n     by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (v) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (b) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section \n     includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if \n     a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the \n     condition. Treatment does not include routine physical \n     examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. Under \n     paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B), a regimen of continuing treatment \n     includes, for example, a course of prescription medication \n     (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment \n     to resolve or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). \n     A regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of \n     over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, \n     or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, \n     headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia \n     problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of \n     conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious \n     health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. \n     Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or \n     removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions \n     provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. \n     Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be \n     serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of \n     this section are met.\n       (d) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (e) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) qualify for FMLA leave even though the \n     employee or the immediate family member does not receive \n     treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and \n     even if the absence does not last more than three days. For \n     example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for \n     work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the \n     employee's health care provider has advised the employee to \n     stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An \n     employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work \n     because of severe morning sickness.\n     Sec. 825.115  What does it mean that ``the employee is unable \n         to perform the functions of the position of the \n         employee''?\n       An employee is ``unable to perform the functions of the \n     position'' where the health care provider finds that the \n     employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any \n     one of the essential functions of the employee's position \n     within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA), as made applicable by section 201(a)(3) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)). An employee who must be absent from work \n     to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition \n     is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions \n     of the position during the absence for treatment. An \n     employing office has the option, in requiring certification \n     from a health care provider, to provide a statement of the \n     essential functions of the employee's position for the health \n     care provider to review. For purposes of FMLA, the essential \n     functions of the employee's position are to be determined \n     with reference to the position the employee held at the time \n     notice is given or leave commenced, whichever is earlier.\n     Sec. 825.116  What does it mean that an employee is ``needed \n         to care for'' a family member?\n       (a) The medical certification provision that an employee is \n     ``needed to care for'' a family member encompasses both \n     physical and psychological care. It includes situations\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\n     where, for example, because of a serious health condition, \n     the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic \n     medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is \n     unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor, etc. \n     The term also includes providing psychological comfort and \n     reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or \n     parent with a serious health condition who is receiving \n     inpatient or home care.\n       (b) The term also includes situations where the employee \n     may be needed to fill in for others who are caring for the \n     family member, or to make arrangements for changes in care, \n     such as transfer to a nursing home.\n       (c) An employee's intermittent leave or a reduced leave \n     schedule necessary to care for a family member includes not \n     only a situation where the family member's condition itself \n     is intermittent, but also where the employee is only needed \n     intermittently--such as where other care is normally \n     available, or care responsibilities are shared with another \n     member of the family or a third party.\n     Sec. 825.117  For an employee seeking intermittent FMLA leave \n         or leave on a reduced leave schedule, what is meant by \n         ``the medical necessity for'' such leave?\n       For intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave \n     schedule, there must be a medical need for leave (as \n     distinguished from voluntary treatments and procedures) and \n     it must be that such medical need can be best accommodated \n     through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. The \n     treatment regimen and other information described in the \n     certification of a serious health condition (See \n     Sec. 825.306) meets the requirement for certification of the \n     medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule. Employees needing intermittent FMLA leave or \n     leave on a reduced leave schedule must attempt to schedule \n     their leave so as not to disrupt the employing office's \n     operations. In addition, an employing office may assign an \n     employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and \n     benefits that better accommodates the employee's intermittent \n     or reduced leave schedule.\n     Sec. 825.118  What is a ``health care provider''?\n       (a)(1) The term ``health care provider'' means:\n       (i) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to \n     practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in \n     which the doctor practices; or\n       (ii) Any other person determined by the Office of \n     Compliance to be capable of providing health care services.\n       (2) In making a determination referred to in subparagraph \n     (1)(ii), and absent good cause shown to do otherwise, the \n     Office of Compliance will follow any determination made by \n     the Secretary of Labor (under section 101(6)(B) of the FMLA, \n     29 U.S.C. 2611(6)(B)) that a person is capable of providing \n     health care services, provided the Secretary s determination \n     was not made at the request of a person who was then a \n     covered employee.\n       (b) Others ``capable of providing health care services'' \n     include only:\n       (1) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, \n     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment \n     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a \n     subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to \n     practice in the State and performing within the scope of \n     their practice as defined under State law;\n       (2) Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social \n     workers who are authorized to practice under State law and \n     who are performing within the scope of their practice as \n     defined under State law;\n       (3) Christian Science practitioners listed with the First \n     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. Where \n     an employee or family member is receiving treatment from a \n     Christian Science practitioner, an employee may not object to \n     any requirement from an employing office that the employee or \n     family member submit to examination (though not treatment) to \n     obtain a second or third certification from a health care \n     provider other than a Christian Science practitioner \n     except as otherwise provided under applicable State or \n     local law or collective bargaining agreement.\n       (4) Any health care provider from whom an employing office \n     or the employing office's group health plan's benefits \n     manager will accept certification of the existence of a \n     serious health condition to substantiate a claim for \n     benefits; and\n       (5) A health care provider listed above who practices in a \n     country other than the United States, who is authorized to \n     practice in accordance with the law of that country, and who \n     is performing within the scope of his or her practice as \n     defined under such law.\n       (c) The phrase ``authorized to practice in the State'' as \n     used in this section means that the provider must be \n     authorized to diagnose and treat physical or mental health \n     conditions without supervision by a doctor or other health \n     care provider.\n\n\nSubpart B--What Leave Is an Employee Entitled to Take under the Family \n    and Medical Leave Act, as Made Applicable by the Congressional \n                          Accountability Act?\n\n     Sec. 825.200  How much leave may an employee take?\n       (a) An eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement is \n     limited to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-\n     month period for any one, or more, of the following reasons:\n       (1) The birth of the employee's son or daughter, and to \n     care for the newborn child;\n       (2) The placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed \n     child;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and,\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of his or her job.\n       (b) An employing office is permitted to choose any one of \n     the following methods for determining the ``12-month period'' \n     in which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement occurs:\n       (1) The calendar year;\n       (2) Any fixed 12-month ``leave year,'' such as a fiscal \n     year or a year starting on an employee's ``anniversary'' \n     date;\n       (3) The 12-month period measured forward from the date any \n     employee's first FMLA leave begins; or\n       (4) A ``rolling'' 12-month period measured backward from \n     the date an employee uses any FMLA leave (except that such \n     measure may not extend back before the date on which the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections first becomes \n     effective for the employing office; see Sec. 825.102).\n       (c) Under methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this \n     section an employee would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave at any time in the fixed 12-month period selected. \n     An employee could, therefore, take 12 weeks of leave at the \n     end of the year and 12 weeks at the beginning of the \n     following year. Under the method in paragraph (b)(3) of this \n     section, an employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave \n     during the year beginning on the first date FMLA leave is \n     taken; the next 12-month period would begin the first time \n     FMLA leave is taken after completion of any previous 12-month \n     period. Under the method in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, \n     the ``rolling'' 12-month period, each time an employee takes \n     FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any \n     balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the \n     immediately preceding 12 months. For example, if an \n     employee has taken eight weeks of leave during the past 12 \n     months, an additional four weeks of leave could be taken. \n     If an employee used four weeks beginning February 1, 1997, \n     four weeks beginning June 1, 1997, and four weeks \n     beginning December 1, 1997, the employee would not be \n     entitled to any additional leave until February 1, 1998. \n     However, beginning on February 1, 1998, the employee would \n     be entitled to four weeks of leave, on June 1 the employee \n     would be entitled to an additional four weeks, etc.\n       (d)(1) Employing offices will be allowed to choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section provided \n     the alternative chosen is applied consistently and uniformly \n     to all employees. An employing office wishing to change to \n     another alternative is required to give at least 60 days \n     notice to all employees, and the transition must take place \n     in such a way that the employees retain the full benefit of \n     12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords the greatest \n     benefit to the employee. Under no circumstances may a new \n     method be implemented in order to avoid the CAA's FMLA leave \n     requirements.\n       (2) [Reserved]\n       (e) If an employing office fails to select one of the \n     options in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the \n     12-month period, the option that provides the most beneficial \n     outcome for the employee will be used. The employing office \n     may subsequently select an option only by providing the 60-\n     day notice to all employees of the option the employing \n     office intends to implement. During the running of the 60-day \n     period any other employee who needs FMLA leave may use the \n     option providing the most beneficial outcome to that \n     employee. At the conclusion of the 60-day period the \n     employing office may implement the selected option.\n       (f) For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by \n     an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the \n     week taken as FMLA leave has no effect; the week is counted \n     as a week of FMLA leave. However, if for some reason the \n     employing office's activity has temporarily ceased and \n     employees generally are not expected to report for work for \n     one or more weeks (e.g., a school closing two weeks for the \n     Christmas/New Year holiday or the summer vacation or an \n     employing office closing the office for repairs), the days \n     the employing office's activities have ceased do not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Methods for \n     determining an employee's 12-week leave entitlement are also \n     described in Sec. 825.205.\n       (g)(1) If employing offices jointly employ an employee, and \n     if they designate a primary employer pursuant to \n     Sec. 825.106(c), the primary employer may choose any one of \n     the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for \n     measuring the 12-month period, provided that the alternative \n     chosen is applied consistently and uniformly to all employees \n     of the primary employer including the jointly employed \n     employee.\n       (2) If employing offices fail to designated a primary \n     employer pursuant to Sec. 825.106(c), an employee jointly \n     employed by the employing offices may, by so notifying one of \n     the employing offices, select that employing office to be the \n     primary employer of the employee for purposes of the \n     application of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.\n     Sec. 825.201  If leave is taken for the birth of a child, or \n         for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n         when must the leave be concluded?\n       An employee's entitlement to leave for a birth or placement \n     for adoption or foster\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\n     care expires at the end of the 12-month period beginning on \n     the date of the birth or placement, unless the employing \n     office permits leave to be taken for a longer period. Any \n     such FMLA leave must be concluded within this one-year \n     period.\n     Sec. 825.202  How much leave may a husband and wife take if \n         they are employed by the same employing office?\n       (a) A husband and wife who are eligible for FMLA leave and \n     are employed by the same employing office may be limited to a \n     combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken:\n       (1) for birth of the employee's son or daughter or to care \n     for the child after birth;\n       (2) for placement of a son or daughter with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after \n     placement; or\n       (3) to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition.\n       (b) This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to \n     leave taken for the reasons specified in paragraph (a) of \n     this section as long as a husband and wife are employed by \n     the ``same employing office.'' It would apply, for example, \n     even though the spouses are employed at two different \n     worksites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one \n     spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would \n     be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\n       (c) Where the husband and wife both use a portion of the \n     total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for one of the purposes \n     in paragraph (a) of this section, the husband and wife would \n     each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or \n     she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for a \n     purpose other than those contained in paragraph (a) of this \n     section. For example, if each spouse took 6 weeks of leave to \n     care for a healthy, newborn child, each could use an \n     additional 6 weeks due to his or her own serious health \n     condition or to care for a child with a serious health \n     condition.\n     Sec. 825.203  Does FMLA leave have to be taken all at once, \n         or can it be taken in parts?\n       (a) FMLA leave may be taken ``intermittently or on a \n     reduced leave schedule'' under certain circumstances. \n     Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of \n     time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave \n     schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual \n     number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A \n     reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule \n     for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time.\n       (b) When leave is taken after the birth or placement of a \n     child for adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the \n     employing office agrees. Such a schedule reduction might \n     occur, for example, where an employee, with the employing \n     office's agreement, works part-time after the birth of a \n     child, or takes leave in several segments. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required, however, for leave during \n     which the mother has a serious health condition in connection \n     with the birth of her child or if the newborn child has a \n     serious health condition.\n       (c) Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave \n     schedule when medically necessary for planned and/or \n     unanticipated medical treatment of a related serious health \n     condition by or under the supervision of a health care \n     provider, or for recovery from treatment or recovery from a \n     serious health condition. It may also be taken to provide \n     care or psychological comfort to an immediate family member \n     with a serious health condition.\n       (1) Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health \n     condition which requires treatment by a health care provider \n     periodically, rather than for one continuous period of \n     time, and may include leave of periods from an hour or \n     more to several weeks. Examples of intermittent leave \n     would include leave taken on an occasional basis for \n     medical appointments, or leave taken several days at a \n     time spread over a period of six months, such as for \n     chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may take leave \n     intermittently for prenatal examinations or for her own \n     condition, such as for periods of severe morning sickness. \n     An example of an employee taking leave on a reduced leave \n     schedule is an employee who is recovering from a serious \n     health condition and is not strong enough to work a full-\n     time schedule.\n       (2) Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for \n     absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated \n     or unable to perform the essential functions of the position \n     because of a chronic serious health condition even if he or \n     she does not receive treatment by a health care provider.\n       (d) There is no limit on the size of an increment of leave \n     when an employee takes intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule. However, an employing office may \n     limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that \n     the employing office's payroll system uses to account for \n     absences or use of leave, provided it is one hour or less. \n     For example, an employee might take two hours off for a \n     medical appointment, or might work a reduced day of four \n     hours over a period of several weeks while recuperating from \n     an illness. An employee may not be required to take more FMLA \n     leave than necessary to address the circumstance that \n     precipitated the need for the leave, except as provided in \n     Sec. Sec. 825.601 and 825.602.\n     Sec. 825.204  May an employing office transfer an employee to \n         an ``alternative position'' in order to accommodate \n         intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule?\n       (a) If an employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment for the employee or a family member, \n     including during a period of recovery from a serious health \n     condition, or if the employing office agrees to permit \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a \n     child or for placement of a child for adoption or foster \n     care, the employing office may require the employee to \n     transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule is required, to an available \n     alternative position for which the employee is qualified and \n     which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than \n     does the employee's regular position. See Sec. 825.601 for \n     special rules applicable to instructional employees of \n     schools.\n       (b) Transfer to an alternative position may require \n     compliance with any applicable collective bargaining \n     agreement and any applicable law (such as the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to \n     an alternative position may include altering an existing job \n     to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent or \n     reduced leave.\n       (c) The alternative position must have equivalent pay and \n     benefits. An alternative position for these purposes does not \n     have to have equivalent duties. The employing office may \n     increase the pay and benefits of an existing alternative \n     position, so as to make them equivalent to the pay and \n     benefits of the employee's regular job. The employing office \n     may also transfer the employee to a part-time job with the \n     same hourly rate of pay and benefits, provided the employee \n     is not required to take more leave than is medically \n     necessary. For example, an employee desiring to take leave in \n     increments of four hours per day could be transferred to a \n     half-time job, or could remain in the employee's same job on \n     a part-time schedule, paying the same hourly rate as \n     the employee's previous job and enjoying the same \n     benefits. The employing office may not eliminate benefits \n     which otherwise would not be provided to part-time \n     employees; however, an employing office may \n     proportionately reduce benefits such as vacation leave \n     where an employing office's normal practice is to base \n     such benefits on the number of hours worked.\n       (d) An employing office may not transfer the employee to an \n     alternative position in order to discourage the employee from \n     taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee. \n     For example, a white collar employee may not be assigned to \n     perform laborer's work; an employee working the day shift may \n     not be reassigned to the graveyard shift; an employee working \n     in the headquarters facility may not be reassigned to a \n     branch a significant distance away from the employee's normal \n     job location. Any such attempt on the part of the employing \n     office to make such a transfer will be held to be contrary to \n     the prohibited-acts provisions of the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) When an employee who is taking leave intermittently or \n     on a reduced leave schedule and has been transferred to an \n     alternative position no longer needs to continue on leave and \n     is able to return to full-time work, the employee must be \n     placed in the same or equivalent job as the job he/she left \n     when the leave commenced. An employee may not be required to \n     take more leave than necessary to address the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave.\n     Sec. 825.205  How does one determine the amount of leave used \n         where an employee takes leave intermittently or on a \n         reduced leave schedule?\n       (a) If an employee takes leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule, only the amount of leave actually \n     taken may be counted toward the 12 weeks of leave to which an \n     employee is entitled. For example, if an employee who \n     normally works five days a week takes off one day, the \n     employee would use 1/5 of a week of FMLA leave. Similarly, if \n     a full-time employee who normally works 8-hour days works 4-\n     hour days under a reduced leave schedule, the employee would \n     use \\1/2\\ week of FMLA leave each week.\n       (b) Where an employee normally works a part-time schedule \n     or variable hours, the amount of leave to which an employee \n     is entitled is determined on a pro rata or proportional basis \n     by comparing the new schedule with the employee's normal \n     schedule. For example, if an employee who normally works 30 \n     hours per week works only 20 hours a week under a reduced \n     leave schedule, the employee's ten hours of leave would \n     constitute one-third of a week of FMLA leave for each week \n     the employee works the reduced leave schedule.\n       (c) If an employing office has made a permanent or long-\n     term change in the employee's schedule (for reasons other \n     than FMLA, and prior to the notice of need for FMLA leave), \n     the hours worked under the new schedule are to be used for \n     making this calculation.\n       (d) If an employee's schedule varies from week to week, a \n     weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 weeks prior to \n     the beginning of the leave period would be used for \n     calculating the employee's normal workweek.\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\n     Sec. 825.206  May an employing office deduct hourly amounts \n         from an employee's salary, when providing unpaid leave \n         under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, without \n         affecting the employee's qualification for exemption as \n         an executive, administrative, or professional employee, \n         or when utilizing the fluctuating workweek method for \n         payment of overtime, under the Fair Labor Standards Act?\n       (a) Leave taken under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     may be unpaid. If an employee is otherwise exempt from \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), as made applicable by the CAA, as a \n     salaried executive, administrative, or professional employee \n     (under regulations issued by the Board, at part 541), \n     providing unpaid FMLA-qualifying leave to such an employee \n     will not cause the employee to lose the FLSA exemption. \n     This means that under regulations currently in effect, \n     where an employee meets the specified duties test, is paid \n     on a salary basis, and is paid a salary of at least the \n     amount specified in the regulations, the employing office \n     may make deductions from the employee's salary for any \n     hours taken as intermittent or reduced FMLA leave within a \n     workweek, without affecting the exempt status of the \n     employee. The fact that an employing office provides FMLA \n     leave, whether paid or unpaid, or maintains any records \n     regarding FMLA leave, will not be relevant to the \n     determination whether an employee is exempt within the \n     meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541.\n       (b) For an employee paid in accordance with a fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime, where permitted by \n     section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), the employing office, \n     during the period in which intermittent or reduced schedule \n     FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may compensate an \n     employee on an hourly basis and pay only for the hours the \n     employee works, including time and one-half the employee's \n     regular rate for overtime hours. The change to payment on an \n     hourly basis would include the entire period during which the \n     employee is taking intermittent leave, including weeks in \n     which no leave is taken. The hourly rate shall be determined \n     by dividing the employee's weekly salary by the employee's \n     normal or average schedule of hours worked during weeks in \n     which FMLA leave is not being taken. If an employing office \n     chooses to follow this exception from the fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment, the employing office must do so \n     uniformly, with respect to all employees paid on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis for whom FMLA leave is taken on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis. If an employing \n     office does not elect to convert the employee's compensation \n     to hourly pay, no deduction may be taken for FMLA leave \n     absences. Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled \n     leave is over, the employee may be restored to payment on a \n     fluctuating work week basis.\n       (c) This special exception to the ``salary basis'' \n     requirements of the FLSA exemption or fluctuating workweek \n     payment requirements applies only to employees of employing \n     offices who are eligible for FMLA leave, and to leave which \n     qualifies as (one of the four types of) FMLA leave. Hourly or \n     other deductions which are not in accordance with the Board's \n     regulations at part 541 or with a permissible fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime may not be taken, for \n     example, where the employee has not worked long enough to be \n     eligible for FMLA leave without potentially affecting the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption. Nor may deductions \n     which are not permitted by the Board's regulations at part \n     541 or by a permissible fluctuating workweek method of \n     payment for overtime be taken from such an employee's salary \n     for any leave which does not qualify as FMLA leave, for \n     example, deductions from an employee's pay for leave required \n     under an employing office's policy or practice for a reason \n     which does not qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to care for \n     a grandparent or for a medical condition which does not \n     qualify as a serious health condition; or for leave which is \n     more generous than provided by FMLA as made applicable by the \n     CAA, such as leave in excess of 12 weeks in a year. The \n     employing office may comply with the employing office's own \n     policy practice under these circumstances and maintain the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption or for the fluctuating \n     workweek method of pay by not taking hourly deductions from \n     the employee's pay, in accordance with FLSA requirements, or \n     may take such deductions, treating the employee as an \n     ``hourly'' employee and pay overtime premium pay for hours \n     worked over 40 in a workweek.\n     Sec. 825.207  Is FMLA leave paid or unpaid?\n       (a) Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid. However, under the \n     circumstances described in this section, FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, permits an eligible employee to choose \n     to substitute paid leave for FMLA leave. If an employee does \n     not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, the employing \n     office may require the employee to substitute accrued paid \n     leave for FMLA leave.\n       (b) Where an employee has earned or accrued paid vacation, \n     personal or family leave, that paid leave may be substituted \n     for all or part of any (otherwise) unpaid FMLA leave relating \n     to birth, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The term ``family leave'' as used in FMLA \n     refers to paid leave provided by the employing office \n     covering the particular circumstances for which the employee \n     seeks leave for either the birth of a child and to care for \n     such child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health \n     condition. For example, if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows use of family leave to care for a child but not for a \n     parent, the employing office is not required to allow accrued \n     family leave to be substituted for FMLA leave used to care \n     for a parent.\n       (c) Substitution of paid accrued vacation, personal, or \n     medical/sick leave may be made for any (otherwise) unpaid \n     FMLA leave needed to care for a family member or the \n     employee's own serious health condition. Substitution of paid \n     sick/medical leave may be elected to the extent the \n     circumstances meet the employing office's usual requirements \n     for the use of sick/medical leave. An employing office is not \n     required to allow substitution of paid sick or medical leave \n     for unpaid FMLA leave ``in any situation'' where the \n     employing office's uniform policy would not normally allow \n     such paid leave. An employee, therefore, has a right to \n     substitute paid medical/sick leave to care for a seriously \n     ill family member only if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows paid leave to be used for that purpose. Similarly, an \n     employee does not have a right to substitute paid medical/\n     sick leave for a serious health condition which is not \n     covered by the employing office's leave plan.\n       (d)(1) Disability leave for the birth of a child would be \n     considered FMLA leave for a serious health condition and \n     counted in the 12 weeks of leave permitted under FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA. Because the leave pursuant to a \n     temporary disability benefit plan is not unpaid, the \n     provision for substitution of paid leave is inapplicable. \n     However, the employing office may designate the leave as FMLA \n     leave and count the leave as running concurrently for \n     purposes of both the benefit plan and the FMLA leave \n     entitlement. If the requirements to qualify for payments \n     pursuant to the employing office's temporary disability plan \n     are more stringent than those of FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, the employee must meet the more stringent \n     requirements of the plan, or may choose not to meet the \n     requirements of the plan and instead receive no payments from \n     the plan and use unpaid FMLA leave or substitute available \n     accrued paid leave.\n       (2) The FMLA as made applicable by the CAA provides that a \n     serious health condition may result from injury to the \n     employee ``on or off'' the job. If the employing office \n     designates the leave as FMLA leave in accordance with \n     Sec. 825.208, the employee's FMLA 12-week leave entitlement \n     may run concurrently with a workers' compensation absence \n     when the injury is one that meets the criteria for a serious \n     health condition. As the workers' compensation absence is not \n     unpaid leave, the provision for substitution of the \n     employee's accrued paid leave is not applicable. However, if \n     the health care provider treating the employee for the \n     workers' compensation injury certifies the employee is able \n     to return to a ``light duty job'' but is unable to return to \n     the same or equivalent job, the employee may decline the \n     employing office's offer of a ``light duty job''. As a \n     result the employee may lose workers' compensation \n     payments, but is entitled to remain on unpaid FMLA leave \n     until the 12-week entitlement is exhausted. As of the date \n     workers' compensation benefits cease, the substitution \n     provision becomes applicable and either the employee may \n     elect or the employing office may require the use of \n     accrued paid leave. See also Sec. Sec. 825.210(f), \n     825.216(d), 825.220(d), 825.307(a)(1) and 825.702 (d) (1) \n     and (2) regarding the relationship between workers' \n     compensation absences and FMLA leave.\n       (e) Paid vacation or personal leave, including leave earned \n     or accrued under plans allowing ``paid time off,'' may be \n     substituted, at either the employee's or the employing \n     office's option, for any qualified FMLA leave. No limitations \n     may be placed by the employing office on substitution of paid \n     vacation or personal leave for these purposes.\n       (f) If neither the employee nor the employing office elects \n     to substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave under the \n     above conditions and circumstances, the employee will remain \n     entitled to all the paid leave which is earned or accrued \n     under the terms of the employing office's plan.\n       (g) If an employee uses paid leave under circumstances \n     which do not qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will not count \n     against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave to which the employee is \n     entitled. For example, paid sick leave used for a medical \n     condition which is not a serious health condition does not \n     count against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (h) When an employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid leave (of any type) for unpaid FMLA leave \n     under circumstances permitted by these regulations, and the \n     employing office's procedural requirements for taking that \n     kind of leave are less stringent than the requirements of \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA (e.g., notice or \n     certification requirements), only the less stringent \n     requirements may be imposed. An employee who complies with an \n     employing office's less stringent leave plan requirements in \n     such cases may not have leave for an FMLA purpose delayed or \n     denied on the grounds that the employee has not complied with \n     stricter requirements of FMLA as made applicable by the CAA. \n     However, where accrued paid vacation or personal leave is \n     substituted for\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\n     unpaid FMLA leave for a serious health condition, an employee \n     may be required to comply with any less stringent medical \n     certification requirements of the employing office's sick \n     leave program. See Sec. Sec. 825.302(g), 825.305(e) and \n     825.306(c).\n       (i) Compensatory time off, if any is authorized under \n     applicable law, is not a form of accrued paid leave that an \n     employing office may require the employee to substitute for \n     unpaid FMLA leave. The employee may request to use his/her \n     balance of compensatory time for an FMLA reason. If the \n     employing office permits the accrual of compensatory time to \n     be used in compliance with applicable Board regulations, the \n     absence which is paid from the employee's accrued \n     compensatory time ``account'' may not be counted against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n     Sec. 825.208  Under what circumstances may an employing \n         office designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA leave \n         and, as a result, enable leave to be counted against the \n         employee's total FMLA leave entitlement?\n       (a) In all circumstances, it is the employing office's \n     responsibility to designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-\n     qualifying, and to give notice of the designation to the \n     employee as provided in this section. In the case of \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule, only one \n     such notice is required unless the circumstances regarding \n     the leave have changed. The employing office's designation \n     decision must be based only on information received from the \n     employee or the employee's spokesperson (e.g., if the \n     employee is incapacitated, the employee's spouse, \n     adult child, parent, doctor, etc., may provide notice to \n     the employing office of the need to take FMLA leave). In \n     any circumstance where the employing office does not have \n     sufficient information about the reason for an employee's \n     use of paid leave, the employing office should inquire \n     further of the employee or the spokesperson to ascertain \n     whether the paid leave is potentially FMLA- qualifying.\n       (1) An employee giving notice of the need for unpaid FMLA \n     leave must explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to \n     allow the employing office to determine that the leave \n     qualifies under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If \n     the employee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be \n     denied. In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a \n     request to use paid leave, especially when the need for the \n     leave was unexpected or unforeseen, an employee will provide \n     sufficient information for the employing office to designate \n     the paid leave as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid \n     leave, especially vacation or personal leave, may in some \n     cases not spontaneously explain the reasons or their plans \n     for using their accrued leave.\n       (2) As noted in Sec. 825.302(c), an employee giving notice \n     of the need for unpaid FMLA leave does not need to expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA or \n     even mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation to \n     provide notice, though the employee would need to state a \n     qualifying reason for the needed leave. An employee \n     requesting or notifying the employing office of an intent to \n     use accrued paid leave, even if for a purpose covered by \n     FMLA, would not need to assert such right either. However, if \n     an employee requesting to use paid leave for an FMLA-\n     qualifying purpose does not explain the reason for the leave \n     consistent with the employing office's established policy or \n     practice and the employing office denies the employee's \n     request, the employee will need to provide sufficient \n     information to establish an FMLA-qualifying reason for the \n     needed leave so that the employing office is aware of the \n     employee's entitlement (i.e., that the leave may not be \n     denied) and, then, may designate that the paid leave be \n     appropriately counted against (substituted for) the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement. Similarly, an employee using \n     accrued paid vacation leave who seeks an extension of unpaid \n     leave for an FMLA-qualifying purpose will need to state the \n     reason. If this is due to an event which occurred during the \n     period of paid leave, the employing office may count the \n     leave used after the FMLA-qualifying event against the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement.\n       (b)(1) Once the employing office has acquired knowledge \n     that the leave is being taken for an FMLA required reason, \n     the employing office must promptly (within two business days \n     absent extenuating circumstances) notify the employee that \n     the paid leave is designated and will be counted as FMLA \n     leave. If there is a dispute between an employing office and \n     an employee as to whether paid leave qualifies as FMLA leave, \n     it should be resolved through discussions between the \n     employee and the employing office. Such discussions and the \n     decision must be documented.\n       (2) The employing office's notice to the employee that the \n     leave has been designated as FMLA leave may be orally or in \n     writing. If the notice is oral, it shall be confirmed in \n     writing, no later than the following payday (unless the \n     payday is less than one week after the oral notice, in which \n     case the notice must be no later than the subsequent payday). \n     The written notice may be in any form, including a notation \n     on the employee's pay stub.\n       (c) If the employing office requires paid leave to be \n     substituted for unpaid leave, or that paid leave taken under \n     an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, this \n     decision must be made by the employing office within two \n     business days of the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for leave, or, where the employing office does not \n     initially have sufficient information to make a \n     determination, when the employing office determines that the \n     leave qualifies as FMLA leave if this happens later. The \n     employing office's designation must be made before the leave \n     starts, unless the employing office does not have sufficient \n     information as to the employee's reason for taking the leave \n     until after the leave commenced. If the employing office has \n     the requisite knowledge to make a determination that the paid \n     leave is for an FMLA reason at the time the employee either \n     gives notice of the need for leave or commences leave and \n     fails to designate the leave as FMLA leave (and so notify the \n     employee in accordance with paragraph (b)), the employing \n     office may not designate leave as FMLA leave retroactively, \n     and may designate only prospectively as of the date of \n     notification to the employee of the designation. In such \n     circumstances, the employee is subject to the full \n     protections of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, but \n     none of the absence preceding the notice to the employee of \n     the designation may be counted against the employee's 12-week \n     FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (d) If the employing office learns that leave is for an \n     FMLA purpose after leave has begun, such as when an employee \n     gives notice of the need for an extension of the paid leave \n     with unpaid FMLA leave, the entire or some portion of the \n     paid leave period may be retroactively counted as FMLA leave, \n     to the extent that the leave period qualified as FMLA leave. \n     For example, an employee is granted two weeks paid vacation \n     leave for a skiing trip. In mid-week of the second week, the \n     employee contacts the employing office for an extension of \n     leave as unpaid leave and advises that at the beginning of \n     the second week of paid vacation leave the employee suffered \n     a severe accident requiring hospitalization. The employing \n     office may notify the employee that both the extension and \n     the second week of paid vacation leave (from the date of the \n     injury) is designated as FMLA leave. On the other hand, when \n     the employee takes sick leave that turns into a serious \n     health condition (e.g., bronchitis that turns into bronchial \n     pneumonia) and the employee gives notice of the need for an \n     extension of leave, the entire period of the serious health \n     condition may be counted as FMLA leave.\n       (e) Employing offices may not designate leave as FMLA leave \n     after the employee has returned to work with two exceptions:\n       (1) If the employee was absent for an FMLA reason and the \n     employing office did not learn the reason for the absence \n     until the employee's return (e.g., where the employee was \n     absent for only a brief period), the employing office may, \n     upon the employee's return to work, promptly (within two \n     business days of the employee's return to work) designate the \n     leave retroactively with appropriate notice to the employee. \n     If leave is taken for an FMLA reason but the employing office \n     was not aware of the reason, and the employee desires that \n     the leave be counted as FMLA leave, the employee must notify \n     the employing office within two business days of returning to \n     work of the reason for the leave. In the absence of such \n     timely notification by the employee, the employee may not \n     subsequently assert FMLA protections for the absence.\n       (2) If the employing office knows the reason for the leave \n     but has not been able to confirm that the leave qualifies \n     under FMLA, or where the employing office has requested \n     medical certification which has not yet been received or the \n     parties are in the process of obtaining a second or third \n     medical opinion, the employing office should make a \n     preliminary designation, and so notify the employee, at the \n     time leave begins, or as soon as the reason for the leave \n     becomes known. Upon receipt of the requisite information from \n     the employee or of the medical certification which confirms \n     the leave is for an FMLA reason, the preliminary designation \n     becomes final. If the medical certifications fail to confirm \n     that the reason for the absence was an FMLA reason, the \n     employing office must withdraw the designation (with written \n     notice to the employee).\n       (f) If, before beginning employment with an employing \n     office, an employee had been employed by another employing \n     office, the subsequent employing office may count against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement FMLA leave taken from the \n     prior employing office, except that, if the FMLA leave began \n     after the effective of these regulations (or if the FMLA \n     leave was subject to other applicable requirement under which \n     the employing office was to have designated the leave as FMLA \n     leave), the prior employing office must have properly \n     designated the leave as FMLA under these regulations or other \n     applicable requirement.\n     Sec. 825.209  Is an employee entitled to benefits while using \n         FMLA leave?\n       (a) During any FMLA leave, the employing office must \n     maintain the employee's coverage under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program or any group health plan (as defined \n     in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) \n     on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided \n     if the employee had been continuously employed during the \n     entire leave period. All employing offices are subject to the \n     requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to \n     maintain health coverage. The definition of ``group health \n     plan'' is set forth in Sec. 825.800. For purposes of FMLA, \n     the term\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\n     ``group health plan'' shall not include an insurance program \n     providing health coverage under which employees purchase \n     individual policies from insurers provided that:\n       (1) no contributions are made by the employing office;\n       (2) participation in the program is completely voluntary \n     for employees;\n       (3) the sole functions of the employing office with respect \n     to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit \n     the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect \n     premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the \n     insurer;\n       (4) the employing office receives no consideration in the \n     form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, \n     other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for \n     administrative services actually rendered in connection with \n     payroll deduction; and,\n       (5) the premium charged with respect to such coverage does \n     not increase in the event the employment relationship \n     terminates.\n       (b) The same group health plan benefits provided to an \n     employee prior to taking FMLA leave must be maintained during \n     the FMLA leave. For example, if family member coverage is \n     provided to an employee, family member coverage must be \n     maintained during the FMLA leave. Similarly, benefit coverage \n     during FMLA leave for medical care, surgical care, hospital \n     care, dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, \n     substance abuse treatment, etc., must be maintained during \n     leave if provided in an employing office's group health plan, \n     including a supplement to a group health plan, whether or not \n     provided through a flexible spending account or other \n     component of a cafeteria plan.\n       (c) If an employing office provides a new health plan or \n     benefits or changes health benefits or plans while an \n     employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the \n     new or changed plan/benefits to the same extent as if the \n     employee were not on leave. For example, if an employing \n     office changes a group health plan so that dental care \n     becomes covered under the plan, an employee on FMLA leave \n     must be given the same opportunity as other employees to \n     receive (or obtain) the dental care coverage. Any other plan \n     changes (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) \n     which apply to all employees of the workforce would also \n     apply to an employee on FMLA leave.\n       (d) Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits \n     must also be given to an employee on FMLA leave. If the group \n     health plan permits an employee to change from single to \n     family coverage upon the birth of a child or otherwise add \n     new family members, such a change in benefits must be made \n     available while an employee is on FMLA leave. If the employee \n     requests the changed coverage it must be provided by the \n     employing office.\n       (e) An employee may choose not to retain group health plan \n     coverage during FMLA leave. However, when an employee returns \n     from leave, the employee is entitled to be reinstated on the \n     same terms as prior to taking the leave, including family or \n     dependent coverages, without any qualifying period, physical \n     examination, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc. See \n     Sec. 825.212(c).\n       (f) Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable, and for ``key'' employees (as \n     discussed below), an employing office's obligation to \n     maintain health benefits during leave (and to restore the \n     employee to the same or equivalent employment) under FMLA \n     ceases if and when the employment relationship would have \n     terminated if the employee had not taken FMLA leave (e.g., if \n     the employee's position is eliminated as part of a \n     nondiscriminatory reduction in force and the employee would \n     not have been transferred to another position); an employee \n     informs the employing office of his or her intent not to \n     return from leave (including before starting the leave if the \n     employing office is so informed before the leave starts); or \n     the employee fails to return from leave or continues on leave \n     after exhausting his or her FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-\n     month period.\n       (g) If a ``key employee'' (See Sec. 825.218) does not \n     return from leave when notified by the employing office that \n     substantial or grievous economic injury will result from his \n     or her reinstatement, the employee's entitlement to group \n     health plan benefits continues unless and until the employee \n     advises the employing office that the employee does not \n     desire restoration to employment at the end of the leave \n     period, or FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, or \n     reinstatement is actually denied.\n       (h) An employee's entitlement to benefits other than group \n     health benefits during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., holiday \n     pay) is to be determined by the employing office's \n     established policy for providing such benefits when the \n     employee is on other forms of leave (paid or unpaid, as \n     appropriate).\n     Sec. 825.210  How may employees on FMLA leave pay their share \n         of group health benefit premiums?\n       (a) Group health plan benefits must be maintained on the \n     same basis as coverage would have been provided if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Therefore, any share of group health plan premiums \n     which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must \n     continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave \n     period. If premiums are raised or lowered, the employee would \n     be required to pay the new premium rates. Maintenance of \n     health insurance policies which are not a part of the \n     employing office's group health plan, as described in \n     Sec. 825.209(a), are the sole responsibility of the employee. \n     The employee and the insurer should make necessary \n     arrangements for payment of premiums during periods of unpaid \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the \n     employee's share of premiums must be paid by the method \n     normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a payroll \n     deduction.\n       (c) If FMLA leave is unpaid, the employing office has a \n     number of options for obtaining payment from the employee. \n     The employing office may require that payment be made to the \n     employing office or to the insurance carrier, but no \n     additional charge may be added to the employee's premium \n     payment for administrative expenses. The employing office may \n     require employees to pay their share of premium payments in \n     any of the following ways:\n       (1) Payment would be due at the same time as it would be \n     made if by payroll deduction;\n       (2) Payment would be due on the same schedule as payments \n     are made under COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is \n     applicable;\n       (3) Payment would be prepaid pursuant to a cafeteria plan \n     at the employee's option;\n       (4) The employing office's existing rules for payment by \n     employees on ``leave without pay'' would be followed, \n     provided that such rules do not require prepayment (i.e., \n     prior to the commencement of the leave) of the premiums that \n     will become due during a period of unpaid FMLA leave or \n     payment of higher premiums than if the employee had continued \n     to work instead of taking leave; or,\n       (5) Another system voluntarily agreed to between the \n     employing office and the employee, which may include \n     prepayment of premiums (e.g., through increased payroll \n     deductions when the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable).\n       (d) The employing office must provide the employee with \n     advance written notice of the terms and conditions under \n     which these payments must be made. (See Sec. 825.301.)\n       (e) An employing office may not require more of an employee \n     using FMLA leave than the employing office requires of other \n     employees on ``leave without pay.''\n       (f) An employee who is receiving payments as a result of a \n     workers' compensation injury must make arrangements with the \n     employing office for payment of group health plan benefits \n     when simultaneously taking unpaid FMLA leave. See paragraph \n     (c) of this section and Sec. 825.207(d)(2).\n     Sec. 825.211  What special health benefits maintenance rules \n         apply to multi-employer health plans?\n       (a) A multi-employer health plan is a plan to which more \n     than one employer is required to contribute, and which is \n     maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining \n     agreements between employee organiza- tion(s) and the \n     employers.\n       (b) An employing office under a multi-employer plan must \n     continue to make contributions on behalf of an employee using \n     FMLA leave as though the employee had been continuously \n     employed, unless the plan contains an explicit FMLA provision \n     for maintaining coverage such as through pooled contributions \n     by all employers party to the plan.\n       (c) During the duration of an employee's FMLA leave, \n     coverage by the group health plan, and benefits provided \n     pursuant to the plan, must be maintained at the level of \n     coverage and benefits which were applicable to the employee \n     at the time FMLA leave commenced.\n       (d) An employee using FMLA leave cannot be required to use \n     ``banked'' hours or pay a greater premium than the employee \n     would have been required to pay if the employee had been \n     continuously employed.\n       (e) As provided in Sec. 825.209(f), group health plan \n     coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA leave \n     until:\n       (1) the employee's FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted;\n       (2) the employing office can show that the employee would \n     have been laid off and the employment relationship \n     terminated; or,\n       (3) the employee provides unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work.\n     Sec. 825.212  What are the consequences of an employee's \n         failure to make timely health plan premium payments?\n       (a)(1) In the absence of an established employing office \n     policy providing a longer grace period, an employing office's \n     obligations to maintain health insurance coverage cease under \n     FMLA if an employee's premium payment is more than 30 days \n     late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee whose \n     premium payment is late, the employing office must provide \n     written notice to the employee that the payment has not been \n     received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least \n     15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage \n     will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after \n     the date of the letter unless the payment has been received \n     by that date. If the employing office has established \n     policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that provide \n     for the employing office to cease coverage retroactively to \n     the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the employing \n     office may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in \n     accordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was \n     given. In the absence of such a policy, coverage for the \n     employee may be terminated at the end of\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\n     the 30-day grace period, where the required 15-day notice has \n     been provided.\n       (2) An employing office has no obligation regarding the \n     maintenance of a health insurance policy which is not a \n     ``group health plan.'' See Sec. 825.209(a).\n       (3) All other obligations of an employing office under FMLA \n     would continue; for example, the employing office continues \n     to have an obligation to reinstate an employee upon return \n     from leave.\n       (b) The employing office may recover the employee's share \n     of any premium payments missed by the employee for any FMLA \n     leave period during which the employing office maintains \n     health coverage by paying the employee's share after the \n     premium payment is missed.\n       (c) If coverage lapses because an employee has not made \n     required premium payments, upon the employee's return from \n     FMLA leave the employing office must still restore the \n     employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the \n     employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the \n     premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or \n     dependent coverage. See Sec. 825.215(d)(1)-(5). In such case, \n     an employee may not be required to meet any qualification \n     requirements imposed by the plan, including any new \n     preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open \n     season, or to pass a medical examination to obtain \n     reinstatement of coverage.\n     Sec. 825.213  May an employing office recover costs it \n         incurred for maintaining ``group health plan'' or other \n         non-health benefits coverage during FMLA leave?\n       (a) In addition to the circumstances discussed in \n     Sec. 825.212(b), the share of health plan premiums paid by or \n     on behalf of the employing office during a period of unpaid \n     FMLA leave may be recovered from an employee if the employee \n     fails to return to work after the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement has been exhausted or expires, unless the reason \n     the employee does not return is due to:\n       (1) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious \n     health condition of the employee or the employee's family \n     member which would otherwise entitle the employee to leave \n     under FMLA; or\n       (2) Other circumstances beyond the employee's control. \n     Examples of ``other circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control'' are necessarily broad. They include such situations \n     as where a parent chooses to stay home with a newborn child \n     who has a serious health condition; an employee's spouse is \n     unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles \n     from the employee's worksite; a relative or individual other \n     than an immediate family member has a serious health \n     condition and the employee is needed to provide care; the \n     employee is laid off while on leave; or, the employee is a \n     ``key employee'' who decides not to return to work upon being \n     notified of the employing office's intention to deny \n     restoration because of substantial and grievous economic \n     injury to the employing office's operations and is not \n     reinstated by the employing office. Other circumstances \n     beyond the employee's control would not include a situation \n     where an employee desires to remain with a parent in a \n     distant city even though the parent no longer requires the \n     employee's care, or a parent chooses not to return to work to \n     stay home with a well, newborn child.\n       (3) When an employee fails to return to work because of the \n     continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health \n     condition, thereby precluding the employing office from \n     recovering its (share of) health benefit premium payments \n     made on the employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employing office may require medical certification \n     of the employee's or the family member's serious health \n     condition. Such certification is not required unless \n     requested by the employing office. The employee is required \n     to provide medical certification in a timely manner which, \n     for purposes of this section, is within 30 days from the date \n     of the employing office's request. For purposes of medical \n     certification, the employee may use the optional form \n     developed for this purpose (see Sec. 825.306(a) and Appendix \n     B of this part). If the employing office requests medical \n     certification and the employee does not provide such \n     certification in a timely manner (within 30 days), or the \n     reason for not returning to work does not meet the test of \n     other circumstances beyond the employee's control, the \n     employing office may recover 100% of the health benefit \n     premiums it paid during the period of unpaid FMLA leave.\n       (b) Under some circumstances an employing office may elect \n     to maintain other benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability \n     insurance, etc., by paying the employee's (share of) premiums \n     during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For example, to ensure \n     the employing office can meet its responsibilities to \n     provide equivalent benefits to the employee upon return \n     from unpaid FMLA leave, it may be necessary that premiums \n     be paid continuously to avoid a lapse of coverage. If the \n     employing office elects to maintain such benefits during \n     the leave, at the conclusion of leave, the employing \n     office is entitled to recover only the costs incurred for \n     paying the employee's share of any premiums whether or not \n     the employee returns to work.\n       (c) An employee who returns to work for at least 30 \n     calendar days is considered to have ``returned'' to work. An \n     employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to \n     retirement, or who retires during the first 30 days after the \n     employee returns to work, is deemed to have returned to work.\n       (d) When an employee elects or an employing office requires \n     paid leave to be substituted for FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may not recover its (share of) health insurance or \n     other non-health benefit premiums for any period of FMLA \n     leave covered by paid leave. Because paid leave provided \n     under a plan covering temporary disabilities (including \n     workers' compensation) is not unpaid, recovery of health \n     insurance premiums does not apply to such paid leave.\n       (e) The amount that self-insured employing offices may \n     recover is limited to only the employing office's share of \n     allowable ``premiums'' as would be calculated under COBRA, \n     excluding the 2 percent fee for administrative costs.\n       (f) When an employee fails to return to work, any health \n     and non-health benefit premiums which this section of the \n     regulations permits an employing office to recover are a debt \n     owed by the non-returning employee to the employing office. \n     The existence of this debt caused by the employee's failure \n     to return to work does not alter the employing office's \n     responsibilities for health benefit coverage and, under a \n     self-insurance plan, payment of claims incurred during the \n     period of FMLA leave. To the extent recovery is allowed, the \n     employing office may recover the costs through deduction from \n     any sums due to the employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation \n     pay, etc.), provided such deductions do not otherwise violate \n     applicable wage payment or other laws. Alternatively, the \n     employing office may initiate legal action against the \n     employee to recover such costs.\n     Sec. 825.214  What are an employee's rights on returning to \n         work from FMLA leave?\n       (a) On return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to \n     be returned to the same position the employee held when leave \n     commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     An employee is entitled to such reinstatement even if the \n     employee has been replaced or his or her position has been \n     restructured to accommodate the employee's absence. See also \n     Sec. 825.106(e) for the obligations of employing offices that \n     are joint employing offices.\n       (b) If the employee is unable to perform an essential \n     function of the position because of a physical or mental \n     condition, including the continuation of a serious health \n     condition, the employee has no right to restoration to \n     another position under the FMLA. However, the employing \n     office's obligations may be governed by the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA. See \n     Sec. 825.702.\n     Sec. 825.215  What is an equivalent position?\n       (a) An equivalent position is one that is virtually \n     identical to the employee's former position in terms of pay, \n     benefits and working conditions, including privileges, \n     perquisites and status. It must involve the same or \n     substantially similar duties and responsibilities, which \n     must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, \n     responsibility, and authority.\n       (b) If an employee is no longer qualified for the position \n     because of the employee's inability to attend a necessary \n     course, renew a license, fly a minimum number of hours, etc., \n     as a result of the leave, the employee shall be given a \n     reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon \n     return to work.\n       (c) Equivalent Pay. (1) An employee is entitled to any \n     unconditional pay increases which may have occurred during \n     the FMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases. Pay \n     increases conditioned upon seniority, length of service, or \n     work performed would not have to be granted unless it is the \n     employing office's policy or practice to do so with respect \n     to other employees on ``leave without pay.'' In such case, \n     any pay increase would be granted based on the employee's \n     seniority, length of service, work performed, etc., excluding \n     the period of unpaid FMLA leave. An employee is entitled to \n     be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay \n     premiums, such as a shift differential. If an employee \n     departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime (and \n     corresponding overtime pay) each week, an employee is \n     ordinarily entitled to such a position on return from FMLA \n     leave.\n       (2) Many employing offices pay bonuses in different forms \n     to employees for job-related performance such as for perfect \n     attendance, safety (absence of injuries or accidents on the \n     job) and exceeding production goals. Bonuses for perfect \n     attendance and safety do not require performance by the \n     employee but rather contemplate the absence of occurrences. \n     To the extent an employee who takes FMLA leave had met all \n     the requirements for either or both of these bonuses before \n     FMLA leave began, the employee is entitled to continue this \n     entitlement upon return from FMLA leave, that is, the \n     employee may not be disqualified for the bonus(es) for the \n     taking of FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220 (b) and (c). A monthly \n     production bonus, on the other hand, does require performance \n     by the employee. If the employee is on FMLA leave during any \n     part of the period for which the bonus is computed, the \n     employee is entitled to the same consideration for the bonus \n     as other employees on paid or unpaid leave (as appropriate). \n     See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n       (d) Equivalent Benefits. ``Benefits'' include all benefits \n     provided or made available to employees by an employing \n     office, including group life insurance, health insurance, \n     disability insurance, sick leave, annual leave,\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n     educational benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether \n     such benefits are provided by a practice or written policy of \n     an employing office through an employee benefit plan.\n       (1) At the end of an employee's FMLA leave, benefits must \n     be resumed in the same manner and at the same levels as \n     provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in \n     benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of \n     FMLA leave affecting the entire work force, unless otherwise \n     elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave, an \n     employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the \n     employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or \n     dependent coverages). For example, if an employee was covered \n     by a life insurance policy before taking leave but is not \n     covered or coverage lapses during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employee cannot be required to meet any \n     qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in \n     order to requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. \n     Accordingly, some employing offices may find it necessary to \n     modify life insurance and other benefits programs in order to \n     restore employees to equivalent benefits upon return from \n     FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued payment of costs \n     to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA leave, or pay \n     these costs subject to recovery from the employee on \n     return from leave. See Sec. 825.213(b).\n       (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any \n     additional benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Benefits accrued at the time leave began, however, (e.g., \n     paid vacation, sick or personal leave to the extent not \n     substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an employee \n     upon return from leave.\n       (3) If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to \n     continue life insurance, disability insurance, or other types \n     of benefits for which he or she typically pays, the employing \n     office is required to follow established policies or \n     practices for continuing such benefits for other instances of \n     leave without pay. If the employing office has no established \n     policy, the employee and the employing office are encouraged \n     to agree upon arrangements before FMLA leave begins.\n       (4) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any \n     period of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or \n     counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and \n     eligibility to participate. Also, if the plan requires an \n     employee to be employed on a specific date in order to be \n     credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions or \n     participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on \n     that date shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. \n     However, unpaid FMLA leave periods need not be treated as \n     credited service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and \n     eligibility to participate.\n       (5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if \n     they continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit \n     plans. They are entitled to changes in benefits plans, except \n     those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual during \n     the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to \n     the same extent they would have qualified if no leave had \n     been taken. For example if the benefit plan is predicated on \n     a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the \n     employee does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking \n     unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost. (In this regard, \n     Sec. 825.209 addresses health benefits.)\n       (e) Equivalent Terms and Conditions of Employment. An \n     equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, \n     conditions, responsibilities, privileges and status as the \n     employee's original position.\n       (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a \n     geographically proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not \n     involve a significant increase in commuting time or distance) \n     from where the employee had previously been employed. If the \n     employee's original worksite has been closed, the employee is \n     entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been \n     on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an \n     employing office transfers all employees from a closed \n     worksite to a new worksite in a different city, the employee \n     on leave is also entitled to transfer under the same \n     conditions as if he or she had continued to be employed.\n       (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the \n     same shift or the same or an equivalent work schedule.\n       (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent \n     opportunity for bonuses and other similar discretionary and \n     non-discretionary payments.\n       (4) FMLA does not prohibit an employing office from \n     accommodating an employee's request to be restored to a \n     different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the \n     employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a \n     promotion to a better position. However, an employee cannot \n     be induced by the employing office to accept a different \n     position against the employee's wishes.\n       (f) The requirement that an employee be restored to the \n     same or equivalent job with the same or equivalent pay, \n     benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not \n     extend to de minimis or intangible, unmeasurable aspects of \n     the job. However, restoration to a job slated for lay-off, \n     when the employee's original position is not, would not \n     meet the requirements of an equivalent position.\n     Sec. 825.216  Are there any limitations on an employing \n         office's obligation to reinstate an employee?\n       (a) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. An employing office must be able to show that an \n     employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time \n     reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to \n     employment. For example:\n       (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking \n     FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employing \n     office's responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain \n     group health plan benefits and restore the employee ceases at \n     the time the employee is laid off, provided the employing \n     office has no continuing obligations under a collective \n     bargaining agreement or otherwise. An employing office would \n     have the burden of proving that an employee would have been \n     laid off during the FMLA leave period and, therefore, would \n     not be entitled to restoration.\n       (2) If a shift has been eliminated, or overtime has been \n     decreased, an employee would not be entitled to return to \n     work that shift or the original overtime hours upon \n     restoration. However, if a position on, for example, a night \n     shift has been filled by another employee, the employee is \n     entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before \n     taking FMLA leave.\n       (b) If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to \n     perform work on a discrete project, the employing office has \n     no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term \n     or project is over and the employing office would not \n     otherwise have continued to employ the employee.\n       (c) In addition to the circumstances explained above, an \n     employing office may deny job restoration to salaried \n     eligible employees (``key employees,'' as defined in \n     paragraph (c) of Sec. 825.217) if such denial is necessary to \n     prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the \n     operations of the employing office; or may delay restoration \n     to an employee who fails to provide a fitness for duty \n     certificate to return to work under the conditions described \n     in Sec. 825.310.\n       (d) If the employee has been on a workers' compensation \n     absence during which FMLA leave has been taken concurrently, \n     and after 12 weeks of FMLA leave the employee is unable to \n     return to work, the employee no longer has the protections of \n     FMLA and must look to the workers' compensation statute or \n     ADA, as made applicable by the CAA, for any relief or \n     protections.\n     Sec. 825.217  What is a ``key employee''?\n       (a) A ``key employee'' is a salaried FMLA-eligible employee \n     who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees \n     employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the \n     employee's worksite.\n       (b) The term ``salaried'' means paid on a salary basis, \n     within the meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541, \n     implementing section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313) \n     (regarding employees who may qualify as exempt from the \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, as executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees).\n       (c) A ``key employee'' must be ``among the highest paid 10 \n     percent'' of all the employees both salaried and non-\n     salaried, eligible and--ineligible--who are employed by the \n     employing office within 75 miles of the worksite.\n       (1) In determining which employees are among the highest \n     paid 10 percent, year-to-date earnings are divided by weeks \n     worked by the employee (including weeks in which paid leave \n     was taken). Earnings include wages, premium pay, incentive \n     pay, and non-discretionary and discretionary bonuses. \n     Earnings do not include incentives whose value is determined \n     at some future date, e.g., benefits or perquisites.\n       (2) The determination of whether a salaried employee is \n     among the highest paid 10 percent shall be made at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave. No more than \n     10 percent of the employing office's employees within 75 \n     miles of the worksite may be ``key employees.''\n     Sec. 825.218  What does ``substantial and grievous economic \n         injury'' mean?\n       (a) In order to deny restoration to a key employee, an \n     employing office must determine that the restoration of the \n     employee to employment will cause ``substantial and grievous \n     economic injury'' to the operations of the employing office, \n     not whether the absence of the employee will cause such \n     substantial and grievous injury.\n       (b) An employing office may take into account its ability \n     to replace on a temporary basis (or temporarily do without) \n     the employee on FMLA leave. If permanent replacement is \n     unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating the employee can be \n     considered in evaluating whether substantial and grievous \n     economic injury will occur from restoration; in other words, \n     the effect on the operations of the employing office of \n     reinstating the employee in an equivalent position.\n       (c) A precise test cannot be set for the level of hardship \n     or injury to the employing office which must be sustained. If \n     the reinstatement of a ``key employee'' threatens the \n     economic viability of the employing office, that would \n     constitute ``substantial and grievous economic injury.'' A \n     lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic \n     injury would also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and \n     costs that the employing office would experience in the \n     normal course would certainly not constitute ``substantial \n     and grievous economic injury.''\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\n       (d) FMLA's ``substantial and grievous economic injury'' \n     standard is different from and more stringent than the \n     ``undue hardship'' test under the ADA (see, also \n     Sec. 825.702).\n     Sec. 825.219  What are the rights of a key employee?\n       (a) An employing office which believes that reinstatement \n     may be denied to a key employee, must give written notice to \n     the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if \n     earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At the \n     same time, the employing office must also fully inform the \n     employee of the potential consequences with respect to \n     reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the \n     employing office should determine that substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to the employing office's operations \n     will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave. If \n     such notice cannot be given immediately because of the need \n     to determine whether the employee is a key employee, it shall \n     be given as soon as practicable after being notified of a \n     need for leave (or the commencement of leave, if earlier). It \n     is expected that in most circumstances there will be no \n     desire that an employee be denied restoration after FMLA \n     leave and, therefore, there would be no need to provide such \n     notice. However, an employing office who fails to provide \n     such timely notice will lose its right to deny restoration \n     even if substantial and grievous economic injury will \n     result from reinstatement.\n       (b) As soon as an employing office makes a good faith \n     determination, based on the facts available, that substantial \n     and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if \n     a key employee who has given notice of the need for FMLA \n     leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employing \n     office shall notify the employee in writing of its \n     determination, that it cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it \n     intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of \n     the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an employing office \n     will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the \n     employee starting leave. The employing office must serve this \n     notice either in person or by certified mail. This notice \n     must explain the basis for the employing office's finding \n     that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, \n     and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a \n     reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into \n     account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave \n     and the urgency of the need for the employee to return.\n       (c) If an employee on leave does not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notification of intent to \n     deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to \n     maintenance of health benefits and the employing office may \n     not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key \n     employee's rights under FMLA continue unless and until either \n     the employee gives notice that he or she no longer wishes to \n     return to work, or the employing office actually denies \n     reinstatement at the conclusion of the leave period.\n       (d) After notice to an employee has been given that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result if the \n     employee is reinstated to employment, an employee is still \n     entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave \n     period even if the employee did not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notice. The employing \n     office must then again determine whether there will be \n     substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, \n     based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the \n     employing office shall notify the employee in writing (in \n     person or by certified mail) of the denial of restoration.\n     Sec. 825.220  How are employees protected who request leave \n         or otherwise assert FMLA rights?\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prohibits \n     interference with an employees' rights under the law, and \n     with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employees' \n     rights. More specifically, the law contains the following \n     employee protections:\n       (1) An employing office is prohibited from interfering \n     with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to \n     exercise) any rights provided by the FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA.\n       (2) An employing office is prohibited from discharging or \n     in any other way discriminating against any covered employee \n     (whether or not an eligible employee) for opposing or \n     complaining about any unlawful practice under the FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (3) All employing offices are prohibited from discharging \n     or in any other way discriminating against any covered \n     employee (whether or not an eligible employee) because that \n     covered employee has\n       (i) Filed any charge, or has instituted (or caused to be \n     instituted) any proceeding under or related to the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA;\n       (ii) Given, or is about to give, any information in \n     connection with an inquiry or proceeding relating to a right \n     under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA;\n       (iii) Testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or \n     proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering with, \n     restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by \n     the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA. ``Interfering with'' \n     the exercise of an employee's rights would include, for \n     example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but \n     discouraging an employee from using such leave. It would also \n     include manipulation by covered an employing office to avoid \n     responsibilities under FMLA, for example:\n       (1) [Reserved];\n       (2) changing the essential functions of the job in order to \n     preclude the taking of leave;\n       (3) reducing hours available to work in order to avoid \n     employee eligibility.\n       (c) An employing office is prohibited from discriminating \n     against employees or prospective employees who have used FMLA \n     leave. For example, if an employee on leave without pay would \n     otherwise be entitled to full benefits (other than health \n     benefits), the same benefits would be required to be provided \n     to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token, \n     employing offices cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a \n     negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, \n     promotions or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be \n     counted under ``no fault'' attendance policies.\n       (d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employing offices \n     induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA. For \n     example, employees (or their collective bargaining \n     representatives) cannot ``trade off'' the right to take FMLA \n     leave against some other benefit offered by the employing \n     office. This does not prevent an employee's voluntary and \n     uncoerced acceptance (not as a condition of employment) of a \n     ``light duty'' assignment while recovering from a serious \n     health condition (see Sec. 825.702(d)). In such a \n     circumstance the employee's right to restoration to the same \n     or an equivalent position is available until 12 weeks have \n     passed within the 12-month period, including all FMLA leave \n     taken and the period of ``light duty.''\n       (e) Covered employees, and not merely eligible employees, \n     are protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., file a \n     complaint about) any practice which is unlawful under the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They are similarly \n     protected if they oppose any practice which they reasonably \n     believe to be a violation of the FMLA, as made applicable by \n     the CAA or regulations.\n\n\nSubpart C--How do Employees Learn of Their Rights and Obligations under \n  the FMLA, as Made Applicable by the CAA, and What Can an Employing \n                     Office Require of an Employee?\n\n     Sec. 825.300  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.301  What notices to employees are required of \n         employing offices under the FMLA as made applicable by \n         the CAA?\n       (a)(1) If an employing office has any eligible employees \n     and has any written guidance to employees concerning employee \n     benefits or leave rights, such as in an employee handbook, \n     information concerning both entitlements and employee \n     obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     must be included in the handbook or other document. For \n     example, if an employing office provides an employee handbook \n     to all employees that describes the employing office's \n     policies regarding leave, wages, attendance, and similar \n     matters, the handbook must incorporate information on FMLA \n     rights and responsibilities and the employing office's \n     policies regarding the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. \n     Informational publications describing the provisions of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA are available from the \n     Office of Compliance and may be incorporated in such \n     employing office handbooks or written policies.\n       (2) If such an employing office does not have written \n     policies, manuals, or handbooks describing employee benefits \n     and leave provisions, the employing office shall provide \n     written guidance to an employee concerning all the employee's \n     rights and obligations under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. This notice shall be provided to employees each time \n     notice is given pursuant to paragraph (b), and in accordance \n     with the provisions of that paragraph. Employing offices may \n     duplicate and provide the employee a copy of the FMLA Fact \n     Sheet available from the Office of Compliance to provide such \n     guidance.\n       (b)(1) The employing office shall also provide the employee \n     with written notice detailing the specific expectations and \n     obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences \n     of a failure to meet these obligations. The written notice \n     must be provided to the employee in a language in which the \n     employee is literate. Such specific notice must include, as \n     appropriate:\n       (i) that the leave will be counted against the employee's \n     annual FMLA leave entitlement (see Sec. 825.208);\n       (ii) any requirements for the employee to furnish medical \n     certification of a serious health condition and the \n     consequences of failing to do so (see Sec. 825.305);\n       (iii) the employee's right to substitute paid leave and \n     whether the employing office will require the substitution of \n     paid leave, and the conditions related to any substitution;\n       (iv) any requirement for the employee to make any premium \n     payments to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for \n     making such payments (see Sec. 825.210), and the possible \n     consequences of failure to make such payments on a timely \n     basis (i.e., the circumstances under which coverage may \n     lapse);\n       (v) any requirement for the employee to present a fitness-\n     for-duty certificate to be restored to employment (see \n     Sec. 825.310);\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\n       (vi) the employee's status as a ``key employee'' and the \n     potential consequence that restoration may be denied \n     following FMLA leave, explaining the conditions required for \n     such denial (see Sec. 825.218);\n       (vii) the employee's right to restoration to the same or an \n     equivalent job upon return from leave (see Sec. Sec. 825.214 \n     and 825.604); and,\n       (viii) the employee's potential liability for payment of \n     health insurance premiums paid by the employing office during \n     the employee's unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to \n     return to work after taking FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.213).\n       (2) The specific notice may include other information--\n     e.g., whether the employing office will require periodic \n     reports of the employee's status and intent to return to \n     work, but is not required to do so. A prototype notice is \n     contained in Appendix D of this part, or may be obtained from \n     the Office of Compliance, which employing offices may adapt \n     for their use to meet these specific notice requirements.\n       (c) Except as provided in this subparagraph, the written \n     notice required by paragraph (b) (and by subparagraph (a)(2) \n     where applicable) must be provided to the employee no less \n     often than the first time in each six-month period that an \n     employee gives notice of the need for FMLA leave (if FMLA \n     leave is taken during the six-month period). The notice shall \n     be given within a reasonable time after notice of the need \n     for leave is given by the employee--within one or two \n     business days if feasible. If leave has already begun, the \n     notice should be mailed to the employee's address of record.\n       (1) If the specific information provided by the notice \n     changes with respect to a subsequent period of FMLA leave \n     during the six-month period, the employing office shall, \n     within one or two business days of receipt of the employee's \n     notice of need for leave, provide written notice referencing \n     the prior notice and setting forth any of the information in \n     subparagraph (b) which has changed. For example, if the \n     initial leave period were paid leave and the subsequent leave \n     period would be unpaid leave, the employing office may need \n     to give notice of the arrangements for making premium \n     payments.\n       (2)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii), if the \n     employing office is requiring medical certification or a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report, written notice of the \n     requirement shall be given with respect to each employee \n     notice of a need for leave.\n       (ii) Subsequent written notification shall not be required \n     if the initial notice in the six-month period and the \n     employing office handbook or other written documents (if any) \n     describing the employing office's leave policies, clearly \n     provided that certification or a ``fitness-for-duty'' report \n     would be required (e.g., by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases, by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases in which leave of more than a \n     specified number of days is taken, or by stating that a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report would be required in all cases \n     for back injuries for employees in a certain occupation). \n     Where subsequent written notice is not required, at least \n     oral notice shall be provided. (See Sec. 825.305(a).)\n       (d) Employing offices are also expected to responsively \n     answer questions from employees concerning their rights and \n     responsibilities under the FMLA as made applicable under the \n     CAA.\n       (e) Employing offices furnishing FMLA-required notices to \n     sensory impaired individuals must also comply with all \n     applicable requirements under law.\n       (f) If an employing office fails to provide notice in \n     accordance with the provisions of this section, the employing \n     office may not take action against an employee for failure to \n     comply with any provision required to be set forth in the \n     notice.\n     Sec. 825.302  What notice does an employee have to give an \n         employing office when the need for FMLA leave is \n         foreseeable?\n       (a) An employee must provide the employing office at least \n     30 days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the \n     need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected \n     birth, placement for adoption or foster care, or planned \n     medical treatment for a serious health condition of the \n     employee or of a family member. If 30 days notice is not \n     practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge of \n     approximately when leave will be required to begin, a \n     change in circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice \n     must be given as soon as practicable. For example, an \n     employee's health condition may require leave to commence \n     earlier than anticipated before the birth of a child. \n     Similarly, little opportunity for notice may be given \n     before placement for adoption. Whether the leave is to be \n     continuous or is to be taken intermittently or on a \n     reduced schedule basis, notice need only be given one \n     time, but the employee shall advise the employing office \n     as soon as practicable if dates of scheduled leave change \n     or are extended, or were initially unknown.\n       (b) ``As soon as practicable'' means as soon as both \n     possible and practical, taking into account all of the facts \n     and circumstances in the individual case. For foreseeable \n     leave where it is not possible to give as much as 30 days \n     notice, ``as soon as practicable'' ordinarily would mean at \n     least verbal notification to the employing office within one \n     or two business days of when the need for leave becomes known \n     to the employee.\n       (c) An employee shall provide at least verbal notice \n     sufficient to make the employing office aware that the \n     employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated \n     timing and duration of the leave. The employee need not \n     expressly assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that \n     leave is needed for an expected birth or adoption, for \n     example. The employing office should inquire further of the \n     employee if it is necessary to have more information about \n     whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and \n     obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. In the \n     case of medical conditions, the employing office may find it \n     necessary to inquire further to determine if the leave is \n     because of a serious health condition and may request medical \n     certification to support the need for such leave (see \n     Sec. 825.305).\n       (d) An employing office may also require an employee to \n     comply with the employing office's usual and customary notice \n     and procedural requirements for requesting leave. For \n     example, an employing office may require that written notice \n     set forth the reasons for the requested leave, the \n     anticipated duration of the leave, and the anticipated start \n     of the leave. However, failure to follow such internal \n     employing office procedures will not permit an employing \n     office to disallow or delay an employee's taking FMLA leave \n     if the employee gives timely verbal or other notice.\n       (e) When planning medical treatment, the employee must \n     consult with the employing office and make a reasonable \n     effort to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt unduly the \n     employing office's operations, subject to the approval of the \n     health care provider. Employees are ordinarily expected to \n     consult with their employing offices prior to the scheduling \n     of treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule which \n     best suits the needs of both the employing office and the \n     employee. If an employee who provides notice of the need to \n     take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical \n     treatment neglects to consult with the employing office to \n     make a reasonable attempt to arrange the schedule of \n     treatments so as not to unduly disrupt the employing office's \n     operations, the employing office may initiate discussions \n     with the employee and require the employee to attempt to make \n     such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider.\n       (f) In the case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule which is medically necessary, an employee \n     shall advise the employing office, upon request, of the \n     reasons why the intermittent/reduced leave schedule is \n     necessary and of the schedule for treatment, if applicable. \n     The employee and employing office shall attempt to work \n     out a schedule which meets the employee's needs without \n     unduly disrupting the employing office's operations, \n     subject to the approval of the health care provider.\n       (g) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     requirements. In addition, an employing office may not \n     require compliance with stricter FMLA notice requirements \n     where the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or \n     applicable leave plan allow less advance notice to the \n     employing office. For example, if an employee (or employing \n     office) elects to substitute paid vacation leave for unpaid \n     FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.207), and the employing office's \n     paid vacation leave plan imposes no prior notification \n     requirements for taking such vacation leave, no advance \n     notice may be required for the FMLA leave taken in these \n     circumstances. On the other hand, FMLA notice requirements \n     would apply to a period of unpaid FMLA leave, unless the \n     employing office imposes lesser notice requirements on \n     employees taking leave without pay.\n     Sec. 825.303  What are the requirements for an employee to \n         furnish notice to an employing office where the need for \n         FMLA leave is not foreseeable?\n       (a) When the approximate timing of the need for leave is \n     not foreseeable, an employee should give notice to the \n     employing office of the need for FMLA leave as soon as \n     practicable under the facts and circumstances of the \n     particular case. It is expected that an employee will give \n     notice to the employing office within no more than one or two \n     working days of learning of the need for leave, except in \n     extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not \n     feasible. In the case of a medical emergency requiring leave \n     because of an employee's own serious health condition or to \n     care for a family member with a serious health condition, \n     written advance notice pursuant to an employing office's \n     internal rules and procedures may not be required when FMLA \n     leave is involved.\n       (b) The employee should provide notice to the employing \n     office either in person or by telephone, telegraph, facsimile \n     (``fax'') machine or other electronic means. Notice may be \n     given by the employee's spokesperson (e.g., spouse, adult \n     family member or other responsible party) if the employee is \n     unable to do so personally. The employee need not expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is \n     needed. The employing office will be expected to obtain any \n     additional required information through informal means. The \n     employee or spokesperson will be expected to provide more \n     information when it can readily be accomplished as a \n     practical matter, taking into consideration the exigencies of \n     the situation.\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\n     Sec. 825.304  What recourse do employing offices have if \n         employees fail to provide the required notice?\n       (a) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     obligations or the employing office's own internal rules on \n     leave notice requirements.\n       (b) If an employee fails to give 30 days notice for \n     foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, \n     the employing office may delay the taking of FMLA leave until \n     at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice \n     to the employing office of the need for FMLA leave.\n       (c) In all cases, in order for the onset of an employee's \n     FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack of required notice, it \n     must be clear that the employee had actual notice of the FMLA \n     notice requirements. This condition would be satisfied by the \n     employing office's proper posting, at the worksite where \n     the employee is employed, of the information regarding the \n     FMLA provided (pursuant to section 301(h)(2) of the CAA, 2 \n     U.S.C. 1381(h)(2)) by the Office of Compliance to the \n     employing office in a manner suitable for posting. \n     Furthermore, the need for leave and the approximate date \n     leave would be taken must have been clearly foreseeable to \n     the employee 30 days in advance of the leave. For example, \n     knowledge that an employee would receive a telephone call \n     about the availability of a child for adoption at some \n     unknown point in the future would not be sufficient.\n     Sec. 825.305  When must an employee provide medical \n         certification to support FMLA leave?\n       (a) An employing office may require that an employee's \n     leave to care for the employee's seriously-ill spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent, or due to the employee's own serious \n     health condition that makes the employee unable to perform \n     one or more of the essential functions of the employee's \n     position, be supported by a certification issued by the \n     health care provider of the employee or the employee's ill \n     family member. An employing office must give notice of a \n     requirement for medical certification each time a \n     certification is required; such notice must be written notice \n     whenever required by Sec. 825.301. An employing office's oral \n     request to an employee to furnish any subsequent medical \n     certification is sufficient.\n       (b) When the leave is foreseeable and at least 30 days \n     notice has been provided, the employee should provide the \n     medical certification before the leave begins. When this is \n     not possible, the employee must provide the requested \n     certification to the employing office within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 calendar days after the employing office's request), \n     unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts.\n       (c) In most cases, the employing office should request that \n     an employee furnish certification from a health care provider \n     at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave \n     or within two business days thereafter, or, in the case of \n     unforeseen leave, within two business days after the leave \n     commences. The employing office may request certification at \n     some later date if the employing office later has reason to \n     question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.\n       (d) At the time the employing office requests \n     certification, the employing office must also advise an \n     employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee's \n     failure to provide adequate certification. The employing \n     office shall advise an employee whenever the employing office \n     finds a certification incomplete, and provide the employee a \n     reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency.\n       (e) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     imposes medical certification requirements that are less \n     stringent than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's less stringent sick leave \n     certification requirements may be imposed.\n     Sec. 825.306  How much information may be required in medical \n         certifications of a serious health condition?\n       (a) The Office of Compliance has made available an optional \n     form (``Certification of Physician or Practitioner'') for \n     employees' (or their family members') use in obtaining \n     medical certification, including second and third opinions, \n     from health care providers that meets FMLA's certification \n     requirements. (See Appendix B to these regulations.) This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the health care provider to furnish appropriate \n     medical information within his or her knowledge.\n       (b) The Certification of Physician or Practitioner form is \n     modeled closely on Form WH-380, as revised, which was \n     developed by the Department of Labor (see 29 C.F.R. Part 825, \n     Appendix B). The employing office may use the Office of \n     Compliance's form, or Form WH-380, as revised, or another \n     form containing the same basic information; however, no \n     additional information may be required. In all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the serious \n     health condition for which the current need for leave exists. \n     The form identifies the health care provider and type of \n     medical practice (including pertinent specialization, if \n     any), makes maximum use of checklist entries for ease in \n     completing the form, and contains required entries for:\n       (1) A certification as to which part of the definition of \n     ``serious health condition'' (see Sec. 825.114), if any, \n     applies to the patient's condition, and the medical facts \n     which support the certification, including a brief statement \n     as to how the medical facts meet the criteria of the \n     definition.\n       (2)(i) The approximate date the serious health condition \n     commenced, and its probable duration, including the probable \n     duration of the patient's present incapacity (defined to mean \n     inability to work, attend school or perform other regular \n     daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom) if different.\n       (ii) Whether it will be necessary for the employee to take \n     leave intermittently or to work on a reduced leave schedule \n     basis (i.e., part-time) as a result of the serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.117 and Sec. 825.203), and if so, the \n     probable duration of such schedule.\n       (iii) If the condition is pregnancy or a chronic condition \n     within the meaning of Sec. 825.114(a)(2)(iii), whether the \n     patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration \n     and frequency of episodes of incapacity.\n       (3)(i)(A) If additional treatments will be required for the \n     condition, an estimate of the probable number of such \n     treatments.\n       (B) If the patient's incapacity will be intermittent, or \n     will require a reduced leave schedule, an estimate of the \n     probable number and interval between such treatments, actual \n     or estimated dates of treatment if known, and period required \n     for recovery if any.\n       (ii) If any of the treatments referred to in subparagraph \n     (i) will be provided by another provider of health services \n     (e.g., physical therapist), the nature of the treatments.\n       (iii) If a regimen of continuing treatment by the patient \n     is required under the supervision of the health care \n     provider, a general description of the regimen (see \n     Sec. 825.114(b)).\n       (4) If medical leave is required for the employee's absence \n     from work because of the employee's own condition (including \n     absences due to pregnancy or a chronic condition), whether \n     the employee:\n       (i) is unable to perform work of any kind;\n       (ii) is unable to perform any one or more of the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, including a statement \n     of the essential functions the employee is unable to perform \n     (see Sec. 825.115), based on either information provided on a \n     statement from the employing office of the essential \n     functions of the position or, if not provided, discussion \n     with the employee about the employee's job functions; or\n       (iii) must be absent from work for treatment.\n       (5)(i) If leave is required to care for a family member of \n     the employee with a serious health condition, whether the \n     patient requires assistance for basic medical or personal \n     needs or safety, or for transportation; or if not, whether \n     the employee's presence to provide psychological comfort \n     would be beneficial to the patient or assist in the patient's \n     recovery. The employee is required to indicate on the form \n     the care he or she will provide and an estimate of the time \n     period.\n       (ii) If the employee's family member will need care only \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule basis (i.e., \n     part-time), the probable duration of the need.\n       (c) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     requires less information to be furnished in medical \n     certifications than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's lesser sick leave certification \n     requirements may be imposed.\n     Sec. 825.307  What may an employing office do if it questions \n         the adequacy of a medical certification?\n       (a) If an employee submits a complete certification signed \n     by the health care provider, the employing office may not \n     request additional information from the employee's health \n     care provider. However, a health care provider representing \n     the employing office may contact the employee's health care \n     provider, with the employee's permission, for purposes of \n     clarification and authenticity of the medical certification.\n       (1) If an employee is on FMLA leave running concurrently \n     with a workers' compensation absence, and the provisions of \n     the workers' compensation statute permit the employing office \n     or the employing office's representative to have direct \n     contact with the employee's workers' compensation health care \n     provider, the employing office may follow the workers' \n     compensation provisions.\n       (2) An employing office that has reason to doubt the \n     validity of a medical certification may require the employee \n     to obtain a second opinion at the employing office's expense. \n     Pending receipt of the second (or third) medical opinion, the \n     employee is provisionally entitled to the benefits of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA, including maintenance of \n     group health benefits. If the certifications do not \n     ultimately establish the employee's entitlement to FMLA \n     leave, the leave shall not be designated as FMLA leave and \n     may be treated as paid or unpaid leave under the employing \n     office's established leave policies. The employing office is \n     permitted to designate the health care provider to furnish \n     the second opinion, but the selected health care provider may \n     not be employed on a regular basis by the employing office. \n     See also paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.\n       (b) The employing office may not regularly contract with or \n     otherwise regularly utilize\n\n[[Page S3911]]\n\n     the services of the health care provider furnishing the \n     second opinion unless the employing office is located in an \n     area where access to health care is extremely limited (e.g., \n     a rural area where no more than one or two doctors practice \n     in the relevant specialty in the vicinity).\n       (c) If the opinions of the employee's and the employing \n     office's designated health care providers differ, the \n     employing office may require the employee to obtain \n     certification from a third health care provider, again at the \n     employing office's expense. This third opinion shall be final \n     and binding. The third health care provider must be \n     designated or approved jointly by the employing office and \n     the employee. The employing office and the employee must \n     each act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on \n     whom to select for the third opinion provider. If the \n     employing office does not attempt in good faith to reach \n     agreement, the employing office will be bound by the first \n     certification. If the employee does not attempt in good \n     faith to reach agreement, the employee will be bound by \n     the second certification. For example, an employee who \n     refuses to agree to see a doctor in the specialty in \n     question may be failing to act in good faith. On the other \n     hand, an employing office that refuses to agree to any \n     doctor on a list of specialists in the appropriate field \n     provided by the employee and whom the employee has not \n     previously consulted may be failing to act in good faith.\n       (d) The employing office is required to provide the \n     employee with a copy of the second and third medical \n     opinions, where applicable, upon request by the employee. \n     Requested copies are to be provided within two business days \n     unless extenuating circumstances prevent such action.\n       (e) If the employing office requires the employee to obtain \n     either a second or third opinion the employing office must \n     reimburse an employee or family member for any reasonable \n     ``out of pocket'' travel expenses incurred to obtain the \n     second and third medical opinions. The employing office may \n     not require the employee or family member to travel outside \n     normal commuting distance for purposes of obtaining the \n     second or third medical opinions except in very unusual \n     circumstances.\n       (f) In circumstances when the employee or a family member \n     is visiting in another country, or a family member resides in \n     another country, and a serious health condition develops, the \n     employing office shall accept a medical certification as well \n     as second and third opinions from a health care provider who \n     practices in that country.\n     Sec. 825.308  Under what circumstances may an employing \n         office request subsequent recertifications of medical \n         conditions?\n       (a) For pregnancy, chronic, or permanent/long-term \n     conditions under continuing supervision of a health care \n     provider (as defined in Sec. 825.114(a)(2) (ii), (iii) or \n     (iv)), an employing office may request recertification no \n     more often than every 30 days and only in connection with an \n     absence by the employee, unless:\n       (1) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration or frequency \n     of absences, the severity of the condition, complications); \n     or\n       (2) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the employee's stated reason for the absence.\n       (b)(1) If the minimum duration of the period of incapacity \n     specified on a certification furnished by the health care \n     provider is more than 30 days, the employing office may not \n     request recertification until that minimum duration has \n     passed unless one of the conditions set forth in paragraph \n     (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (2) For FMLA leave taken intermittently or on a reduced \n     leave schedule basis, the employing office may not request \n     recertification in less than the minimum period specified on \n     the certification as necessary for such leave (including \n     treatment) unless one of the conditions set forth in \n     paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (c) For circumstances not covered by paragraphs (a) or (b) \n     of this section, an employing office may request \n     recertification at any reasonable interval, but not more \n     often than every 30 days, unless:\n       (1) The employee requests an extension of leave;\n       (2) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration of the \n     illness, the nature of the illness, complications); or\n       (3) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the continuing validity of the certification.\n       (d) The employee must provide the requested recertification \n     to the employing office within the time frame requested by \n     the employing office (which must allow at least 15 calendar \n     days after the employing office's request), unless it is not \n     practicable under the particular circumstances to do so \n     despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts.\n       (e) Any recertification requested by the employing office \n     shall be at the employee's expense unless the employing \n     office provides otherwise. No second or third opinion on \n     recertification may be required.\n     Sec. 825.309  What notice may an employing office require \n         regarding an employee's intent to return to work?\n       (a) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intent to return to work. The employing office's policy \n     regarding such reports may not be discriminatory and must \n     take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances \n     related to the individual employee's leave situation.\n       (b) If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work, the employing office's obligations under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health \n     benefits (subject to requirements of COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable) and to restore the employee cease. \n     However, these obligations continue if an employee indicates \n     he or she may be unable to return to work but expresses a \n     continuing desire to do so.\n       (c) It may be necessary for an employee to take more leave \n     than originally anticipated. Conversely, an employee may \n     discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have \n     changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no \n     longer necessary. An employee may not be required to take \n     more FMLA leave than necessary to resolve the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave. In both of these \n     situations, the employing office may require that the \n     employee provide the employing office reasonable notice \n     (i.e., within two business days) of the changed circumstances \n     where foreseeable. The employing office may also obtain \n     information on such changed circumstances through requested \n     status reports.\n     Sec. 825.310  Under what circumstances may an employing \n         office require that an employee submit a medical \n         certification that the employee is able (or unable) to \n         return to work (i.e., a ``fitness-for-duty'' report)?\n       (a) As a condition of restoring an employee whose FMLA \n     leave was occasioned by the employee's own serious health \n     condition that made the employee unable to perform the \n     employee's job, an employing office may have a uniformly-\n     applied policy or practice that requires all similarly-\n     situated employees (i.e., same occupation, same serious \n     health condition) who take leave for such conditions to \n     obtain and present certification from the employee's health \n     care provider that the employee is able to resume work.\n       (b) If the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \n     govern an employee's return to work, those provisions shall \n     be applied. Similarly, requirements under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA, that \n     any return-to-work physical be job-related and consistent \n     with business necessity apply. For example, an attorney could \n     not be required to submit to a medical examination or inquiry \n     just because her leg had been amputated. The essential \n     functions of an attorney's job do not require use of both \n     legs; therefore such an inquiry would not be job related. An \n     employing office may require a warehouse laborer, whose \n     back impairment affects the ability to lift, to be \n     examined by an orthopedist, but may not require this \n     employee to submit to an HIV test where the test is not \n     related to either the essential functions of his/her job \n     or to his/her impairment.\n       (c) An employing office may seek fitness-for-duty \n     certification only with regard to the particular health \n     condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave. The \n     certification itself need only be a simple statement of an \n     employee's ability to return to work. A health care provider \n     employed by the employing office may contact the employee's \n     health care provider with the employee's permission, for \n     purposes of clarification of the employee's fitness to return \n     to work. No additional information may be acquired, and \n     clarification may be requested only for the serious health \n     condition for which FMLA leave was taken. The employing \n     office may not delay the employee's return to work while \n     contact with the health care provider is being made.\n       (d) The cost of the certification shall be borne by the \n     employee and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the \n     time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification.\n       (e) The notice that employing offices are required to give \n     to each employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     regarding their FMLA rights and obligations as made \n     applicable by the CAA (see Sec. 825.301) shall advise the \n     employee if the employing office will require fitness-for-\n     duty certification to return to work. If the employing office \n     has a handbook explaining employment policies and benefits, \n     the handbook should explain the employing office's general \n     policy regarding any requirement for fitness-for-duty \n     certification to return to work. Specific notice shall also \n     be given to any employee from whom fitness-for-duty \n     certification will be required either at the time notice of \n     the need for leave is given or immediately after leave \n     commences and the employing office is advised of the medical \n     circumstances requiring the leave, unless the employee's \n     condition changes from one that did not previously require \n     certification pursuant to the employing office's practice or \n     policy. No second or third fitness-for-duty certification may \n     be required.\n       (f) An employing office may delay restoration to employment \n     until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty \n     certification unless the employing office has failed to \n     provide the notices required in paragraph (e) of this \n     section.\n       (g) An employing office is not entitled to certification of \n     fitness to return to duty when the employee takes \n     intermittent leave as described in Sec. 825.203.\n       (h) When an employee is unable to return to work after FMLA \n     leave because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of \n     the employee's or family member's serious health\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\n     condition, thereby preventing the employing office from \n     recovering its share of health benefit premium payments made \n     on the employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employing office may require medical certification \n     of the employee's or the family member's serious health \n     condition. (See Sec. 825.213(a)(3).) The cost of the \n     certification shall be borne by the employee and the employee \n     is not entitled to be paid for the time or travel costs spent \n     in acquiring the certification.\n     Sec. 825.311  What happens if an employee fails to satisfy \n         the medical certification and/or recertification \n         requirements?\n       (a) In the case of foreseeable leave, an employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave to an employee who fails \n     to provide timely certification after being requested by the \n     employing office to furnish such certification (i.e., within \n     15 calendar days, if practicable), until the required \n     certification is provided.\n       (b) When the need for leave is not foreseeable, or in the \n     case of recertification, an employee must provide \n     certification (or recertification) within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 days after the employing office's request) or as soon as \n     reasonably possible under the particular facts and \n     circumstances. In the case of a medical emergency, it may not \n     be practicable for an employee to provide the required \n     certification within 15 calendar days. If an employee fails \n     to provide a medical certification within a reasonable time \n     under the pertinent circumstances, the employing office may \n     delay the employee's continuation of FMLA leave. If the \n     employee never produces the certification, the leave is not \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) When requested by the employing office pursuant to a \n     uniformly applied policy for similarly-situated employees, \n     the employee must provide medical certification at the time \n     the employee seeks reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave \n     taken for the employee's serious health condition, that the \n     employee is fit for duty and able to return to work (see \n     Sec. 825.310(a)) if the employing office has provided the \n     required notice (see Sec. 825.301(c); the employing office \n     may delay restoration until the certification is provided. In \n     this situation, unless the employee provides either a \n     fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification \n     for a serious health condition at the time FMLA leave is \n     concluded, the employee may be terminated. See also \n     Sec. 825.213(a)(3).\n     Sec. 825.312  Under what circumstances may an employing \n         office refuse to provide FMLA leave or reinstatement to \n         eligible employees?\n       (a) If an employee fails to give timely advance notice when \n     the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave until 30 days after the \n     date the employee provides notice to the employing office of \n     the need for FMLA leave. (See Sec. 825.302.)\n       (b) If an employee fails to provide in a timely manner a \n     requested medical certification to substantiate the need for \n     FMLA leave due to a serious health condition, an employing \n     office may delay continuation of FMLA leave until an employee \n     submits the certificate. (See Sec. Sec. 825.305 and 825.311.) \n     If the employee never produces the certification, the leave \n     is not FMLA leave.\n       (c) If an employee fails to provide a requested fitness-\n     for-duty certification to return to work, an employing office \n     may delay restoration until the employee submits the \n     certificate. (See Sec. Sec. 825.310 and 825.311.)\n       (d) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Thus, an employee's rights to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration cease under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, if and when the \n     employment relationship terminates (e.g., layoff), unless \n     that relationship continues, for example, by the employee \n     remaining on paid FMLA leave. If the employee is recalled or \n     otherwise re-employed, an eligible employee is immediately \n     entitled to further FMLA leave for an FMLA-qualifying reason. \n     An employing office must be able to show, when an employee \n     requests restoration, that the employee would not otherwise \n     have been employed if leave had not been taken in order to \n     deny restoration to employment. (See Sec. 825.216.)\n       (e) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intention to return to work. (See Sec. 825.309.) If an \n     employee unequivocally advises the employing office either \n     before or during the taking of leave that the employee does \n     not intend to return to work, and the employment relationship \n     is terminated, the employee's entitlement to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration ceases unless \n     the employment relationship continues, for example, by the \n     employee remaining on paid leave. An employee may not be \n     required to take more leave than necessary to address the \n     circumstances for which leave was taken. If the employee \n     is able to return to work earlier than anticipated, the \n     employee shall provide the employing office two business \n     days notice where feasible; the employing office is \n     required to restore the employee once such notice is \n     given, or where such prior notice was not feasible.\n       (f) An employing office may deny restoration to employment, \n     but not the taking of FMLA leave and the maintenance of \n     health benefits, to an eligible employee only under the terms \n     of the ``key employee'' exemption. Denial of reinstatement \n     must be necessary to prevent ``substantial and grievous \n     economic injury'' to the employing office's operations. The \n     employing office must notify the employee of the employee's \n     status as a ``key employee'' and of the employing office's \n     intent to deny reinstatement on that basis when the employing \n     office makes these determinations. If leave has started, the \n     employee must be given a reasonable opportunity to return to \n     work after being so notified. (See Sec. 825.219.)\n       (g) An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an \n     employing office is not protected by job restoration or \n     maintenance of health benefits provisions of the FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (h) If the employing office has a uniformly-applied policy \n     governing outside or supplemental employment, such a policy \n     may continue to apply to an employee while on FMLA leave. An \n     employing office which does not have such a policy may not \n     deny benefits to which an employee is entitled under FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA on this basis unless the FMLA \n     leave was fraudulently obtained as in paragraph (g) of this \n     section.\n\n\n      Subpart D--What Enforcement Mechanisms Does the CAA Provide?\n\n     Sec. 825.400  What can employees do who believe that their \n         rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have \n         been violated?\n       (a) To commence a proceeding, a covered employee alleging a \n     violation of the rights and protections of the FMLA made \n     applicable by the CAA must request counseling by the Office \n     of Compliance not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     alleged violation. If a covered employee misses this \n     deadline, the covered employee will be unable to obtain a \n     remedy under the CAA.\n       (b) The following procedures are available under title IV \n     of the CAA for covered employees who believe that their \n     rights under FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have been \n     violated:\n       (1) counseling;\n       (2) mediation; and\n       (3) election of either--\n       (A) a formal complaint, filed with the Office of \n     Compliance, and a hearing before a hearing officer, subject \n     to review by the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and judicial review in the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or\n       (B) a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Regulations of the Office of Compliance describing and \n     governing these procedures are found at [proposed rules can \n     be found at 141 Cong. Rec. S17012 (November 14, 1995)].\n     Sec. 825.401  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.402  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.403  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.404  [Reserved]\n\n\n                         Subpart E--[Reserved]\n\n      Subpart F--What Special Rules Apply to Employees of Schools?\n\n     Sec. 825.600  To whom do the special rules apply?\n       (a) Certain special rules apply to employees of ``local \n     educational agencies,'' including public school boards and \n     elementary schools under their jurisdiction, and private \n     elementary and secondary schools. The special rules do not \n     apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such as \n     colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.\n       (b) Educational institutions are covered by FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA (and these special rules). The usual \n     requirements for employees to be ``eligible'' apply.\n       (c) The special rules affect the taking of intermittent \n     leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the \n     end of an academic term (semester), by instructional \n     employees. ``Instructional employees'' are those whose \n     principal function is to teach and instruct students in a \n     class, a small group, or an individual setting. This term \n     includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, \n     driving instructors, and special education assistants such as \n     signers for the hearing impaired. It does not include, and \n     the special rules do not apply to, teacher assistants or \n     aides who do not have as their principal job actual teaching \n     or instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such \n     as counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists. It \n     also does not include cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, \n     or bus drivers.\n       (d) Special rules which apply to restoration to an \n     equivalent position apply to all employees of local \n     educational agencies.\n     Sec. 825.601  What limitations apply to the taking of \n         intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule?\n       (a) Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year \n     and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively \n     rather than intermittently. The period during the summer \n     vacation when the employee would not have been required to \n     report for duty is not counted against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA \n     leave at the end of the school year must be provided with any \n     benefits over the summer vacation that employees would \n     normally receive if they had been working at the end of the \n     school year.\n       (1) If an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule to \n     care for a family member, or for the employee's own serious \n     health condition, which is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for \n     more than 20\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\n     percent of the total number of working days over the period \n     the leave would extend, the employing office may require the \n     employee to choose either to:\n       (i) Take leave for a period or periods of a particular \n     duration, not greater than the duration of the planned \n     treatment; or\n       (ii) Transfer temporarily to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified, which has \n     equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates \n     recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular \n     position.\n       (2) These rules apply only to a leave involving more than \n     20 percent of the working days during the period over which \n     the leave extends. For example, if an instructional employee \n     who normally works five days each week needs to take two days \n     of FMLA leave per week over a period of several weeks, the \n     special rules would apply. Employees taking leave which \n     constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during \n     the leave period would not be subject to transfer to an \n     alternative position. ``Periods of a particular duration'' \n     means a block, or blocks, of time beginning no earlier \n     than the first day for which leave is needed and ending no \n     later than the last day on which leave is needed, and may \n     include one uninterrupted period of leave.\n       (b) If an instructional employee does not give required \n     notice of foreseeable FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.302) to be \n     taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the \n     employing office may require the employee to take leave of a \n     particular duration, or to transfer temporarily to an \n     alternative position. Alternatively, the employing office may \n     require the employee to delay the taking of leave until the \n     notice provision is met. See Sec. 825.207(h).\n     Sec. 825.602  What limitations apply to the taking of leave \n         near the end of an academic term?\n       (a) There are also different rules for instructional \n     employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end \n     of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and \n     less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules \n     apply except in circumstances when:\n       (1) An instructional employee begins leave more than five \n     weeks before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last at least three weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the three-\n     week period before the end of the term.\n       (2) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the five-week \n     period before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last more than two weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term.\n       (3) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the three-week \n     period before the end of a term, and the leave will last more \n     than five working days. The employing office may require the \n     employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term.\n       (b) For purposes of these provisions, ``academic term'' \n     means the school semester, which typically ends near the end \n     of the calendar year and the end of spring each school year. \n     In no case may a school have more than two academic terms or \n     semesters each year for purposes of FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA. An example of leave falling within these \n     provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of \n     leave to care for a family member which will begin three \n     weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the \n     employing office could require the employee to stay out on \n     leave until the end of the term.\n     Sec. 825.603  Is all leave taken during ``periods of a \n         particular duration'' counted against the FMLA leave \n         entitlement?\n       (a) If an employee chooses to take leave for ``periods of a \n     particular duration'' in the case of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave, the entire period of leave taken will count \n     as FMLA leave.\n       (b) In the case of an employee who is required to take \n     leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of \n     leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work \n     shall be charged against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. The employing office has the option not to \n     require the employee to stay on leave until the end of the \n     school term. Therefore, any additional leave required by the \n     employing office to the end of the school term is not counted \n     as FMLA leave; however, the employing office shall be \n     required to maintain the employee's group health insurance \n     and restore the employee to the same or equivalent job \n     including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.\n     Sec. 825.604  What special rules apply to restoration to ``an \n         equivalent position?''\n       The determination of how an employee is to be restored to \n     ``an equivalent position'' upon return from FMLA leave will \n     be made on the basis of ``established school board policies \n     and practices, private school policies and practices, and \n     collective bargaining agreements.'' The ``established \n     policies'' and collective bargaining agreements used as a \n     basis for restoration must be in writing, must be made known \n     to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must \n     clearly explain the employee's restoration rights upon return \n     from leave. Any established policy which is used as the basis \n     for restoration of an employee to ``an equivalent position'' \n     must provide substantially the same protections as provided \n     in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, for reinstated \n     employees. See Sec. 825.215. In other words, the policy or \n     collective bargaining agreement must provide for restoration \n     to an ``equivalent position'' with equivalent employment \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     For example, an employee may not be restored to a position \n     requiring additional licensure or certification.\n\n\n     Subpart G--How Do Other Laws, Employing Office Practices, and \nCollective Bargaining Agreements Affect Employee Rights Under the FMLA \n                     as Made Applicable by the CAA?\n\n     Sec. 825.700  What if an employing office provides more \n         generous benefits than required by FMLA as Made \n         Applicable by the CAA?\n       (a) An employing office must observe any employment benefit \n     program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave \n     rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA. \n     Conversely, the rights established by the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, may not be diminished by any \n     employment benefit program or plan. For example, a provision \n     of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which provides for \n     reinstatement to a position that is not equivalent because of \n     seniority (e.g., provides lesser pay) is superseded by FMLA. \n     If an employing office provides greater unpaid family leave \n     rights than are afforded by FMLA, the employing office is not \n     required to extend additional rights afforded by FMLA, such \n     as maintenance of health benefits (other than through COBRA \n     or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable), to the \n     additional leave period not covered by FMLA. If an employee \n     takes paid or unpaid leave and the employing office does not \n     designate the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken does not \n     count against an employee's FMLA entitlement.\n       (b) Nothing in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     prevents an employing office from amending existing leave and \n     employee benefit programs, provided they comply with FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA. However, nothing in the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, is intended to discourage \n     employing offices from adopting or retaining more generous \n     leave policies.\n       (c) [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.701  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 825.702  How does FMLA affect anti-discrimination laws \n         as applied by section 201 of the CAA?\n       (a) Nothing in FMLA modifies or affects any applicable law \n     prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, \n     color, national origin, sex, age, or disability (e.g., Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the \n     Pregnancy Discrimination Act), as made applicable by the CAA. \n     FMLA's legislative history explains that FMLA is ``not \n     intended to modify or affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n     as amended, the regulations concerning employment which have \n     been promulgated pursuant to that statute, or the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the regulations issued \n     under that act. Thus, the leave provisions of the [FMLA] are \n     wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations \n     of employers covered under the [ADA] . . . or the Federal \n     government itself. The purpose of the FMLA is to make leave \n     available to eligible employees and employing offices within \n     its coverage, and not to limit already existing rights and \n     protection.'' S. Rep. No. 3, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1993). \n     An employing office must therefore provide leave under \n     whichever statutory provision provides the greater rights to \n     employees.\n       (b) If an employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), the employing office must make \n     reasonable accommodations, etc., barring undue hardship, in \n     accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employing \n     office must afford an employee his or her FMLA rights. ADA's \n     ``disability'' and FMLA's ``serious health condition'' are \n     different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. FMLA \n     entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 12-\n     month period, whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount \n     of leave, barring undue hardship, as a reasonable \n     accommodation. FMLA requires employing offices to maintain \n     employees' group health plan coverage during FMLA leave on \n     the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if \n     the employee had been continuously employed during the leave \n     period, whereas ADA does not require maintenance of health \n     insurance unless other employees receive health insurance \n     during leave under the same circumstances.\n       (c)(1) A reasonable accommodation under the ADA might be \n     accomplished by providing an individual with a disability \n     with a part-time job with no health benefits, assuming the \n     employing office did not ordinarily provide health insurance \n     for part-time employees. However, FMLA would permit an \n     employee to work a reduced leave schedule until the \n     equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave were used, with group \n     health benefits maintained during this period. FMLA permits \n     an employing office to temporarily transfer an employee who \n     is taking leave intermittently\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\n     or on a reduced leave schedule to an alternative position, \n     whereas the ADA allows an accommodation of reassignment to an \n     equivalent, vacant position only if the employee cannot \n     perform the essential functions of the employee's present \n     position and an accommodation is not possible in the \n     employee's present position, or an accommodation in the \n     employee's present position would cause an undue hardship. \n     The examples in the following paragraphs of this section \n     demonstrate how the two laws would interact with respect to a \n     qualified individual with a disability.\n       (2) A qualified individual with a disability who is also an \n     ``eligible employee'' entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 \n     weeks of medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which \n     the employing office grants because it is not an undue \n     hardship. The employing office advises the employee that the \n     10 weeks of leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and \n     will count towards the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. \n     This designation does not prevent the parties from also \n     treating the leave as a reasonable accommodation and \n     reinstating the employee into the same job, as required by \n     the ADA, rather than an equivalent position under FMLA, if \n     that is the greater right available to the employee. At \n     the same time, the employee would be entitled under FMLA \n     to have the employing office maintain group health plan \n     coverage during the leave, as that requirement provides \n     the greater right to the employee.\n       (3) If the same employee needed to work part-time (a \n     reduced leave schedule) after returning to his or her same \n     job, the employee would still be entitled under FMLA to have \n     group health plan coverage maintained for the remainder of \n     the two-week equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, \n     notwithstanding an employing office policy that part-time \n     employees do not receive health insurance. This employee \n     would be entitled under the ADA to reasonable accommodations \n     to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of \n     the part-time position. In addition, because the employee is \n     working a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, \n     the employee would be shielded from FMLA's provision for \n     temporary assignment to a different alternative position. \n     Once the employee has exhausted his or her remaining FMLA \n     leave entitlement while working the reduced (part-time) \n     schedule, if the employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability, and if the employee is unable to return to the \n     same full-time position at that time, the employee might \n     continue to work part-time as a reasonable accommodation, \n     barring undue hardship; the employee would then be entitled \n     to only those employment benefits ordinarily provided by the \n     employing office to part-time employees.\n       (4) At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, an employing \n     office is required under FMLA to reinstate the employee in \n     the same or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay and \n     benefits, to that which the employee held when leave \n     commenced. The employing office's FMLA obligations would be \n     satisfied if the employing office offered the employee an \n     equivalent full-time position. If the employee were unable to \n     perform the essential functions of that equivalent position \n     even with reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, \n     the ADA may require the employing office to make a reasonable \n     accommodation at that time by allowing the employee to work \n     part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant \n     position, barring undue hardship.\n       (d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an employing \n     office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitlement, require an \n     employee to take a job with a reasonable accommodation. \n     However, ADA may require that an employing office offer an \n     employee the opportunity to take such a position. An \n     employing office may not change the essential functions of \n     the job in order to deny FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220(b).\n       (2) An employee may be on a workers' compensation absence \n     due to an on-the-job injury or illness which also qualifies \n     as a serious health condition under FMLA. The workers' \n     compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently \n     (subject to proper notice and designation by the employing \n     office). At some point the health care provider providing \n     medical care pursuant to the workers' compensation injury may \n     certify the employee is able to return to work in a ``light \n     duty'' position. If the employing office offers such a \n     position, the employee is permitted but not required to \n     accept the position (see Sec. 825.220(d)). As a result, the \n     employee may no longer qualify for payments from the workers' \n     compensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled to \n     continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the employee is \n     able to return to the same or equivalent job the employee \n     left or until the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement is \n     exhausted. See Sec. 825.207(d)(2). If the employee returning \n     from the workers' compensation injury is a qualified \n     individual with a disability, he or she will have rights \n     under the ADA.\n       (e) If an employing office requires certifications of an \n     employee's fitness for duty to return to work, as permitted \n     by FMLA under a uniform policy, it must comply with the ADA \n     requirement that a fitness for duty physical be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity.\n       (f) Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \n     amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, an employing office should provide the \n     same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employing \n     office provides to other employees with short-term \n     disabilities. Because Title VII does not require employees to \n     be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an \n     employee employed for less than 12 months by any employing \n     office (and, therefore, not an ``eligible'' employee under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA) may not be denied \n     maternity leave if the employing office normally provides \n     short-term disability benefits to employees with the same \n     tenure who are experiencing other short-term disabilities.\n       (g) For further information on Federal anti-discrimination \n     laws applied by section 201 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311), \n     including Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA, \n     individuals are encouraged to contact the Office of \n     Compliance.\n\n\n                         Subpart H--Definitions\n\n     Sec. 825.800  Definitions.\n       For purposes of this part:\n       ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.).\n       CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (Pub.

A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (i) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care \n     provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider;\n       (ii) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (iii) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (4) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the continuing \n     supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment \n     by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (5) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       Covered employee--The term ``covered employee'', as defined \n     in the CAA, means any employee of--(1) the House of \n     Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol Guide \n     Service; (4) the Capitol Police; (5) the Congressional Budget \n     Office; (6) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (7) \n     the Office of the Attending Physician; (8) the Office of \n     Compliance; or (9) the Office of Technology Assessment.\n       Eligible employee--The term ``eligible employee'', as \n     defined in the CAA, means a covered employee who has been \n     employed in any employing office for 12 months and for at \n     least 1,250 hours of employment during the previous 12 \n     months.\n       Employ means to suffer or permit to work.\n       Employee means an employee as defined in the CAA and \n     includes an applicant for employment and a former employee.\n       Employee employed in an instructional capacity.

Instrumental \n     activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, \n     shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, \n     maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, \n     using a post office, etc.\n       Instructional employee: See Teacher.\n       Intermittent leave means leave taken in separate periods of \n     time due to a single illness or injury, rather than for one \n     continuous period of time, and may include leave of periods \n     from an hour or more to several weeks. Examples of \n     intermittent leave would include leave taken on an occasional \n     basis for medical appointments, or leave taken several days \n     at a time spread over a period of six months, such as for \n     chemotherapy.\n       Mental disability: See Physical or mental disability.\n       Office of Compliance means the independent office \n     established in the legislative branch under section 301 of \n     the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381).\n       Parent means the biological parent of an employee or an \n     individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to an \n     employee when the employee was a child.\n       Physical or mental disability means a physical or mental \n     impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major \n     life activities of an individual. See the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by section \n     201(a)(3) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)).\n       Reduced leave schedule means a leave schedule that reduces \n     the usual number of hours per workweek, or hours per workday, \n     of an employee.\n       Secretary means the Secretary of Labor or authorized \n     representative.\n       Serious health condition entitling an employee to FMLA \n     leave means: (1) an illness, injury, impairment, or physical \n     or mental condition that involves:\n       (i) Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, \n     hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any \n     period of incapacity (for purposes of this section, defined \n     to mean inability to work, attend school or perform other \n     regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom), or any subsequent \n     treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or\n       (ii) Continuing treatment by a health care provider. A \n     serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a \n     health care provider includes:\n       (A) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery \n     therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days, \n     including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity \n     relating to the same condition, that also involves:\n       (1) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       (B) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (C) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (1) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care \n     provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider;\n       (2) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (3) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (D) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the continuing \n     supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment \n     by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (E) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (2) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (1) of this \n     definition includes (but is not limited to) examinations to \n     determine if a serious health condition exists and \n     evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include \n     routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental \n     examinations. Under paragraph (1)(ii)(A)(2) of this \n     definition, a regimen of continuing treatment includes, for \n     example, a course of prescription medication (e.g., an \n     antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve \n     or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). A regimen \n     of continuing treatment that includes the taking of over-the-\n     counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, or \n     salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (3) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\n     aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than \n     migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal \n     disease, etc., are examples of conditions that do not meet \n     the definition of a serious health condition and do not \n     qualify for FMLA leave. Restorative dental or plastic surgery \n     after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are serious \n     health conditions provided all the other conditions of this \n     regulation are met. Mental illness resulting from stress or \n     allergies may be serious health conditions, but only if all \n     the conditions of this section are met.\n       (4) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (5) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (1)(ii)(B) or (C) of this definition qualify for FMLA leave \n     even though the employee or the immediate family member does \n     not receive treatment from a health care provider during the \n     absence, and even if the absence does not last more than \n     three days. For example, an employee with asthma may be \n     unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma \n     attack or because the employee's health care provider has \n     advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count \n     exceeds a certain level. An employee who is pregnant may be \n     unable to report to work because of severe morning sickness.\n       Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person \n     standing in loco parentis, who is under 18 years of age or 18 \n     years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a \n     mental or physical disability.\n       Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized \n     under State law for purposes of marriage in the State where \n     the employee resides, including common law marriage in States \n     where it is recognized.\n       State means any State of the United States or the District \n     of Columbia or any Territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n       Teacher (or employee employed in an instructional capacity, \n     or instructional employee) means an employee employed \n     principally in an instructional capacity by an educational \n     agency or school whose principal function is to teach and \n     instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual \n     setting, and includes athletic coaches, driving instructors, \n     and special education assistants such as signers for the \n     hearing impaired. The term does not include teacher \n     assistants or aides who do not have as their principal \n     function actual teaching or instructing, nor auxiliary \n     personnel such as counselors, psychologists, curriculum \n     specialists, cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, bus \n     drivers, or other primarily noninstructional employees.\n\n                   Appendix A to Part 825--[Reserved]\n\n   Appendix B to Part 825--Certification of Physician or Practitioner\n\n\nCertification of Health Care Provider (Family and Medical Leave Act of \n  1993 as Made Applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act of \n                                 1995)\n\n       1.

Hospital Care: Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) \n     in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, \n     including any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in \n     connection with or consequent to such inpatient care.\n       2. Absence Plus Treatment:\n       (a) A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive \n     calendar days (including any subsequent treatment or period \n     of incapacity relating to the same condition), that also \n     involves:\n       (1) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider: or\n       (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       3.

You have a minimum 30-day (or, indicate longer period, \n     if applicable) grace period in which to make premium \n     payments. If payment is not made timely, your group health \n     insurance may be cancelled, provided we notify you in writing \n     at least 15 days before the date that your health coverage \n     will lapse, or, at our option, we may pay your share of the \n     premiums during FMLA leave, and recover these payments from \n     you upon your return to work.

On April 15, 1996, pursuant to \n     section 304(c) of the CAA, the House and the Senate agreed to \n     resolutions approving the final regulations. Specifically, \n     the Senate agreed to S. Res. 242, to provide for the approval \n     of final regulations that are applicable to the Senate and \n     the employees of the Senate; the House agreed to H. Res. 400, \n     to provide for the approval of final regulations that are \n     applicable to the House and the employees of the House; and \n     the House and the Senate agreed to S. Con. Res. 51, to \n     provide for approval of final regulations that are applicable \n     to employing offices and employees other than those offices \n     and employees of the House and the Senate. Accordingly, \n     pursuant to section 304(d) of the CAA, the Board submits \n     these regulations to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     for issuance by publication in the Congressional Record.\n       Pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 304(d) of the CAA, the \n     Board finds good cause for the regulations to become \n     effective on April 16, 1996, rather than 60 days after \n     issuance. Were the regulations not effective immediately upon \n     the expiration of the interim regulations on April 15, 1996, \n     covered employees, employing offices and the Office of \n     Compliance would be forced to operate under the same kind of \n     regulatory uncertainty that the Board sought to avoid by \n     adopting interim regulations effective as of January 23, \n     1996, the effective date of the relevant provisions of the \n     CAA.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 19th day of April, 1996.\n                                                    Glen D.

Section 204(a) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1314(a) provides that no employing office may require \n     any covered employee (including a covered employee who does \n     not work in that employing office) to take a lie detector \n     test where such test would be prohibited if required by an \n     employer under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of section 3 of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA), 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2002(1), (2) or (3). The purpose of this part is to set \n     forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of Section \n     204 of the CAA.\n       Subpart A contains the provisions generally applicable to \n     covered employers, including the requirements relating to the \n     prohibitions on lie detector use. Subpart B sets forth rules \n     regarding the statutory exemptions from application of \n     section 204 of the CAA. Subpart C sets forth the restrictions \n     on polygraph usage under such exemptions. Subpart D sets \n     forth the rules on recordkeeping and the disclosure of \n     polygraph test information.\n     Sec. 1.2 Definitions\n       For purposes of this part:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) EPPA means the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of \n     1988 (Pub. L. 100-347, 102 Stat. 646, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2001-2009) as applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices by Section 204 of the CAA.\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\n       (c) The term covered employee means any employee of (1) the \n     House of Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (4) the Congressional Budget Office; (5) the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (6) the Office of the \n     Attending Physician; (7) the Office of Compliance; or (8) the \n     Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (d) The term employee includes an applicant for employment \n     and a former employee.\n       (e) The term employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       (f) The term employee of the Capitol Police includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (g) The term employee of the House of Representatives \n     includes an individual occupying a position the pay for which \n     is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (c) above.\n       (h) The term employee of the Senate includes any employee \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but \n     not any such individual employed by any entity listed in \n     subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph (c) above.\n       (i) The term employing office means (1) the personal office \n     of a Member of the House of Representatives or of a Senator; \n     (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate \n     or a joint committee; (3) any other office headed by a person \n     with the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set \n     the terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives or the Senate; or \n     (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the \n     Attending Physician, the Office of Compliance, and the Office \n     of Technology Assessment. The term employing office includes \n     any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of \n     an employing office in relation to an employee or prospective \n     employee. A polygraph examiner either employed for or whose \n     services are retained for the sole purpose of administering \n     polygraph tests ordinarily would not be deemed an employing \n     office with respect to the examinees. Any reference to \n     ``employer'' in these regulations includes employing offices.\n       (j) (1) The term lie detector means a polygraph, \n     deceptograph, voice stress analyzer, psychological stress \n     evaluator, or any other similar device (whether mechanical or \n     electrical) that is used, or the results of which are used, \n     for the purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding \n     the honesty or dishonesty of an individual. Voice \n     stress analyzers, or psychological stress evaluators, \n     include any systems that utilize voice stress analysis, \n     whether or not an opinion on honesty or dishonesty is \n     specifically rendered. (2) The term lie detector does not \n     include medical tests used to determine the presence or \n     absence of controlled substances or alcohol in bodily \n     fluids. Also not included in the definition of lie \n     detector are written or oral tests commonly referred to as \n     ``honesty'' or ``paper and pencil'' tests, machine-scored \n     or otherwise; and graphology tests commonly referred to as \n     handwriting tests.\n       (k) The term polygraph means an instrument that--\n       (1) Records continuously, visually, permanently, and \n     simultaneously changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, and \n     electrodermal patterns as minimum instrumentation standards; \n     and\n       (2) Is used, or the results of which are used, for the \n     purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding the \n     honesty or dishonesty of an individual.\n       (l) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (m) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.3 Coverage.\n       The coverage of Section 204 of the Act extends to any \n     ``covered employee'' or ``covered employing office'' without \n     regard to the number of employees or the employing office's \n     effect on interstate commerce.\n     Sec. 1.4 Prohibitions on lie detector use.\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA provides that, subject to the \n     exemptions of the EPPA incorporated into the CAA under \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, as set forth in Sec. 1.10 through \n     1.12 of this Part, employing offices are prohibited from:\n       (1) Requiring, requesting, suggesting or causing, directly \n     or indirectly, any covered employee or prospective employee \n     to take or submit to a lie detector test;\n       (2) Using, accepting, or inquiring about the results of a \n     lie detector test of any covered employee or prospective \n     employee; and\n       (3) Discharging, disciplining, discriminating against, \n     denying employment or promotion, or threatening any covered \n     employee or prospective employee to take such action for \n     refusal or failure to take or submit to such test, or on the \n     basis of the results of a test. The above prohibitions apply \n     irrespective of whether the covered employee referred to in \n     paragraphs (1), (2) or (3), above, works in that employing \n     office.\n       (b) An employing office that reports a theft or other \n     incident involving economic loss to police or other law \n     enforcement authorities is not engaged in conduct subject to \n     the prohibitions under paragraph (a) of this section if, \n     during the normal course of a subsequent investigation, such \n     authorities deem it necessary to administer a polygraph \n     test to a covered employee(s) suspected of involvement in \n     the reported incident. Employing offices that cooperate \n     with police authorities during the course of their \n     investigations into criminal misconduct are likewise not \n     deemed engaged in prohibitive conduct provided that such \n     cooperation is passive in nature. For example, it is not \n     uncommon for police authorities to request employees \n     suspected of theft or criminal activity to submit to a \n     polygraph test during the employee's tour of duty since, \n     as a general rule, suspect employees are often difficult \n     to locate away from their place of employment. Allowing a \n     test on the employing office's premises, releasing a \n     covered employee during working hours to take a test at \n     police headquarters, and other similar types of \n     cooperation at the request of the police authorities would \n     not be construed as ``requiring, requesting, suggesting, \n     or causing, directly or indirectly, any covered employee * \n     * * to take or submit to a lie detector test.'' \n     Cooperation of this type must be distinguished from actual \n     participation in the testing of employees suspected of \n     wrongdoing, either through the administration of a test by \n     the employing office at the request or direction of police \n     authorities, or through reimbursement by the employing \n     office of tests administered by police authorities to \n     employees. In some communities, it may be a practice of \n     police authorities to request testing by employing offices \n     of employees before a police investigation is initiated on \n     a reported incident. In other communities, police \n     examiners are available to covered employing offices, on a \n     cost reimbursement basis, to conduct tests on employees \n     suspected by an employing office of wrongdoing. All such \n     conduct on the part of employing offices is deemed within \n     the prohibitions of section 204 of the CAA.\n       (c) The receipt by an employing office of information from \n     a polygraph test administered by police authorities pursuant \n     to an investigation is prohibited by section 3(2) of the \n     EPPA. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)\n       (d) The simulated use of a polygraph instrument so as to \n     lead an individual to believe that an actual test is being or \n     may be performed (e.g., to elicit confessions or admissions \n     of guilt) constitutes conduct prohibited by paragraph (a) of \n     this section. Such use includes the connection of a covered \n     employee or prospective employee to the instrument without \n     any intention of a diagnostic purpose, the placement of the \n     instrument in a room used for interrogation unconnected to \n     the covered employee or prospective employee, or the mere \n     suggestion that the instrument may be used during the course \n     of the interview.\n       (e) The Capitol Police may not require a covered employee \n     not employed by the Capitol Police to take a lie detector \n     test (on its own initiative or at the request of another \n     employing office) except where the Capitol Police administers \n     such lie detector test as part of an ``ongoing \n     investigation'' by the Capitol Police. For the purpose of \n     this subsection, the definition of ``ongoing investigation'' \n     contained section 1.12(b) shall apply.\n     Sec. 1.5 Effect on other laws or agreements.\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA does not preempt any otherwise \n     applicable provision of federal law or any rule or regulation \n     of the House or Senate or any negotiated collective \n     bargaining agreement that prohibits lie detector tests or is \n     more restrictive with respect to the use of lie detector \n     tests.\n       (b)(1) This provision applies to all aspects of the use of \n     lie detector tests, including procedural safeguards, the use \n     of test results, the rights and remedies provided examinees, \n     and the rights, remedies, and responsibilities of examiners \n     and employing offices.\n       (2) For example, a collective bargaining agreement that \n     provides greater protection to an examinee would apply in \n     addition to the protection provided in section 204 of the \n     CAA.\n     Sec. 1.6 Notice of protection.\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for posting, a notice \n     explaining the provisions of section 204 of the CAA. Copies \n     of such notice may be obtained from the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.7 Authority of the Board.\n       Pursuant to sections 204 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections of the EPPA. Section 204(c) directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing section 204 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsections (a) and (b) [of section 204 of the \n     CAA] except insofar as the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown . . . that a modification of such regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under this section.'' The regulations issued \n     by the Board herein are on all matters for which section 204 \n     of the CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, \n     it is the Board's considered judgment, based on the \n     information available to it at the time of promulgation of \n     these regulations, that, with the exception of the \n     regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsections (a) and (b) [of section 204 of the CAA].''\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover such changes, \n     in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute an \n     interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     Sec. 1.8 Employment relationship.\n       Subject to the exemptions incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f), section 204 applies the prohibitions on the \n     use of lie detectors by employing offices with respect to \n     covered employees irrespective of whether a covered employee \n     works in that employing office. Sections 101(3), (4) and 204 \n     of the CAA also apply EPPA prohibitions against \n     discrimination to applicants for employment and former \n     employees of a covered employing office. For example, an \n     employee may quit rather than take a lie detector test. The \n     employing office cannot discriminate or threaten to \n     discriminate in any manner against that person (such as by \n     providing bad references in the future) because of that \n     person's refusal to be tested. Similarly, an employing office \n     cannot discriminate or threaten to discriminate in any \n     manner against that person because that person files a \n     complaint, institutes a proceeding, testifies in a \n     proceeding, or exercises any right under section 204 of \n     the CAA. (See section 207 of the CAA.)\n\n\n                         Subpart B--Exemptions\n\n     Sec. 1.10  Exclusion for employees of the Capitol Police. \n         [Reserved]\n     Sec. 1.11  Exemption for national defense and security.\n       (a) The exemptions allowing for the administration of lie \n     detector tests in the following paragraphs (b) through (e) of \n     this section apply only to the Federal Government; they do \n     not allow covered employing offices to administer such tests. \n     For the purposes of this section, the term ``Federal \n     Government'' means any agency or entity within the Federal \n     Government authorized to administer polygraph examinations \n     which is otherwise exempt from coverage under section 7(a) of \n     the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2006(a).\n       (b) Section 7(b)(1) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA \n     under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in the \n     EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of any \n     lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any counterintelligence function, to any \n     expert, consultant or employee of any contractor under \n     contract with the Department of Defense; or with the \n     Department of Energy, in connection with the atomic energy \n     defense activities of such Department.\n       (c) Section 7(b)(2)(A) of the EPPA, incorporated into the \n     CAA under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in \n     the EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of \n     any lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any intelligence or counterintelligence \n     function of the National Security Agency, the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, or the Central Intelligence Agency, to \n     any individual employed by, assigned to, or detailed to any \n     such agency; or any expert or consultant under contract to \n     any such agency; or any employee of a contractor to such \n     agency; or any individual applying for a position in any such \n     agency; or any individual assigned to a space where sensitive \n     cryptologic information is produced, processed, or stored for \n     any such agency.\n       (d) Section 7(b)(2)(B) of the EPPA, incorporated into the \n     CAA under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in \n     the EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of \n     any lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any intelligence or counterintelligence \n     function, to any covered employee whose duties involve access \n     to information that has been classified at the level of top \n     secret or designated as being within a special access program \n     under section 4.2(a) of Executive Order 12356 (or a successor \n     Executive Order).\n       (c) Counterintelligence for purposes of the above \n     paragraphs means information gathered and activities \n     conducted to protect against espionage and other clandestine \n     intelligence activities, sabotage, terrorist activities, or \n     assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign \n     governments, or foreign or domestic organizations or persons.\n       (d) Lie detector tests of persons described in the above \n     paragraphs will be administered in accordance with applicable \n     Department of Defense directives and regulations, or other \n     regulations and directives governing the use of such tests by \n     the United States Government, as applicable.\n     Sec. 1.12  Exemption for employing offices conducting \n         investigations of economic loss or injury.\n       (a) Section 7(d) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA \n     under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides a limited exemption \n     from the general prohibition on lie detector use for \n     employers conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss \n     or injury to the employer's business. An employing office may \n     request an employee, subject to the conditions set forth in \n     sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and Secs. 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.35 of this part, to submit to a \n     polygraph test, but no other type of lie detector test, only \n     if--\n       (1) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation involving economic loss or injury to the \n     employing office's operations, such as theft, embezzlement, \n     misappropriation or an act of unlawful industrial espionage \n     or sabotage;\n       (2) The employee had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation;\n       (3) The employing office has a reasonable suspicion that \n     the employee was involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation;\n       (4) The employing office provides the examinee with a \n     statement, in a language understood by the examinee, prior to \n     the test which fully explains with particularity the specific \n     incident or activity being investigated and the basis for \n     testing particular employees and which contains, at a \n     minimum:\n       (i) An identification with particularity of the specific \n     economic loss or injury to the operations of the employing \n     office;\n       (ii) A description of the employee's access to the property \n     that is the subject of the investigation;\n       (iii) A description in detail of the basis of the employing \n     office's reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved \n     in the incident or activity under investigation; and\n       (iv) Signature of a person (other than a polygraph \n     examiner) authorized to legally bind the employing office; \n     and\n       (5) The employing office retains a copy of the statement \n     and proof of service described in paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section for at least 3 years.\n       (b) For the exemption to apply, the condition of an ongoing \n     investigation must be met. As used in section 7(d) of the \n     EPPA, the ongoing investigation must be of a specific \n     incident or activity. Thus, for example, an employing office \n     may not request that an employee or employees submit to a \n     polygraph test in an effort to determine whether or not any \n     thefts have occurred. Such random testing by an employing \n     office is precluded by the EPPA. Further, because the \n     exemption is limited to a specific incident or activity, an \n     employing office is precluded from using the exemption in \n     situations where the so-called ``ongoing investigation'' is \n     continuous. For example, the fact that items are frequently \n     missing would not be a sufficient basis, standing alone, for \n     administering a polygraph test. Even if the employing office \n     can establish that unusually high amounts of property are \n     missing in a given month, this, in and of itself, would \n     not be a sufficient basis to meet the specific incident \n     requirement. On the other hand, polygraph testing in \n     response to missing property would be permitted where \n     additional evidence is obtained through subsequent \n     investigation of specific items missing through \n     intentional wrongdoing, and a ``reasonable suspicion that \n     the employee to be polygraphed was involved'' in the \n     incident under investigation. Administering a polygraph \n     test in circumstances where the missing property is merely \n     unspecified, statistical shortages, without identification \n     of a specific incident or activity that produced the \n     missing property and a reasonable suspicion that the \n     employee was involved, would amount to little more than a \n     fishing expedition and is prohibited by the EPPA as \n     applied to covered employees and employing offices by the \n     CAA.\n       (c)(1)(i) The terms economic loss or injury to the \n     employing office's operations include both direct and \n     indirect economic loss or injury.\n       (ii) Direct loss or injury includes losses or injuries \n     resulting from theft, embezzlement, misappropriation, \n     espionage or sabotage. These examples, cited in the EPPA, are \n     intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. Another \n     specific incident which would constitute direct economic loss \n     or injury is the misappropriation of confidential or trade \n     secret information.\n       (iii) Indirect loss or injury includes the use of an \n     employing office's operations to commit a crime, such as \n     check-kiting or money laundering. In such cases, the ongoing \n     investigation must be limited to criminal activity that has \n     already occurred, and to use of the employing office's \n     operations (and not simply the use of the premises) for such \n     activity. For example, the use of an employing office's \n     vehicles, warehouses, computers or equipment to smuggle or \n     facilitate the importing of illegal substances constitutes an \n     indirect loss or injury to the employing office's business \n     operations. Conversely, the mere fact that an illegal act \n     occurs on the employing office's premises (such as a drug \n     transaction that takes place in the employing office's \n     parking lot or rest room) does not constitute an indirect \n     economic loss or injury to the employing office.\n       (iv) Indirect loss or injury also includes theft or injury \n     to property of another for which the employing office \n     exercises fiduciary, managerial or security responsibility, \n     or where the office has custody of the property (but not \n     property of other offices to which the employees have access \n     by virtue of the employment relationship). For example, if a \n     maintenance employee of the manager of an apartment building \n     steals jewelry from a tenant's apartment, the theft results \n     in an indirect economic loss or injury to the employer \n     because of the manager's management responsibility with \n     respect to the tenant's apartment. A messenger on a delivery \n     of confidential business reports for a client firm who steals \n     the reports causes an indirect economic loss or injury to the \n     messenger service because the messenger service is custodian \n     of the client firm's reports, and\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\n     therefore is responsible for their security. Similarly, the \n     theft of property protected by a security service employer is \n     considered an economic loss or injury to that employer.\n       (v) A theft or injury to a client firm does not constitute \n     an indirect loss or injury to an employing office unless that \n     employing office has custody of, or management, or security \n     responsibility for, the property of the client that was lost \n     or stolen or injured. For example, a cleaning contractor has \n     no responsibility for the money at a client bank. If money is \n     stolen from the bank by one of the cleaning contractor's \n     employees, the cleaning contractor does not suffer an \n     indirect loss or injury.\n       (vi) Indirect loss or injury does not include loss or \n     injury which is merely threatened or potential, e.g., a \n     threatened or potential loss of an advantageous business \n     relationship.\n       (2) Economic losses or injuries which are the result of \n     unintentional or lawful conduct would not serve as a basis \n     for the administration of a polygraph test. Thus, apparently \n     unintentional losses or injuries stemming from truck, car, \n     workplace, or other similar type accidents or routine \n     inventory or cash register shortages would not meet the \n     economic loss or injury requirement. Any economic loss \n     incident to lawful union or employee activity also would not \n     satisfy this requirement.\n       (3) It is the operations of the employing office which must \n     suffer the economic loss or injury. Thus, a theft committed \n     by one employee against another employee of the same \n     employing office would not satisfy the requirement.\n       (d) While nothing in the EPPA as applied by the CAA \n     prohibits the use of medical tests to determine the presence \n     of controlled substances or alcohol in bodily fluids, the \n     section 7(d) exemption of the EPPA does not permit the use of \n     a polygraph test to learn whether an employee has used drugs \n     or alcohol, even where such possible use may have contributed \n     to an economic loss to the employing office (e.g., an \n     accident involving an employing office's vehicle).\n       (e) Section 7(d)(2) of the EPPA provides that, as a \n     condition for the use of the exemption, the employee must \n     have had access to the property that is the subject of the \n     investigation.\n       (1) The word access, as used in section 7(d)(2), refers to \n     the opportunity which an employee had to cause, or to aid or \n     abet in causing, the specific economic loss or injury under \n     investigation. The term ``access'', thus, includes more than \n     direct or physical contact during the course of employment. \n     For example, as a general matter, all employees working in or \n     with authority to enter a property storage area have \n     ``access'' to unsecured property in the area. All employees \n     with the combination to a safe have ``access'' to the \n     property in a locked safe. Employees also have ``access'' who \n     have the ability to divert possession or otherwise affect the \n     disposition of the property that is the subject of \n     investigation. For example, a bookkeeper in a jewelry store \n     with access to inventory records may aid or abet a clerk who \n     steals an expensive watch by removing the watch from the \n     employing office's inventory records. In such a situation, it \n     is clear that the bookkeeper effectively has ``access'' to \n     the property that is the subject of the investigation. (2) As \n     used in section 7(d)(2), property refers to specifically \n     identifiable property, but also includes such things of value \n     as security codes and computer data, and proprietary, \n     financial or technical information, such as trade secrets, \n     which by its availability to competitors or others would \n     cause economic harm to the employing office. (f)(1) As used \n     in section 7(d)(3), the term ``reasonable suspicion'' refers \n     to an observable, articulable basis in fact which indicates \n     that a particular employee was involved in, or responsible \n     for, an economic loss. Access in the sense of possible or \n     potential opportunity, standing alone, does not constitute a \n     basis for ``reasonable suspicion.'' Information from a co-\n     worker, or an employee's behavior, demeanor, or conduct may \n     be factors in the basis for reasonable suspicion. Likewise, \n     inconsistencies between facts, claims, or statements that \n     surface during an investigation can serve as a sufficient \n     basis for reasonable suspicion. While access or opportunity, \n     standing alone, does not constitute a basis for ``reasonable \n     suspicion'', the totality of circumstances surrounding the \n     access or opportunity (such as its unauthorized or unusual \n     nature or the fact that access was limited to a single \n     individual) may constitute a factor in determining whether \n     there is a reasonable suspicion.\n       (2) For example, in an investigation of a theft of an \n     expensive piece of jewelry, an employee authorized to open \n     the establishment's safe no earlier than 9 a.m., in order to \n     place the jewelry in a window display case, is observed \n     opening the safe at 7:30 a.m. In such a situation, the \n     opening of the safe by the employee one and one-half hours \n     prior to the specified time may serve as the basis for \n     reasonable suspicion. On the other hand, in the example \n     given, if the employee is asked to bring the piece of jewelry \n     to his or her office at 7:30 a.m., and the employee then \n     opened the safe and reported the jewelry missing, such \n     access, standing alone, would not constitute a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved in the \n     incident unless access to the safe was limited solely to the \n     employee. If no one other than the employee possessed the \n     combination to the safe, and all other possible explanations \n     for the loss are ruled out, such as a break-in, a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion may be formulated based on sole access \n     by one employee.\n       (3) The employing office has the burden of establishing \n     that the specific individual or individuals to be tested are \n     ``reasonably suspected'' of involvement in the specific \n     economic loss or injury for the requirement in section \n     7(d)(3) of the EPPA to be met.\n       (g)(1) As discussed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, \n     section 7(d)(4) of the EPPA sets forth what information, at a \n     minimum, must be provided to an employee if the employing \n     office wishes to claim the exemption.\n       (2) The statement required under paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section must be received by the employee at least 48 hours, \n     excluding weekend days and holidays, prior to the time of the \n     examination. The statement must set forth the time and date \n     of receipt by the employee and be verified by the employee's \n     signature. This will provide the employee with adequate pre-\n     test notice of the specific incident or activity being \n     investigated and afford the employee sufficient time prior to \n     the test to obtain and consult with legal counsel or an \n     employee representative.\n       (3) The statement to be provided to the employee must set \n     forth with particularity the specific incident or activity \n     being investigated and the basis for testing particular \n     employees. Section 7(d)(4)(A) of the EPPA requires \n     specificity beyond the mere assertion of general statements \n     regarding economic loss, employee access, and reasonable \n     suspicion. For example, an employing office's assertion that \n     an expensive watch was stolen, and that the employee had \n     access to the watch and is therefore a suspect, would not \n     meet the ``with particularity'' criterion. If the basis for \n     an employing office's requesting an employee (or employees) \n     to take a polygraph test is not articulated with \n     particularity, and reduced to writing, then the standard is \n     not met. The identity of a co-worker or other individual \n     providing information used to establish reasonable suspicion \n     need not be revealed in the statement.\n       (4) It is further required that the statement provided to \n     the examinee be signed by the employing office, or an \n     employee or other representative of the employing office with \n     authority to legally bind the employing office. The person \n     signing the statement must not be a polygraph examiner unless \n     the examiner is acting solely in the capacity of an employing \n     office with respect to his or her own employees and does not \n     conduct the examination. The standard would not be met, and \n     the exemption would not apply if the person signing the \n     statement is not authorized to legally bind the employing \n     office.\n       (h) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in Secs. 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employing office to \n     remedial actions, as provided for in section 6(c) of the \n     EPPA.\n     Sec. 1.13  Exemption of employing offices authorized to \n         manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled \n         substances.\n       (a) Section 7(f) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, provides an exemption from the \n     EPPA's general prohibition regarding the use of polygraph \n     tests for employers authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense a controlled substance listed in schedule I, II, \n     III, or IV of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act \n     (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812). This exemption permits the \n     administration of polygraph tests, subject to the conditions \n     set forth in sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and Sec. 1.21, \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part, to:\n       (1) A prospective employee who would have direct access to \n     the manufacture, storage, distribution, or sale of any such \n     controlled substance; or\n       (2) a current employee if the following conditions are met:\n       (i) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation of criminal or other misconduct involving, or \n     potentially involving, loss or injury to the manufacture, \n     distribution, or dispensing of any such controlled substance \n     by such employing office; and\n       (ii) The employee had access to the person or property that \n     is the subject of the investigation.\n       (b)(1) The terms manufacture, distribute, distribution, \n     dispense, storage, and sale, for the purposes of this \n     exemption, are construed within the meaning of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812 et seq.), as administered \n     by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department \n     of Justice.\n       (2) The exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA applies only \n     to employing offices that are authorized by DEA to \n     manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance. \n     Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 812) requires every person who manufactures, \n     distributes, or dispenses any controlled substance to \n     register with the Attorney General (i.e., with DEA). Common \n     or contract carriers and warehouses whose possession of the \n     controlled substance is in the usual course of their business \n     or employment are not required to register. Truck drivers and \n     warehouse employees of the persons or entities registered \n     with DEA and authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense controlled substances, are within the scope of the \n     exemption where they have direct access or access to the \n     controlled substances, as discussed below.\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\n       (c) In order for a polygraph examination to be performed, \n     section 7(f) of the Act requires that a prospective employee \n     have ``direct access'' to the controlled substance(s) \n     manufactured, dispensed, or distributed by the employing \n     office. Where a current employee is to be tested as a part of \n     an ongoing investigation, section 7(f) requires that the \n     employee have ``access'' to the person or property that is \n     the subject of the investigation.\n       (1) A prospective employee would have ``direct access'' if \n     the position being applied for has responsibilities which \n     include contact with or which affect the disposition of a \n     controlled substance, including participation in the process \n     of obtaining, dispensing, or otherwise distributing a \n     controlled substance. This includes contact or direct \n     involvement in the manufacture, storage, testing, \n     distribution, sale or dispensing of a controlled substance \n     and may include, for example, packaging, repackaging, \n     ordering, licensing, shipping, receiving, taking inventory, \n     providing security, prescribing, and handling of a controlled \n     substance. A prospective employee would have ``direct \n     access'' if the described job duties would give such person \n     access to the products in question, whether such employee \n     would be in physical proximity to controlled substances or \n     engaged in activity which would permit the employee to divert \n     such substances to his or her possession.\n       (2) A current employee would have ``access'' within the \n     meaning of section 7(f) if the employee had access to the \n     specific person or property which is the subject of the on-\n     going investigation, as discussed in Sec. 1.12(e) of this \n     part. Thus, to test a current employee, the employee need not \n     have had ``direct'' access to the controlled substance, but \n     may have had only infrequent, random, or opportunistic \n     access. Such access would be sufficient to test the employee \n     if the employee could have caused, or could have aided or \n     abetted in causing, the loss of the specific property which \n     is the subject of the investigation. For example, a \n     maintenance worker in a drug warehouse, whose job duties \n     include the cleaning of areas where the controlled substances \n     which are the subject of the investigation were present, but \n     whose job duties do not include the handling of controlled \n     substances, would be deemed to have ``access'', but normally \n     not ``direct access'', to the controlled substances. On the \n     other hand, a drug warehouse truck loader, whose job duties \n     include the handling of outgoing shipment orders which \n     contain controlled substances, would have ``direct access'' \n     to such controlled substances. A pharmacy department in a \n     supermarket is another common situation which is useful in \n     illustrating the distinction between ``direct access'' and \n     ``access.'' Store personnel receiving pharmaceutical orders, \n     i.e., the pharmacist, pharmacy intern, and other such \n     employees working in the pharmacy department, would \n     ordinarily have ``direct access'' to controlled substances. \n     Other store personnel whose job duties and responsibilities \n     do not include the handling of controlled substances but who \n     had occasion to enter the pharmacy department where the \n     controlled substances which are the subject of the \n     investigation were stored, such as maintenance personnel or \n     pharmacy cashiers, would have ``access.'' Certain other store \n     personnel whose job duties do not permit or require entrance \n     into the pharmacy department for any reason, such as produce \n     or meat clerks, checkout cashiers, or baggers, would not \n     ordinarily have ``access.'' However, any current employee, \n     regardless of described job duties, may be polygraphed if the \n     employing office's investigation of criminal or other \n     misconduct discloses that such employee in fact took action \n     to obtain ``access'' to the person or property that is the \n     subject of the investigation--e.g., by actually entering the \n     drug storage area in violation of company rules. In the case \n     of ``direct access'', the prospective employee's access to \n     controlled substances would be as a part of the \n     manufacturing, dispensing or distribution process, while a \n     current employee's ``access'' to the controlled substances \n     which are the subject of the investigation need only be \n     opportunistic.\n       (d) The term prospective employee, for the purposes of this \n     section, includes a current employee who presently holds a \n     position which does not entail direct access to controlled \n     substances, and therefore is outside the scope of the \n     exemption's provisions for preemployment polygraph testing, \n     provided the employee has applied for and is being considered \n     for transfer or promotion to another position which entails \n     such direct access. For example, an office secretary may \n     apply for promotion to a position in the vault or cage areas \n     of a drug warehouse, where controlled substances are kept. In \n     such a situation, the current employee would be deemed a \n     ``prospective employee'' for the purposes of this exemption, \n     and thus could be subject to preemployment polygraph \n     screening, prior to such a change in position. However, any \n     adverse action which is based in part on a polygraph test \n     against a current employee who is considered a ``prospective \n     employee'' for purposes of this section may be taken only \n     with respect to the prospective position and may not affect \n     the employee's employment in the current position.\n       (e) Section 7(f) of the EPPA, as applied by the CAA, makes \n     no specific reference to a requirement that employing offices \n     provide current employees with a written statement prior to \n     polygraph testing. Thus, employing offices to whom this \n     exemption is available are not required to furnish a written \n     statement such as that specified in section 7(d) of the EPPA \n     and Sec. 1.12(a)(4) of this part.\n       (f) For the section 7(f) exemption to apply, the polygraph \n     testing of current employees must be administered in \n     connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal or other \n     misconduct involving, or potentially involving, loss or \n     injury to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of any \n     such controlled substance by such employing office.\n       (1) Current employees may only be administered polygraph \n     tests in connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal \n     or other misconduct, relating to a specific incident or \n     activity, or potential incident or activity. Thus, an \n     employing office is precluded from using the exemption in \n     connection with continuing investigations or on a random \n     basis to determine if thefts are occurring. However, unlike \n     the exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for employing \n     offices conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss or \n     injury, the section 7(f) exemption includes ongoing \n     investigations of misconduct involving potential drug losses. \n     Nor does the latter exemption include the requirement for \n     ``reasonable suspicion'' contained in the section 7(d) \n     exemption. Thus, a drug store operator is permitted to \n     polygraph all current employees who have access to a \n     controlled substance stolen from the inventory, or where \n     there is evidence that such a theft is planned. Polygraph \n     testing based on an inventory shortage of the drug during \n     a particular accounting period would not be permitted \n     unless there is extrinsic evidence of misconduct.\n       (2) In addition, the test must be administered in \n     connection with loss or injury, or potential loss or injury, \n     to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of a \n     controlled substance.\n       (i) Retail drugstores and wholesale drug warehouses \n     typically carry inventory of so-called health and beauty \n     aids, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, and a variety of \n     other similar products, in addition to their product lines of \n     controlled drugs. The noncontrolled products usually \n     constitute the majority of such firms' sales volumes. An \n     economic loss or injury related to such noncontrolled \n     substances would not constitute a basis of applicability of \n     the section 7(f) exemption. For example, an investigation \n     into the theft of a gross of cosmetic products could not be a \n     basis for polygraph testing under section 7(f), but the theft \n     of a container of Valium could be.\n       (ii) Polygraph testing, with respect to an ongoing \n     investigation concerning products other than controlled \n     substances might be initiated under section 7(d) of the EPPA \n     and Sec. 1.12 of this part. However, the exemption in section \n     7(f) of the EPPA and this section is limited solely to losses \n     or injury associated with controlled substances.\n       (g) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in Secs. 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employing office to \n     the remedies authorized in section 204 of the CAA. The \n     administration of such tests is also subject to collective \n     bargaining agreements, which may either prohibit lie detector \n     tests, or contain more restrictive provisions with respect to \n     polygraph testing.\n\n\n      Subpart C--Restrictions on Polygraph Usage Under Exemptions\n\n     Sec. 1.20 Adverse employment action under ongoing \n         investigation exemption.\n       (a) Section 8(a)(1) of the EPPA provides that the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA and Sec. 1.12 of this \n     part for ongoing investigations shall not apply if an \n     employing office discharges, disciplines, denies employment \n     or promotion or otherwise discriminates in any manner against \n     a current employee based upon the analysis of a polygraph \n     test chart or the refusal to take a polygraph test, without \n     additional supporting evidence.\n       (b) ``Additional supporting evidence'', for purposes of \n     section 8(a) of the EPPA, includes, but is not limited to, \n     the following:\n       (1)(i) Evidence indicating that the employee had access to \n     the missing or damaged property that is the subject of an \n     ongoing investigation; and\n       (ii) Evidence leading to the employing office's reasonable \n     suspicion that the employee was involved in the incident or \n     activity under investigation; or\n       (2) Admissions or statements made by an employee before, \n     during or following a polygraph examination.\n       (c) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with additional supporting evidence, \n     unless the employing office observes all the requirements of \n     sections 7(d) and 8(b) of the EPPA, as applied by the CAA and \n     described in Secs. 1.12, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 of this \n     part.\n     Sec. 1.21 Adverse employment action under controlled \n         substance exemption.\n       (a) Section 8(a)(2) of the EPPA provides that the \n     controlled substance exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.13 of this part shall not apply if an employing \n     office discharges, disciplines, denies employment or \n     promotion, or otherwise discriminates in any manner against a \n     current employee or prospective employee based solely\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\n     on the analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusal to \n     take a polygraph test.\n       (b) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may serve as one basis for adverse employment \n     actions of the type described in paragraph (a) of this \n     section, provided that the adverse action was also based on \n     another bona fide reason, with supporting evidence therefor. \n     For example, traditional factors such as prior employment \n     experience, education, job performance, etc. may be used as a \n     basis for employment decisions. Employment decisions based on \n     admissions or statements made by an employee or prospective \n     employee before, during or following a polygraph examination \n     may, likewise, serve as a basis for such decisions.\n       (c) Analysis of a polgraph test chart or the refusal to \n     take a polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with another legitimate basis for \n     such action, unless the employing office observes all the \n     requirements of section 7(f) of the EPPA, as appropriate, and \n     seciton 8(b) of the EPPA, as described in sections 1.13, \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 of this part.\n     Sec. 1.22 Rights of examinee--general.\n       (a) Pursuant to section 8(b) of the EPPA, the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations (described in Secs. 1.12 and 1.13 of this \n     part) shall not apply unless all of the requirements set \n     forth in this section and Secs. 1.23 through 1.25 of this \n     part are met.\n       (b) During all phases of the polygraph testing the person \n     being examined has the following rights:\n       (1) The examinee may terminate the test at any time.\n       (2) The examinee may not be asked any questions in a \n     degrading or unnecessarily intrusive manner.\n       (3) The examinee may not be asked any questions dealing \n     with:\n       (i) Religious beliefs or affiliations;\n       (ii) Beliefs or opinions regarding racial matters;\n       (iii) Political beliefs or affiliations;\n       (iv) Sexual preferences or behavior; or\n       (v) Beliefs, affiliations, opinions, or lawful activities \n     concerning unions or labor organizations.\n       (4) The examinee may not be subjected to a test when there \n     is sufficient written evidence by a physician that the \n     examinee is suffering from any medical or psychological \n     condition or undergoing any treatment that might cause \n     abnormal responses during the actual testing phase. \n     Sufficient written evidence shall constitute, at a minimum, a \n     statement by a physician specifically describing the \n     examinee's medical or psychological condition or treatment \n     and the basis for the physician's opinion that the condition \n     or treatment might result in such abnormal responses.\n       (5) An employee or prospective employee who exercises the \n     right to terminate the test, or who for medical reasons with \n     sufficient supporting evidence is not administered the test, \n     shall be subject to adverse employment action only on the \n     same basis as one who refuses to take a polygraph test, as \n     described in Secs. 1.20 and 1.21 of this part.\n       (c) Any polygraph examination shall consist of one or more \n     pretest phases, actual testing phases, and post-test phases, \n     which must be conducted in accordance with the rights of \n     examinees described in Secs. 1.23 through 1.25 of this part.\n     Sec. 1.23 Rights of examinee--pretest phase.\n       (a) The pretest phase consists of the questioning and other \n     preparation of the prospective examinee before the actual use \n     of the polygraph instrument. During the initial pretest \n     phase, the examinee must be:\n       (1) Provided with written notice, in a language understood \n     by the examinee, as to when and where the examination will \n     take place and that the examinee has the right to consult \n     with counsel or an employee representative before each phase \n     of the test. Such notice shall be received by the examinee at \n     least forty-eight hours, excluding weekend days and holidays, \n     before the time of the examination, except that a prospective \n     employee may, at the employee's option, give written consent \n     to administration of a test anytime within 48 hours but no \n     earlier than 24 hours after receipt of the written notice. \n     The written notice or proof of service must set forth the \n     time and date of receipt by the employee or prospective \n     employee and be verified by his or her signature. The purpose \n     of this requirement is to provide a sufficient opportunity \n     prior to the examination for the examinee to consult with \n     counsel or an employee representative. Provision shall also \n     be made for a convenient place on the premises where the \n     examination will take place at which the examinee may consult \n     privately with an attorney or an employee representative \n     before each phase of the test. The attorney or representative \n     may be excluded from the room where the examination is \n     administered during the actual testing phase.\n       (2) Informed orally and in writing of the nature and \n     characteristics of the polygraph instrument and examination, \n     including an explanation of the physical operation of the \n     polygraph instrument and the procedure used during the \n     examination.\n       (3) Provided with a written notice prior to the testing \n     phase, in a language understood by the examinee, which shall \n     be read to and signed by the examinee. Use of Appendix A to \n     this part, if properly completed, will constitute compliance \n     with the contents of the notice requirement of this \n     paragraph. If a format other than in Appendix A is used, it \n     must contain at least the following information:\n       (i) Whether or not the polygraph examination area contains \n     a two-way mirror, a camera, or other device through which the \n     examinee may be observed;\n       (ii) Whether or not any other device, such as those used in \n     conversation or recording will be used during the \n     examination;\n       (iii) That both the examinee and the employing office have \n     the right, with the other's knowledge, to make a recording of \n     the entire examination;\n       (iv) That the examinee has the right to terminate the test \n     at any time;\n       (v) That the examinee has the right, and will be given the \n     opportunity, to review all questions to be asked during the \n     test;\n       (vi) That the examinee may not be asked questions in a \n     manner which degrades, or needlessly intrudes;\n       (vii) That the examinee may not be asked any questions \n     concerning religious beliefs or opinions; beliefs regarding \n     racial matters; political beliefs or affiliations; matters \n     relating to sexual behavior; beliefs, affiliations, opinions, \n     or lawful activities regarding unions or labor organizations;\n       (viii) That the test may not be conducted if there is \n     sufficient written evidence by a physician that the examinee \n     is suffering from a medical or psychological condition or \n     undergoing treatment that might cause abnormal responses \n     during the examination;\n       (ix) That the test is not and cannot be required as a \n     condition of employment;\n       (x) That the employing office may not discharge, dismiss, \n     discipline, deny employment or promotion, or otherwise \n     discriminate against the examinee based on the analysis of a \n     polygraph test, or based on the examinee's refusal to take \n     such a test, without additional evidence which would support \n     such action;\n       (xi)(A) In connection with an ongoing investigation, that \n     the additional evidence required for the employing office to \n     take adverse action against the examinee, including \n     termination, may be evidence that the examinee had access to \n     the property that is the subject of the investigation, \n     together with evidence supporting the employing office's \n     reasonable suspicion that the examinee was involved in the \n     incident or activity under investigation;\n       (B) That any statement made by the examinee before or \n     during the test may serve as additional supporting evidence \n     for an adverse employment action, as described in paragraph \n     (a)(3)(x) of this section, and that any admission of criminal \n     conduct by the examinee may be transmitted to an appropriate \n     government law enforcement agency;\n       (xii) That information acquired from a polygraph test may \n     be disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n       (A) To the examinee or any other person specifically \n     designated in writing by the examinee to receive such \n     information;\n       (B) To the employing office that requested the test;\n       (C) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or \n     mediator pursuant to a court order;\n       (D) By the employing office, to an appropriate governmental \n     agency without a court order where, and only insofar as, the \n     information disclosed is an admission of criminal conduct;\n       (xiii) That if any of the examinee's rights or protections \n     under the law are violated, the examinee has the right to \n     take action against the employing office under sections 401-\n     404 of the CAA. Employing offices that violate this law are \n     liable to the affected examinee, who may recover such legal \n     or equitable relief as may be appropriate, including, but not \n     limited to, employment, reinstatement, and promotion, payment \n     of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable costs, including \n     attorney's fees;\n       (xiv) That the examinee has the right to obtain and consult \n     with legal counsel or other representative before each phase \n     of the test, although the legal counsel or representative may \n     be excluded from the room where the test is administered \n     during the actual testing phase.\n       (xv) That the employee's rights under the CAA may not be \n     waived, either voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or \n     otherwise, except as part of a written settlement to a \n     pending action or complaint under the CAA, agreed to and \n     signed by the parties.\n        (b) During the initial or any subsequent pretest phases, \n     the examinee must be given the opportunity, prior to the \n     actual testing phase, to review all questions in writing that \n     the examiner will ask during each testing phase. Such \n     questions may be presented at any point in time prior to the \n     testing phase.\n     Sec. 1.24 Rights of examinee--actual testing phase.\n       (a) The actual testing phase refers to that time during \n     which the examiner administers the examination by using a \n     polygraph instrument with respect to the examinee and then \n     analyzes the charts derived from the test. Throughout the \n     actual testing phase, the examiner shall not ask any question \n     that was not presented in writing for review prior to the \n     testing phase. An examiner may, however, recess the testing \n     phase and return to the pre-test phase to review additional \n     relevant questions with the examinee. In the case of an \n     ongoing investigation, the examiner shall ensure that all \n     relevant questions (as distinguished from technical baseline \n     questions) pertain to the investigation.\n       (b) No testing period subject to the provisions of the Act \n     shall be less than ninety minutes in length. Such ``test \n     period'' begins\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\n      at the time that the examiner begins informing the examinee \n     of the nature and characteristics of the examination and the \n     instruments involved, as prescribed in section 8(b)(2)(B) of \n     the EPPA and Sec. 1.23(a)(2) of this part, and ends when the \n     examiner completes the review of the test results with the \n     examinee as provided in Sec. 1.25 of this part. The ninety-\n     minute minimum duration shall not apply if the examinee \n     voluntarily acts to terminate the test before the completion \n     thereof, in which event the examiner may not render an \n     opinion regarding the employee's truthfulness.\n     Sec. 1.25  Rights of examinee--post-test phase.\n       (a) The post-test phase refers to any questioning or other \n     communication with the examinee following the use of the \n     polygraph instrument, including review of the results of the \n     test with the examinee. Before any adverse employment action, \n     the employing office must:\n       (1) Further interview the examinee on the basis of the test \n     results; and\n       (2) Give to the examinee a written copy of any opinions or \n     conclusions rendered in response to the test, as well as the \n     questions asked during the test, with the corresponding \n     charted responses. The term ``corresponding charted \n     responses'' refers to copies of the entire examination charts \n     recording the employee's physiological responses, and not \n     just the examiner's written report which describes the \n     examinee's responses to the questions as ``charted'' by the \n     instrument.\n     Sec. 1.26  Qualifications of and requirements for examiners.\n       (a) Section 8 (b) and (c) of the EPPA provides that the \n     limited exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations shall not apply unless the person conducting \n     the polygraph examination meets specified qualifications and \n     requirements.\n       (b) An examiner must meet the following qualifications:\n       (1) Have a valid current license, if required by the State \n     in which the test is to be conducted; and\n       (2) Carry a minimum bond of $50,000 provided by a surety \n     incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any \n     State, which may under those laws guarantee the fidelity of \n     persons holding positions of trust, or carry an equivalent \n     amount of professional liability coverage.\n       (c) An examiner must also, with respect to examinees \n     identified by the employing office pursuant to Sec. 1.30(c) \n     of this part:\n       (1) Observe all rights of examinees, as set out in Secs. \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25 of this part;\n       (2) Administer no more than five polygraph examinations in \n     any one calendar day on which a test or tests subject to the \n     provisions of EPPA are administered, not counting those \n     instances where an examinee voluntarily terminates an \n     examination prior to the actual testing phase;\n        (3) Administer no polygraph examination subject to the \n     provisions of the EPPA which is less than ninety minutes in \n     duration, as described in Sec. 1.24(b) of this part; and\n        (4) Render any opinion or conclusion regarding \n     truthfulness or deception in writing. Such opinion or \n     conclusion must be based solely on the polygraph test \n     results. The written report shall not contain any information \n     other than admissions, information, case facts, and \n     interpretation of the charts relevant to the stated purpose \n     of the polygraph test and shall not include any \n     recommendation concerning the employment of the examinee.\n       (5) Maintain all opinions, reports, charts, written \n     questions, lists, and other records relating to the test, \n     including, statements signed by examinees advising them of \n     rights under the CAA (as described in section 1.23(a)(3) of \n     this part) and any electronic recordings of examinations, for \n     at least three years from the date of the administration of \n     the test. (See section 1.30 of this part for recordkeeping \n     requirements.)\n\n\n          Subpart D--Recordkeeping and Disclosure Requirements\n\n     Sec. 1.30  Records to be preserved for 3 years.\n       (a) The following records shall be kept for a minimum \n     period of three years from the date the polygraph examination \n     is conducted (or from the date the examination is requested \n     if no examination is conducted):\n       (1) Each employing office that requests an employee to \n     submit to a polygraph examination in connection with an \n     ongoing investigation involving economic loss or injury shall \n     retain a copy of the statement that sets forth the specific \n     incident or activity under investigation and the basis for \n     testing that particular covered employee, as required by \n     section 7(d)(4) of the EPPA and described in 1.12(a)(4) of \n     this part.\n       (2) Each examiner retained to administer examinations \n     pursuant to any of the exemptions under section 7(d), (e) or \n     (f) of the EPPA (described in sections 1.12 and 1.13 of this \n     part) shall maintain all opinions, reports, charts, written \n     questions, lists, and other records relating to polygraph \n     tests of such persons.\n     Sec. 1.35  Disclosure of test information.\n       This section prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of any \n     information obtained during a polygraph test by any person, \n     other than the examinee, directly or indirectly, except as \n     follows:\n       (a) A polygraph examiner or an employing office (other than \n     an employing office exempt under section 7 (a), or (b) of the \n     EPPA (described in Secs. 1.10 and 1.11 of this part)) may \n     disclose information acquired from a polygraph test only to:\n       (1) The examinee or an individual specifically designated \n     in writing by the examinee to receive such information;\n       (2) The employing office that requested the polygraph test \n     pursuant to the provisions of the EPPA (including management \n     personnel of the employing office where the disclosure is \n     relevant to the carrying out of their job responsibilities);\n       (3) Any court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or mediator \n     pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction \n     requiring the production of such information;\n       (b) An employing office may disclose information from the \n     polygraph test at any time to an appropriate governmental \n     agency without the need of a court order where, and only \n     insofar as, the information disclosed is an admission of \n     criminal conduct.\n       (c) A polygraph examiner may disclose test charts, without \n     identifying information (but not other examination materials \n     and records), to another examiner(s) for examination and \n     analysis, provided that such disclosure is for the sole \n     purpose of consultation and review of the initial examiner's \n     opinion concerning the indications of truthfulness or \n     deception. Such action would not constitute disclosure under \n     this part provided that the other examiner has no direct or \n     indirect interest in the matter.\n\n               Appendix A to Part 801--Notice to Examinee\n\n       Section 204 of the Congressional Accountability Act, which \n     applies the rights and protections of section 8(b) of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act to covered employees and \n     employing offices, and the regulations of the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance (Sections 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, and 1.25), require that you be given the following \n     information before taking a polygraph examination:\n       1. (a) The polygraph examination area [does] [does not] \n     contain a two-way mirror, a camera, or other device through \n     which you may be observed.\n       (b) Another device, such as those used in conversation or \n     recording, [will] [will not] be used during the examination.\n       (c) Both you and the employing office have the right, with \n     the other's knowledge, to record electronically the entire \n     examination.\n       2. (a) You have the right to terminate the test at any \n     time.\n       (b) You have the right, and will be given the opportunity, \n     to review all questions to be asked during the test.\n       (c) You may not be asked questions in a manner which \n     degrades, or needlessly intrudes.\n       (d) You may not be asked any questions concerning: \n     Religious beliefs or opinions; beliefs regarding racial \n     matters; political beliefs or affiliations; matters relating \n     to sexual preference or behavior; beliefs, affiliations, \n     opinions, or lawful activities regarding unions or labor \n     organizations.\n       (e) The test may not be conducted if there is sufficient \n     written evidence by a physician that you are suffering from a \n     medical or psychological condition or undergoing treatment \n     that might cause abnormal responses during the examination.\n       (f) You have the right to consult with legal counsel or \n     other representative before each phase of the test, although \n     the legal counsel or other representative may be excluded \n     from the room where the test is administered during the \n     actual testing phase.\n       3. (a) The test is not and cannot be required as a \n     condition of employment.\n       (b) The employing office may not discharge, dismiss, \n     discipline, deny employment or promotion, or otherwise \n     discriminate against you based on the analysis of a polygraph \n     test, or based on your refusal to take such a test without \n     additional evidence which would support such action.\n       (c)(1) In connection with an ongoing investigation, the \n     additional evidence required for an employing office to take \n     adverse action against you, including termination, may be (A) \n     evidence that you had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation, together with (B) the evidence \n     supporting the employing office's reasonable suspicion that \n     you were involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation.\n       (2) Any statement made by you before or during the test may \n     serve as additional supporting evidence for an adverse \n     employment action, as described in 3(b) above, and any \n     admission of criminal conduct by you may be transmitted to an \n     appropriate government law enforcement agency.\n       4. (a) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n       (1) To you or any other person specifically designated in \n     writing by you to receive such information;\n       (2) To the employing office that requested the test;\n       (3) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or \n     mediator that obtains a court order.\n       (b) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the employing office to an appropriate \n     governmental agency without a court order where, and only \n     insofar as, the information disclosed is an admission of \n     criminal conduct.\n       5. If any of your rights or protections under the law are \n     violated, you have the right to take action against the \n     employing office by filing a request for counseling with the \n     Office of Compliance under section 402 of\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n     the Congressional Accountability Act. Employing offices that \n     violate this law are liable to the affected examinee, who may \n     recover such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate, \n     including, but not limited to, employment, reinstatement, and \n     promotion, payment of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable \n     costs, including attorney's fees.\n       6. Your rights under the CAA may not be waived, either \n     voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or otherwise, \n     except as part of a written settlement to a pending action or \n     complaint under the CAA, and agreed to and signed by the \n     parties.\n       I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the above \n     notice, and that it has been read to me.\n       (Date):\n       (Signature):\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \n   Extension of Rights and Protections Under the Employee Polygraph \n          Protection Act of 1988--Exclusion of Capitol Police\n\n\n                 notice of issuance of final regulation\n\n       On January 22, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance adopted and submitted for publication in the \n     Congressional Record a final regulation authorizing the \n     Capitol Police to use lie detector tests under Section \n     204(a)(3) and (c) of the Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995 (``CAA''). On April 15, 1996, pursuant to section 304(c) \n     of the CAA, the House and the Senate agreed to resolutions \n     approving the final regulations. Specifically, the Senate \n     agreed to S.

H501.101  Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1) & (d), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to \n     covered employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSA, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n       (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations with \n     respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance has adopted pursuant to Sections 203(c) and 304 \n     of the CAA, which require that the Board promulgate \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.''\n       (d) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors, \n     Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 203(c) and 304 of \n     the CAA, which directs the Board to promulgate regulations \n     implementing section 203 that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     a [of section 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' The regulations issued by the Board herein are on \n     all matters for which section 203 of the CAA requires \n     regulations to be issued. Specifically,\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\n     it is the Board's considered judgment, based on the \n     information available to it at the time of the promulgation \n     of these regulations, that, with the exception of regulations \n     adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsection (a) [of section 203 of the CAA].''\n       (e) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     Sec. H501.102 Definitions.\n       For purposes of this chapter:\n       (a) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) ``FLSA'' or Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.), as applied by \n     section 203 of the CAA to covered employees and employing \n     offices.\n       (c) ``Covered employee'' means any employee of the House of \n     Representatives, including an applicant for employment and a \n     former employee, but shall not include an intern.\n       (d) ``Employee of the House of Representatives'' includes \n     any individual occupying a position the pay for which is \n     disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by (1) \n     the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the \n     Congressional Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; \n     (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (e) Employing office and employer mean (1) the personal \n     office of a Member of the House of Representatives; (2) a \n     committee of the House of Representatives or a joint \n     committee; or (3) any other office headed by a person with \n     the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the \n     terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives.\n       (f) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (h) Intern is an individual who (a) is performing services \n     in an employing office as part of a demonstrated educational \n     plan, and (b) is appointed on a temporary basis for a period \n     not to exceed 12 months; provided that if an intern is \n     appointed for a period shorter than 12 months, the intern may \n     be reappointed for additional periods as long as the total \n     length of the internship does not exceed 12 months; provided \n     further that the defintion of intern does not include \n     volunteers, fellows or pages.\n     Sec. H501.103 Coverage.\n       The coverage of Section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n     Sec. H501.104 Administrative authority.\n       (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of Section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n       (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of Sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n     Sec. H501.105 Effect of Interpretations of the Department of \n         Labor.\n       (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutorily-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. See \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its reasoning, \n     its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and \n     all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking \n     power to control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 \n     (1944).\n       (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the substantive \n     regulations implementing Section 203 of the CAA shall be \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for good \n     cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division.

H531.1  Definitions.\n       (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary \n     of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions \n     vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n       (b) Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\n     Sec. H531.2 Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term `wage' to \n     include the `reasonable cost', as determined by the Secretary \n     of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee with \n     board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, \n     or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer \n     to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives the \n     Secretary authority to determine the `fair value.' of such \n     facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer or to \n     groups of employers similarly situated, on average value to \n     groups of employees, or other appropriate measures of `fair \n     value.' Whenever so determined and when applicable and \n     pertinent, the `fair value' of the facilities involved shall \n     be includable as part of `wages' instead of the actual \n     measure of the costs of those facilities. The section \n     provides, however, that the cost of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities shall not be included as part of `wages' if \n     excluded therefrom by a bona fide collective bargaining \n     agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for \n     determining the wage of a tipped employee.\n       (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the `reasonable cost' and `fair value' of board, lodging, or \n     other facilities having general application.\n\n\n subpart b--determinations of ``Reasonable Cost'' and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     Sec. H531.3 General determinations of `reasonable cost.'\n       (a) The term reasonable cost as used in section 3(m) of the \n     Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost \n     to the employer of the board, lodging, or other facilities \n     customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n       (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n       (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the depreciated amount of \n     capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the total \n     so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the fair \n     price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale), the \n     fair rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or \n     facilities offered for sale) shall be the reasonable cost. \n     The cost of operation and maintenance, the rate of \n     depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital invested \n     by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     good accounting practices does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term depreciation includes \n     obsolescence.\n       (d)(1) The cost of furnishing `facilities' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n       (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative \n     rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other \n     materials and services incidental to carrying on the \n     employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and \n     for the employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their \n     laundering, where the nature of the business requires the \n     employee to wear a uniform.\n     Sec. H531.6  Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n       (a) The cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall \n     not be included as part of the wage paid to any employee to \n     the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona \n     fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the \n     particular employee.\n       (b) A collective bargaining agreement shall be deemed to be \n     ``bona fide'' when pursuant to the provisions of section \n     7(b)(1) or 7(b)(2) of the FLSA it is made with the certified \n     representative of the employees under the provisions of the \n     CAA.\n\n PART H541--DEFINING AND DELIMITING THE TERMS ``BONA FIDE EXECUTIVE,'' \n    ``ADMINISTRATIVE,'' OR ``PROFESSIONAL'' CAPACITY (INCLUDING ANY \nEMPLOYEE EMPLOYED IN THE CAPACITY OF ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL \n                    OR TEACHER IN SECONDARY SCHOOL)\n\n                     Subpart A--General Regulations\n\n       Sec.\n     H541.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     H541.01  Application of the exemptions of section 13(a)(1) of \n         the FLSA.\n     H541.1  Executive.\n     H541.2  Administrative.\n     H541.3  Professional.\n     H541.5b  Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA as \n         applied by the CAA extend to executive, administrative, \n         and professional employees.\n     H541.5d  Special provisions applicable to employees of public \n         agencies.\n\n\n                     subpart a--general regulations\n\n     Sec.

H541.5b  Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the \n         FLSA as applied by the CAA extend to executive, \n         administrative, and professional employees.\n       The FLSA, as amended and as applied by the CAA, includes \n     within the protection of the equal pay provisions those \n     employees exempt from the minimum wage and overtime pay \n     provisions as bona fide executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees (including any employee employed in \n     the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher \n     in elementary or secondary schools) under section 13(a)(1) of \n     the FLSA. Thus, for example, where an exempt administrative \n     employee and another employee of the employing office are \n     performing substantially ``equal work,'' the sex \n     discrimination prohibitions of section 6(d) are applicable \n     with respect to any wage differential between those two \n     employees.\n     Sec.

In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n       (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single \n     program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or \n     trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n     Sec. H547.1  Essential requirements of qualifications.\n       (a) A ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' for the purpose \n     of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the FLSA as applied by the CAA is \n     required to meet all the standards set forth in paragraphs \n     (b) through (f) of this section and must not contain the \n     disqualifying provisions set forth in Sec. H547.2.\n       (b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite \n     program or arrangement in writing, adopted by the employer or \n     by contract as a result of collective bargaining and \n     communicated or made available to the employees, which is \n     established and maintained, in good faith, for the purpose of \n     encouraging voluntary thrift or savings by employees by \n     providing an incentive to employees to accumulate regularly \n     and retain cash savings for a reasonable period of time or to \n     save through the regular purchase of public or private \n     securities.\n       (c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or \n     categories of employees participating and the basis of their \n     eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n       (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n       (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\n     participating employees' total earnings during that year. In \n     addition, the employer's total contribution in any year may \n     not exceed the total amount saved or invested by the \n     participating employees during that year.\n       (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among \n     the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n     Sec. H547.2  Disqualifying provisions.\n       (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n       (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n       (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n   PART H553--OVERTIME COMPENSATION: PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES \n     ENGAGED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE PROTECTION; OVERTIME AND \n   COMPENSATORY TIME-OFF FOR EMPLOYEES WHOSE WORK SCHEDULE DIRECTLY \n                 DEPENDS UPON THE SCHEDULE OF THE HOUSE\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Sec.\n     H553.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     H553.1  Definitions\n     H553.2  Purpose and scope\n\n Subpart C--Partial Exemption for Employees Engaged in Law Enforcement \n                          and Fire Protection\n\n     H553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\n     H553.202  Limitations.\n     H553.211  Law enforcement activities.\n     H553.212  Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\n     H553.213  Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n         protection and law enforcement activities.\n     H553.214  Trainees.\n     H553.215  Ambulance and rescue service employees.\n     H553.216  Other exemptions.\n     H553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined.\n     H553.221  Compensable hours of work.\n     H553.222  Sleep time.\n     H553.223  Meal time.\n     H553.224  ``Work period'' defined.\n     H553.225  Early relief.\n     H553.226  Training time.\n     H553.227  Outside employment.\n     H553.230  Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 to 28 \n         days--section 7(k).\n     H553.231  Compensatory time off.\n     H553.232  Overtime pay requirements.\n     H553.233  ``Regular rate'' defined.\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n     Work Schedule Directly Depends upon the Schedule of the House\n\n     H553.301  Definition of ``directly depends.''\n     H553.302  Overtime compensation and compensatory time off for \n         an employee whose work schedule directly depends upon the \n         schedule of the House.\n     H553.303  Using compensatory time off.\n     H553.304  Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n         compensatory time off as of termination of service.\n\n                              Introduction\n\n     Sec.

H553.1  Definitions\n       (a) Act or FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (52 Stat. 1060, as amended; 29 U.S.C. 201-219), as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) 1985 Amendments means the Fair Labor Standards \n     Amendments of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-150).\n       (c) Public agency means an employing office as the term is \n     defined in Sec. --501.102 of this chapter, including the \n     Capitol Police.\n       (d) Section 7(k) means the provisions of Sec. 7(k) of the \n     FLSA as applied to covered employees and employing offices by \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA.\n     Sec. H553.2  Purpose and scope\n       The purpose of part H553 is to adopt with appropriate \n     modifications the regulations of the Secretary of Labor to \n     carry out those provisions of the FLSA relating to public \n     agency employees as they are applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices of the CAA. In particular, these \n     regulations apply section 7(k) as it relates to fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies.\n\n\n subpart c--partial exemption for employees engaged in law enforcement \n                          and fire protection\n\n     Sec. H553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\n       Section 7(k) of the Act provides a partial overtime pay \n     exemption for fire protection and law enforcement personnel \n     (including security personnel in correctional institutions) \n     who are employed by public agencies on a work period basis. \n     This section of the Act formerly permitted public agencies to \n     pay overtime compensation to such employees in work periods \n     of 28 consecutive days only after 216 hours of work. As \n     further set forth in Sec. H553.230 of this part, the 216-hour \n     standard has been replaced, pursuant to the study mandated by \n     the statute, by 212 hours for fire protection employees and \n     171 hours for law enforcement employees. In the case of such \n     employees who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, overtime compensation is required when \n     the ratio of the number of hours worked to the number of days \n     in the work period exceeds the ratio of 212 (or 171) hours to \n     28 days.\n     Sec. H553.202  Limitations.\n       The application of Sec. 7(k), by its terms, is limited to \n     public agencies, and does not apply to any private \n     organization engaged in furnishing fire protection or law \n     enforcement services. This is so even if the services are \n     provided under contract with a public agency.\n\n                         Exemption Requirements\n\n     Sec. H553.211  Law enforcement activities.\n       (a) As used in Sec. 7(k) of the Act, the term `any employee \n     . . . in law enforcement activities' refers to any employee \n     (1) who is a uniformed or plainclothed member of a body of \n     officers and subordinates who are empowered by law to enforce \n     laws designed to maintain public peace and order and to \n     protect both life and property from accidental or willful \n     injury, and to prevent and detect crimes, (2) who has the \n     power to arrest, and (3) who is presently undergoing or has \n     undergone or will undergo on-the-job training and/or a course \n     of instruction and study which typically includes physical \n     training, self-defense, firearm proficiency, criminal and \n     civil law principles, investigative and law enforcement \n     techniques, community relations, medical aid and ethics.\n       (b) Employees who meet these tests are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank, or of their status as `trainee,' `probationary,' or \n     `permanent,' and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities such as equipment maintenance, and lecturing, or \n     to support activities of the type described in paragraph (g) \n     of this section, whether or not such assignment is for \n     training or familiarization purposes, or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity. The term would also include \n     rescue and ambulance service personnel if such personnel form \n     an integral part of the public agency's law enforcement \n     activities. See Sec. H553.215.\n       (c) Typically, employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities include police who are regularly employed and paid \n     as such. Other agency employees with duties not specifically \n     mentioned may, depending upon the particular facts and \n     pertinent statutory provisions in that jurisdiction, meet the \n     three tests described above. If so, they will also qualify as \n     law enforcement officers. Such employees might include, for \n     example, any law enforcement employee within the legislative \n     branch concerned with keeping public peace and order and \n     protecting life and property.\n       (d) Employees who do not meet each of the three tests \n     described above are not engaged in `law enforcement \n     activities' as that term is used in sections 7(k). Employees \n     who normally would not meet each of these tests include:\n       (1) Building inspectors (other than those defined in Sec. \n     H553.213(a)),\n       (2) Health inspectors,\n       (3) Sanitarians,\n       (4) Civilian traffic employees who direct vehicular and \n     pedestrian traffic at specified intersections or other \n     control points,\n       (5) Civilian parking checkers who patrol assigned areas for \n     the purpose of discovering parking violations and issuing \n     appropriate warnings or appearance notices,\n       (6) Wage and hour compliance officers,\n       (7) Equal employment opportunity compliance officers, and\n       (8) Building guards whose primary duty is to protect the \n     lives and property of persons within the limited area of the \n     building.\n       (e) The term `any employee in law enforcement activities' \n     also includes, by express reference, `security personnel in \n     correctional institutions. Typically, such facilities may \n     include precinct house lockups. Employees of correctional \n     institutions who qualify as security personnel for purposes \n     of the section 7(k) exemption are those who have \n     responsibility for controlling and maintaining\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\n     custody of inmates and of safeguarding them from other \n     inmates or for supervising such functions, regardless of \n     whether their duties are performed inside the correctional \n     institution or outside the institution. These employees are \n     considered to be engaged in law enforcement activities \n     regardless of their rank or of their status as `trainee,' \n     `probationary,' or `permanent,' and regardless of their \n     assignment to duties incidental to the performance of their \n     law enforcement activities, or to support activities of the \n     type described in paragraph (f) of this section, whether or \n     not such assignment is for training or familiarization \n     purposes or for reasons of illness, injury or infirmity.\n       (f) Not included in the term `employee in law enforcement \n     activities' are the so-called `civilian' employees of law \n     enforcement agencies or correctional institutions who engage \n     in such support activities as those performed by dispatcher, \n     radio operators, apparatus and equipment maintenance and \n     repair workers, janitors, clerks and stenographers. Nor does \n     the term include employees in correctional institutions who \n     engage in building repair and maintenance, culinary services, \n     teaching, or in psychological, medical and paramedical \n     services. This is so even though such employees may, when \n     assigned to correctional institutions, come into regular \n     contact with the inmates in the performance of their duties.\n     Sec. H553.212  Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\n       (a) Employees engaged in fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities as described in Sec. H553.210 and H553.211, may \n     also engage in some nonexempt work which is not performed as \n     an incident to or in conjunction with their fire protection \n     or law enforcement activities. For example, firefighters who \n     work for forest conservation agencies may, during slack \n     times, plant trees and perform other conservation activities \n     unrelated to their firefighting duties. The performance of \n     such nonexempt work will not defeat the Sec. 7(k) exemption \n     unless it exceeds 20 percent of the total hours worked by \n     that employee during the workweek or applicable work period. \n     A person who spends more than 20 percent of his/her working \n     time in nonexempt activities is not considered to be an \n     employee engaged in fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities for purposes of this part.\n       (b) Public agency fire protection and law enforcement \n     personnel may, at their own option, undertake employment for \n     the same employer on an occasional or sporadic and part-time \n     basis in a different capacity from their regular employment. \n     The performance of such work does not affect the application \n     of the Sec. 7(k) exemption with respect to the regular \n     employment. In addition, the hours of work in the different \n     capacity need not be counted as hours worked for overtime \n     purposes on the regular job, nor are such hours counted in \n     determining the 20 percent tolerance for nonexempt work \n     discussed in paragraph (a) of this section.\n     Sec. H553.213  Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n         protection and law enforcement activities.\n       (a) Some public agencies have employees (often called \n     `public safety officers') who engage in both fire protection \n     and law enforcement activities, depending on the agency needs \n     at the time. This dual assignment would not defeat the \n     section 7(k) exemption, provided that each of the activities \n     performed meets the appropriate tests set forth in Sec. \n     H553.210 and H553.211. This is so regardless of how the \n     employee's time is divided between the two activities. \n     However, all time spent in nonexempt activities by public \n     safety officers within the work period, whether performed in \n     connection with fire protection or law enforcement functions, \n     or with neither, must be combined for purposes of the 20 \n     percent limitation on nonexempt work discussed in Sec. \n     H553.212.\n       (b) As specified in Sec. H553.230, the maximum hours \n     standards under section 7(k) are different for employees \n     engaged in fire protection and for employees engaged in law \n     enforcement. For those employees who perform both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, the applicable \n     standard is the one which applies to the activity in which \n     the employee spends the majority of work time during the work \n     period.\n     Sec. H553.214  Trainees.\n       The attendance at a bona fide fire or police academy or \n     other training facility, when required by the employing \n     agency, constitutes engagement in activities under section \n     7(k) only when the employee meets all the applicable tests \n     described in Sec. H553.210 or Sec. H553.211 (except for the \n     power of arrest for law enforcement personnel), as the case \n     may be. If the applicable tests are met, then basic training \n     or advanced training is considered incidental to, and part \n     of, the employee's fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities.\n     Sec. H553.215  Ambulance and rescue service employees.\n       Ambulance and rescue service employees of a public agency \n     other than a fire protection or law enforcement agency may be \n     treated as employees engaged in fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities of the type contemplated by Sec. 7(k) \n     if their services are substantially related to firefighting \n     or law enforcement activities in that (1) the ambulance and \n     rescue service employees have received training in the rescue \n     of fire, crime, and accident victims or firefighters or law \n     enforcement personnel injured in the performance of their \n     respective, duties, and (2) the ambulance and rescue service \n     employees are regularly dispatched to fires, crime scenes, \n     riots, natural disasters and accidents. As provided in Sec. \n     H553.213(b), where employees perform both fire protection and \n     law enforcement activities, the applicable standard is the \n     one which applies to the activity in which the employee \n     spends the majority of work time during the work period.\n     Sec. H553.216  Other exemptions.\n       Although the 1974 Amendments to the FLSA as applied by the \n     CAA provide special exemptions for employees of public \n     agencies engaged in fire protection and law enforcement \n     activities, such workers may also be subject to other \n     exemptions in the Act, and public agencies may claim such \n     other applicable exemptions in lieu of Sec. 7(k). For \n     example, section 13(a)(1) as applied by the CAA provides a \n     complete minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for any \n     employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, \n     or professional capacity, as those terms are defined and \n     delimited in Part H541. The section 13(a)(1) exemption can be \n     claimed for any fire protection or law enforcement employee \n     who meets all of the tests specified in part H541 relating to \n     duties, responsibilities, and salary. Thus, high ranking \n     police officials who are engaged in law enforcement \n     activities, may also, depending on the facts, qualify for the \n     section 13(a)(1) exemption as `executive' employees. \n     Similarly, certain criminal investigative agents may qualify \n     as ``administrative'' employees under section 13(a)(1).\n\n            Tour of Duty and Compensable Hours of Work Rules\n\n     Sec. H553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined.\n       (a) The term ``tour of duty'' is a unique concept \n     applicable only to employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed. This term, as used in section 7(k), \n     means the period of time during which an employee is \n     considered to be on duty for purposes of determining \n     compensable hours. It may be a scheduled or unscheduled \n     period. Such periods include `shifts' assigned to employees \n     often days in advance of the performance of the work. \n     Scheduled periods also include time spent in work outside the \n     ``shift'' which the public agency employer assigns. For \n     example, a police officer may be assigned to crowd control \n     during a parade or other special event outside of his or her \n     shift.\n       (b) Unscheduled periods include time spent in court by \n     police officers, time spent handling emergency situations, \n     and time spent working after a shift to complete an \n     assignment. Such time must be included in the compensable \n     tour of duty even though the specific work performed may not \n     have been assigned in advance.\n       (c) The tour of duty does not include time spent working \n     for a separate and independent employer in certain types of \n     special details as provided in Sec. H553.227.\n     Sec. H553.221  Compensable hours of work.\n       (a) The rules under the FLSA as applied by the CAA on \n     compensable hours of work are applicable to employees for \n     whom the section 7(k) exemption is claimed. Special rules for \n     sleep time (Sec. H553.222) apply to both law enforcement and \n     firefighting employees for whom the section 7(k) exemption is \n     claimed. Also, special rules for meal time apply in the case \n     of firefighters (Sec. H553.223).\n       (b) Compensable hours of work generally include all of the \n     time during which an employee is on duty on the employer's \n     premises or at a prescribed workplace, as well as all other \n     time during which the employee is suffered or permitted to \n     work for the employer. Such time includes all pre-post-shift \n     activities which are an integral part of the employee's \n     principal activity or which are closely related to the \n     performance of the principal activity, such as attending roll \n     call, writing up and completing tickets or reports, and \n     washing and re-racking fire hoses.\n       (c) Time spent away from the employer's premises under \n     conditions that are so circumscribed that they restrict the \n     employee from effectively using the time for personal \n     pursuits also constitutes compensable hours of work. For \n     example, where a police station must be evacuated because of \n     an electrical failure and the employees are expected to \n     remain in the vicinity and return to work after the emergency \n     has passed, the entire time spent away from the premises is \n     compensable. The employees in this example cannot use the \n     time for their personal pursuits.\n       (d) An employee who is not required to remain on the \n     employer's premises but is merely required to leave word at \n     home or with company officials where he or she may be reached \n     is not working while on call. Time spent at home on call may \n     or may not be compensable depending on whether the \n     restrictions placed on the employee preclude using the time \n     for personal pursuits. Where, for example, a firefighter has \n     returned home after the shift, with the understanding that he \n     or she is expected to return to work in the event of an \n     emergency in the night, such time spent at home is normally \n     not compensable. On the other hand, where the conditions \n     placed on the employee's activities are so restrictive that \n     the employee cannot use the time effectively for personal \n     pursuits, such time spent on call is compensable.\n       (e) Normal home to work travel is not compensable, even \n     where the employee is expected to report to work at a \n     location away from the location of the employer's premises.\n       (f) A police officer, who has completed his or her tour of \n     duty and who is given a patrol\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\n     car to drive home and use on personal business, is not \n     working during the travel time even where the radio must be \n     left on so that the officer can respond to emergency calls. \n     Of course, the time spent in responding to such calls is \n     compensable.\n     Sec. H553.222  Sleep time.\n       (a) Where a public agency elects to pay overtime \n     compensation to firefighters and/or law enforcement personnel \n     in accordance with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public \n     agency may exclude sleep time from hours worked if all the \n     conditions for the exclusion of such time are met.\n       (b) Where the employer has elected to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, sleep time cannot be excluded from the compensable \n     hours of work where\n       (1) The employee is on a tour of duty of less than 24 \n     hours, and\n       (2) Where the employee is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 \n     hours.\n       (c) Sleep time can be excluded from compensable hours of \n     work, however, in the case of police officers or firefighters \n     who are on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, but only if \n     there is an expressed or implied agreement between the \n     employer and the employees to exclude such time. In the \n     absence of such an agreement, the sleep time is compensable. \n     In no event shall the time excluded as sleep time exceed 8 \n     hours in a 24-hour period. If the sleep time is interrupted \n     by a call to duty, the interruption must be counted as hours \n     worked. If the sleep period is interrupted to such an extent \n     that the employee cannot get a reasonable night's sleep \n     (which, for enforcement purposes means at least 5 hours), the \n     entire time must be counted as hours of work.\n     Sec. H553.223  Meal time.\n       (a) If a public agency elects to pay overtime compensation \n     to firefighters and law enforcement personnel in accordance \n     with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public agency may \n     exclude meal time from hours worked if all the statutory \n     tests for the exclusion of such time are met.\n       (b) If a public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, the public agency may, in the case of law \n     enforcement personnel, exclude meal time from hours worked on \n     tours of duty of 24 hours or less, provided that the employee \n     is completely relieved from duty during the meal period, and \n     all the other statutory tests for the exclusion of such time \n     are met. On the other hand, where law enforcement personnel \n     are required to remain on call in barracks or similar \n     quarters, or are engaged in extended surveillance activities \n     (e.g., stakeouts'), they are not considered to be completely \n     relieved from duty, and meal periods would be compensable.\n       (c) With respect to firefighters employed under section \n     7(k), who are confined to a duty station, the legislative \n     history of the Act indicates Congressional intent to mandate \n     a departure from the usual FLSA 'hours of work' rules and \n     adoption of an overtime standard keyed to the unique concept \n     of 'tour of duty' under which firefighters are employed. \n     Where the public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption for firefighters, meal time cannot be excluded from \n     the compensable hours of work where (1) the firefighter is on \n     a tour of duty of less than 24 hours, and (2) where the \n     firefighter is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 hours.\n       (d) In the case of police officers or firefighters who are \n     on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, meal time may be \n     excluded from compensable hours of work provided that the \n     statutory tests for exclusion of such hours are met.\n     Sec. H553.224  ``Work period'' defined.\n       (a) As used in section 7(k), the term ``work period'' \n     refers to any established and regularly recurring period of \n     work which, under the terms of the Act and legislative \n     history, cannot be less than 7 consecutive days nor more than \n     28 consecutive days. Except for this limitation, the work \n     period can be of any length, and it need not coincide with \n     the duty cycle or pay period or with a particular day of the \n     week or hour of the day. Once the beginning and ending time \n     of an employee's work period is established, however, it \n     remains fixed regardless of how many hours are worked within \n     the period. The beginning and ending of the work period may \n     be changed, provided that the change is intended to be \n     permanent and is not designed to evade the overtime \n     compensation requirements of the Act.\n       (b) An employer may have one work period applicable to all \n     employees, or different work periods for different employees \n     or groups of employees.\n     Sec. H553.225  Early relief.\n       It is a common practice among employees engaged in fire \n     protection activities to relieve employees on the previous \n     shift prior to the scheduled starting time. Such early relief \n     time may occur pursuant to employee agreement, either \n     expressed or implied. This practice will not have the effect \n     of increasing the number of compensable hours of work for \n     employees employed under section 7(k) where it is voluntary \n     on the part of the employees and does not result, over a \n     period of time, in their failure to receive proper \n     compensation for all hours actually worked. On the other \n     hand, if the practice is required by the employer, the time \n     involved must be added to the employee's tour of duty and \n     treated as compensable hours of work.\n     Sec. H553.226  Training time.\n       (a) The general rules for determining the compensability of \n     training time under the FLSA apply to employees engaged in \n     law enforcement or fire protection activities.\n       (b) While time spent in attending training required by an \n     employer is normally considered compensable hours of work, \n     following are situations where time spent by employees in \n     required training is considered to be noncompensable:\n       (1) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required by law \n     for certification of public and private sector employees \n     within a particular governmental jurisdiction (e.g., \n     certification of public and private emergency rescue \n     workers), does not constitute compensable hours of work for \n     public employees within that jurisdiction and subordinate \n     jurisdictions.\n       (2) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required for \n     certification of employees of a governmental jurisdiction by \n     law of a higher level of government, does not constitute \n     compensable hours of work.\n       (3) Time spent in the training described in paragraphs (b) \n     (1) or (2) of this section is not compensable, even if all or \n     part of the costs of the training is borne by the employer.\n       (c) Police officers or firefighters, who are in attendance \n     at a police or fire academy or other training facility, are \n     not considered to be on duty during those times when they are \n     not in class training session, if they are free to use such \n     time for personal pursuits. Such free time is not \n     compensable.\n     Sec. H553.227  Outside employment.\n       (a) Section 7(p)(1) makes special provision for fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies \n     who, at their own option, perform special duty work in fire \n     protection, law enforcement or related activities for a \n     separate and independent employer (public or private) during \n     their off-duty hours. The hours of work for the separate and \n     independent employer are not combined with the hours worked \n     for the primary public agency employer for purposes of \n     overtime compensation.\n       (b) Section 7(p)(1) applies to such outside employment \n     provided (1) the special detail work is performed solely at \n     the employee's option, and (2) the two employers are in fact \n     separate and independent.\n       (c) Whether two employers are, in fact, separate and \n     independent can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n       (d) The primary employer may facilitate the employment or \n     affect the conditions of employment of such employees. For \n     example, a police department may maintain a roster of \n     officers who wish to perform such work. The department may \n     also select the officers for special details from a list of \n     those wishing to participate, negotiate their pay, and retain \n     a fee for administrative expenses. The department may require \n     that the separate and independent employer pay the fee for \n     such services directly to the department, and establish \n     procedures for the officers to receive their pay for the \n     special details through the agency's payroll system. Finally, \n     the department may require that the officers observe their \n     normal standards of conduct during such details and take \n     disciplinary action against those who fail to do so.\n       (e) Section 7(p)(1) applies to special details even where a \n     State law or local ordinance requires that such work be \n     performed and that only law enforcement or fire protection \n     employees of a public agency in the same jurisdiction perform \n     the work. For example, a city ordinance may require the \n     presence of city police officers at a convention center \n     during concerts or sports events. If the officers perform \n     such work at their own option, the hours of work need not be \n     combined with the hours of work for their primary employer in \n     computing overtime compensation.\n       (f) The principles in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this \n     section with respect to special details of public agency fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees under section \n     7(p)(1) are exceptions to the usual rules on joint employment \n     set forth in part 791 of this title.\n       (g) Where an employee is directed by the public agency to \n     perform work for a second employer, section 7(p)(1) does not \n     apply. Thus, assignments of police officers outside of their \n     normal work hours to perform crowd control at a parade, where \n     the assignments are not solely at the option of the officers, \n     would not qualify as special details subject to this \n     exception. This would be true even if the parade organizers \n     reimburse the public agency for providing such services.\n       (h) Section 7(p)(1) does not prevent a public agency from \n     prohibiting or restricting outside employment by its \n     employees.\n\n                      Overtime Compensation Rules\n\n     Sec. H553.230 Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 \n         to 28 days--section 7(k).\n       (a) For those employees engaged in fire protection \n     activities who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is required \n     under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked exceeds \n     the number of hours which bears the same relationship to 212 \n     as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (b) For those employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities (including security personnel in correctional \n     institutions) who have a work period of at least 7 but less \n     than 28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is \n     required under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked \n     exceeds the number of hours which bears the same relationship \n     to 171 as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\n       (c) The ratio of 212 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in fire protection activities is 7.57 hours per day (rounded) \n     and the ratio of 171 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in law enforcement activities is 6.11 hours per day \n     (rounded). Accordingly, overtime compensation (in premium pay \n     or compensatory time) is required for all hours worked in \n     excess of the following maximum hours standards (rounded to \n     the nearest whole hour):\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Maximum hours standards   \n                                         -------------------------------\n           Work period (days)                  Fire             Law     \n                                            protection      enforcement \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n28......................................             212             171\n27......................................             204             165\n26......................................             197             159\n25......................................             189             153\n24......................................             182             147\n23......................................             174             141\n22......................................             167             134\n21......................................             159             128\n20......................................             151             122\n19......................................             144             116\n18......................................             136             110\n17......................................             129             104\n16......................................             121              98\n15......................................             114              92\n14......................................             106              86\n13......................................              98              79\n12......................................              91              73\n11......................................              83              67\n10......................................              76              61\n9.......................................              68              55\n8.......................................              61              49\n7.......................................              53              43\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Sec. H553.231 Compensatory time off.\n       (a) Law enforcement and fire protection employees who are \n     subject to the section 7(k) exemption may receive \n     compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay for hours \n     worked in excess of the maximum for their work period as set \n     forth in Sec. H553.230.\n       (b) Section 7(k) permits public agencies to balance the \n     hours of work over an entire work period for law enforcement \n     and fire protection employees. For example, if a \n     firefighter's work period is 28 consecutive days, and he or \n     she works 80 hours in each of the first two weeks, but only \n     52 hours in the third week, and does not work in the fourth \n     week, no overtime compensation (in cash wages or compensatory \n     time) would be required since the total hours worked do not \n     exceed 212 for the work period. If the same firefighter had a \n     work period of only 14 days, overtime compensation or \n     compensatory time off would be due for 54 hours (160 minus \n     106 hours) in the first 14 day work period.\n     Sec. H553.232 Overtime pay requirements.\n       If a public agency pays employees subject to section 7(k) \n     for overtime hours worked in cash wages rather than \n     compensatory time off, such wages must be paid at one and \n     one-half times the employees' regular rates of pay.\n     Sec. H553.233 `Regular rate' defined.\n       The statutory rules for computing an employee's `regular \n     rate', for purposes of the Act's overtime pay requirements \n     are applicable to employees or whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed when overtime compensation is provided \n     in cash wages.\n\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n     Work Schedule Directly Depends upon the Schedule of the House\n\n     Sec. H553.301 Definition of ``directly depends.''\n       For the purposes of this Part, a covered employee's work \n     schedule ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the House of \n     Representatives only if the eligible employee performs work \n     that directly supports the conduct of legislative or other \n     business in the chamber and works hours that regularly change \n     in response to the schedule of the House and the Senate.\n     Sec. H553.302 Overtime compensation and compensatory time off \n         for an employee whose work schedule directly depends upon \n         the schedule of the House.\n       No employing office shall be deemed to have violated \n     section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the protections \n     of section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (``FLSA'') to \n     covered employees and employing office, by employing any \n     employee for a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable to such employee under section 7(a) of the FLSA \n     where the employee's work schedule directly depends on the \n     schedule of the House of Representatives within the meaning \n     of Sec. H553.301, and: (a) the employee is compensated at the \n     rate of time-and-a-half in pay for all hours in excess of 40 \n     and up to 60 hours in a workweek, and (b) the employee is \n     compensated at the rate of time-and-a-half in either pay or \n     in time off for all hours in excess of 60 hours in a \n     workweek.\n     Sec. H553.303 Using compensatory time off.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time off under \n     Sec. H553.302 upon his or her request, shall be permitted by \n     the employing office to use such time within a reasonable \n     period after making the request, unless the employing office \n     makes a bona fide determination that the needs of the \n     operations of the office do not allow the taking of \n     compensatory time off at the time of the request. An employee \n     may renew the request at a subsequent time. An employing \n     office may also, upon reasonable notice, require an employee \n     to use accrued compensatory time-off.\n     Sec. H553.304 Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n         compensatory time off as of termination of service.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time authorized by \n     this regulation shall, upon termination of employment, be \n     paid for the unused compensatory time at the rate earned by \n     the employee at the time the employee receives such payment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \nExtension of Rights and Protections Under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n                                of 1938\n\n\n                NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n       On January 22, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance adopted and submitted for publication in the \n     Congressional Record final regulations implementing section \n     203 of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), \n     which apply certain rights and protections of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938. On April 15, 1996, pursuant to section \n     304(c) of the CAA, the House and the Senate agreed to \n     resolutions approving the final regulations. Specifically, \n     the Senate agreed to S. Res. 242, to provide for the approval \n     of final regulations that are applicable to the Senate and \n     the employees of the Senate; the House agreed to H. Res. 400, \n     to provide for the approval of final regulations that are \n     applicable to the House and the employees of the House; and \n     the House and the Senate agreed to S. Con. Res. 51, to \n     provide for approval of final regulations that are applicable \n     to employing offices and employees other than those offices \n     and employees of the House and the Senate. Accordingly, \n     pursuant section 304(d) of the CAA, the Board submits these \n     regulations to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the President pro tempore of the Senate for issuance by \n     publication in the Congressional Record.\n       Pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 304(d) of the CAA, the \n     Board finds good cause for the regulations to become \n     effective on April 16, 1996, rather than 60 days after \n     issuance. Were the regulations not effective immediately upon \n     the expiration of the interim regulations on April 15, 1996, \n     covered employees, employing offices and the Office of \n     Compliance would be forced to operate under the same kind of \n     regulatory uncertainty that the Board sought to avoid by \n     adopting interim regulations effective as of January 23, \n     1996, which was the effective date of the relevant provisions \n     of the CAA.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 19th day of April, 1996.\n                                                    Glen D.

S501.101 Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1) & (d), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to \n     covered employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSA, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\n       (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations with \n     respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance has adopted pursuant to Sections 203(c) and 304 \n     of the CAA, which require that the Board promulgate \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.''\n     (d) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors, \n     Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 203(c) and 304 of \n     the CAA, which directs the Board to promulgate regulations \n     implementing section 203 that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     a [of section 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . .that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' The regulations issued by the Board herein are on \n     all matters for which section 203 of the CAA requires a \n     regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment, based on the information available to it \n     at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, that, \n     with the exception of regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     section 203 of the CAA].''\n     (e) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     Sec. S501.102 Definitions.\n       For purposes of this chapter:\n       (a) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) FLSA or Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.), as applied by \n     section 203 of the CAA to covered employees and employing \n     offices.\n       (c) Covered employee means any employee of the Senate, \n     including an applicant for employment and a former employee, \n     but shall not include an intern.\n       (d) Employee of the Senate includes any employee whose pay \n     is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but not any such \n     individual employed by (1) the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the \n     Capitol Police; (3) the Congressional Budget Office; (4) the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the \n     Attending Physician; (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the \n     Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (e) Employing office and employer mean (1) the personal \n     office of a Senator; (2) a committee of the Senate or a joint \n     committee; or (3) any other office headed by a person with \n     the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the \n     terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the Senate.\n       (f) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (h) Intern is an individual who (a) is performing services \n     in an employing office as part of a demonstrated educational \n     plan, and (b) is appointed on a temporary basis for a period \n     not to exceed 12 months; provided that if an intern is \n     appointed for a period shorter than 12 months, the intern may \n     be reappointed for additional periods as long as the total \n     length of the internship does not exceed 12 months; provided \n     further that an intern for purposes of section 203(a)(2) of \n     the CAA also includes an individual who is a senior citizen \n     appointed under S. Res. 219 (May 5, 1978, as amended by S. \n     Res. 96, April 9, 1991), but does not include volunteers, \n     fellows or pages.\n     Sec. S501.103 Coverage.\n       The coverage of Section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n     Sec. S501.104 Administrative authority.\n       (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of Section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n       (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of Sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n     Sec. S501.105 Effect of Interpretations of the Department of \n         Labor.\n       (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutorily-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n. 9 (1977). See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. See \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its reasoning, \n     its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and \n     all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking \n     power to control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 \n     (1944).\n       (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the substantive \n     regulations implementing Section 203 of the CAA shall be \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for good \n     cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division. The Board is thus not \n     adopting such statements as part of its substantive \n     regulations.\n     Sec. S501.106 Application of the Portal-to-Portal Act of \n         1947.\n       (a) Consistent with Section 225 of the CAA, the Portal to \n     Portal Act (PPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 216 and 251 et seq., is \n     applicable in defining and delimiting the rights and \n     protections of the FLSA that are prescribed by the CAA. \n     Section 10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 259, provides in \n     pertinent part:\n       ``[N]o employer shall be subject to any liability or \n     punishment for or on account of the failure of the employer \n     to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, . . . if he pleads \n     and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good \n     faith in conformity with and reliance on any written \n     administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation of [the Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n     Division of the Department of Labor] . . . or any \n     administrative practice or enforcement policy of such agency \n     with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. \n     Such a defense, if established shall be a bar to the action \n     or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or \n     omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is \n     modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority \n     to be invalid or of no legal effect.''\n       (b) In defending any action or proceeding based on any act \n     or omission arising out of section 203 of the CAA, an \n     employing office may satisfy the standards set forth in \n     subsection (a) by pleading and proving good faith reliance \n     upon any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval or interpretation, of the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division of the Department of Labor: Provided, that \n     such regulation, order, ruling approval or interpretation had \n     not been superseded at the time of reliance by any \n     regulation, order, decision, or ruling of the Board or the \n     courts.\n\n  PART S531--WAGE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938\n\n                     Subpart A--Preliminary Matters\n\n       Sec.\n     S531.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     S531.1  Definitions.\n     S531.2  Purpose and scope.\n\nSubpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost;'' Effects of Collective \n                         Bargaining Agreements\n\n     S531.3  General determinations of `reasonable cost'.\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\n     S531.6  Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n\n                    subpart a--preliminary matters.\n\n     Sec.

S531.1  Definitions.\n       (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary \n     of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions \n     vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n       (b) Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n     Sec. S531.2  Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term `wage' to \n     include the `reasonable cost', as determined by the Secretary \n     of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee with \n     board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, \n     or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer \n     to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives the \n     Secretary authority to determine the `fair value.' of such \n     facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer or to \n     groups of employers similarly situated, on average value to \n     groups of employees, or other appropriate measures of `fair \n     value.' Whenever so determined and when applicable and \n     pertinent, the `fair value' of the facilities involved shall \n     be includable as part of `wages' instead of the actual \n     measure of the costs of those facilities. The section \n     provides, however, that the cost of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities shall not be included as part of `wages' if \n     excluded therefrom by a bona fide collective bargaining \n     agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for \n     determining the wage of a tipped employee.\n       (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the ``reasonable cost'' and ``fair value'' of board, lodging, \n     or other facilities having general application.\n\n\n Subpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost'' and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     Sec. S531.3  General determinations of ``reasonable cost.''\n       (a) The term reasonable cost as used in section 3(m) of the \n     Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost \n     to the employer of the board, lodging, or other facilities \n     customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n       (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n       (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5\\1/2\\ percent) for interest on the depreciated amount \n     of capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the \n     total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the \n     fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for \n     sale), the fair rental value (or the fair price of the \n     commodities or facilities offered for sale) shall be the \n     reasonable cost. The cost of operation and maintenance, the \n     rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital \n     invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     good accounting practices does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term depreciation includes \n     obsolescence.\n       (d)(1) The cost of furnishing ``facilities'' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n       (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative \n     rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other \n     materials and services incidental to carrying on the \n     employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and \n     for the employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their \n     laundering, where the nature of the business requires the \n     employee to wear a uniform.\n     Sec.

In determining the \n     total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the \n     FLSA requires to be included in the regular rate at which an \n     employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums \n     paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of \n     services performed by him during a given period, which are \n     paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting \n     the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n       (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single \n     program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or \n     trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n     Sec. S547.1 Essential requirements for qualifications.\n       (a) A ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' for the purpose \n     of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the FLSA as applied by the CAA is \n     required to meet all the standards set forth in paragraphs \n     (b) through (f) of this section and must not contain the \n     disqualifying provisions set forth in Sec. S547.2.\n       (b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite \n     program or arrangement in writing,\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\n      adopted by the employer or by contract as a result of \n     collective bargaining and communicated or made available to \n     the employees, which is established and maintained, in good \n     faith, for the purpose of encouraging voluntary thrift or \n     savings by employees by providing an incentive to employees \n     to accumulate regularly and retain cash savings for a \n     reasonable period of time or to save through the regular \n     purchase of public or private securities.\n       (c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or \n     categories of employees participating and the basis of their \n     eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n       (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n       (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total \n     earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total \n     contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount \n     saved or invested by the participating employees during that \n     year.\n       (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among \n     the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n     Sec. S547.2 Disqualifying provisions.\n       (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n       (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n       (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n   PART S553--OVERTIME COMPENSATION: PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES \n     ENGAGED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE PROTECTION; OVERTIME AND \n   COMPENSATORY TIME-OFF FOR EMPLOYEES WHOSE WORK SCHEDULE DIRECTLY \n                 DEPENDS UPON THE SCHEDULE OF THE HOUSE\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Sec.\n     S553.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     S553.1  Definitions.\n     S553.2  Purpose and scope.\n\n Subpart C--Partial Exemption for Employees Engaged in Law Enforcement \n                          and Fire Protection\n\n     S553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\n     S553.202  Limitations.\n     S553.211  Law enforcement activities.\n     S553.212  Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\n     S553.213  Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n         protection and law enforcement activities.\n     S553.214  Trainees.\n     S553.215  Ambulance and rescue service employees.\n     S553.216  Other exemptions.\n     S553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined.\n     S553.221  Compensable hours of work.\n     S553.222  Sleep time.\n     S553.223  Meal time.\n     S553.224  ``Work period'' defined.\n     S553.225  Early relief.\n     S553.226  Training time.\n     S553.227  Outside employment.\n     S553.230  Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 to 28 \n         days--section 7(k).\n     S553.231  Compensatory time off.\n     S553.232  Overtime pay requirements.\n     S553.233  ``Regular rate'' defined.\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n     Work Schedule Directly Depends upon the Schedule of the House\n\n     S553.301  Definition of ``directly depends.''\n     S553.302  Overtime compensation and compensatory time off for \n         an employee whose work schedule directly depends upon the \n         schedule of the House.\n     S553.303  Using compensatory time off.\n     S553.304  Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n         compensatory time off as of termination of service.\n\n                              Introduction\n\n     Sec.

S553.1  Definitions\n       (a) Act or FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (52 Stat. 1060, as amended; 29 U.S.C. 201-219), as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) 1985 Amendments means the Fair Labor Standards \n     Amendments of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-150).\n       (c) Public agency means an employing office as the term is \n     defined in Sec. --501.102 of this chapter, including the \n     Capitol Police.\n       (d) Section 7(k) means the provisions of Sec. 7(k) of the \n     FLSA as applied to covered employees and employing offices by \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA.\n     Sec. S553.2  Purpose and scope\n       The purpose of part S553 is to adopt with appropriate \n     modifications the regulations of the Secretary of Labor to \n     carry out those provisions of the FLSA relating to public \n     agency employees as they are applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices of the CAA. In particular, these \n     regulations apply section 7(k) as it relates to fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies.\n\n\n SUBPART C--PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                          AND FIRE PROTECTION\n\n     Sec. S553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\n       Section 7(k) of the Act provides a partial overtime pay \n     exemption for fire protection and law enforcement personnel \n     (including security personnel in correctional institutions) \n     who are employed by public agencies on a work period basis. \n     This section of the Act formerly permitted public agencies to \n     pay overtime compensation to such employees in work periods \n     of 28 consecutive days only after 216 hours of work. As \n     further set forth in Sec. S553.230 of this part, the 216-hour \n     standard has been replaced, pursuant to the study mandated by \n     the statute, by 212 hours for fire protection employees and \n     171 hours for law enforcement employees. In the case of such \n     employees who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, overtime compensation is required when \n     the ratio of the number of hours worked to the number of days \n     in the work period exceeds the ratio of 212 (or 171) hours to \n     28 days.\n     Sec. S553.202  Limitations.\n        The application of Sec. 7(k), by its terms, is limited to \n     public agencies, and does not apply to any private \n     organization engaged in furnishing fire protection or law \n     enforcement services. This is so even if the services are \n     provided under contract with a public agency.\n\n                         Exemption Requirements\n\n     Sec. S553.211 Law enforcement activities.\n       (a) As used in Sec. 7(k) of the Act, the term ``any \n     employee * * * in law enforcement activities'' refers to any \n     employee (1) who is a uniformed or plainclothed member of a \n     body of officers and subordinates who are empowered by law to \n     enforce laws designed to maintain public peace and order and \n     to protect both life and property from accidental or willful \n     injury, and to prevent and detect crimes, (2) who has the \n     power to arrest, and (3) who is presently undergoing or has \n     undergone or will undergo on-the-job training and/or a course \n     of instruction and study which typically includes physical \n     training, self-defense, firearm proficiency, criminal and \n     civil law principles, investigative and law enforcement \n     techniques, community relations, medical aid and ethics.\n       (b) Employees who meet these tests are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank, or of their status as ``trainee,'' ``probationary,'' or \n     ``permanent,'' and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities such as equipment maintenance, and lecturing, or \n     to support activities of the type described in paragraph (g) \n     of this section, whether or not such assignment is for \n     training or familiarization purposes, or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity. The term would also include \n     rescue and ambulance service personnel if such personnel form \n     an integral part of the public agency's law enforcement \n     activities. See Sec. S553.215.\n       (c) Typically, employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities include police who are regularly employed and paid \n     as such. Other agency employees with duties not specifically \n     mentioned may, depending upon the particular facts and \n     pertinent statutory provisions in that jurisdiction, meet the \n     three tests described above. If so, they will also qualify as \n     law enforcement officers. Such employees might include, for \n     example, any law enforcement employee within the legislative \n     branch concerned with keeping public\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\n     peace and order and protecting life and property.\n       (d) Employees who do not meet each of the three tests \n     described above are not engaged in ``law enforcement \n     activities'' as that term is used in sections 7(k). Employees \n     who normally would not meet each of these tests include:\n        (1) Building inspectors (other than those defined in Sec. \n     S553.213(a)),\n       (2) Health inspectors,\n        (3) Sanitarians,\n        (4) Civilian traffic employees who direct vehicular and \n     pedestrian traffic at specified intersections or other \n     control points,\n       (5) Civilian parking checkers who patrol assigned areas for \n     the purpose of discovering parking violations and issuing \n     appropriate warnings or appearance notices,\n        (6) Wage and hour compliance officers,\n       (7) Equal employment opportunity compliance officers, and\n       (8) Building guards whose primary duty is to protect the \n     lives and property of persons within the limited area of the \n     building.\n        (e) The term ``any employee in law enforcement \n     activities'' also includes, by express reference, ``security \n     personnel in correctional institutions.'' Typically, such \n     facilities may include precinct house lockups. Employees of \n     correctional institutions who qualify as security personnel \n     for purposes of the section 7(k) exemption are those who have \n     responsibility for controlling and maintaining custody of \n     inmates and of safeguarding them from other inmates or for \n     supervising such functions, regardless of whether their \n     duties are performed inside the correctional institution or \n     outside the institution. These employees are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank or of their status as ``trainee,'' ``probationary,'' or \n     ``permanent,'' and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities, or to support activities of the type described in \n     paragraph (f) of this section, whether or not such assignment \n     is for training or familiarization purposes or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity.\n        (f) Not included in the term ``employee in law enforcement \n     activities'' are the so-called ``civilian'' employees of law \n     enforcement agencies or correctional institutions who engage \n     in such support activities as those performed by dispatcher, \n     radio operators, apparatus and equipment maintenance and \n     repair workers, janitors, clerks and stenographers. Nor does \n     the term include employees in correctional institutions who \n     engage in building repair and maintenance, culinary services, \n     teaching, or in psychological, medical and paramedical \n     services. This is so even though such employees may, when \n     assigned to correctional institutions, come into regular \n     contact with the inmates in the performance of their duties.\n      Sec. S553.212 Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\n        (a) Employees engaged in fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities as described in Sec. S553.210 and \n     S553.211, may also engage in some nonexempt work which is not \n     performed as an incident to or in conjunction with their fire \n     protection or law enforcement activities. For example, \n     firefighters who work for forest conservation agencies may, \n     during slack times, plant trees and perform other \n     conservation activities unrelated to their firefighting \n     duties. The performance of such nonexempt work will not \n     defeat the Sec. 7(k) exemption unless it exceeds 20 percent \n     of the total hours worked by that employee during the \n     workweek or applicable work period. A person who spends more \n     than 20 percent of his/her working time in nonexempt \n     activities is not considered to be an employee engaged in \n     fire protection or law enforcement activities for purposes of \n     this part.\n        (b) Public agency fire protection and law enforcement \n     personnel may, at their own option, undertake employment for \n     the same employer on an occasional or sporadic and part-time \n     basis in a different capacity from their regular employment. \n     The performance of such work does not affect the application \n     of the Sec. 7(k) exemption with respect to the regular \n     employment. In addition, the hours of work in the different \n     capacity need not be counted as hours worked for overtime \n     purposes on the regular job, nor are such hours counted in \n     determining the 20 percent tolerance for nonexempt work \n     discussed in paragraph (a) of this section.\n      Sec. S553.213 Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n         protection and law enforcement activities.\n       (a) Some public agencies have employees (often called \n     `public safety officers') who engage in both fire protection \n     and law enforcement activities, depending on the agency needs \n     at the time. This dual assignment would not defeat the \n     section 7(k) exemption, provided that each of the activities \n     performed meets the appropriate tests set forth in Sec. \n     S553.210 and S553.211. This is so regardless of how the \n     employee's time is divided between the two activities. \n     However, all time spent in nonexempt activities by public \n     safety officers within the work period, whether performed in \n     connection with fire protection or law enforcement functions, \n     or with neither, must be combined for purposes of the 20 \n     percent limitation on nonexempt work discussed in \n     Sec.S553.212.\n       (b) As specified in Sec. S553.230, the maximum hours \n     standards under section 7(k) are different for employees \n     engaged in fire protection and for employees engaged in law \n     enforcement. For those employees who perform both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, the applicable \n     standard is the one which applies to the activity in which \n     the employee spends the majority of work time during the work \n     period.\n      Sec. S553.214 Trainees.\n       The attendance at a bona fide fire or police academy or \n     other training facility, when required by the employing \n     agency, constitutes engagement in activities under section \n     7(k) only when the employee meets all the applicable tests \n     described in Sec. S553.210 or Sec. S553.211 (except for the \n     power of arrest for law enforcement personnel), as the case \n     may be. If the applicable tests are met, then basic training \n     or advanced training is considered incidental to, and part \n     of, the employee's fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities.\n     Sec. S553.215 Ambulance and rescue service employees.\n        Ambulance and rescue service employees of a public agency \n     other than a fire protection or law enforcement agency may be \n     treated as employees engaged in fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities of the type contemplated by Sec. 7(k) \n     if their services are substantially related to firefighting \n     or law enforcement activities in that (1) the ambulance and \n     rescue service employees have received training in the rescue \n     of fire, crime, and accident victims or firefighters or law \n     enforcement personnel injured in the performance of their \n     respective duties, and (2) the ambulance and rescue service \n     employees are regularly dispatched to fires, crime scenes, \n     riots, natural disasters and accidents. As provided in Sec. \n     S553.213(b), where employees perform both fire protection and \n     law enforcement activities, the applicable standard is the \n     one which applies to the activity in which the employee \n     spends the majority of work time during the work period.\n     Sec. S553.216 Other exemptions.\n        Although the 1974 Amendments to the FLSA as applied by the \n     CAA provide special exemptions for employees of public \n     agencies engaged in fire protection and law enforcement \n     activities, such workers may also be subject to other \n     exemptions in the Act, and public agencies may claim such \n     other applicable exemptions in lieu of Sec. 7(k). For \n     example, section 13(a)(1) as applied by the CAA provides a \n     complete minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for any \n     employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, \n     or professional capacity, as those terms are defined and \n     delimited in Part S541. The section 13(a)(1) exemption can be \n     claimed for any fire protection or law enforcement employee \n     who meets all of the tests specified in part S541 relating to \n     duties, responsibilities, and salary. Thus, high ranking \n     police officials who are engaged in law enforcement \n     activities, may also, depending on the facts, qualify for the \n     section 13(a)(1) exemption as `executive' employees. \n     Similarly, certain criminal investigative agents may qualify \n     as ``administrative'' employees under section 13(a)(1).\n\n            Tour of Duty and Compensable Hours of Work Rules\n\n     Sec. S553.220 ``Tour of duty'' defined.\n       (a) The term ``tour of duty'' is a unique concept \n     applicable only to employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed. This term, as used in section 7(k), \n     means the period of time during which an employee is \n     considered to be on duty for purposes of determining \n     compensable hours. It may be a scheduled or unscheduled \n     period. Such periods include `shifts' assigned to employees \n     often days in advance of the performance of the work. \n     Scheduled periods also include time spent in work outside the \n     ``shift'' which the public agency employer assigns. For \n     example, a police officer may be assigned to crowd control \n     during a parade or other special event outside of his or her \n     shift.\n       (b) Unscheduled periods include time spent in court by \n     police officers, time spent handling emergency situations, \n     and time spent working after a shift to complete an \n     assignment. Such time must be included in the compensable \n     tour of duty even though the specific work performed may not \n     have been assigned in advance.\n       (c) The tour of duty does not include time spent working \n     for a separate and independent employer in certain types of \n     special details as provided in Sec. S553.227.\n     Sec. S553.221 Compensable hours of work.\n       (a) The rules under the FLSA as applied by the CAA on \n     compensable hours of work are applicable to employees for \n     whom the section 7(k) exemption is claimed. Special rules for \n     sleep time (Sec. S553.222) apply to both law enforcement and \n     firefighting employees for whom the section 7(k) exemption is \n     claimed. Also, special rules for meal time apply in the case \n     of firefighters (Sec. S553.223).\n       (b) Compensable hours of work generally include all of the \n     time during which an employee is on duty on the employer's \n     premises or at a prescribed workplace, as well as all other \n     time during which the employee is suffered or permitted to \n     work for the employer. Such time includes all pre-shift and \n     post-shift activities which are an integral part of the \n     employee's principal activity or which are closely related to \n     the performance of the principal activity, such as attending \n     roll call, writing up and completing tickets or reports, and \n     washing and re-racking fire hoses.\n       (c) Time spent away from the employer's premises under \n     conditions that are so circumscribed that they restrict the \n     employee from effectively using the time for personal\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\n      pursuits also constitutes compensable hours of work. For \n     example, where a police station must be evacuated because of \n     an electrical failure and the employees are expected to \n     remain in the vicinity and return to work after the emergency \n     has passed, the entire time spent away from the premises is \n     compensable. The employees in this example cannot use the \n     time for their personal pursuits.\n       (d) An employee who is not required to remain on the \n     employer's premises but is merely required to leave word at \n     home or with company officials where he or she may be reached \n     is not working while on call. Time spent at home on call may \n     or may not be compensable depending on whether the \n     restrictions placed on the employee preclude using the time \n     for personal pursuits. Where, for example, a firefighter has \n     returned home after the shift, with the understanding that he \n     or she is expected to return to work in the event of an \n     emergency in the night, such time spent at home is normally \n     not compensable. On the other hand, where the conditions \n     placed on the employee's activities are so restrictive that \n     the employee cannot use the time effectively for personal \n     pursuits, such time spent on call is compensable.\n       (e) Normal home to work travel is not compensable, even \n     where the employee is expected to report to work at a \n     location away from the location of the employer's premises.\n       (f) A police officer, who has completed his or her tour of \n     duty and who is given a patrol car to drive home and use on \n     personal business, is not working during the travel time even \n     where the radio must be left on so that the officer can \n     respond to emergency calls. Of course, the time spent in \n     responding to such calls is compensable.\n     Sec. S553.222 Sleep time.\n       (a) Where a public agency elects to pay overtime \n     compensation to firefighters and/or law enforcement personnel \n     in accordance with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public \n     agency may exclude sleep time from hours worked if all the \n     conditions for the exclusion of such time are met.\n       (b) Where the employer has elected to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, sleep time cannot be excluded from the compensable \n     hours of work where\n       (1) The employee is on a tour of duty of less than 24 \n     hours, and\n       (2) Where the employee is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 \n     hours.\n       (c) Sleep time can be excluded from compensable hours of \n     work, however, in the case of police officers or firefighters \n     who are on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, but only if \n     there is an expressed or implied agreement between the \n     employer and the employees to exclude such time. In the \n     absence of such an agreement, the sleep time is compensable. \n     In no event shall the time excluded as sleep time exceed 8 \n     hours in a 24-hour period. If the sleep time is interrupted \n     by a call to duty, the interruption must be counted as hours \n     worked. If the sleep period is interrupted to such an extent \n     that the employee cannot get a reasonable night's sleep \n     (which, for enforcement purposes means at least 5 hours), the \n     entire time must be counted as hours of work.\n     Sec. S553.223 Meal time.\n       (a) If a public agency elects to pay overtime compensation \n     to firefighters and law enforcement personnel in accordance \n     with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public agency may \n     exclude meal time from hours worked if all the statutory \n     tests for the exclusion of such time are met.\n       (b) If a public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, the public agency may, in the case of law \n     enforcement personnel, exclude meal time from hours worked on \n     tours of duty of 24 hours or less, provided that the employee \n     is completely relieved from duty during the meal period, and \n     all the other statutory tests for the exclusion of such time \n     are met. On the other hand, where law enforcement personnel \n     are required to remain on call in barracks or similar \n     quarters, or are engaged in extended surveillance activities \n     (e.g., stakeouts'), they are not considered to be completely \n     relieved from duty, and any such meal periods would be \n     compensable.\n       (c) With respect to firefighters employed under section \n     7(k), who are confined to a duty station, the legislative \n     history of the Act indicates Congressional intent to mandate \n     a departure from the usual FLSA `hours of work' rules and \n     adoption of an overtime standard keyed to the unique concept \n     of `tour of duty' under which firefighters are employed. \n     Where the public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption for firefighters, meal time cannot be excluded from \n     the compensable hours of work where (1) the firefighter is on \n     a tour of duty of less than 24 hours, and (2) where the \n     firefighter is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 hours.\n       (d) In the case of police officers or firefighters who are \n     on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, meal time may be \n     excluded from compensable hours of work provided that the \n     statutory tests for exclusion of such hours are met.\n     Sec. S553.224 ``Work period'' defined.\n       (a) As used in section 7(k), the term `work period' refers \n     to any established and regularly recurring period of work \n     which, under the terms of the Act and legislative history, \n     cannot be less than 7 consecutive days nor more than 28 \n     consecutive days. Except for this limitation, the work period \n     can be of any length, and it need not coincide with the duty \n     cycle or pay period or with a particular day of the week or \n     hour of the day. Once the beginning and ending time of an \n     employee's work period is established, however, it remains \n     fixed regardless of how many hours are worked within the \n     period. The beginning and ending of the work period may be \n     changed, provided that the change is intended to be permanent \n     and is not designed to evade the overtime compensation \n     requirements of the Act.\n       (b) An employer may have one work period applicable to all \n     employees, or different work periods for different employees \n     or groups of employees.\n     Sec. S553.225  Early relief.\n       It is a common practice among employees engaged in fire \n     protection activities to relieve employees on the previous \n     shift prior to the scheduled starting time. Such early relief \n     time may occur pursuant to employee agreement, either \n     expressed or implied. This practice will not have the effect \n     of increasing the number of compensable hours of work for \n     employees employed under section 7(k) where it is voluntary \n     on the part of the employees and does not result, over a \n     period of time, in their failure to receive proper \n     compensation for all hours actually worked. On the other \n     hand, if the practice is required by the employer, the time \n     involved must be added to the employee's tour of duty and \n     treated as compensable hours of work.\n     Sec. S553.226  Training time.\n       (a) The general rules for determining the compensability of \n     training time under the FLSA apply to employees engaged in \n     law enforcement or fire protection activities.\n       (b) While time spent in attending training required by an \n     employer is normally considered compensable hours of work, \n     following are situations where time spent by employees in \n     required training is considered to be noncompensable:\n       (1) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required by law \n     for certification of public and private sector employees \n     within a particular governmental jurisdiction (e.g., \n     certification of public and private emergency rescue \n     workers), does not constitute compensable hours of work for \n     public employees within that jurisdiction and subordinate \n     jurisdictions.\n       (2) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required for \n     certification of employees of a governmental jurisdiction by \n     law of a higher level of government, does not constitute \n     compensable hours of work.\n       (3) Time spent in the training described in paragraphs (b) \n     (1) or (2) of this section is not compensable, even if all or \n     part of the costs of the training is borne by the employer.\n       (c) Police officers or firefighters, who are in attendance \n     at a police or fire academy or other training facility, are \n     not considered to be on duty during those times when they are \n     not in class or at a training session, if they are free to \n     use such time for personal pursuits. Such free time is not \n     compensable.\n     Sec. S553.227  Outside employment.\n       (a) Section 7(p)(1) makes special provision for fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies \n     who, at their own option, perform special duty work in fire \n     protection, law enforcement or related activities for a \n     separate and independent employer (public or private) during \n     their off-duty hours. The hours of work for the separate and \n     independent employer are not combined with the hours worked \n     for the primary public agency employer for purposes of \n     overtime compensation.\n       (b) Section 7(p)(1) applies to such outside employment \n     provided (1) the special detail work is performed solely at \n     the employee's option, and (2) the two employers are in fact \n     separate and independent.\n       (c) Whether two employers are, in fact, separate and \n     independent can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n       (d) The primary employer may facilitate the employment or \n     affect the conditions of employment of such employees. For \n     example, a police department may maintain a roster of \n     officers who wish to perform such work. The department may \n     also select the officers for special details from a list of \n     those wishing to participate, negotiate their pay, and retain \n     a fee for administrative expenses. The department may require \n     that the separate and independent employer pay the fee for \n     such services directly to the department, and establish \n     procedures for the officers to receive their pay for the \n     special details through the agency's payroll system. Finally, \n     the department may require that the officers observe their \n     normal standards of conduct during such details and take \n     disciplinary action against those who fail to do so.\n       (e) Section 7(p)(1) applies to special details even where a \n     State law or local ordinance requires that such work be \n     performed and that only law enforcement or fire protection \n     employees of a public agency in the same jurisdiction perform \n     the work. For example, a city ordinance may require the \n     presence of city police officers at a convention center \n     during concerts or sports events. If the officers perform \n     such work at their own option, the hours of work need not be \n     combined with the hours of work for their primary employer in \n     computing overtime compensation.\n       (f) The principles in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this \n     section with respect to special details of public agency fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees under section \n     7(p)(1) are exceptions to the usual rules on joint employment \n     set forth in part 791 of this title.\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\n       (g) Where an employee is directed by the public agency to \n     perform work for a second employer, section 7(p)(1) does not \n     apply. Thus, assignments of police officers outside of their \n     normal work hours to perform crowd control at a parade, where \n     the assignments are not solely at the option of the officers, \n     would not qualify as special details subject to this \n     exception. This would be true even if the parade organizers \n     reimburse the public agency for providing such services.\n       (h) Section 7(p)(1) does not prevent a public agency from \n     prohibiting or restricting outside employment by its \n     employees.\n\n                      Overtime Compensation Rules\n\n     Sec. S553.230 Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 \n         to 28 days--section 7(k).\n       (a) For those employees engaged in fire protection \n     activities who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is required \n     under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked exceeds \n     the number of hours which bears the same relationship to 212 \n     as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (b) For those employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities (including security personnel in correctional \n     institutions) who have a work period of at least 7 but less \n     than 28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is \n     required under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked \n     exceeds the number of hours which bears the same relationship \n     to 171 as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (c) The ratio of 212 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in fire protection activities is 7.57 hours per day (rounded) \n     and the ratio of 171 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in law enforcement activities is 6.11 hours per day \n     (rounded). Accordingly, overtime compensation (in premium pay \n     or compensatory time) is required for all hours worked in \n     excess of the following maximum hours standards (rounded to \n     the nearest whole hour):\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Maximum hours standards   \n                                         -------------------------------\n           Work period (days)                  Fire             Law     \n                                            protection      enforcement \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n28......................................             212             171\n27......................................             204             165\n26......................................             197             159\n25......................................             189             153\n24......................................             182             147\n23......................................             174             141\n22......................................             167             134\n21......................................             159             128\n20......................................             151             122\n19......................................             144             116\n18......................................             136             110\n17......................................             129             104\n16......................................             121              98\n15......................................             114              92\n14......................................             106              86\n13......................................              98              79\n12......................................              91              73\n11......................................              83              67\n10......................................              76              61\n9.......................................              68              55\n8.......................................              61              49\n7.......................................              53              43\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Sec. S553.231  Compensatory time off.\n       (a) Law enforcement and fire protection employees who are \n     subject to the section 7(k) exemption may receive \n     compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay for hours \n     worked in excess of the maximum for their work period as set \n     forth in Sec. S553.230.\n       (b) Section 7(k) permits public agencies to balance the \n     hours of work over an entire work period for law enforcement \n     and fire protection employees. For example, if a \n     firefighter's work period is 28 consecutive days, and he or \n     she works 80 hours in each of the first two weeks, but only \n     52 hours in the third week, and does not work in the fourth \n     week, no overtime compensation (in cash wages or compensatory \n     time) would be required since the total hours worked do not \n     exceed 212 for the work period. If the same firefighter had a \n     work period of only 14 days, overtime compensation or \n     compensatory time off would be due for 54 hours (160 minus \n     106 hours) in the first 14 day work period.\n     Sec. S553.232  Overtime pay requirements.\n       If a public agency pays employees subject to section 7(k) \n     for overtime hours worked in cash wages rather than \n     compensatory time off, such wages must be paid at one and \n     one-half times the employees' regular rates of pay.\n     Sec. S553.233  `Regular rate' defined.\n       The statutory rules for computing an employee's `regular \n     rate', for purposes of the Act's overtime pay requirements \n     are applicable to employees or whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed when overtime compensation is provided \n     in cash wages.\n\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n     Work Schedule Directly Depends upon the Schedule of the Senate\n\n     Sec. S553.301  Definition of ``directly depends.''\n       For the purposes of this Part, a covered employee's work \n     schedule ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the Senate \n     only if the eligible employee performs work that directly \n     supports the conduct of legislative or other business in the \n     chamber and works hours that regularly change in response to \n     the schedule of the House and the Senate.\n     Sec. S553.302  Overtime compensation and compensatory time \n         off for an employee whose work schedule directly depends \n         upon the schedule of the Senate.\n       No employing office shall be deemed to have violated \n     section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the protections \n     of section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (``FLSA'') to \n     covered employees and employing office, by employing any \n     employee for a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable to such employee under section 7(a) of the FLSA \n     where the employee's work schedule directly depends on the \n     schedule of the Senate within the meaning of Sec. S553.301, \n     and: (a) the employee is compensated at the rate of time-and-\n     a-half in pay for all hours in excess of 40 and up to 60 \n     hours in a workweek, and (b) the employee is compensated at \n     the rate of time-and-a-half in either pay or in time off for \n     all hours in excess of 60 hours in a workweek.\n     Sec. S553.303  Using compensatory time off.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time off under \n     Sec. S553.302, upon his or her request, shall be permitted by \n     the employing office to use such time within a reasonable \n     period after making the request, unless the employing office \n     makes a bona fide determination that the needs of the \n     operations of the office do not allow the taking of \n     compensatory time off at the time of the request. An employee \n     may renew the request at a subsequent time. An employing \n     office may also, upon reasonable notice, require an employee \n     to use accrued compensatory time-off.\n     Sec. S553.304  Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n         compensatory time off as of termination of service.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time authorized by \n     this regulation shall, upon termination of employment, be \n     paid for the unused compensatory time at the rate earned by \n     the employee at the time the employee receives such payment.\n\n                   PART S570--CHILD LABOR REGULATIONS\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n       Sec.\n     S570.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     S570.1  Definitions.\n     S570.2  Minimum age standards.\n\n Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (Child \n                             Labor Reg. 3)\n\n     S570.31  Determination.\n     S570.32  Effect of this subpart.\n     S570.33  Occupations.\n     S570.35  Periods and conditions of employment.\n\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.

S570.2 of this \n     subpart.\n       (c) Oppressive child labor age means an age below the \n     minimum age established under the Act for the occupation in \n     which a minor is employed or in which his employment is \n     contemplated.\n       (d) [Reserved]\n       (e) [Reserved]\n       (f) Secretary or Secretary of Labor means the Secretary of \n     Labor, United States Department of Labor, or his authorized \n     representative.\n       (g) Wage and Hour Division means the Wage and Hour \n     Division, Employment Standards Administration, United States \n     Department of Labor.\n       (h) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative.\n     Sec. S570.2 Minimum age standards.\n       (a) All occupations except in agriculture. (1) The Act, in \n     section 3(1), sets a general 16-year minimum age which \n     applies to all employment subject to its child labor \n     provisions in any occupation other than in agriculture, with \n     the following exceptions:\n       (i) The Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to provide by \n     regulation or by order that the employment of employees \n     between the ages of 14 and 16 years in occupations other than \n     manufacturing and mining shall not be deemed to constitute \n     oppressive child labor, if and to the extent that the \n     Secretary of Labor determines that such employment is \n     confined to periods which will not interfere with their \n     schooling and to conditions which will not interfere with \n     their health and well-being (see subpart C of this part); and\n       (ii) The Act sets an 18-year minimum age with respect to \n     employment in any occupation found and declared by the \n     Secretary of Labor to be particularly hazardous for the \n     employment of minors of such age or detrimental to their \n     health or well-being.\n       (2) The Act exempts from its minimum age requirements the \n     employment by a parent of\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\n     his own child, or by a person standing in place of a parent \n     of a child in his custody, except in occupations to which the \n     18-year age minimum applies and in manufacturing and mining \n     occupations.\n\n\n                          Subpart B [Reserved]\n\n Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (Child \n                             Labor Reg. 3)\n\n     Sec.

On April 15, 1996, pursuant to section \n     304(c) of the CAA, the House and the Senate agreed to \n     resolutions approving the final regulations. Specifically, \n     the Senate agreed to S. Res. 242, to provide for the approval \n     of final regulations that are applicable to the Senate and \n     the employees of the Senate; the House agreed to H. Res. 400, \n     to provide for the approval of final regulations that are \n     applicable to the House and the employees of the House; and \n     the House and the Senate agreed to S. Con. Res. 51, to \n     provide for approval of final regulations that are applicable \n     to employing offices and employees other than those offices \n     and employees of the House and the Senate. Accordingly, \n     pursuant to section 304(d) of the CAA, the Board submits \n     these regulations to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     for issuance by publication in the Congressional Record.\n        Pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 304(d) of the CAA, \n     the Board finds good cause for the regulations to become \n     effective on April 16, 1996, rather than 60 days after \n     issuance. Were the regulations not effective immediately upon \n     the expiration of the interim regulations on April 15, 1996, \n     covered employees, employing offices and the Office of \n     Compliance would be forced to operate under the same kind of \n     regulatory uncertainty that the Board sought to avoid by \n     adopting interim regulations effective as of January 23, \n     1996, which was the effective date of the relevant provisions \n     of the CAA.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 19th day of April, 1996.\n\n                                                Glen D.

C501.101 Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1) & (d), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to \n     covered employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSA, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n       (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations with \n     respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance has adopted pursuant to Sections 203(c) and 304 \n     of the CAA, which requires that the Board promulgate \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown * * * that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.''\n       (d) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors, \n     Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 203(c) and 304 of \n     the CAA, which directs the Board to promulgate regulations \n     implementing section 203 that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     a [of section 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown * * * that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' The regulations issued by the Board herein are on \n     all matters for which section 203 of the CAA requires a \n     regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment, based on the information available to it \n     at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, that, \n     with the exception of regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     section 203 of the CAA].''\n       (e) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\n     are intended to make the provisions adopted accord more \n     naturally to situations in the legislative branch. However, \n     by making these changes, the Board does not intend a \n     substantive difference between these regulations and those of \n     the Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     Sec. C501.102 Definitions.\n       For purposes of this chapter:\n       (a) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) FLSA or Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.), as applied by \n     section 203 of the CAA to covered employees and employing \n     offices.\n       (c) Covered employee means any employee, including an \n     applicant for employment and a former employee, of the (1) \n     the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the \n     Congressional Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; \n     (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment, but shall not include an intern.\n       (d) (1) Employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, the Botanic Garden, or the Senate Restaurants;\n       (2) Employee of the Capitol Police includes any member or \n     officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (e) Employing office and employer mean (1) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the Congressional \n     Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; (6) the \n     Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (f) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (h) Intern is an individual who (a) is performing services \n     in an employing office as part of a demonstrated educational \n     plan, and (b) is appointed on a temporary basis for a period \n     not to exceed 12 months; provided that if an intern is \n     appointed for a period shorter than 12 months, the intern may \n     be reappointed for additional periods as long as the total \n     length of the internship does not exceed 12 months; provided \n     further that the defintion of intern does not include \n     volunteers, fellows or pages.\n     Sec. C501.103 Coverage.\n       The coverage of Section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n     Sec. C501.104 Administrative authority.\n       (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of Section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n       (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of Sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n     Sec. C501.105 Effect of Interpretations of the Department of \n         Labor.\n       (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutorily-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. See \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No.8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its reasoning, \n     its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and \n     all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking \n     power to control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 \n     (1944).\n       (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the substantive \n     regulations implementing Section 203 of the CAA shall be \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for good \n     cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division. The Board is thus not \n     adopting such statements as part of its substantive \n     regulations.\n     Sec. C501.106 Application of the Portal-to-Portal Act of \n         1947.\n       (a) Consistent with Section 225 of the CAA, the Portal to \n     Portal Act (PPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 216 and 251 et seq., is \n     applicable in defining and delimiting the rights and \n     protections of the FLSA that are prescribed by the CAA. \n     Section 10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 259, provides in \n     pertinent part:\n       * * * [N]o employer shall be subject to any liability or \n     punishment for or on account of the failure of the employer \n     to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, * * * if he pleads \n     and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good \n     faith in conformity with and reliance on any written \n     administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation of [the Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n     Division of the Department of Labor] * * * or any \n     administrative practice or enforcement policy of such agency \n     with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. \n     Such a defense, if established shall be a bar to the action \n     or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or \n     omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is \n     modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority \n     to be invalid or of no legal effect.\n       (b) In defending any action or proceeding based on any act \n     or omission arising out of section 203 of the CAA, an \n     employing office may satisfy the standards set forth in \n     subsection (a) by pleading and proving good faith reliance \n     upon any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval or interpretation, of the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division of the Department of Labor: Provided, that \n     such regulation, order, ruling approval or interpretation had \n     not been superseded at the time of reliance by any \n     regulation, order, decision, or ruling of the Board or the \n     courts.\n\n  PART C531--WAGE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938\n\n                     Subpart A--Preliminary Matters\n\n       Sec.\n     C531.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     C531.1  Definitions.\n     C531.2  Purpose and scope.\n\n  Subpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     C531.3  General determinations of `reasonable cost'.\n     C531.6  Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n\n                    Subpart A--Preliminary Matters.\n\n     Sec.

C531.1 Definitions.\n       (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary \n     of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions \n     vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n       (b) Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n     Sec. C531.2 Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term `wage' to \n     include the `reasonable cost', as determined by the Secretary \n     of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee with \n     board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, \n     or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer \n     to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives the \n     Secretary authority to determine the `fair value.' of such \n     facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer or to \n     groups of employers similarly situated, on average value to \n     groups of employees, or other appropriate measures of `fair \n     value.' Whenever so determined and when applicable and \n     pertinent, the 'fair value' of the facilities involved shall \n     be includable as part of `wages' instead of the actual \n     measure of the costs of\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n     those facilities. The section provides, however, that the \n     cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be \n     included as part of `wages' if excluded therefrom by a bona \n     fide collective bargaining agreement. Section 3(m) also \n     provides a method for determining the wage of a tipped \n     employee.\n       (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the `reasonable cost' and `fair value' of board, lodging, or \n     other facilities having general application.\n\n\n Subpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost'' and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     Sec. C531.3  General determinations of `reasonable cost.'\n       (a) The term reasonable cost as used in section 3(m) of the \n     Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost \n     to the employer of the board, lodging, or other facilities \n     customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n       (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n       (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the depreciated amount of \n     capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the total \n     so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the fair \n     price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale), the \n     fair rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or \n     facilities offered for sale) shall be the reasonable cost. \n     The cost of operation and maintenance, the rate of \n     depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital invested \n     by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     good accounting practices does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term depreciation includes \n     obsolescence.\n       (d)(1) The cost of furnishing `facilities' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n       (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer.

C541.5b Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA \n         as applied by the CAA extend to executive, \n         administrative, and professional employees.\n       The FLSA, as amended and as applied by the CAA, includes \n     within the protection of the equal pay provisions those \n     employees exempt from the minimum wage and overtime pay \n     provisions as bona fide executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees (including any employee employed in \n     the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher \n     in elementary or secondary schools) under section 13(a)(1) of \n     the FLSA. Thus, for example, where an exempt administrative \n     employee and another employee of the employing office are \n     performing substantially ``equal work,'' the sex \n     discrimination prohibitions of section 6(d) are applicable \n     with respect to any wage differential between those two \n     employees.\n     Sec.

C547.0 Scope and effect of part.\n       (a) The regulations in this part set forth the requirements \n     of a ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' under section \n     7(e)(3)(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended (FLSA), as applied by the CAA. In determining the \n     total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the \n     FLSA requires to be included in the regular rate at which an \n     employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums \n     paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of \n     services performed by him during a given period, which are \n     paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting \n     the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n       (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single \n     program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or \n     trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n     Sec. C547.1 Essential requirements for qualifications.\n       (a) A ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' for the purpose \n     of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the FLSA as applied by the CAA is \n     required to meet all the standards set forth in paragraphs \n     (b) through (f) of this section and must not contain the \n     disqualifying provisions set forth in Sec. 547.2.\n       (b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite \n     program or arrangement in writing, adopted by the employer or \n     by contract as a result of collective bargaining and \n     communicated or made available to the employees, which is \n     established and maintained, in good faith, for the purpose of \n     encouraging voluntary thrift or savings by employees by \n     providing an incentive to employees to accumulate regularly \n     and retain cash savings for a reasonable period of time or to \n     save through the regular purchase of public or private \n     securities.\n       (c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or \n     categories of employees participating and the basis of their \n     eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n       (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n       (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total \n     earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total \n     contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount \n     saved or invested by the participating employees during that \n     year.\n       (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among \n     the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\n     Sec. C547.2 Disqualifying provisions.\n       (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n       (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n       (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n   PART C553--OVERTIME COMPENSATION: PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES \n     ENGAGED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE PROTECTION; OVERTIME AND \n   COMPENSATORY TIME-OFF FOR EMPLOYEES WHOSE WORK SCHEDULE DIRECTLY \n                 DEPENDS UPON THE SCHEDULE OF THE HOUSE\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Sec.\n     C553.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     C553.1  Definitions\n     C553.2  Purpose and scope\n\n Subpart C--Partial Exemption for Employees Engaged in Law Enforcement \n                          and Fire Protection\n\n     C553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\n     C553.202  Limitations.\n     C553.211  Law enforcement activities.\n     C553.212  Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\n     C553.213  Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n         protection and law enforcement activities.\n     C553.214  Trainees.\n     C553.215  Ambulance and rescue service employees.\n     C553.216  Other exemptions.\n     C553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined.\n     C553.221  Compensable hours of work.\n     C553.222  Sleep time.\n     C553.223  Meal time.\n     C553.224  ``Work period'' defined.\n     C553.225  Early relief.\n     C553.226  Training time.\n     C553.227  Outside employment.\n     C553.230  Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 to 28 \n         days--section 7(k).\n     C553.231  Compensatory time off.\n     C553.232  Overtime pay requirements.\n     C553.233  ``Regular rate'' defined.\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n Work Schedule Directly Depends upon the Schedule of the House and the \n                                 Senate\n\n     C553.301  Definition of ``directly depends.''\n     C553.302  Overtime compensation and compensatory time off for \n           an employee whose work schedule directly depends upon \n           the schedule of the House.\n     C553.303  Using compensatory time off.\n     C553.304  Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n         compensatory time off as of termination of service.\n\n                              Introduction\n\n     Sec.

C553.1  Definitions\n        (a) Act or FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938, as amended (52 Stat. 1060, as amended; 29 U.S.C. 201-\n     219), as applied by the CAA.\n       (b) 1985 Amendments means the Fair Labor Standards \n     Amendments of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-150).\n       (c) Public agency means an employing office as the term is \n     defined in Sec. --501.102 of this chapter, including the \n     Capitol Police.\n       (d) Section 7(k) means the provisions of Sec. 7(k) of the \n     FLSA as applied to covered employees and employing offices by \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA.\n     Sec. C553.2  Purpose and scope\n        The purpose of part C553 is to adopt with appropriate \n     modifications the regulations of the Secretary of Labor to \n     carry out those provisions of the FLSA relating to public \n     agency employees as they are applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices of the CAA. In particular, these \n     regulations apply section 7(k) as it relates to fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies.\n\n\n SUBPART C--PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                          AND FIRE PROTECTION\n\n     Sec. C553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\n        Section 7(k) of the Act provides a partial overtime pay \n     exemption for fire protection and law enforcement personnel \n     (including security personnel in correctional institutions) \n     who are employed by public agencies on a work period basis. \n     This section of the Act formerly permitted public agencies to \n     pay overtime compensation to such employees in work periods \n     of 28 consecutive days only after 216 hours of work. As \n     further set forth in Sec. C553.230 of this part, the 216-hour \n     standard has been replaced pursuant to the study mandated by \n     the statute, by 212 hours for fire protection employees and \n     171 hours for law enforcement employees. In the case of such \n     employees who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, overtime compensation is required when \n     the ratio of the number of hours worked to the number of days \n     in the work period exceeds the ratio of 212 (or 171) hours to \n     28 days.\n     Sec. C553.202  Limitations.\n        The application of Sec. 7(k), by its terms, is limited to \n     public agencies, and does not apply to any private \n     organization engaged in furnishing fire protection or law \n     enforcement services. This is so even if the services are \n     provided under contract with a public agency.\n\n                         Exemption Requirements\n\n     Sec. C553.211  Law enforcement activities.\n        (a) As used in Sec. 7(k) of the Act, the term ``any \n     employee . . . in law enforcement activities'' refers to any \n     employee (1) who is a uniformed or plainclothed member of a \n     body of officers and subordinates who are empowered by law to \n     enforce laws designed to maintain public peace and order and \n     to protect both life and property from accidental or willful \n     injury, and to prevent and detect crimes, (2) who has the \n     power to arrest, and (3) who is presently undergoing or has \n     undergone or will undergo on-the-job training and/or a course \n     of instruction and study which typically includes physical \n     training, self-defense, firearm proficiency, criminal and \n     civil law principles, investigative and law enforcement \n     techniques, community relations, medical aid and ethics.\n        (b) Employees who meet these tests are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank, or of their status as ``trainee,'' ``probationary,'' or \n     ``permanent,'' and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities such as equipment maintenance, and lecturing, or \n     to support activities of the type described in paragraph (g) \n     of this section, whether or not such assignment is for \n     training or familiarization purposes, or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity. The term would also include \n     rescue and ambulance service personnel if such personnel form \n     an integral part of the public agency's law enforcement \n     activities. See Sec. C553.215.\n        (c) Typically, employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities include police who are regularly employed and paid \n     as such. Other agency employees with duties not specifically \n     mentioned may, depending upon the particular facts and \n     pertinent statutory provisions in that jurisdiction, meet the \n     three tests described above. If so, they will also qualify as \n     law enforcement officers. Such employees might include, for \n     example, any law enforcement employee within the legislative \n     branch concerned with keeping public peace and order and \n     protecting life and property.\n        (d) Employees who do not meet each of the three tests \n     described above are not engaged in ``law enforcement \n     activities'' as that term is used in sections 7(k). Employees \n     who normally would not meet each of these tests include:\n       (1) Building inspectors (other than those defined in Sec. \n     C553.213(a)),\n       (2) Health inspectors,\n       (3) Sanitarians,\n       (4) civilian traffic employees who direct vehicular and \n     pedestrian traffic at specified intersections or other \n     control points,\n       (5) Civilian parking checkers who patrol assigned areas for \n     the purpose of discovering parking violations and issuing \n     appropriate warnings or appearance notices,\n       (6) Wage and hour compliance officers,\n       (7) Equal employment opportunity compliance officers, and\n       (8) Building guards whose primary duty is to protect the \n     lives and property of persons within the limited area of the \n     building.\n       (e) The term ``any employee in law enforcement activities'' \n     also includes, by express reference, ``security personnel in \n     correctional institutions''. Typically, such facilities may \n     include precinct house lockups. Employees of correctional \n     institutions who qualify as security personnel for purposes \n     of the section 7(k) exemption are those who have \n     responsibility for controlling and maintaining custody of \n     inmates and of safeguarding them from other inmates or for \n     supervising such functions, regardless of whether their \n     duties are performed inside the correctional institution or \n     outside the institution. These employees are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank or of their status as ``trainee,'' ``probationary,'' or \n     ``permanent,'' and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities, or to support activities\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\n     of the type described in paragraph (f) of this section, \n     whether or not such assignment is for training or \n     familiarization purposes or for reasons of illness, injury or \n     infirmity.\n       (f) Not included in the term ``employee in law enforcement \n     activities'' are the so-called ``civilian'' employees of law \n     enforcement agencies or correctional institutions who engage \n     in such support activities as those performed by dispatcher, \n     radio operators, apparatus and equipment maintenance and \n     repair workers, janitors, clerks and stenographers. Nor does \n     the term include employees in correctional institutions who \n     engage in building repair and maintenance, culinary services, \n     teaching, or in psychological, medical and paramedical \n     services. This is so even though such employees may, when \n     assigned to correctional institutions, come into regular \n     contact with the inmates in the performance of their duties.\n     Sec. C553.212 Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\n       (a) Employees engaged in fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities as described in Sec. C553.210 and C553.211, may \n     also engage in some nonexempt work which is not performed as \n     an incident to or in conjunction with their fire protection \n     or law enforcement activities. For example, firefighters who \n     work for forest conservation agencies may, during slack \n     times, plant trees and perform other conservation activities \n     unrelated to their firefighting duties. The performance of \n     such nonexempt work will not defeat the Sec. 7(k) exemption \n     unless it exceeds 20 percent of the total hours worked by \n     that employee during the workweek or applicable work period. \n     A person who spends more than 20 percent of his/her working \n     time in nonexempt activities is not considered to be an \n     employee engaged in fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities for purposes of this part.\n       (b) Public agency fire protection and law enforcement \n     personnel may, at their own option, undertake employment for \n     the same employer on an occasional or sporadic and part-time \n     basis in a different capacity from their regular employment. \n     The performance of such work does not affect the application \n     of the Sec. 7(k) exemption with respect to the regular \n     employment. In addition, the hours of work in the different \n     capacity need not be counted as hours worked for overtime \n     purposes on the regular job, nor are such hours counted in \n     determining the 20 percent tolerance for nonexempt work \n     discussed in paragraph (a) of this section.\n     Sec. C553.213 Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n         protection and law enforcement activities.\n       (a) Some public agencies have employees (often called \n     ``public safety officers'') who engage in both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, depending on the \n     agency needs at the time. This dual assignment would not \n     defeat the section 7(k) exemption, provided that each of the \n     activities performed meets the appropriate tests set forth in \n     Sec. C553.210 and C553.211. This is so regardless of how the \n     employee's time is divided between the two activities. \n     However, all time spent in nonexempt activities by public \n     safety officers within the work period, whether performed in \n     connection with fire protection or law enforcement functions, \n     or with neither, must be combined for purposes of the 20 \n     percent limitation on nonexempt work discussed in \n     Sec.C553.212.\n       (b) As specified in Sec.C553.230, the maximum hours \n     standards under section 7(k) are different for employees \n     engaged in fire protection and for employees engaged in law \n     enforcement. For those employees who perform both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, the applicable \n     standard is the one which applies to the activity in which \n     the employee spends the majority of work time during the work \n     period.\n     Sec. C553.214 Trainees.\n       The attendance at a bona fide fire or police academy or \n     other training facility, when required by the employing \n     agency, constitutes engagement in activities under section \n     7(k) only when the employee meets all the applicable tests \n     described in Sec. C553.210 or Sec. C553.211 (except for the \n     power of arrest for law enforcement personnel), as the case \n     may be. If the applicable tests are met, then basic training \n     or advanced training is considered incidental to, and part \n     of, the employee's fire protection or law enforcement \n     activities.\n     Sec. C553.215 Ambulance and rescue service employees.\n       Ambulance and rescue service employees of a public agency \n     other than a fire protection or law enforcement agency may be \n     treated as employees engaged in fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities of the type contemplated by Sec. 7(k) \n     if their services are substantially related to firefighting \n     or law enforcement activities in that (1) the ambulance and \n     rescue service employees have received training in the rescue \n     of fire, crime, and accident victims or firefighters or law \n     enforcement personnel injured in the performance of their \n     respective duties, and (2) the ambulance and rescue service \n     employees are regularly dispatched to fires, crime scenes, \n     riots, natural disasters and accidents. As provided in Sec. \n     C553.213(b), where employees perform both fire protection and \n     law enforcement activities, the applicable standard is the \n     one which applies to the activity in which the employee \n     spends the majority of work time during the work period.\n     Sec. C553.216 Other exemptions.\n       Although the 1974 Amendments to the FLSA as applied by the \n     CAA provide special exemptions for employees of public \n     agencies engaged in fire protection and law enforcement \n     activities, such workers may also be subject to other \n     exemptions in the Act, and public agencies may claim such \n     other applicable exemptions in lieu of Sec. 7(k). For \n     example, section 13(a)(1) as applied by the CAA provides a \n     complete minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for any \n     employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, \n     or professional capacity, as those terms are defined and \n     delimited in Part C541. The section 13(a)(1) exemption can be \n     claimed for any fire protection or law enforcement employee \n     who meets all of the tests specified in part C541 relating to \n     duties, responsibilities, and salary. Thus, high ranking \n     police officials who are engaged in law enforcement \n     activities, may also, depending on the facts, qualify for the \n     section 13(a)(1) exemption as ``executive'' employees. \n     Similarly, certain criminal investigative agents may qualify \n     as ``administrative'' employees under section 13(a)(1).\n\n            Tour of Duty and Compensable Hours of Work Rules\n\n     Sec. C553.220 ``Tour of duty'' defined.\n       (a) The term ``tour of duty'' is a unique concept \n     applicable only to employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed. This term, as used in section 7(k), \n     means the period of time during which an employee is \n     considered to be on duty for purposes of determining \n     compensable hours. It may be a scheduled or unscheduled \n     period. Such periods include 'shifts' assigned to \n     employees often days in advance of the performance of the \n     work. Scheduled periods also include time spent in work \n     outside the ``shift'' which the public agency employer \n     assigns. For example, a police officer may be assigned to \n     crowd control during a parade or other special event \n     outside of his or her shift.\n       (b) Unscheduled periods include time spent in court by \n     police officers, time spent handling emergency situations, \n     and time spent working after a shift to complete an \n     assignment. Such time must be included in the compensable \n     tour of duty even though the specific work performed may not \n     have been assigned in advance. (c) The tour of duty does not \n     include time spent working for a separate and independent \n     employer in certain types of special details as provided in \n     Sec. C553.227.\n     Sec. C553.221 Compensable hours of work.\n       (a) The rules under the FLSA as applied by the CAA on \n     compensable hours of work are applicable to employees for \n     whom the section 7(k) exemption is claimed. Special rules for \n     sleep time (Sec. C553.222) apply to both law enforcement and \n     firefighting employees for whom the section 7(k) exemption is \n     claimed. Also, special rules for meal time apply in the case \n     of firefighters (Sec. C553.223).\n       (b) Compensable hours of work generally include all of the \n     time during which an employee is on duty on the employer's \n     premises or at a prescribed workplace, as well as all other \n     time during which the employee is suffered or permitted to \n     work for the employer. Such time includes all pre-shift and \n     post-shift activities which are an integral part of the \n     employee's principal activity or which are closely related to \n     the performance of the principal activity, such as attending \n     roll call, writing up and completing tickets or reports, and \n     washing and re-racking fire hoses.\n       (c) Time spent away from the employer's premises under \n     conditions that are so circumscribed that they restrict the \n     employee from effectively using the time for personal \n     pursuits also constitutes compensable hours of work. For \n     example, where a police station must be evacuated because of \n     an electrical failure and the employees are expected to \n     remain in the vicinity and return to work after the emergency \n     has passed, the entire time spent away from the premises is \n     compensable. The employees in this example cannot use the \n     time for their personal pursuits.\n       (d) An employee who is not required to remain on the \n     employer's premises but is merely required to leave word at \n     home or with company officials where he or she may be reached \n     is not working while on call. Time spent at home on call may \n     or may not be compensable depending on whether the \n     restrictions placed on the employee preclude using the time \n     for personal pursuits. Where, for example, a firefighter has \n     returned home after the shift, with the understanding that he \n     or she is expected to return to work in the event of an \n     emergency in the night, such time spent at home is normally \n     not compensable. On the other hand, where the conditions \n     placed on the employee's activities are so restrictive that \n     the employee cannot use the time effectively for personal \n     pursuits, such time spent on call is compensable.\n       (e) Normal home to work travel is not compensable, even \n     where the employee is expected to report to work at a \n     location away from the location of the employer's premises.\n       (f) A police officer, who has completed his or her tour of \n     duty and who is given a patrol car to drive home and use on \n     personal business, is not working during the travel time even \n     where the radio must be left on so that the officer can \n     respond to emergency calls. Of course, the time spent in \n     responding to such calls is compensable.\n     Sec. C553.222 Sleep time.\n       (a) Where a public agency elects to pay overtime \n     compensation to firefighters and/or law enforcement personnel \n     in accordance with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public \n     agency may exclude sleep time from hours\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\n     worked if all the conditions for the exclusion of such time \n     are met.\n       (b) Where the employer has elected to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, sleep time cannot be excluded from the compensable \n     hours of work where\n       (1) The employee is on a tour of duty of less than 24 \n     hours, and\n       (2) Where the employee is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 \n     hours.\n       (c) Sleep time can be excluded from compensable hours of \n     work, however, in the case of police officers or firefighters \n     who are on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, but only if \n     there is an expressed or implied agreement between the \n     employer and the employees to exclude such time. In the \n     absence of such an agreement, the sleep time is compensable. \n     In no event shall the time excluded as sleep time exceed 8 \n     hours in a 24-hour period. If the sleep time is interrupted \n     by a call to duty, the interruption must be counted as hours \n     worked. If the sleep period is interrupted to such an extent \n     that the employee cannot get a reasonable night's sleep \n     (which, for enforcement purposes means at least 5 hours), the \n     entire time must be counted as hours of work.\n     Sec. C553.223 Meal time.\n       (a) If a public agency elects to pay overtime compensation \n     to firefighters and law enforcement personnel in accordance \n     with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public agency may \n     exclude meal time from hours worked if all the statutory \n     tests for the exclusion of such time are met.\n       (b) If a public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, the public agency may, in the case of law \n     enforcement personnel, exclude meal time from hours worked on \n     tours of duty of 24 hours or less, provided that the employee \n     is completely relieved from duty during the meal period, and \n     all the other statutory tests for the exclusion of such time \n     are met. On the other hand, where law enforcement personnel \n     are required to remain on call in barracks or similar \n     quarters, or are engaged in extended surveillance activities \n     (e.g., stakeouts'), they are not considered to be completely \n     relieved from duty, and any such meal periods would be \n     compensable.\n       (c) With respect to firefighters employed under section \n     7(k), who are confined to a duty station, the legislative \n     history of the Act indicates Congressional intent to mandate \n     a departure from the usual FLSA 'hours of work' rules and \n     adoption of an overtime standard keyed to the unique concept \n     of 'tour of duty' under which firefighters are employed. \n     Where the public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption for firefighters, meal time cannot be excluded from \n     the compensable hours of work where (1) the firefighter is on \n     a tour of duty of less than 24 hours, and (2) where the \n     firefighter is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 hours.\n       (d) In the case of police officers or firefighters who are \n     on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, meal time may be \n     excluded from compensable hours of work provided that the \n     statutory tests for exclusion of such hours are met.\n     Sec. C553.224 ``Work period'' defined.\n       (a) As used in section 7(k), the term `work period' refers \n     to any established and regularly recurring period of work \n     which, under the terms of the Act and legislative history, \n     cannot be less than 7 consecutive days nor more than 28 \n     consecutive days. Except for this limitation, the work period \n     can be of any length, and it need not coincide with the duty \n     cycle or pay period or with a particular day of the week or \n     hour of the day. Once the beginning and ending time of an \n     employee's work period is established, however, it remains \n     fixed regardless of how many hours are worked within the \n     period. The beginning and ending of the work period may be \n     changed, provided that the change is intended to be permanent \n     and is not designed to evade the overtime compensation \n     requirements of the Act.\n       (b) An employer may have one work period applicable to all \n     employees, or different work periods for different employees \n     or groups of employees.\n     Sec. C553.225 Early relief.\n       It is a common practice among employees engaged in fire \n     protection activities to relieve employees on the previous \n     shift prior to the scheduled starting time. Such early relief \n     time may occur pursuant to employee agreement, either \n     expressed or implied. This practice will not have the \n     effect of increasing the number of compensable hours of \n     work for employees employed under section 7(k) where it is \n     voluntary on the part of the employees and does not \n     result, over a period of time, in their failure to receive \n     proper compensation for all hours actually worked. On the \n     other hand, if the practice is required by the employer, \n     the time involved must be added to the employee's tour of \n     duty and treated as compensable hours of work.\n     Sec. C553.226 Training time.\n       (a) The general rules for determining the compensability of \n     training time under the FLSA apply to employees engaged in \n     law enforcement or fire protection activities.\n       (b) While time spent in attending training required by an \n     employer is normally considered compensable hours of work, \n     following are situations where time spent by employees in \n     required training is considered to be noncompensable:\n       (1) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required by law \n     for certification of public and private sector employees \n     within a particular governmental jurisdiction (e.g., \n     certification of public and private emergency rescue \n     workers), does not constitute compensable hours of work for \n     public employees within that jurisdiction and subordinate \n     jurisdictions.\n       (2) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required for \n     certification of employees of a governmental jurisdiction by \n     law of a higher level of government, does not constitute \n     compensable hours of work.\n       (3) Time spent in the training described in paragraphs (b) \n     (1) or (2) of this section is not compensable, even if all or \n     part of the costs of the training is borne by the employer.\n       (c) Police officers or firefighters, who are in attendance \n     at a police or fire academy or other training facility, are \n     not considered to be on duty during those times when they are \n     not in class or at a training session, if they are free to \n     use such time for personal pursuits. Such free time is not \n     compensable.\n     Sec. C553.227 Outside employment.\n       (a) Section 7(p)(1) makes special provision for fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies \n     who, at their own option, perform special duty work in fire \n     protection, law enforcement or related activities for a \n     separate and independent employer (public or private) during \n     their off-duty hours. The hours of work for the separate and \n     independent employer are not combined with the hours worked \n     for the primary public agency employer for purposes of \n     overtime compensation.\n       (b) Section 7(p)(1) applies to such outside employment \n     provided (1) the special detail work is performed solely at \n     the employee's option, and (2) the two employers are in fact \n     separate and independent.\n       (c) Whether two employers are, in fact, separate and \n     independent can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n       (d) The primary employer may facilitate the employment or \n     affect the conditions of employment of such employees. For \n     example, a police department may maintain a roster of \n     officers who wish to perform such work. The department may \n     also select the officers for special details from a list of \n     those wishing to participate, negotiate their pay, and retain \n     a fee for administrative expenses. The department may require \n     that the separate and independent employer pay the fee for \n     such services directly to the department, and establish \n     procedures for the officers to receive their pay for the \n     special details through the agency's payroll system. Finally, \n     the department may require that the officers observe their \n     normal standards of conduct during such details and take \n     disciplinary action against those who fail to do so.\n       (e) Section 7(p)(1) applies to special details even where a \n     State law or local ordinance requires that such work be \n     performed and that only law enforcement or fire protection \n     employees of a public agency in the same jurisdiction perform \n     the work. For example, a city ordinance may require the \n     presence of city police officers at a convention center \n     during concerts or sports events. If the officers perform \n     such work at their own option, the hours of work need not be \n     combined with the hours of work for their primary employer in \n     computing overtime compensation.\n       (f) The principles in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this \n     section with respect to special details of public agency fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees under section \n     7(p)(1) are exceptions to the usual rules on joint employment \n     set forth in part 791 of this title.\n       (g) Where an employee is directed by the public agency to \n     perform work for a second employer, section 7(p)(1) does not \n     apply. Thus, assignments of police officers outside of their \n     normal work hours to perform crowd control at a parade, where \n     the assignments are not solely at the option of the officers, \n     would not qualify as special details subject to this \n     exception. This would be true even if the parade organizers \n     reimburse the public agency for providing such services.\n       (h) Section 7(p)(1) does not prevent a public agency from \n     prohibiting or restricting outside employment by its \n     employees.\n\n                      Overtime Compensation Rules\n\n     Sec. C553.230 Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 \n         to 28 days--section 7(k).\n       (a) For those employees engaged in fire protection \n     activities who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is required \n     under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked exceeds \n     the number of hours which bears the same relationship to 212 \n     as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (b) For those employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities (including security personnel in correctional \n     institutions) who have a work period of at least 7 but less \n     than 28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is \n     required under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked \n     exceeds the number of hours which bears the same relationship \n     to 171 as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (c) The ratio of 212 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in fire protection activities is 7.57 hours per day (rounded) \n     and the ratio of 171 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in law enforcement activities is 6.11 hours per day \n     (rounded). Accordingly, overtime compensation (in premium pay \n     or compensatory time) is required for all hours worked in \n     excess of the following maximum hours standards (rounded to \n     the nearest whole hour):\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Work period (days)  \n                                                ------------------------\n            Maximum hours standards                 Fire         Law    \n                                                 protection  enforcement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n28.............................................         212         171 \n27.............................................         204         165 \n26.............................................         197         159 \n25.............................................         189         153 \n24.............................................         182         147 \n23.............................................         174         141 \n22.............................................         167         134 \n21.............................................         159         128 \n20.............................................         151         122 \n19.............................................         144         116 \n18.............................................         136         110 \n17.............................................         129         104 \n16.............................................         121          98 \n15.............................................         114          92 \n14.............................................         106          86 \n13.............................................          98          79 \n12.............................................          91          73 \n11.............................................          83          67 \n10.............................................          76          61 \n9..............................................          68          55 \n8..............................................          61          49 \n7..............................................          53          43 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Sec. C553.231 Compensatory time off.\n       (a) Law enforcement and fire protection employees who are \n     subject to the section 7(k) exemption may receive \n     compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay for hours \n     worked in excess of the maximum for their work period as set \n     forth in Sec. C553.230.\n       (b) Section 7(k) permits public agencies to balance the \n     hours of work over an entire work period for law enforcement \n     and fire protection employees. For example, if a \n     firefighter's work period is 28 consecutive days, and he or \n     she works 80 hours in each of the first two weeks, but only \n     52 hours in the third week, and does not work in the fourth \n     week, no overtime compensation (in cash wages or compensatory \n     time) would be required since the total hours worked do not \n     exceed 212 for the work period. If the same firefighter had a \n     work period of only 14 days, overtime compensation or \n     compensatory time off would be due for 54 hours (160 minus \n     106 hours) in the first 14 day work period.\n     Sec. C553.232 Overtime pay requirements.\n       If a public agency pays employees subject to section 7(k) \n     for overtime hours worked in cash wages rather than \n     compensatory time off, such wages must be paid at one and \n     one-half times the employees' regular rate of pay.\n     Sec. C553.233 `Regular rate' defined.\n       The statutory rules for computing an employees' `regular \n     rate', for purposes of the Act's overtime pay requirements \n     are applicable to employees or whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed when overtime compensation is provided \n     in cash wages.\n\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n Work Schedule Directly Depends upon the Schedule of the House and the \n                                 Senate\n\n     Sec. C553.301 Definition of ``directly depends''.\n       For the purposes of this Part, a covered employees' work \n     schedule ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate only if the eligible employee \n     performs work that directly supports the conduct of \n     legislative or other business in the chamber and works hours \n     that regularly change in response to the schedule of the \n     House and the Senate.\n     Sec. C553.302 Overtime compensation and compensatory time off \n         for an employee whose work schedule directly depends upon \n         the schedule of the House and Senate.\n       No employing office shall be deemed to have violated \n     section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the protections \n     of section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (``FLSA'') to \n     covered employees and employing office, by employing any \n     employee for a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable to such employee under section 7(a) of the FLSA \n     where the employees' work schedule directly depends on the \n     schedule of the House of Representatives or the Senate within \n     the meaning of Sec. C553.301, and: (a) the employee is \n     compensated at the rate of time-and-a-half in pay for all \n     hours in excess of 40 and up to 60 hours in a workweek, and \n     (b) the employee is compensated at the rate of time-and-a-\n     half in either pay or in time off for all hours in excess of \n     60 hours in a workweek.\n     Sec. C553.303 Using compensatory time off.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time off under \n     Sec. C553.302 upon his or her request, shall be permitted by \n     the employing office to use such time within a reasonable \n     period after making the request, unless the employing office \n     makes a bona fide determination that the needs of the \n     operations of the office do not allow the taking of \n     compensatory time off at the time of the request. An employee \n     may renew the request at a subsequent time. An employing \n     office may also, upon reasonable notice, require an employee \n     to use accrued compensatory time-off.\n     Sec. C553.304 Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n         compensatory time off as of termination of service.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time authorized by \n     this regulation shall, upon termination of employment, be \n     paid for the unused compensatory time at the rate earned by \n     the employee at the time the employee receives such payment.\n\n                   PART C570--CHILD LABOR REGULATIONS\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.\n     C570.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations \n         of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the \n         Office of Compliance.\n     C570.1  Definitions.\n     C570.2  Minimum age standards.\n\n Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (Child \n                             Labor Reg. 3)\n\n     C570.31  Determination.\n     C570.32  Effect of this subpart.\n     C570.33  Occupations.\n     C570.35  Periods and conditions of employment.\n\n  Subpart E--Occupations Particularly Hazardous for the Employment of \nMinors Between 16 and 18 Years of Age or Detrimental to Their Health or \n                               Well-Being\n\n     C570.50  General.\n     C570.51  Occupations in or about plants or establishments \n         manufacturing or storing explosives or articles \n         containing explosive components (Order 1).\n     C570.52  Occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside \n         helper (Order 2).\n     C570.55  Occupations involved in the operation of power-\n         driven woodworking machines (Order 5).\n     C570.58  Occupations involved in the operation of power-\n         driven hoisting apparatus (Order 7).\n     C570.59  Occupations involved in the operations of power-\n         driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines \n         (Order 8).\n     C570.62  Occupations involved in the operation of bakery \n         machines (Order 11).\n     C570.63  Occupations involved in the operation of paper-\n         products machines (Order 12).\n     C570.65  Occupations involved in the operations of circular \n         saws, band saws, and guillotine shears (Order 14).\n     C570.66  Occupations involved in wrecking and demolition \n         operations (Order 15).\n     C570.67  Occupations in roofing operations (Order 16).\n     C570.68  Occupations in excavation operations (Order 17).\n\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.

On April 15, 1996, pursuant to section 304(c) of the \n     CAA, the House and the Senate agreed to resolutions approving \n     the final regulations. Specifically, the Senate agreed to S. \n     Res. 242, to provide for the approval of final regulations \n     that are applicable to the Senate and the employees of the \n     Senate; the House agreed to H. Res. 400, to provide for the \n     approval of final regulations that are applicable to the \n     House and the employees of the House; and the House and the \n     Senate agreed to S. Con. Res. 51, to provide for approval of \n     final regulations that are applicable to employing offices \n     and employees other than those offices and employees of the \n     House and the Senate. Accordingly, pursuant section 304(d) of \n     the CAA, the Board submits these regulations to the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\n     and the President pro tempore of the Senate for issuance by \n     publication in the Congressional Record.\n       Pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 304(d) of the CAA, the \n     Board finds good cause for the regulations of become \n     effective on April 16, 1996, rather than 60 days after \n     issuance. Were the regulations not effective immediately upon \n     the expiration of the interim regulations on April 15, 1996, \n     covered employees, employing offices and the Office of \n     Compliance would be forced to operate under the same kind of \n     regulatory uncertainty that the Board sought to avoid by \n     adopting interim regulations effective as of the January 23, \n     1996, which was the effective date of the relevant provisions \n     of the CAA.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 19th day of April, 1996.\n                                                    Glen D. Nager,\n                         Chair of the Board, Office of Compliance.\n\n       Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance hereby issues on an the following final \n     regulations:\n       Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance hereby issues following final regulations:\n\n                          [Final Regulations]\n\n    Application of Rights and Protections of the Worker Adjustment \n Retraining and Notification Act of 1988 (Implementing Section 204 of \n                                the CAA)\n\n       Section\n     639.1  Purpose and scope.\n     639.2  What does WARN require?\n     639.3  Definitions.\n     639.4  Who must give notice?\n     639.5  When must notice be given?\n     639.6  Who must receive notice?\n     639.7  What must the notice contain?\n     639.8  How is the notice served?\n     639.9  When may notice be given less than 60 days in advance?\n     639.10  When may notice be extended?\n     Sec. 639.1 Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Purpose of WARN as applied by the CAA. Section 205 of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act, P.L. 104-1 (``CAA''), \n     provides protection to covered employees and their families \n     by requiring employing offices to provide notification 60 \n     calendar days in advance of office closings and mass layoffs \n     within the meaning of section 3 of the Worker Adjustment and \n     Retraining Notification Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2102. \n     Advance notice provides workers and their families some \n     transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of \n     employment, to seek and obtain alternative jobs and, if \n     necessary, to enter skill training or retraining that will \n     allow these workers to successfully compete in the job \n     market. As used in these regulations, WARN shall refer to the \n     provisions of WARN applied to covered employing offices by \n     section 205 of the CAA.\n       (b) Scope of these regulations. These regulations are \n     issued by the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, \n     pursuant to sections 205(c) and 304 of the CAA, which directs \n     the Board to promulgate regulations implementing section 205 \n     that are the same as substantive regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) [of section 205 of the CAA] \n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown. . . that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section. The regulations issued by the \n     Board herein are on all matters for which section 205 of the \n     CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is \n     the Board s considered judgment, based on the information \n     available to it at the time of promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of regulations adopted \n     and set forth herein, there are no other ``substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 205 of the CAA].''\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these sections and those of the Secretary \n     from which they are derived. Moreover, such changes, in and \n     of themselves, are not intended to constitute an \n     interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n       These regulations establish basic definitions and rules for \n     giving notice, implementing the provisions of WARN. The \n     objective of these regulations is to establish clear \n     principles and broad guidelines which can be applied in \n     specific circumstances. However, it is recognized that \n     rulemaking cannot address the multitude of employing office-\n     specific situations in which advance notice will be given.\n       (c) Notice in ambiguous situations. It is civically \n     desirable and it would appear to be good business practice \n     for an employing office to provide advance notice, where \n     reasonably possible, to its workers or unions when \n     terminating a significant number of employees. The Office \n     encourages employing offices to give notice in such \n     circumstances.\n       (d) WARN not to supersede other laws and contracts. The \n     provisions of WARN do not supersede any otherwise applicable \n     laws or collective bargaining agreements that provide for \n     additional notice or additional rights and remedies. If such \n     law or agreement provides for a longer notice period, WARN \n     notice shall run concurrently with that additional notice \n     period. Collective bargaining agreements may be used to \n     clarify or amplify the terms and conditions of WARN, but may \n     not reduce WARN rights.\n     Sec. 639.2 What does WARN require?\n       WARN requires employing offices that are planning an office \n     closing or a mass layoff to give affected employees at least \n     60 days' notice of such an employment action. While the 60-\n     day period is the minimum for advance notice, this provision \n     is not intended to discourage employing offices from \n     voluntarily providing longer periods of advance notice. Not \n     all office closings and layoffs are subject to WARN, and \n     certain employment thresholds must be reached before WARN \n     applies. WARN sets out specific exemptions, and provides for \n     a reduction in the notification period in particular \n     circumstances. Remedies authorized under section 205 of the \n     CAA may be assessed against employing offices that violate \n     WARN requirements.\n     Sec. 639.3 Definitions.\n       (a) Employing office. (1) The term ``employing office'' \n     means any of the entities listed in section 101(9) of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9) that employs--\n       (i) 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; \n     or\n       (ii) employs 100 or more employees, including part-time \n     employees, who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per \n     week, exclusive of overtime. Workers on temporary layoff or \n     on leave who have a reasonable expectation of recall are \n     counted as employees. An employee has a ``reasonable \n     expectation of recall'' when he/she understands, through \n     notification or through common practice, that his/her \n     employment with the employing office has been temporarily \n     interrupted and that he/she will be recalled to the same or \n     to a similar job.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN, are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     employing office.\n       (3) An employing office may have one or more sites of \n     employment under common control.\n       (b) Office closing. The term ``office closing'' means the \n     permanent or temporary shutdown of a ``single site of \n     employment'', or one or more ``facilities or operating \n     units'' within a single site of employment, if the shutdown \n     results in an ``employment loss'' during any 30-day period at \n     the single site of employment for 50 or more employees, \n     excluding any part-time employees. An employment action that \n     results in the effective cessation of the work performed by a \n     unit, even if a few employees remain, is a shutdown. A \n     ``temporary shutdown'' triggers the notice requirement only \n     if there are a sufficient number of terminations, layoffs \n     exceeding 6 months, or reductions in hours of work as \n     specified under the definition of ``employment loss.''\n       (c) Mass layoff. (1) The term ``mass layoff'' means a \n     reduction in force which first, is not the result of an \n     office closing, and second, results in an employment loss at \n     the single site of employment during any 30-day period for:\n       (i) At least 33 percent of the active employees, excluding \n     part-time employees, and\n       (ii) At least 50 employees, excluding part-time employees.\n       Where 500 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) \n     are affected, the 33% requirement does not apply, and notice \n     is required if the other criteria are met. Office closings \n     involve employment loss which results from the shutdown of \n     one or more distinct units within a single site or the entire \n     site. A mass layoff involves employment loss, regardless of \n     whether one or more units are shut down at the site.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     office closing or mass layoff. For example, if an employing \n     office closes a temporary project on which 10 permanent and \n     40 temporary workers are employed, a covered office closing \n     has occurred although only 10 workers are entitled to notice.\n       (d) Representative. The term ``representative'' means an \n     exclusive representative of employees within the meaning of 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7101 et seq., as applied to covered \n     employees and employing offices by section 220 of the CAA, 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1351.\n       (e) Affected employees. The term ``affected employees'' \n     means employees who may reasonably be expected to experience \n     an employment loss as a consequence of a proposed office \n     closing or mass layoff by their employing office. This \n     includes individually identifiable employees who will likely \n     lose their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, \n     to the extent that such individual workers reasonably can be \n     identified at the time notice is required to be given. The \n     term ``affected employees'' includes managerial and \n     supervisory employees. Consultant or contract employees who \n     have a separate employment relationship with another \n     employing office or employer and are paid by that other \n     employing office or employer, or who are self-employed, are \n     not ``affected employees'' of the operations to which they \n     are assigned. In addition, for purposes of determining \n     whether coverage thresholds are met, either incumbent workers \n     in jobs being eliminated or, if known 60 days in advance, the \n     actual employees who suffer an employment loss may be \n     counted.\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\n       (f) Employment loss. (1) The term ``employment loss'' means \n     (i) an employment termination, other than a discharge for \n     cause, voluntary departure, or retirement, (ii) a layoff \n     exceeding 6 months, or (iii) a reduction in hours of work of \n     individual employees of more than 50% during each month of \n     any 6-month period.\n       (2) Where a termination or a layoff (see paragraphs \n     (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section) is involved, an \n     employment loss does not occur when an employee is reassigned \n     or transferred to employing office-sponsored programs, such \n     as retraining or job search activities, as long as the \n     reassignment does not constitute a constructive discharge or \n     other involuntary termination.\n       (3) An employee is not considered to have experienced an \n     employment loss if the closing or layoff is the result of the \n     relocation or consolidation of part or all of the employing \n     office's operations and, prior to the closing or layoff--\n       (i) The employing office offers to transfer the employee to \n     a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting \n     distance with no more than a 6-month break in employment, or\n       (ii) The employing office offers to transfer the employee \n     to any other site of employment regardless of distance with \n     no more than a 6-month break in employment, and the employee \n     accepts within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or \n     layoff, whichever is later.\n       (4) A ``relocation or consolidation'' of part or all of an \n     employing office s operations, for purposes of paragraph \n     Sec. 639.3(f)(3), means that some definable operations are \n     transferred to a different site of employment and that \n     transfer results in an office closing or mass layoff.\n       (g) Part-time employee. The term ``part-time'' employee \n     means an employee who is employed for an average of fewer \n     than 20 hours per week or who has been employed for fewer \n     than 6 of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice is \n     required, including workers who work full-time. This term may \n     include workers who would traditionally be understood as \n     ``seasonal'' employees. The period to be used for calculating \n     whether a worker has worked ``an average of fewer than 20 \n     hours per week'' is the shorter of the actual time the worker \n     has been employed or the most recent 90 days.\n       (h) Single site of employment. (1) A single site of \n     employment can refer to either a single location or a group \n     of contiguous locations. Separate facilities across the \n     street from one another may be considered a single site of \n     employment.\n       (2) There may be several single sites of employment within \n     a single building, such as an office building, if separate \n     employing offices conduct activities within such a building. \n     For example, an office building housing 50 different \n     employing offices will contain 50 single sites of employment. \n     The offices of each employing office will be its single site \n     of employment.\n       (3) Separate buildings or areas which are not directly \n     connected or in immediate proximity may be considered a \n     single site of employment if they are in reasonable \n     geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share \n     the same staff and equipment.\n       (4) Non-contiguous sites in the same geographic area which \n     do not share the same staff or operational purpose should not \n     be considered a single site.\n       (5) Contiguous buildings operated by the same employing \n     office which have separate management and have separate \n     workforces are considered separate single sites of \n     employment.\n       (6) For workers whose primary duties require travel from \n     point to point, who are outstationed, or whose primary duties \n     involve work outside any of the employing office's regular \n     employment sites (e.g., railroad workers, bus drivers, \n     salespersons), the single site of employment to which they \n     are assigned as their home base, from which their work is \n     assigned, or to which they report will be the single site in \n     which they are covered for WARN purposes.\n       (7) Foreign sites of employment are not covered under WARN. \n     U.S. workers at such sites are counted to determine whether \n     an employing office is covered as an employing office under \n     Sec. 639.3(a).\n       (8) The term ``single site of employment'' may also apply \n     to truly unusual organizational situations where the above \n     criteria do not reasonably apply. The application of this \n     definition with the intent to evade the purpose of WARN to \n     provide notice is not acceptable.\n       (i) Facility or operating unit. The term ``facility'' \n     refers to a building or buildings. The term ``operating \n     unit'' refers to an organizationally or operationally \n     distinct product, operation, or specific work function within \n     or across facilities at the single site.\n     Sec. 639.4 Who must give notice?\n       Section 205(a)(1) of the CAA states that ``[n]o employing \n     office shall be closed or a mass layoff ordered within the \n     meaning of section 3 of [WARN] until the end of a 60-day \n     period after the employing office serves written notice of \n     such prospective closing or layoff. . .'' Therefore, an \n     employing office that is anticipating carrying out an office \n     closing or mass layoff is required to give notice to affected \n     employees or their representative(s). (See definitions in \n     Sec. 639.3 of this part.).\n       (a) It is the responsibility of the employing office to \n     decide the most appropriate person within the employing \n     office's organization to prepare and deliver the notice to \n     affected employees or their representative(s). In most \n     instances, this may be the local site office manager, the \n     local personnel director or a labor relations officer.\n       (b) An employing office that has previously announced and \n     carried out a short-term layoff (6 months or less) which is \n     being extended beyond 6 months due to circumstances not \n     reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff is \n     required to give notice when it becomes reasonably \n     foreseeable that the extension is required. A layoff \n     extending beyond 6 months from the date the layoff commenced \n     for any other reason shall be treated as an employment loss \n     from the date of its commencement.\n       (c) In the case of the privatization or sale of part or all \n     of an employing office's operations, the employing office is \n     responsible for providing notice of any office closing or \n     mass layoff which takes place up to and including the \n     effective date (time) of the privatization or sale, and the \n     contractor or buyer is responsible for providing any required \n     notice of any office closing or mass layoff that takes place \n     thereafter.\n       (1) If the employing office is made aware of any definite \n     plans on the part of the buyer or contractor to carry out an \n     office closing or mass layoff within 60 days of purchase, the \n     employing office may give notice to affected employees as an \n     agent of the buyer or contractor, if so empowered. If the \n     employing office does not give notice, the buyer or \n     contractor is, nevertheless, responsible to give notice. If \n     the employing office gives notice as the agent of the buyer \n     or contractor, the responsibility for notice still remains \n     with the buyer or contractor.\n       (2) It may be prudent for the buyer or contractor and \n     employing office to determine the impacts of the \n     privatization or sale on workers, and to arrange between them \n     for advance notice to be given to affected employees or their \n     representative(s), if a mass layoff or office closing is \n     planned.\n     Sec. 639.5 When must notice be given?\n       (a) General rule. (1) With certain exceptions discussed in \n     paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in Sec. 639.9 of \n     this part, notice must be given at least 60 calendar days \n     prior to any planned office closing or mass layoff, as \n     defined in these regulations. When all employees are not \n     terminated on the same date, the date of the first individual \n     termination within the statutory 30- day or 90-day period \n     triggers the 60-day notice requirement. A worker's last day \n     of employment is considered the date of that worker's layoff. \n     The first and each subsequent group of terminees are entitled \n     to a full 60 days' notice. In order for an employing office \n     to decide whether issuing notice is required, the employing \n     office should--\n       (i) Look ahead 30 days and behind 30 days to determine \n     whether employment actions both taken and planned will, in \n     the aggregate for any 30-day period, reach the minimum \n     numbers for an office closing or a mass layoff and thus \n     trigger the notice requirement; and\n       (ii) Look ahead 90 days and behind 90 days to determine \n     whether employment actions both taken and planned each of \n     which separately is not of sufficient size to trigger WARN \n     coverage will, in the aggregate for any 90-day period, reach \n     the minimum numbers for an office closing or a mass layoff \n     and thus trigger the notice requirement. An employing office \n     is not, however, required under section 3(d) to give notice \n     if the employing office demonstrates that the separate \n     employment losses are the result of separate and distinct \n     actions and causes, and are not an attempt to evade the \n     requirements of WARN.\n       (2) The point in time at which the number of employees is \n     to be measured for the purpose of determining coverage is the \n     date the first notice is required to be given. If this \n     ``snapshot'' of the number of employees employed on that date \n     is clearly unrepresentative of the ordinary or average \n     employment level, then a more representative number can be \n     used to determine coverage. Examples of unrepresentative \n     employment levels include cases when the level is near the \n     peak or trough of an employment cycle or when large upward or \n     downward shifts in the number of employees occur around the \n     time notice is to be given. A more representative number may \n     be an average number of employees over a recent period of \n     time or the number of employees on an alternative date which \n     is more representative of normal employment levels. \n     Alternative methods cannot be used to evade the purpose of \n     WARN, and should only be used in unusual circumstances.\n       (b) Transfers. (1) Notice is not required in certain cases \n     involving transfers, as described under the definition of \n     employment loss at Sec. 639.3(f) of this part.\n       (2) An offer of reassignment to a different site of \n     employment should not be deemed to be a ``transfer'' if the \n     new job constitutes a constructive discharge.\n       (3) The meaning of the term ``reasonable commuting \n     distance'' will vary with local conditions. In determining \n     what is a ``reasonable commuting distance,'' consideration \n     should be given to the following factors: geographic \n     accessibility of the place of work, the quality of the roads, \n     customarily available transportation, and the usual travel \n     time.\n       (4) In cases where the transfer is beyond reasonable \n     commuting distance, the employing office may become liable \n     for failure to give notice if an offer to transfer is not \n     accepted within 30 days of the offer or of the\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\n     closing or layoff (whichever is later). Depending upon when \n     the offer of transfer was made by the employing office, the \n     normal 60-day notice period may have expired and the office \n     closing or mass layoff may have occurred. An employing office \n     is, therefore, well advised to provide 60-day advance notice \n     as part of the transfer offer.\n       (c) Temporary employment. (1) No notice is required if the \n     closing is of a temporary facility, or if the closing or \n     layoff is the result of the completion of a particular \n     project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired \n     with the understanding that their employment was limited to \n     the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking.\n       (2) Employees must clearly understand at the time of hire \n     that their employment is temporary. When such understandings \n     exist will be determined by reference to employment \n     contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or employment \n     practices of other employing offices or a locality, but the \n     burden of proof will lie with the employing office to show \n     that the temporary nature of the project or facility was \n     clearly communicated should questions arise regarding the \n     temporary employment understandings.\n     Sec. 639.6  Who must receive notice?\n       Section 3(a) of WARN provides for notice to each \n     representative of the affected employees as of the time \n     notice is required to be given or, if there is no such \n     representative at that time, to each affected employee.\n       (a) Representative(s) of affected employees. Written notice \n     is to be served upon the chief elected officer of the \n     exclusive representative(s) or bargaining agent(s) of \n     affected employees at the time of the notice. If this person \n     is not the same as the officer of the local union(s) \n     representing affected employees, it is recommended that a \n     copy also be given to the local union official(s).\n       (b) Affected employees. Notice is required to be given to \n     employees who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss. This includes employees who will likely lose \n     their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, to the \n     extent that such workers can be identified at the time notice \n     is required to be given. If, at the time notice is required \n     to be given, the employing office cannot identify the \n     employee who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss due to the elimination of a particular \n     position, the employing office must provide notice to the \n     incumbent in that position. While part-time employees are not \n     counted in determining whether office closing or mass layoff \n     thresholds are reached, such workers are due notice.\n     Sec. 639.7  What must the notice contain?\n       (a) Notice must be specific. (1) All notice must be \n     specific.\n       (2) Where voluntary notice has been given more than 60 days \n     in advance, but does not contain all of the required elements \n     set out in this section, the employing office must ensure \n     that all of the information required by this section is \n     provided in writing to the parties listed in Sec. 639.6 at \n     least 60 days in advance of a covered employment action.\n       (3) Notice may be given conditional upon the occurrence or \n     nonoccurrence of an event only when the event is definite and \n     the consequences of its occurrence or nonoccurrence will \n     necessarily, in the normal course of operations, lead to a \n     covered office closing or mass layoff less than 60 days after \n     the event. The notice must contain each of the elements set \n     out in this section.\n       (4) The information provided in the notice shall be based \n     on the best information available to the employing office at \n     the time the notice is served. It is not the intent of the \n     regulations that errors in the information provided in a \n     notice that occur because events subsequently change or that \n     are minor, inadvertent errors are to be the basis for finding \n     a violation of WARN.\n       (b) As used in this section, the term ``date'' refers to a \n     specific date or to a 14-day period during which a separation \n     or separations are expected to occur. If separations are \n     planned according to a schedule, the schedule should indicate \n     the specific dates on which or the beginning date of each 14-\n     day period during which any separations are expected to \n     occur. Where a 14-day period is used, notice must be given at \n     least 60 days in advance of the first day of the period.\n       (c) Notice to each representative of affected employees is \n     to contain:\n       (1) The name and address of the employment site where the \n     office closing or mass layoff will occur, and the name and \n     telephone number of an employing office official to contact \n     for further information;\n       (2) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (3) The expected date of the first separation and the \n     anticipated schedule for making separations;\n       (4) The job titles of positions to be affected and the \n     names of the workers currently holding affected jobs.\n       The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n       (d) Notice to each affected employee who does not have a \n     representative is to be written in language understandable to \n     the employees and is to contain:\n       (1) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (2) The expected date when the office closing or mass \n     layoff will commence and the expected date when the \n     individual employee will be separated;\n       (3) An indication whether or not bumping rights exist;\n       (4) The name and telephone number of an employing office \n     official to contact for further information.\n       The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n     Sec. 639.8 How is the notice served?\n       Any reasonable method of delivery to the parties listed \n     under Sec. 639.6 of this part which is designed to ensure \n     receipt of notice of at least 60 days before separation is \n     acceptable (e.g., first class mail, personal delivery with \n     optional signed receipt). In the case of notification \n     directly to affected employees, insertion of notice into pay \n     envelopes is another viable option. A ticketed notice, i.e., \n     preprinted notice regularly included in each employee's pay \n     check or pay envelope, does not meet the requirements of \n     WARN.\n     Sec. 639.9 When may notice be given less than 60 days in \n         advance?\n       Section 3(b) of WARN, as applied by section 205 of the CAA, \n     sets forth two conditions under which the notification period \n     may be reduced to less than 60 days. The employing office \n     bears the burden of proof that conditions for the exceptions \n     have been met. If one of the exceptions is applicable, the \n     employing office must give as much notice as is practicable \n     to the union and non-represented employees and this may, in \n     some circumstances, be notice after the fact. The employing \n     office must, at the time notice actually is given, provide a \n     brief statement of the reason for reducing the notice period, \n     in addition to the other elements set out in Sec. 639.7.\n       (a) The ``unforeseeable business circumstances'' exception \n     under section 3(b)(2)(A) of WARN, as applied under the CAA, \n     applies to office closings and mass layoffs caused by \n     circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the \n     time that 60-day notice would have been required.\n       (1) An important indicator of a circumstance that is not \n     reasonably foreseeable is that the circumstance is caused by \n     some sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition \n     outside the employing office's control.\n       (2) The test for determining when circumstances are not \n     reasonably foreseeable focuses on an employing office's \n     business judgment. The employing office must exercise such \n     reasonable business judgment as would a similarly situated \n     employing office in predicting the demands of its operations. \n     The employing office is not required, however, to accurately \n     predict general economic conditions that also may affect its \n     operations.\n       (b) The ``natural disaster'' exception in section \n     3(b)(2)(B) of WARN applies to office closings and mass \n     layoffs due to any form of a natural disaster.\n       (1) Floods, earthquakes, droughts, storms, tidal waves or \n     tsunamis and similar effects of nature are natural disasters \n     under this provision.\n       (2) To qualify for this exception, an employing office must \n     be able to demonstrate that its office closing or mass layoff \n     is a direct result of a natural disaster.\n       (3) While a disaster may preclude full or any advance \n     notice, such notice as is practicable, containing as much of \n     the information required in Sec. 639.7 as is available in the \n     circumstances of the disaster still must be given, whether in \n     advance or after the fact of an employment loss caused by a \n     natural disaster.\n       (4) Where an office closing or mass layoff occurs as an \n     indirect result of a natural disaster, the exception does not \n     apply but the ``unforeseeable business circumstance'' \n     exception described in paragraph (a) of this section may be \n     applicable.\n     Sec. 639.10 When may notice be extended?\n       Additional notice is required when the date or schedule of \n     dates of a planned office closing or mass layoff is extended \n     beyond the date or the ending date of any 14-day period \n     announced in the original notice as follows:\n       (a) If the postponement is for less than 60 days, the \n     additional notice should be given as soon as possible to the \n     parties identified in Sec. 639.6 and should include reference \n     to the earlier notice, the date (or 14-day period) to which \n     the planned action is postponed, and the reasons for the \n     postponement. The notice should be given in a manner which \n     will provide the information to all affected employees.\n       (b) If the postponement is for 60 days or more, the \n     additional notice should be treated as new notice subject to \n     the provisions of Sec. Sec. 639.5, 639.6 and 639.7 of this \n     part. Rolling notice, in the sense of routine periodic \n     notice, given whether or not an office closing or mass layoff \n     is impending, and with the intent to evade the purpose of the \n     Act rather than give specific notice as required by WARN, is \n     not acceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3896-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3952-S3953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 140\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers \ncentered in Colombia that was declared in Executive Order No. 12978 of \nOctober 21, 1995. This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) \nof the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) \nof the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. \n1703(c).\n  1. On October 21, 1995, I signed Executive Order No. 12978, \n``Blocking Assets and Prohibiting Transactions with Significant \nNarcotics Traffickers'' (the ``Order'') (60 Fed. Reg. 54579, October \n24, 1995). The Order blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction \nin which there is any interest of four significant foreign narcotics \ntraffickers who are principals in the so-called Cali drug cartel \ncentered in Colombia. They are listed in the annex to the Order. In \naddition, the Order blocks the property and interests in property of \nforeign persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, (a) \nto play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking \ncentered in Colombia or (b) to materially assist in or provide \nfinancial or technological support for, or goods or services in support \nof, the narcotics trafficking activities of persons designated in or \npursuant to the Order. In addition the Order blocks all property and \ninterests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of persons \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of State, to be owned or controlled \nby, or to act for or on behalf of, persons designated in or pursuant to \nthe Order (collectively ``Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers'' \nor ``SDNTs'').\n  The Order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a United \nStates person or within the United States in property or interests in \nproperty of SDNTs, and any transaction that evades or avoids, has the \npurpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, the \nprohibitions contained in the Order.\n  Designations of foreign persons blocked pursuant to the Order are \neffective upon the date of determination by the Director of the \nDepartment of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) \nacting under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. \nPublic notice of blocking is effective upon the date of filing with the \nFederal Register, or upon prior actual notice.\n  2. On October 24, 1995, the Department of the Treasury issued a \nnotice containing 76 additional names of persons determined to meet the \ncriteria set forth in Executive Order No. 12978 (60 Fed. Reg. 54582-84, \nOctober 24, 1995). A copy of the notice is attached to this report.\n  The Department of the Treasury issued another notice adding the names \nof one additional entity and three additional individuals, as well as \nexpanded information regarding addresses and pseudonyms, to the List of \nSDNTs on November 29, 1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 61288-89). A copy of the \nnotice is attached to this report.\n  3. On March 8, 1996, FAC published a notice in the Federal Register \nadding the names of 138 additional individuals and 60 entities \ndesignated pursuant to the Order, and revising information for 8 \nindividuals on the list of blocked persons contained in the notices \npublished on November 29, 1995, and October 24, 1995 (61 Fed. Reg. \n9523-28). A copy of the notice is attached to this report. The FAC, in \ncoordination with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, is \ncontinuing to expand the list of Specially Designated Narcotics \nTraffickers, including both organizations and individuals, as \nadditional information is developed.\n  4. On October 22, 1995, FAC disseminated details of this program to \nthe financial, securities, and international trade communities by both \nelectronic and conventional media. This information was updated on \nNovember 29, 1995, and again on March 5, 1996. In addition to bulletins \nto banking institutions via the Federal Reserve System and the Clearing \nHouse Inter-bank Payments System (CHIPS), individual notices were \nprovided to all State and Federal regulatory agencies, automated \nclearing houses, and State and independent banking associations across \nthe country. The FAC contacted all major securities industry \nassociations and regulators, posted electronic notices to 10 computer \nbulletin boards and 2 fax-on-demand services, and provided the same \nmaterial to the U.S. Embassy in Bogota for distribution to U.S. \ncompanies operating in Colombia.\n  5. There were no funds specifically appropriated to implement this \nprogram. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from October 21, 1995, through April 20, 1996, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the national emergency with respect to Significant \nNarcotics Traffickers are estimated at approximately $500,000 from \npreviously appropriated funds. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the Office of the General Counsel, and the U.S. Customs \nService), the Department of Justice, and the Department of State.\n  6. Executive Order No. 12978 provides this Administration with a new \ntool for combating the actions of significant foreign narcotics \ntraffickers centered in Colombia, and the unparalleled violence, \ncorruption, and harm that they cause in the United States and abroad. \nThe Order is designed to deny these traffickers the benefit of any \nassets subject to the jurisdiction of the  United States and to prevent \nUnited States persons from engaging in any commercial dealings with \nthem, their front companies, and their agents. Executive Order No. \n12978 demonstrates the U.S. commitment to end the scourge that such \ntraffickers have wrought upon society in the United States and beyond.\n\n  The magnitude and the dimension of the problem in Colombia--perhaps \nthe most pivotal country of all in terms of the world's cocaine trade--\nis extremely grave. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my \ndisposal to apply economic sanctions against significant foreign \nnarcotics traffickers and their violent and corrupting activities as \nlong as these measures are appropriate, and will continue to report \nperiodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 \nU.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to prohibit insurance providers from denying or \ncanceling health insurance coverage, or varying the premiums, terms, or \nconditions for health insurance coverage on the basis of genetic \ninformation or a request for genetic services, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of \n                                  1996\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1996. I join \nRepresentative Louise Slaughter, who introduced this bill in the House, \nin calling for an end to discrimination on the basis of genetic \ninformation in health insurance.\n  Progress in the field of genetics is accelerating at a breathtaking \npace. Who could have predicted 20 years ago that scientists today could \naccurately identify the genes associated with cystic fibrosis, cancer, \nAlzheimers' and Huntington's disease? Today, scientists can, and as a \nresult doctors are increasingly able to identify predispositions to \ncertain diseases based on the results of genetic testing, and to \nsuccessfully treat and manage such diseases. These scientific advances \nhold tremendous promise for the approximately 15 million people \naffected by the over 4,000 currently known genetic disorders, and the \nmillions more who are carriers of genetic diseases who may pass them on \nto their children.\n  But as our knowledge of genetic predisposition to disease has grown, \nso has the potential for discrimination in health insurance.\n  As a legislator who has worked for many years on the issue of breast \ncancer, and as a woman with a history of breast cancer in her family, I \nam delighted with the possibilities for further treatment advances \nbased on the recent discoveries of two genes related to breast cancer--\nBRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who inherit mutated forms of either gene have an \n85-percent risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. Although \nthere is no known treatment to ensure that women who carry the mutated \ngene do not develop breast cancer, genetic testing makes it possible \nfor carriers of these mutated genes to take extra precautions--such as \nmammograms and self-examinations--in order to detect cancer at its \nearliest stages. This discovery is truly a momentous breakthrough.\n  However, the tremendous promise of genetic testing is being \nsignificantly threatened by insurance companies that use the results of \ngenetic testing to deny or limit coverage to consumers. Unfortunately, \nthis practice is relatively common today. In fact, a recent survey of \nindividuals with a known genetic condition in their family revealed \nthat 22 percent had been denied health insurance coverage because of \ngenetic information.\n  In addition to the potentially devastating consequences health \ninsurance denials on the basis of genetic information can have on \nAmerican families, the fear of discrimination has equally harmful \nconsequences for consumers and for scientific research. For example, \nmany women who might take extra precautions if they knew they had the \nbreast cancer gene may not seek testing because they fear losing their \nhealth insurance. Patients may be unwilling to disclose information \nabout their genetic status to their physicians out of fear, hindering \ntreatment or preventive efforts. And people may be unwilling to \nparticipate in potentially ground-breaking research trials because they \ndo not want to reveal information about their genetic status.\n  The bill I am introducing today addresses these serious concerns by \nprohibiting health insurance providers from denying or canceling health \ninsurance coverage or varying the terms, premiums, or conditions for \nhealth insurance for individuals or their family members on the basis \nof genetic information. It also prohibits insurance companies from \ndiscriminating against individuals who have requested or received \ngenetic services.\n  My bill also contains important confidentiality provisions which \nprohibit insurance companies from disclosing genetic information about \nan individual without that person's written consent. And it prohibits \nan insurance provider from requesting someone to undergo, and from \ndisclosing, genetic information about that person.\n  Finally, the bill allows individuals to sue for monetary damages or \ninjunctive relief if an insurance company violates, or threatens to \nviolate, these nondiscrimination or disclosure provisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the unfair practice of denying health \ncare coverage to individuals on the basis of genetic information by \nsupporting the bill I am introducing today.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1695. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to assess \nup to $2 per person visiting the Grand Canyon or other national parks \nto secure bonds for capital improvements to the park, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the national parks capital improvements act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to make \ndesperately needed improvements within America's national parks.\n  The National Parks Capital Improvements Act would allow private \nfundraising organizations, under agreement with the Secretary of the \nInterior, to issue taxable capital development bonds to finance park \nimprovement projects. The bonds would be secured by an entrance fee \nsurcharge of up to $2 per visitor at participating parks.\n  Our National Park System has enormous capital needs--by last estimate \nover $3 billion of high priority projects such as improved \ntransportation systems, trail repairs, visitor facilities, historic \npreservation, and the list goes on and on. The unfortunate reality is \nthat even under the rosiest budget scenarios our growing park needs far \noutstrip the resources available.\n  A good example of this funding gap is at Grand Canyon National Park. \nThe park's newly approved park management plan calls for over $300 \nmillion in capital improvements, including a desperately needed \ntransportation system to reduce congestion. Compare that to the $12 \nmillion the Grand Canyon received last year for operating costs. The \ngap is as wide as the Grand Canyon itself. Clearly, we must find new \nmeans of financing park needs.\n  Revenue bonding is an integral part of the solution. Based on current \nvisitation rates, a $2 surcharge at the Grand Canyon would enable us to \nraise $100 million dollars from a bond issue amortized over 20 years. \nThat is significant amount of money with which we could accomplish a \nlot of critical work.\n  I want to point out that the Grand Canyon would not be the only park \neligible for the program. Any park unit with capital needs in excess of \n$5 million is eligible to participate. Among eligible park the \nSecretary will determine which shall take part in the program.\n  I also want to stress that only projects approved as part of park's \nGeneral Management Plan can be funded through bond revenue. This \nproviso eliminates any concern that the revenue could be used for \nprojects of questionable value to the park.\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\n  Finally, the bill requires that all professional standards apply and \nthat the issues are subject to the same laws, rules and regulatory \nenforcement procedures as any other bond issue.\n  In addition, only organizations under agreement with the Secretary \nwill be authorized to administer the bonding, so the Secretary can \nestablish any rules or policies he deems necessary and appropriate.\n  Under, no circumstances, however would investors be able to attach \nliens against Federal property in the very unlikely event of default. \nThe bonds will be secured only by the surcharge revenues.\n  Will the bond markets support park improvement issues, guaranteed by \nan entrance surcharge? The answer is yes, emphatically. Americans are \neager to invest in our Nation's natural heritage, and with park \nvisitation growing stronger, the risks would appear minimal.\n  Are visitors willing to pay a little more at the entrance gate if the \nmoney is used for park improvement? Again, yes. Time and time again \nvisitors have expressed their support provided the revenue is used \nwhere collected and not diverted for some other purpose devised by \nCongress.\n  Finally, I want to point out that the bill will not cost the Treasury \nany money? On the contrary it will result in a net increase in Federal \nrevenue. First, the bonds will be fully taxable, and, second, making \ndisparately needed improvements sooner rather than later will reduce \nproject costs.\n  America has been blessed with a rich natural heritage. The National \nPark Organic Act enjoins us to protect our precious natural resources \nfor future generations and to provide for their enjoyment by the \nAmerican people. The National Parks Capital Improvements Act must pass \nif we are to successfully fulfill the enduring responsibilities of \nstewardship with which we have been vested.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 1696. A bill to provide antitrust clarification, to reduce \nfrivolous antitrust litigation, to promote equitable resolution of \ndisputes over the location of professional sports franchises, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      the professional sports antitrust clarification act of 1996\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nProfessional Sports Antitrust Clarification Act of 1996 to address \nunderlying problems which have resulted in recent franchise instability \nand movement in professional sports, particularly the National Football \nLeague. My legislation clarifies that the antitrust laws do not apply \nto professional sports leagues and their member franchises when they \nestablish rules and make decisions about whether a team may change its \nhome territory. This antitrust protection is obtained, however, only if \nthe sports league provides notice and a hearing and examines \nappropriate factors prior to its decision on relocation, and institutes \nrevenue sharing of the public benefits received by its teams, in order \nto reduce the incentive for teams to move simply to reap large public \nsubsides. I will clarify the importance of these points in a moment.\n  Let me initially explain why this issue deserves the attention of the \nCongress. First, larger and larger amounts of public funds seem to be \nspent subsidizing professional sports, by building new or improved \nstadiums, providing rent abatement and special tax treatment, and even \nmaking direct cash payments. Cities and States are being pitted against \neach other by the threat or promise that a team will relocate depending \non the subsidy offered, which raises serious questions about the \nappropriate use of scarce public resources. Baltimore and Cleveland \nmade headlines last winter by competing to be the hometown of the \nBrowns football team, with hundreds of millions of public dollars at \nstake. The resolution, of course, was for both cities to pour hundreds \nof millions of dollars into new or improved stadiums so each could \nsecure a football team. Even more remarkable, perhaps, is the report \nthat Cincinnati has been handing over $3 million in cash to its \nfootball team in each of the last several years to stave off \nrelocation.\n  Second, professional sports are an important part of American life, \nemotionally as well as financially, and relocation of a popular team \ncan devastate its fans and shake the confidence of its hometown. The \nBrowns' announcement that they intended to move to Baltimore upset the \nteam's fans tremendously both in Cleveland and around the country. The \ncurrent willingness of so many teams to consider moving frightens fans \nof all teams, regardless of whether their own team is openly \nthreatening a move.\n  The current level of sports franchise instability is at its highest \nsince the Congress focused its attention on these issues in the 1980's. \nIn 1982 and 1985, I held several hearings as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee on legislation dealing with sports franchise relocation. \nSince that time, the financial stakes for local and State governments \nhave escalated. The public funds routinely expended to keep a team in \nplace or entice a team to move seem to have risen from tens of millions \nto hundreds of millions of dollars. At a time when public resources at \nall levels of government are becoming ever tighter, this transfer of \nscarce public funds to rich owners and rich players is remarkable. \nAccordingly, it is time to address these issues.\n  Two hearings have been held in the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nrecent months on these issues. As chairman of the Antitrust, Business \nRights, and Corporation Subcommittee, I chaired a hearing on November \n29, 1995, which analyzed sports franchise movement. Witnesses included \na range of elected officials, sports league commissioners, and \nantitrust and economic experts. Senator Hatch chaired a second hearing \nof the full Judiciary Committee on January 23, 1996, in order to \nfurther examine these issues. This legislation is an outgrowth of those \nhearings.\n  Let me turn to the specifics of the legislation I am introducing \ntoday. My bill does not grant a special exemption from current \nantitrust law, but essentially codifies existing judicial \ninterpretations which permit a sports league to determine where its \nmember franchises may operate, provided certain requirements are met. \nMy legislation clarifies and provides certainty in this complex area of \nthe law, where costs of defending claims are always high, and any \ndamages resulting from liability or an incorrect judicial decision are \ntrebled and may amount to hundreds of millions of dollars or more. \nAntitrust certainty would restore integrity to the decision- making \nprocesses of professional sports leagues which have been chilled by the \nprospect of huge treble damage judgments.\n\n  A sports league cannot enjoy this antitrust certainty, however, \nunless it meets three requirements set forth in the legislation. First, \nthe league must provide notice and a hearing to all interested parties \nconcerning a team's proposed move. Second, the league must protect the \npublic interest by considering specified factors in deciding whether to \npermit the move. Last, the league must promote comparable economic \nopportunities for its teams by sharing revenue derived from the public \nbenefits and subsidies the teams receive.\n  This conditional antitrust protection will help resolve the problems \nof franchise instability caused by large public subsidies. The \nantitrust certainty provided by this bill will permit a sports league \nto take more decisive action to stop teams from moving when the league \nbelieves relocation will not serve the public interest. The \nrequirements that the league analyze specific factors and provide \nnotice and a hearing to interested parties before deciding whether a \nteam can relocate will help ensure that proper decisions are made. The \nthird requirement, instituting revenue sharing of public benefits, is \ncrucial to address an underlying cause of sports franchise instability. \nUnlike the first two requirements, the effectiveness of revenue sharing \ndoes not depend on the opinion of the league about a particular move. \nLet me briefly explain the economic background of this revenue sharing \nrequirement.\n  As revealed during my Antitrust Subcommittee hearing, the franchise \ninstability we are now experiencing is largely the result of changing \neconomics within major league sports. Now that players are free agents, \ncompetition among owners for the best talent has driven player salaries \nto amazing heights. This, in turn, has increased pressure on owners to \nincrease their\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nrevenues, particularly relative to other owners, in order to compete \nfor the best players. In this competition for talent, the total amount \nof an owner's revenue matters less than whether that owner has fallen \nbehind the other owners.\n  Football, hockey, and basketball each share a significant portion of \ntotal revenues among the teams in the league. Because owners seek to \nbetter their positions compared to other owners, however, they \nnaturally seek to raise revenue in areas where revenue is not shared. \nAs a result, owners aggressively seek new public benefits and \nsubsidies, often through new or improved stadiums with more luxury \nsuites as we have seen in football, because they have not been required \nto share that revenue. In this effort, owners routinely use threats of \nrelocation to another city as leverage.\n  Let me emphasize that my legislation would not in any way prohibit \npublic funds from being used to attract or keep a team, if a city or \nState voluntarily decides to allocate its resources in that way. \nInstead, my legislation would require the league to promote comparable \nopportunities for all teams by equalizing the public benefits among \nthem. This would level the playing field, so to speak, so that teams \nneed not move or threaten to move in order to obtain more public funds \nto keep from falling behind others in the league. Let me illustrate how \nthis is intended to work in practice.\n  Last Fall, Art Modell, owner of the Cleveland Browns, announced that \nhe planned to move his team from Cleveland to Baltimore. His move \nreportedly was motivated by financial pressure on the franchise caused \nby rapidly increasing player salaries, plus promises of large public \nbenefits from Baltimore. If my revenue-sharing provision had been in \nplace, however, Mr. Modell would have faced different options. Under my \nlegislation, the league would have instituted procedures to promote \ncomparable economic opportunities to address disparities in team \nrevenue due to public benefits and subsidies. So in our example, if Mr. \nModell was obtaining fewer public benefits in Cleveland than average, \nhe would receive transfers to bring his team up to the league average. \nOn the other hand, if the annual public benefits received for moving to \nBaltimore pushed Mr. Modell above the average, he would have to share \nsome of the value of the public benefits in order to keep his team at \nthe league average. Faced with these choices and a hometown that loved \nhis team, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Modell would have chosen to \nmove--and endure tremendous criticism--if he would receive the league \naverage either way. Even if Mr. Modell still wished to relocate, \nhowever, the league might well have blocked the move, based on the \nfactors established and the antitrust certainty provided by this \nlegislation.\n\n  Of course, it is sometimes appropriate and even desirable for a team \nto relocate, such as when the fans and local business community do not \nadequately appreciate and support their team. My revenue-sharing \nrequirement would not stop such moves, but would encourage professional \nsports to look more to private funding than to public subsidies in such \ncases.\n  Nor does this revenue-sharing requirement stop a community from using \npublic funds to construct or improve a stadium or arena if it wishes to \ndo so. The provision would require the team using the facility to share \nrevenue only if the team receives financial benefits as a result of the \npublic expenditures, such as rent abatement or extra luxury suite \nincome, which exceed the league average. In other words, if the city \nchose to build or renovate a stadium, and used any additional revenues \nto repay the public expenditures for the construction, those new \nrevenues would not be included in any revenue-sharing arrangement.\n  As I indicated earlier, the recent problems with franchise \ninstability have occurred largely in the National Football League. It \nmay be no coincidence that since a $49 million antitrust judgment was \nlevied against the NFL for trying to block the Raiders' move to Los \nAngeles in the 1980's, football has been more reluctant than basketball \nand hockey to risk antitrust litigation over the propriety of league \nactions. It should be noted that my legislation does not require any \nleague to take any action, but simply provides antitrust certainty to \nthose leagues which choose to comply with the bill's requirements. Some \nleagues may not choose to participate initially.\n  Certainly this legislation should not be taken as any indication that \njoint conduct by a league in addressing franchise movement or any other \nissue would be illegal under the current state of antitrust law. The \nconduct of a league may very well be found lawful under the antitrust \nlaws when making and enforcing rules governing franchise relocation by \nits teams, without consideration of this legislation. My bill simply \nprovides certainty to leagues that choose to comply with its terms.\n  Finally, this bill does not limit its antitrust clarification to the \nmajor sports, but defines professional sports league broadly. It should \nbe noted, however, that major league baseball is excluded from the bill \nas long as baseball's judicially created antitrust exemption concerning \nfranchise relocation remains in place. I would hasten to add that \nfranchise relocation issues are expressly not affected by the separate \nbaseball legislation, S. 627, that I introduced with Senator Hatch and \nothers, to limit baseball's judicially created antitrust exemption. Let \nme repeat so there is no confusion: neither this legislation I am \nintroducing today, nor our baseball legislation, S. 627, which has \npassed both the Antitrust Subcommittee and the full Judiciary \nCommittee, would in any way impact baseball's current ability to \ncontrol franchise movement. Indeed, this new legislation along with S. \n627 would go a long way toward putting all professional sports on an \neven footing under our Nation's antitrust laws.\n  Mr. President, the instability of sports franchises caused by large \npublic subsidies of professional sports raises important issues which \nhave a direct and significant impact on the lives and finances of most \nAmericans. The Professional Sports Antitrust Clarification Act will \nhelp to resolve these concerns.\n  I send the bill to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 53 RELATIVE TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA \n                                 LEONE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Simon, and Mr. \nFeingold) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 53\n\n       Whereas since 1991 the people of the Republic of Sierra \n     Leone have endured a horrific civil war that has killed \n     thousands of individuals and displaced more than half the \n     population of the country;\n       Whereas for the first time in almost 30 years, the Republic \n     of Sierra Leone held its first truly democratic multiparty \n     elections to elect a president and parliament and put an end \n     to military rule;\n       Whereas the elections held on February 26, 1996, and the \n     subsequent runoff election held on March 15, 1996, were \n     deemed by international and domestic observers to be free and \n     fair and legitimate expressions of the will of the people of \n     the Republic of Sierra Leone;\n       Whereas success of the newly elected democratic government \n     led by President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah could have a positive \n     effect on the West African neighbors of the Republic of \n     Sierra Leone; and\n       Whereas the historic event of democratic multiparty \n     elections in the Republic of Sierra Leone should be honored: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) congratulates the people of the Republic of Sierra \n     Leone for holding their first democratic multiparty \n     presidential and parliamentary elections in nearly 30 years;\n       (2) encourages all people of the Republic of Sierra Leone \n     to continue to negotiate an end to the civil war and work \n     together after taking the critical first step of holding \n     democratic elections in that country;\n       (3) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to help \n     nations move toward freedom and democracy; and\n       (4) further reaffirms that the United States is committed \n     to encouraging peace, democracy, and economic development on \n     the African continent.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am submitting for myself and \nseveral of my colleagues a concurrent resolution recognizing the people \nof the Republic of Sierra Leone for their recent elections and \ndemocratic transition. The elections held this February and March were \nthe first multiparty democratic elections in Sierra Leone in almost 30 \nyears. They marked what could well be the key turning point in the \ncivil war which has tormented Sierra Leone since 1991. In the face of \nongoing civil war and violence, Sierra Leoneans--SEE-AIR-AH LEE-OH-NEE-\nUNS--turned out in impressive numbers to vote, literally putting their \nlives on the line for democracy. They clearly believed that the ballot \nis more powerful than the bullet, and voted to end military rule and \nthe rule of the gun. Their courage and resolve remind us of the \nblessings of democracy and liberty which we so often take for granted \nin the United States. This example is particularly timely for us in \nthis year of American elections.\n  As well as helping move Sierra Leone toward a peaceful resolution of \nits own civil conflict, this successful transition from military rule \nto democracy can serve as a positive example for the region. Sierra \nLeone's potential role in the region was underlined last week during \nthe tragic events in Liberia. The new government of Sierra Leone \nallowed the United States to use the airport in Freetown as a transit \npoint for the evacuation of Americans and third country nationals from \nLiberia. We are grateful for this assistance.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to recognize the important \ncontribution of the various Americans involved in Sierra Leone's \ntransition, notably the United States Embassy in Freetown led by \nAmbassador John Hirsch, and the African-American Institute, which sent \na nonpartisan election observation group to monitor the elections \nthroughout Sierra Leone and train local monitors for this and future \ndemocratic elections there.\n  I have long believed that there are many positive developments in \nAfrica, and that they often are overshadowed by the problems and \ncrises. It is my pleasure today to be able to recognize one such \npositive development, and in that spirit, I hope that my colleagues in \nthe Senate and in the House will join me and my colleagues to pass this \nresolution congratulating the Republic of Sierra Leone on its \ndemocratic transition.\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Feingold, and others in submitting this \nresolution commending the people of Sierra Leone on their successful \ntransition to democracy.\n  At a time of much instability in west Africa--from Liberia, to the \nGambia, to Nigeria--the changes in Sierra Leone represent a beacon of \nhope for the region.\n  Many people questioned the wisdom of proceeding with a multi-party \nelection in the midst of a civil war, but the people of Sierra Leone \nwould not be denied their opportunity to vote. They stood in line for \nmany hours, desperate to cast their ballot. Their will was strong: the \nmilitary simply had to go. Through their determination, the election \nsucceeded, and on March 29, 1996, the military handed over power to a \ndemocratically elected head of state.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues \nin congratulating the new President, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, on his \nelection. He brings to the job a distinguished background in \ninternational affairs, and I believe is well prepared to lead Sierra \nLeone from its troubled past to a prosperous and peaceful future. It is \nmy hope that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will soon be able \nto welcome the new President to Washington.\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\n  The head of the Interim National Election Commission, Mr. James \nJonah, also deserves special congratulations. Under extremely difficult \ncircumstances--from financial to logistical to political--Mr. Jonah \nguided his country toward democracy and civilian rule. His steady hand \ncontributed greatly to the success of the process.\n  I also want to pay special tribute to the United States Ambassador to \nSierra Leone, John Hirsch. Despite limited resources, Ambassador Hirsch \nplayed a critically important role in pushing for democratic change. We \noften fail to recognize our skilled diplomats in small embassies like \nFreetown, but their dedicated efforts are extremely important and \nappreciated.\n  Finally, I want to commend the former military ruler of the country, \nJulius Amaada Bio, for respecting the results of the elections. Until \nthe last moment, many questioned whether the military would actually \nhand over power. Of course, many military rulers--including some in \nwest Africa--have ignored elections. But Brigadier Bio demonstrated \nstatesmanlike leadership in guiding his country to democracy, and I \nbelieve history will look upon him kindly.\n  Mr. President, the path ahead for Sierra Leone will not be easy. \nWhile a tentative cease-fire holds, instability continues to plague the \nSierra Leonian countryside. I hope the Revolutionary United Front [RUF] \nwill negotiate in good faith with the new President of the country and \nthat a lasting peace agreement can soon be reached. The time for \nfighting is over as Sierra Leone moves toward a new era.\n  At the same time, reform of the military must be a top priority. \nThere is little doubt that the people of Sierra Leone lack confidence \nin the integrity and professionalism of their own protectors. That must \nchange.\n  As the peace process moves forward, the South African mercenaries \nshould also return to their homes. As I told Chairman Strasser, the \nformer head of state, during his visit to Washington last October, the \ncontinued presence of mercenaries will only contribute to instability \nover the long-run.\n  While elections are important, Sierra Leone must get back on its feet \neconomically for democracy to take root. The civil war and instability \nhave devastated the formal economy. But Sierra Leone is gifted with \nmany natural resources and great beauty. I urge the new government to \nwork closely with the international financial institutions to move the \neconomy forward, and I urge our Government to closely examine what \ncontribution we can make to Sierra Leone's recovery.\n  Mr. President, as chair of the Africa subcommittee, many people ask \nwhether I get frustrated watching events in Africa--and sometimes I do. \nBut for every Rwanda or Liberia, there is a South Africa, a Mozambique, \nor even--as we recognize today--a Sierra Leone.\n  Again, I congratulate the people of Sierra Leone on their historic \nelection and am pleased to join my colleagues in cosponsoring this \nimportant resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3958-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3959-S3997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 242--TO PROVIDE FOR THE APPROVAL OF FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to on April 15, 1996:\n\n                              S.

(a) Section 202 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) (2 U.S.C. 1312) applies the rights and protections of \n     sections 101 through 105 of the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     of 1993 (FMLA) (29 U.S.C. 2611-2615) to covered employees. \n     (The term ``covered employee'' is defined in section 101(3) \n     of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1301(3)). See Sec. 825.800 of these \n     regulations for that definition.) The purpose of this part is \n     to set forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of \n     section 202 of the CAA.\n       (b) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors, \n     Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 202(d) and 304 of \n     the CAA, which direct the Board to promulgate regulations \n     implementing section 202 that are ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 202 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board \n     may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section''. The regulations issued by the Board herein are on \n     all matters for which section 202 of the CAA requires \n     regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment, based on the information available to it \n     at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, that, \n     with the exception of regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     section 202 of the CAA]''.\n       (c) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n     Sec. 825.2  [Reserved]\n\n Subpart A--What is the Family and Medical Leave Act, and to Whom Does \n          it Apply under the Congressional Accountability Act?\n\n     Sec. 825.100  What is the Family and Medical Leave Act?\n\n       (a) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as \n     made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA), allows ``eligible'' employees of an employing office \n     to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued \n     it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 months \n     because of the birth of a child and to care for the newborn \n     child, because of the placement of a child with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, because the employee is needed \n     to care for a family member (child, spouse, or parent) with a \n     serious health condition, or because the employee's own \n     serious health condition makes the employee unable to perform \n     the functions of his or her job (see Sec. 825.306(b)(4)). In \n     certain cases, this leave may be taken on an intermittent \n     basis rather than all at once, or the employee may work a \n     part-time schedule.\n       (b) An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to have \n     health benefits maintained while on leave as if the employee \n     had continued to work instead of taking the leave. If an \n     employee was paying all or part of the premium payments prior \n     to leave, the employee would continue to pay his or her share \n     during the leave period. The employing office or a disbursing \n     or other financial office of the Senate may recover its share \n     only if the employee does not return to work for a reason \n     other than the serious health condition of the employee or \n     the employee's immediate family member, or another reason \n     beyond the employee's control.\n       (c) An employee generally has a right to return to the same \n     position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, \n     benefits and working conditions at the conclusion of the \n     leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of \n     any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.\n       (d) The employing office has a right to 30 days advance \n     notice from the employee where practicable. In addition, the \n     employing office may require an employee to submit \n     certification from a health care provider to substantiate \n     that the leave is due to the serious health condition of the \n     employee or the employee's immediate family member. Failure \n     to comply with these requirements may result in a delay in \n     the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly applied \n     policy, the employing office may also require that an \n     employee present a certification of fitness to return to work \n     when the absence was caused by the employee's serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.311(c)). The employing office may \n     delay restoring the employee to employment without such \n     certificate relating to the health condition which caused the \n     employee's absence.\n\n     Sec. 825.101  What is the purpose of the FMLA?\n\n       (a) FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance their \n     work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for \n     medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and \n     for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The FMLA is intended to balance the demands \n     of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the \n     stability and economic security of families, and to promote \n     national interests in preserving family integrity. It was \n     intended that the FMLA accomplish these purposes in a manner \n     that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers, and \n     in a manner consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment in minimizing the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex, while \n     promoting equal employment opportunity for men and women.\n       (b) The enactment of FMLA was predicated on two fundamental \n     concerns ``the needs of the American workforce, and the \n     development of high-performance organizations''. \n     Increasingly, America's children and elderly are dependent \n     upon family members who must spend long hours at work. When a \n     family emergency arises, requiring workers to attend to \n     seriously-ill children or parents, or to newly-born or \n     adopted infants, or even to their own serious illness, \n     workers need reassurance that they will not be asked to \n     choose between continuing their employment, and meeting their \n     personal and family obligations or tending to vital needs at \n     home.\n       (c) The FMLA is both intended and expected to benefit \n     employers as well as their employees. A direct correlation \n     exists between stability in the family and productivity in \n     the workplace. FMLA will encourage the development of high-\n     performance organizations. When workers can count on durable \n     links to their workplace they are able to make their own full \n     commitments to their jobs. The record of hearings on family \n     and medical leave indicate the powerful productive advantages \n     of stable workplace relationships, and the comparatively \n     small costs of guaranteeing that those relationships will not \n     be dissolved while workers attend to\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\n     pressing family health obligations or their own serious \n     illness.\n\n     Sec. 825.102  When are the FMLA and the CAA effective for \n       covered employees and employing offices?\n\n       (a) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to certain Senate employees and \n     certain employing offices of the Senate since August 5, 1993 \n     (see section 501 of FMLA).\n       (b) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to any employee in an employment \n     position and any employment authority of the House of \n     Representatives since August 5, 1993 (see section 502 of \n     FMLA).\n       (c) The rights and protections of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to certain employing offices and \n     covered employees other than those referred to in paragraphs \n     (a) and (b) of this section for certain periods since August \n     5, 1993 (see, e.g., title V of the FMLA, sections 501 and \n     502).\n       (d) The provisions of section 202 of the CAA that apply \n     rights and protections of the FMLA to covered employees are \n     effective on January 23, 1996.\n       (e) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee eligibility.\n\n     Sec. 825.103  How does the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n       CAA, affect leave in progress on, or taken before, the \n       effective date of the CAA?\n\n       (a) An eligible employee's right to take FMLA leave began \n     on the date that the rights and protections of the FMLA first \n     went into effect for the employing office and employee (see \n     Sec. 825.102(a)). Any leave taken prior to the date on which \n     the rights and protections of the FMLA first became effective \n     for the employing office from which the leave was taken may \n     not be counted for purposes of the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. If leave qualifying as FMLA leave was underway prior \n     to the effective date of the FMLA for the employing office \n     from which the leave was taken and continued after the FMLA's \n     effective date for that office, only that portion of leave \n     taken on or after the FMLA's effective date may be counted \n     against the employee's leave entitlement under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) If an employing office-approved leave is underway when \n     the application of the FMLA by the CAA takes effect, no \n     further notice would be required of the employee unless the \n     employee requests an extension of the leave. For leave which \n     commenced on the effective date or shortly thereafter, such \n     notice must have been given which was practicable, \n     considering the foreseeability of the need for leave and the \n     effective date.\n       (c) Starting on January 23, 1996, an employee is entitled \n     to FMLA leave under these regulations if the reason for the \n     leave is qualifying under the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, even if the event occasioning the need for leave (e.g., \n     the birth of a child) occurred before such date (so long as \n     any other requirements are satisfied).\n\n     Sec. 825.104  What employing offices are covered by the FMLA, \n       as made applicable by the CAA?\n\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, covers all \n     employing offices. As used in the CAA, the term ``employing \n     office'' means--\n       (1) the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator;\n       (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee;\n       (3) any other office headed by a person with the final \n     authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of the employment of an employee of \n     the House of Representatives or the Senate; or\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Capitol Police Board, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol, the Office of the Attending Physician, the \n     Office of Compliance, and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (b) [Reserved]\n       (c) Separate entities will be deemed to be parts of a \n     single employer for purposes of the FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA, if they meet the ``integrated employer'' test. A \n     determination of whether or not separate entities are an \n     integrated employer is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be reviewed in its totality. Factors considered in \n     determining whether two or more entities are an integrated \n     employer include:\n       (i) Common management;\n       (ii) Interrelation between operations;\n       (iii) Centralized control of labor relations; and\n       (iv) Degree of common financial control.\n\n     Sec. 825.105  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.106  How is ``joint employment'' treated under the \n       FMLA as made applicable by the CAA?\n\n       (a) Where two or more employing offices exercise some \n     control over the work or working conditions of the employee, \n     the employing offices may be joint employers under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. Where the employee performs work \n     which simultaneously benefits two or more employing offices, \n     or works for two or more employing offices at different times \n     during the workweek, a joint employment relationship \n     generally will be considered to exist in situations such as:\n       (1) Where there is an arrangement between employing offices \n     to share an employee's services or to interchange employees;\n       (2) Where one employing office acts directly or indirectly \n     in the interest of the other employing office in relation to \n     the employee; or\n       (3) Where the employing offices are not completely \n     disassociated with respect to the employee's employment and \n     may be deemed to share control of the employee, directly or \n     indirectly, because one employing office controls, is \n     controlled by, or is under common control with the other \n     employing office.\n       (b) A determination of whether or not a joint employment \n     relationship exists is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be viewed in its totality. For example, joint employment \n     will ordinarily be found to exist when--\n       (1) an employee, who is employed by an employing office \n     other than the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator, is under the actual \n     direction and control of the Member of the House of \n     Representatives or Senator; or\n       (2) two or more employing offices employ an individual to \n     work on common issues or other matters for both or all of \n     them.\n       (c) When employing offices employ a covered employee \n     jointly, they may designate one of themselves to be the \n     primary employing office, and the other or others to be the \n     secondary employing office(s). Such a designation shall be \n     made by written notice to the covered employee.\n       (d) If an employing office is designated a primary \n     employing office pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, \n     only that employing office is responsible for giving required \n     notices to the covered employee, providing FMLA leave, and \n     maintenance of health benefits. Job restoration is the \n     primary responsibility of the primary employing office, and \n     the secondary employing office(s) may, subject to the \n     limitations in Sec. 825.216, be responsible for accepting the \n     employee returning from FMLA leave.\n       (e) If employing offices employ an employee jointly, but \n     fail to designate a primary employing office pursuant to \n     paragraph (c) of this section, then all of these employing \n     offices shall be jointly and severally liable for giving \n     required notices to the employee, for providing FMLA leave, \n     for assuring that health benefits are maintained, and for job \n     restoration. The employee may give notice of need for FMLA \n     leave, as described in Sec. Sec.  825.302 and 825.303, to \n     whichever of these employing offices the employee chooses. If \n     the employee makes a written request for restoration to one \n     of these employing offices, that employing office shall be \n     primarily responsible for job restoration, and the other \n     employing office(s) may, subject to the limitations in \n     Sec. 825.216, be responsible for accepting the employee \n     returning from FMLA leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.107  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.108  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.109  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.110  Which employees are ``eligible'' to take FMLA \n       leave under these regulations?\n\n       (a) An ``eligible employee'' under these regulations means \n     a covered employee who has been employed in any employing \n     office for 12 months and for at least 1,250 hours of \n     employment during the previous 12 months.\n       (b) The 12 months an employee must have been employed by \n     any employing office need not be consecutive months. If an \n     employee worked for two or more employing offices \n     sequentially, the time worked will be aggregated to determine \n     whether it equals 12 months. If an employee is maintained on \n     the payroll for any part of a week, including any periods of \n     paid or unpaid leave (sick, vacation) during which other \n     benefits or compensation are provided by the employer (e.g., \n     workers' compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.), the \n     week counts as a week of employment. For purposes of \n     determining whether intermittent/occasional/casual employment \n     qualifies as ``at least 12 months'', 52 weeks is deemed to be \n     equal to 12 months.\n       (c) If an employee was employed by two or more employing \n     offices, either sequentially or concurrently, the hours of \n     service will be aggregated to determine whether the minimum \n     of 1,250 hours has been reached. Whether an employee has \n     worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined \n     according to the principles established under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), as applied by section 203 of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. 1313), for determining compensable hours of work. The \n     determining factor is the number of hours an employee has \n     worked for one or more employing offices. The determination \n     is not limited by methods of record-keeping, or by \n     compensation agreements that do not accurately reflect all of \n     the hours an employee has worked for or been in service to \n     the employing office. Any accurate accounting of actual hours \n     worked may be used. For this purpose, full-time teachers (see \n     Sec. 825.800 for definition) of an elementary or secondary \n     school system, or institution of higher education, or other \n     educational establishment or institution are deemed to meet \n     the 1,250 hour test. An employing office must be able to \n     clearly demonstrate that such an employee did not work 1,250 \n     hours during the previous 12 months in order to claim that \n     the employee is not ``eligible'' for FMLA leave.\n       (d) The determinations of whether an employee has worked \n     for any employing office for at least 1,250 hours in the \n     previous 12 months and has been employed by any employing \n     office for a total of at least 12\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\n     months must be made as of the date leave commences. The \n     ``previous 12 months'' means the 12 months immediately \n     preceding the commencement of the leave. If an employee \n     notifies the employing office of need for FMLA leave before \n     the employee meets these eligibility criteria, the employing \n     office must either confirm the employee's eligibility based \n     upon a projection that the employee will be eligible on the \n     date leave would commence or must advise the employee when \n     the eligibility requirement is met. If the employing office \n     confirms eligibility at the time the notice for leave is \n     received, the employing office may not subsequently challenge \n     the employee's eligibility. In the latter case, if the \n     employing office does not advise the employee whether the \n     employee is eligible as soon as practicable (i.e., two \n     business days absent extenuating circumstances) after the \n     date employee eligibility is determined, the employee will \n     have satisfied the notice requirements and the notice of \n     leave is considered current and outstanding until the \n     employing office does advise. If the employing office fails \n     to advise the employee whether the employee is eligible prior \n     to the date the requested leave is to commence, the employee \n     will be deemed eligible. The employing office may not, then, \n     deny the leave. Where the employee does not give notice of \n     the need for leave more than two business days prior to \n     commencing leave, the employee will be deemed to be eligible \n     if the employing office fails to advise the employee that the \n     employee is not eligible within two business days of \n     receiving the employee's notice.\n       (e) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee's eligibility.\n       (f) [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.111  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.112  Under what kinds of circumstances are employing \n       offices required to grant family or medical leave?\n\n       (a) Employing offices are required to grant leave to \n     eligible employees:\n       (1) For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the \n     newborn child;\n       (2) For placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's \n     job.\n       (b) The right to take leave under FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA applies equally to male and female employees. A \n     father, as well as a mother, can take family leave for the \n     birth, placement for adoption or foster care of a child.\n       (c) Circumstances may require that FMLA leave begin before \n     the actual date of birth of a child. An expectant mother may \n     take FMLA leave pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section \n     before the birth of the child for prenatal care or if her \n     condition makes her unable to work.\n       (d) Employing offices are required to grant FMLA leave \n     pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section before the \n     actual placement or adoption of a child if an absence from \n     work is required for the placement for adoption or foster \n     care to proceed. For example, the employee may be required to \n     attend counseling sessions, appear in court, consult with his \n     or her attorney or the doctor(s) representing the birth \n     parent, or submit to a physical examination. The source of an \n     adopted child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement agency \n     or otherwise) is not a factor in determining eligibility for \n     leave for this purpose.\n       (e) Foster care is 24-hour care for children in \n     substitution for, and away from, their parents or guardian. \n     Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State \n     as a result of a voluntary agreement between the parent or \n     guardian that the child be removed from the home, or pursuant \n     to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, \n     and involves agreement between the State and foster family \n     that the foster family will take care of the child. Although \n     foster care may be with relatives of the child, State action \n     is involved in the removal of the child from parental \n     custody.\n       (f) In situations where the employer/employee relationship \n     has been interrupted, such as an employee who has been on \n     layoff, the employee must be recalled or otherwise be re-\n     employed before being eligible for FMLA leave. Under such \n     circumstances, an eligible employee is immediately entitled \n     to further FMLA leave for a qualifying reason.\n       (g) FMLA leave is available for treatment for substance \n     abuse provided the conditions of Sec. 825.114 are met. \n     However, treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an \n     employing office from taking employment action against an \n     employee. The employing office may not take action against \n     the employee because the employee has exercised his or her \n     right to take FMLA leave for treatment. However, if the \n     employing office has an established policy, applied in a non-\n     discriminatory manner that has been communicated to all \n     employees, that provides under certain circumstances an \n     employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to \n     that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the \n     employee is presently taking FMLA leave. An employee may also \n     take FMLA leave to care for an immediate family member who is \n     receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employing office \n     may not take action against an employee who is providing care \n     for an immediate family member receiving treatment for \n     substance abuse.\n\n     Sec. 825.113  What do ``spouse'', ``parent'', and ``son or \n       daughter'' mean for purposes of an employee qualifying to \n       take FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized \n     under State law for purposes of marriage in the State where \n     the employee resides, including common law marriage in States \n     where it is recognized.\n       (b) Parent means a biological parent or an individual who \n     stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the \n     employee was a son or daughter as defined in (c) below. This \n     term does not include parents ``in law''.\n       (c) Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person \n     standing in loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age \n     18 or older and ``incapable of self-care because of a mental \n     or physical disability''.\n       (1) ``Incapable of self-care'' means that the individual \n     requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily \n     self-care in three or more of the ``activities of daily \n     living'' (ADLs) or ``instrumental activities of daily \n     living'' (IADLs). Activities of daily living include adaptive \n     activities such as caring appropriately for one's grooming \n     and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating. Instrumental \n     activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, \n     shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, \n     maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, \n     using a post office, etc.\n       (2) ``Physical or mental disability'' means a physical or \n     mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of \n     the major life activities of an individual. See the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by section \n     201(a)(3) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)).\n       (3) Persons who are ``in loco parentis'' include those with \n     day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially \n     support a child or, in the case of an employee, who had such \n     responsibility for the employee when the employee was a \n     child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.\n       (d) For purposes of confirmation of family relationship, \n     the employing office may require the employee giving notice \n     of the need for leave to provide reasonable documentation or \n     statement of family relationship. This documentation may take \n     the form of a simple statement from the employee, or a \n     child's birth certificate, a court document, etc. The \n     employing office is entitled to examine documentation such as \n     a birth certificate, etc., but the employee is entitled to \n     the return of the official document submitted for this \n     purpose.\n\n     Sec. 825.114  What is a ``serious health condition'' \n       entitling an employee to FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) For purposes of FMLA, ``serious health condition'' \n     entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:\n       (1) Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, \n     hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any \n     period of incapacity (for purposes of this section, defined \n     to mean inability to work, attend school or perform other \n     regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom), or any subsequent \n     treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or\n       (2) Continuing treatment by a health care provider. A \n     serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a \n     health care provider includes any one or more of the \n     following:\n       (i) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery \n     therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days, and \n     any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to \n     the same condition, that also involves:\n       (A) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (B) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       (ii) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (iii) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (A) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care \n     provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider;\n       (B) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (C) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (iv) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the continuing \n     supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment \n     by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (v) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\n     or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or \n     on referral by, a health care provider, either for \n     restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for \n     a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (b) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section \n     includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if \n     a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the \n     condition. Treatment does not include routine physical \n     examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. Under \n     paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B), a regimen of continuing treatment \n     includes, for example, a course of prescription medication \n     (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment \n     to resolve or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). \n     A regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of \n     over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, \n     or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, \n     headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia \n     problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of \n     conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious \n     health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. \n     Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or \n     removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions \n     provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. \n     Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be \n     serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of \n     this section are met.\n       (d) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (e) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (a)(2) (ii) or (iii) qualify for FMLA leave even though the \n     employee or the immediate family member does not receive \n     treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and \n     even if the absence does not last more than three days. For \n     example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for \n     work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the \n     employee's health care provider has advised the employee to \n     stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An \n     employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work \n     because of severe morning sickness.\n\n     Sec. 825.115  What does it mean that ``the employee is unable \n       to perform the functions of the position of the employee''?\n\n       An employee is ``unable to perform the functions of the \n     position'' where the health care provider finds that the \n     employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any \n     one of the essential functions of the employee's position \n     within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA), as made applicable by section 201(a)(3) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)). An employee who must be absent from work \n     to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition \n     is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions \n     of the position during the absence for treatment. An \n     employing office has the option, in requiring certification \n     from a health care provider, to provide a statement of the \n     essential functions of the employee's position for the health \n     care provider to review. For purposes of FMLA, the essential \n     functions of the employee's position are to be determined \n     with reference to the position the employee held at the time \n     notice is given or leave commenced, whichever is earlier.\n\n     Sec. 825.116  What does it mean that an employee is ``needed \n       to care for'' a family member?\n\n       (a) The medical certification provision that an employee is \n     ``needed to care for'' a family member encompasses both \n     physical and psychological care. It includes situations \n     where, for example, because of a serious health condition, \n     the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic \n     medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is \n     unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor, etc. \n     The term also includes providing psychological comfort and \n     reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or \n     parent with a serious health condition who is receiving \n     inpatient or home care.\n       (b) The term also includes situations where the employee \n     may be needed to fill in for others who are caring for the \n     family member, or to make arrangements for changes in care, \n     such as transfer to a nursing home.\n       (c) An employee's intermittent leave or a reduced leave \n     schedule necessary to care for a family member includes not \n     only a situation where the family member's condition itself \n     is intermittent, but also where the employee is only needed \n     intermittently ``such as where other care is normally \n     available, or care responsibilities are shared with another \n     member of the family or a third party.\n\n     Sec. 825.117  For an employee seeking intermittent FMLA leave \n       or leave on a reduced leave schedule, what is meant by \n       ``the medical necessity for'' such leave?\n\n       For intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave \n     schedule, there must be a medical need for leave (as \n     distinguished from voluntary treatments and procedures) and \n     it must be that such medical need can be best accommodated \n     through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. The \n     treatment regimen and other information described in the \n     certification of a serious health condition (see \n     Sec. 825.306) meets the requirement for certification of the \n     medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule. Employees needing intermittent FMLA leave or \n     leave on a reduced leave schedule must attempt to schedule \n     their leave so as not to disrupt the employing office's \n     operations. In addition, an employing office may assign an \n     employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and \n     benefits that better accommodates the employee's intermittent \n     or reduced leave schedule.\n\n     Sec. 825.118  What is a ``health care provider''?\n\n       (a)(1) The term ``health care provider'' means:\n       (i) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to \n     practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in \n     which the doctor practices; or\n       (ii) Any other person determined by the Office of \n     Compliance to be capable of providing health care services.\n       (2) In making a determination referred to in subparagraph \n     (1)(ii), and absent good cause shown to do otherwise, the \n     Office of Compliance will follow any determination made by \n     the Secretary of Labor (under section 101(6)(B) of the FMLA, \n     29 U.S.C. 2611(6)(B)) that a person is capable of providing \n     health care services, provided the Secretary's determination \n     was not made at the request of a person who was then a \n     covered employee.\n       (b) Others ``capable of providing health care services'' \n     include only:\n       (1) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, \n     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment \n     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a \n     subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to \n     practice in the State and performing within the scope of \n     their practice as defined under State law;\n       (2) Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social \n     workers who are authorized to practice under State law and \n     who are performing within the scope of their practice as \n     defined under State law;\n       (3) Christian Science practitioners listed with the First \n     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. Where \n     an employee or family member is receiving treatment from a \n     Christian Science practitioner, an employee may not object to \n     any requirement from an employing office that the employee or \n     family member submit to examination (though not treatment) to \n     obtain a second or third certification from a health care \n     provider other than a Christian Science practitioner except \n     as otherwise provided under applicable State or local law or \n     collective bargaining agreement.\n       (4) Any health care provider from whom an employing office \n     or the employing office's group health plan's benefits \n     manager will accept certification of the existence of a \n     serious health condition to substantiate a claim for \n     benefits; and\n       (5) A health care provider listed above who practices in a \n     country other than the United States, who is authorized to \n     practice in accordance with the law of that country, and who \n     is performing within the scope of his or her practice as \n     defined under such law.\n       (c) The phrase ``authorized to practice in the State'' as \n     used in this section means that the provider must be \n     authorized to diagnose and treat physical or mental health \n     conditions without supervision by a doctor or other health \n     care provider.\n\nSubpart B--What Leave Is an Employee Entitled To Take Under the Family \n    and Medical Leave Act, as Made Applicable by the Congressional \n                          Accountability Act?\n\n     Sec. 825.200  How much leave may an employee take?\n\n       (a) An eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement is \n     limited to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-\n     month period for any one, or more, of the following reasons:\n       (1) The birth of the employee's son or daughter, and to \n     care for the newborn child;\n       (2) The placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed \n     child;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of his or her job.\n       (b) An employing office is permitted to choose any one of \n     the following methods for determining the ``12-month period'' \n     in which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement occurs:\n       (1) The calendar year;\n       (2) Any fixed 12-month ``leave year'', such as a fiscal \n     year or a year starting on an employee's ``anniversary'' \n     date;\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\n       (3) The 12-month period measured forward from the date any \n     employee's first FMLA leave begins; or\n       (4) A ``rolling'' 12-month period measured backward from \n     the date an employee uses any FMLA leave (except that such \n     measure may not extend back before the date on which the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections first becomes \n     effective for the employing office; see Sec. 825.102).\n       (c) Under methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this \n     section an employee would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave at any time in the fixed 12-month period selected. \n     An employee could, therefore, take 12 weeks of leave at the \n     end of the year and 12 weeks at the beginning of the \n     following year. Under the method in paragraph (b)(3) of this \n     section, an employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave \n     during the year beginning on the first date FMLA leave is \n     taken; the next 12-month period would begin the first time \n     FMLA leave is taken after completion of any previous 12-month \n     period. Under the method in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, \n     the ``rolling'' 12-month period, each time an employee takes \n     FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any \n     balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the \n     immediately preceding 12 months. For example, if an employee \n     has taken eight weeks of leave during the past 12 months, an \n     additional four weeks of leave could be taken. If an employee \n     used four weeks beginning February 1, 1997, four weeks \n     beginning June 1, 1997, and four weeks beginning December 1, \n     1997, the employee would not be entitled to any additional \n     leave until February 1, 1998. However, beginning on February \n     1, 1998, the employee would be entitled to four weeks of \n     leave, on June 1 the employee would be entitled to an \n     additional four weeks, etc.\n       (d)(1) Employing offices will be allowed to choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section provided \n     the alternative chosen is applied consistently and uniformly \n     to all employees. An employing office wishing to change to \n     another alternative is required to give at least 60 days \n     notice to all employees, and the transition must take place \n     in such a way that the employees retain the full benefit of \n     12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords the greatest \n     benefit to the employee. Under no circumstances may a new \n     method be implemented in order to avoid the CAA's FMLA leave \n     requirements.\n       (2) [Reserved]\n       (e) If an employing office fails to select one of the \n     options in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the \n     12-month period, the option that provides the most beneficial \n     outcome for the employee will be used. The employing office \n     may subsequently select an option only by providing the 60-\n     day notice to all employees of the option the employing \n     office intends to implement. During the running of the 60-day \n     period any other employee who needs FMLA leave may use the \n     option providing the most beneficial outcome to that \n     employee. At the conclusion of the 60-day period the \n     employing office may implement the selected option.\n       (f) For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by \n     an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the \n     week taken as FMLA leave has no effect; the week is counted \n     as a week of FMLA leave. However, if for some reason the \n     employing office's activity has temporarily ceased and \n     employees generally are not expected to report for work for \n     one or more weeks (e.g., a school closing two weeks for the \n     Christmas/New Year holiday or the summer vacation or an \n     employing office closing the office for repairs), the days \n     the employing office's activities have ceased do not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Methods for \n     determining an employee's 12-week leave entitlement are also \n     described in Sec. 825.205.\n       (g)(1) If employing offices jointly employ an employee, and \n     if they designate a primary employer pursuant to \n     Sec. 825.106(c), the primary employer may choose any one of \n     the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for \n     measuring the 12-month period, provided that the alternative \n     chosen is applied consistently and uniformly to all employees \n     of the primary employer including the jointly employed \n     employee.\n       (2) If employing offices fail to designated a primary \n     employer pursuant to Sec. 825.106(c), an employee jointly \n     employed by the employing offices may, by so notifying one of \n     the employing offices, select that employing office to be the \n     primary employer of the employee for purposes of the \n     application of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.\n\n     Sec. 825.201  If leave is taken for the birth of a child, or \n       for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, when \n       must the leave be concluded?\n\n       An employee's entitlement to leave for a birth or placement \n     for adoption or foster care expires at the end of the 12-\n     month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement, \n     unless the employing office permits leave to be taken for a \n     longer period. Any such FMLA leave must be concluded within \n     this one-year period.\n\n     Sec. 825.202  How much leave may a husband and wife take if \n       they are employed by the same employing office?\n\n       (a) A husband and wife who are eligible for FMLA leave and \n     are employed by the same employing office may be limited to a \n     combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken--\n       (1) for birth of the employee's son or daughter or to care \n     for the child after birth;\n       (2) for placement of a son or daughter with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after \n     placement; or\n       (3) to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition.\n       (b) This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to \n     leave taken for the reasons specified in paragraph (a) of \n     this section as long as a husband and wife are employed by \n     the ``same employing office''. It would apply, for example, \n     even though the spouses are employed at two different work \n     sites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one \n     spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would \n     be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\n       (c) Where the husband and wife both use a portion of the \n     total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for one of the purposes \n     in paragraph (a) of this section, the husband and wife would \n     each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or \n     she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for a \n     purpose other than those contained in paragraph (a) of this \n     section. For example, if each spouse took 6 weeks of leave to \n     care for a healthy, newborn child, each could use an \n     additional 6 weeks due to his or her own serious health \n     condition or to care for a child with a serious health \n     condition.\n\n     Sec. 825.203  Does FMLA leave have to be taken all at once, \n       or can it be taken in parts?\n\n       (a) FMLA leave may be taken ``intermittently or on a \n     reduced leave schedule'' under certain circumstances. \n     Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of \n     time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave \n     schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual \n     number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A \n     reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule \n     for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time.\n       (b) When leave is taken after the birth or placement of a \n     child for adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the \n     employing office agrees. Such a schedule reduction might \n     occur, for example, where an employee, with the employing \n     office's agreement, works part-time after the birth of a \n     child, or takes leave in several segments. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required, however, for leave during \n     which the mother has a serious health condition in connection \n     with the birth of her child or if the newborn child has a \n     serious health condition.\n       (c) Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave \n     schedule when medically necessary for planned and/or \n     unanticipated medical treatment of a related serious health \n     condition by or under the supervision of a health care \n     provider, or for recovery from treatment or recovery from a \n     serious health condition. It may also be taken to provide \n     care or psychological comfort to an immediate family member \n     with a serious health condition.\n       (1) Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health \n     condition which requires treatment by a health care provider \n     periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, \n     and may include leave of periods from an hour or more to \n     several weeks. Examples of intermittent leave would include \n     leave taken on an occasional basis for medical appointments, \n     or leave taken several days at a time spread over a period of \n     six months, such as for chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may \n     take leave intermittently for prenatal examinations or for \n     her own condition, such as for periods of severe morning \n     sickness. An example of an employee taking leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule is an employee who is recovering from a \n     serious health condition and is not strong enough to work a \n     full-time schedule.\n       (2) Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for \n     absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated \n     or unable to perform the essential functions of the position \n     because of a chronic serious health condition even if he or \n     she does not receive treatment by a health care provider.\n       (d) There is no limit on the size of an increment of leave \n     when an employee takes intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule. However, an employing office may \n     limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that \n     the employing office's payroll system uses to account for \n     absences or use of leave, provided it is one hour or less. \n     For example, an employee might take two hours off for a \n     medical appointment, or might work a reduced day of four \n     hours over a period of several weeks while recuperating from \n     an illness. An employee may not be required to take more FMLA \n     leave than necessary to address the circumstance that \n     precipitated the need for the leave, except as provided in \n     Sec. Sec. 825.601 and 825.602.\n\n     Sec. 825.204  May an employing office transfer an employee to \n       an ``alternative position'' in order to accommodate \n       intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) If an employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment for the employee or a family member, \n     including during a period of recovery from a serious health \n     condition, or if the employing office agrees to permit \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a \n     child or for placement of a child for adoption or foster \n     care, the employing office may require the employee to \n     transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule is required, to an available \n     alternative position for which the employee is qualified and \n     which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than \n     does the employee's regular position. See Sec. 825.601 for\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\n     special rules applicable to instructional employees of \n     schools.\n       (b) Transfer to an alternative position may require \n     compliance with any applicable collective bargaining \n     agreement and any applicable law (such as the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to \n     an alternative position may include altering an existing job \n     to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent or \n     reduced leave.\n       (c) The alternative position must have equivalent pay and \n     benefits. An alternative position for these purposes does not \n     have to have equivalent duties. The employing office may \n     increase the pay and benefits of an existing alternative \n     position, so as to make them equivalent to the pay and \n     benefits of the employee's regular job. The employing office \n     may also transfer the employee to a part-time job with the \n     same hourly rate of pay and benefits, provided the employee \n     is not required to take more leave than is medically \n     necessary. For example, an employee desiring to take leave in \n     increments of four hours per day could be transferred to a \n     half-time job, or could remain in the employee's same job on \n     a part-time schedule, paying the same hourly rate as the \n     employee's previous job and enjoying the same benefits. The \n     employing office may not eliminate benefits which otherwise \n     would not be provided to part-time employees; however, an \n     employing office may proportionately reduce benefits such as \n     vacation leave where an employing office's normal practice is \n     to base such benefits on the number of hours worked.\n       (d) An employing office may not transfer the employee to an \n     alternative position in order to discourage the employee from \n     taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee. \n     For example, a white collar employee may not be assigned to \n     perform laborer's work; an employee working the day shift may \n     not be reassigned to the graveyard shift; an employee working \n     in the headquarters facility may not be reassigned to a \n     branch a significant distance away from the employee's normal \n     job location. Any such attempt on the part of the employing \n     office to make such a transfer will be held to be contrary to \n     the prohibited-acts provisions of the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) When an employee who is taking leave intermittently or \n     on a reduced leave schedule and has been transferred to an \n     alternative position no longer needs to continue on leave and \n     is able to return to full-time work, the employee must be \n     placed in the same or equivalent job as the job he/she left \n     when the leave commenced. An employee may not be required to \n     take more leave than necessary to address the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.205  How does one determine the amount of leave used \n       where an employee takes leave intermittently or on a \n       reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) If an employee takes leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule, only the amount of leave actually \n     taken may be counted toward the 12 weeks of leave to which an \n     employee is entitled. For example, if an employee who \n     normally works five days a week takes off one day, the \n     employee would use \\1/5\\ of a week of FMLA leave. Similarly, \n     if a full-time employee who normally works 8-hour days works \n     4-hour days under a reduced leave schedule, the employee \n     would use \\1/2\\ week of FMLA leave each week.\n       (b) Where an employee normally works a part-time schedule \n     or variable hours, the amount of leave to which an employee \n     is entitled is determined on a pro rata or proportional basis \n     by comparing the new schedule with the employee's normal \n     schedule. For example, if an employee who normally works 30 \n     hours per week works only 20 hours a week under a reduced \n     leave schedule, the employee's ten hours of leave would \n     constitute one-third of a week of FMLA leave for each week \n     the employee works the reduced leave schedule.\n       (c) If an employing office has made a permanent or long-\n     term change in the employee's schedule (for reasons other \n     than FMLA, and prior to the notice of need for FMLA leave), \n     the hours worked under the new schedule are to be used for \n     making this calculation.\n       (d) If an employee's schedule varies from week to week, a \n     weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 weeks prior to \n     the beginning of the leave period would be used for \n     calculating the employee's normal workweek.\n\n     Sec. 825.206  May an employing office deduct hourly amounts \n       from an employee's salary, when providing unpaid leave \n       under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, without \n       affecting the employee's qualification for exemption as an \n       executive, administrative, or professional employee, or \n       when utilizing the fluctuating workweek method for payment \n       of overtime, under the Fair Labor Standards Act?\n\n       (a) Leave taken under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     may be unpaid. If an employee is otherwise exempt from \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), as made applicable by the CAA, as a \n     salaried executive, administrative, or professional employee \n     (under regulations issued by the Board, at part 541), \n     providing unpaid FMLA-qualifying leave to such an employee \n     will not cause the employee to lose the FLSA exemption. This \n     means that under regulations currently in effect, where an \n     employee meets the specified duties test, is paid on a salary \n     basis, and is paid a salary of at least the amount specified \n     in the regulations, the employing office may make deductions \n     from the employee's salary for any hours taken as \n     intermittent or reduced FMLA leave within a workweek, without \n     affecting the exempt status of the employee. The fact that an \n     employing office provides FMLA leave, whether paid or unpaid, \n     or maintains any records regarding FMLA leave, will not be \n     relevant to the determination whether an employee is exempt \n     within the meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541.\n       (b) For an employee paid in accordance with a fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime, where permitted by \n     section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), the employing office, \n     during the period in which intermittent or reduced schedule \n     FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may compensate an \n     employee on an hourly basis and pay only for the hours the \n     employee works, including time and one-half the employee's \n     regular rate for overtime hours. The change to payment on an \n     hourly basis would include the entire period during which the \n     employee is taking intermittent leave, including weeks in \n     which no leave is taken. The hourly rate shall be determined \n     by dividing the employee's weekly salary by the employee's \n     normal or average schedule of hours worked during weeks in \n     which FMLA leave is not being taken. If an employing office \n     chooses to follow this exception from the fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment, the employing office must do so \n     uniformly, with respect to all employees paid on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis for whom FMLA leave is taken on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis. If an employing \n     office does not elect to convert the employee's compensation \n     to hourly pay, no deduction may be taken for FMLA leave \n     absences. Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled \n     leave is over, the employee may be restored to payment on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis.\n       (c) This special exception to the ``salary basis'' \n     requirements of the FLSA exemption or fluctuating workweek \n     payment requirements applies only to employees of employing \n     offices who are eligible for FMLA leave, and to leave which \n     qualifies as (one of the four types of) FMLA leave. Hourly or \n     other deductions which are not in accordance with the Board's \n     regulations at part 541 or with a permissible fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime may not be taken, for \n     example, where the employee has not worked long enough to be \n     eligible for FMLA leave without potentially affecting the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption. Nor may deductions \n     which are not permitted by the Board's regulations at part \n     541 or by a permissible fluctuating workweek method of \n     payment for overtime be taken from such an employee's salary \n     for any leave which does not qualify as FMLA leave, for \n     example, deductions from an employee's pay for leave required \n     under an employing office's policy or practice for a reason \n     which does not qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to care for \n     a grandparent or for a medical condition which does not \n     qualify as a serious health condition; or for leave which is \n     more generous than provided by FMLA as made applicable by the \n     CAA, such as leave in excess of 12 weeks in a year. The \n     employing office may comply with the employing office's own \n     policy/practice under these circumstances and maintain the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption or for the fluctuating \n     workweek method of pay by not taking hourly deductions from \n     the employee's pay, in accordance with FLSA requirements, or \n     may take such deductions, treating the employee as an \n     ``hourly'' employee and pay overtime premium pay for hours \n     worked over 40 in a workweek.\n\n     Sec. 825.207  Is FMLA leave paid or unpaid?\n\n       (a) Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid. However, under the \n     circumstances described in this section, FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, permits an eligible employee to choose \n     to substitute paid leave for FMLA leave. If an employee does \n     not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, the employing \n     office may require the employee to substitute accrued paid \n     leave for FMLA leave.\n       (b) Where an employee has earned or accrued paid vacation, \n     personal or family leave, that paid leave may be substituted \n     for all or part of any (otherwise) unpaid FMLA leave relating \n     to birth, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The term ``family leave'' as used in FMLA \n     refers to paid leave provided by the employing office \n     covering the particular circumstances for which the employee \n     seeks leave for either the birth of a child and to care for \n     such child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health \n     condition. For example, if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows use of family leave to care for a child but not for a \n     parent, the employing office is not required to allow accrued \n     family leave to be substituted for FMLA leave used to care \n     for a parent.\n       (c) Substitution of paid accrued vacation, personal, or \n     medical/sick leave may be made for any (otherwise) unpaid \n     FMLA leave needed to care for a family member or the \n     employee's own serious health condition. Substitution of paid \n     sick/medical leave may be elected to the extent the \n     circumstances meet the employing office's usual requirements \n     for the use of sick/medical leave. An employing office is not \n     required to allow substitution of paid sick or medical leave \n     for unpaid FMLA leave ``in any situation'' where\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\n     the employing office's uniform policy would not normally \n     allow such paid leave. An employee, therefore, has a right to \n     substitute paid medical/sick leave to care for a seriously \n     ill family member only if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows paid leave to be used for that purpose. Similarly, an \n     employee does not have a right to substitute paid medical/\n     sick leave for a serious health condition which is not \n     covered by the employing office's leave plan.\n       (d)(1) Disability leave for the birth of a child would be \n     considered FMLA leave for a serious health condition and \n     counted in the 12 weeks of leave permitted under FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA. Because the leave pursuant to a \n     temporary disability benefit plan is not unpaid, the \n     provision for substitution of paid leave is inapplicable. \n     However, the employing office may designate the leave as FMLA \n     leave and count the leave as running concurrently for \n     purposes of both the benefit plan and the FMLA leave \n     entitlement. If the requirements to qualify for payments \n     pursuant to the employing office's temporary disability plan \n     are more stringent than those of FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, the employee must meet the more stringent \n     requirements of the plan, or may choose not to meet the \n     requirements of the plan and instead receive no payments from \n     the plan and use unpaid FMLA leave or substitute available \n     accrued paid leave.\n       (2) The FMLA as made applicable by the CAA provides that a \n     serious health condition may result from injury to \n     the employee ``on or off'' the job. If the employing \n     office designates the leave as FMLA leave in accordance \n     with Sec. 825.208, the employee's FMLA 12-week leave \n     entitlement may run concurrently with a workers' \n     compensation absence when the injury is one that meets the \n     criteria for a serious health condition. As the workers' \n     compensation absence is not unpaid leave, the provision \n     for substitution of the employee's accrued paid leave is \n     not applicable. However, if the health care provider \n     treating the employee for the workers' compensation injury \n     certifies the employee is able to return to a ``light duty \n     job'' but is unable to return to the same or equivalent \n     job, the employee may decline the employing office's offer \n     of a ``light duty job''. As a result the employee may lose \n     workers' compensation payments, but is entitled to remain \n     on unpaid FMLA leave until the 12-week entitlement is \n     exhausted. As of the date workers' compensation benefits \n     cease, the substitution provision becomes applicable and \n     either the employee may elect or the employing office may \n     require the use of accrued paid leave. See also Sec. Sec.  \n     825.210(f), 825.216(d), 825.220(d), 825.307(a)(1) and \n     825.702(d) (1) and (2) regarding the relationship between \n     workers' compensation absences and FMLA leave.\n       (e) Paid vacation or personal leave, including leave earned \n     or accrued under plans allowing ``paid time off'', may be \n     substituted, at either the employee's or the employing \n     office's option, for any qualified FMLA leave. No limitations \n     may be placed by the employing office on substitution of paid \n     vacation or personal leave for these purposes.\n       (f) If neither the employee nor the employing office elects \n     to substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave under the \n     above conditions and circumstances, the employee will remain \n     entitled to all the paid leave which is earned or accrued \n     under the terms of the employing office's plan.\n       (g) If an employee uses paid leave under circumstances \n     which do not qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will not count \n     against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave to which the employee is \n     entitled. For example, paid sick leave used for a medical \n     condition which is not a serious health condition does not \n     count against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (h) When an employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid leave (of any type) for unpaid FMLA leave \n     under circumstances permitted by these regulations, and the \n     employing office's procedural requirements for taking that \n     kind of leave are less stringent than the requirements of \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA (e.g., notice or \n     certification requirements), only the less stringent \n     requirements may be imposed. An employee who complies with an \n     employing office's less stringent leave plan requirements in \n     such cases may not have leave for an FMLA purpose delayed or \n     denied on the grounds that the employee has not complied with \n     stricter requirements of FMLA as made applicable by the CAA. \n     However, where accrued paid vacation or personal leave is \n     substituted for unpaid FMLA leave for a serious health \n     condition, an employee may be required to comply with any \n     less stringent medical certification requirements of the \n     employing office's sick leave program. See \n     Sec. Sec. 825.302(g), 825.305(e) and 825.306(c).\n       (i) Compensatory time off, if any is authorized under \n     applicable law, is not a form of accrued paid leave that an \n     employing office may require the employee to substitute for \n     unpaid FMLA leave. The employee may request to use his/her \n     balance of compensatory time for an FMLA reason. If the \n     employing office permits the accrual of compensatory time to \n     be used in compliance with applicable Board regulations, the \n     absence which is paid from the employee's accrued \n     compensatory time ``account'' may not be counted against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n\n     Sec. 825.208 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA leave and, as a \n       result, enable leave to be counted against the employee's \n       total FMLA leave entitlement?\n\n       (a) In all circumstances, it is the employing office's \n     responsibility to designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-\n     qualifying, and to give notice of the designation to the \n     employee as provided in this section. In the case of \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule, only one \n     such notice is required unless the circumstances regarding \n     the leave have changed. The employing office's designation \n     decision must be based only on information received from the \n     employee or the employee's spokesperson (e.g., if the \n     employee is incapacitated, the employee's spouse, adult \n     child, parent, doctor, etc., may provide notice to the \n     employing office of the need to take FMLA leave). In any \n     circumstance where the employing office does not have \n     sufficient information about the reason for an employee's use \n     of paid leave, the employing office should inquire further of \n     the employee or the spokesperson to ascertain whether the \n     paid leave is potentially FMLA-qualifying.\n       (1) An employee giving notice of the need for unpaid FMLA \n     leave must explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to \n     allow the employing office to determine that the leave \n     qualifies under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If \n     the employee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be \n     denied. In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a \n     request to use paid leave, especially when the need for the \n     leave was unexpected or unforeseen, an employee will provide \n     sufficient information for the employing office to designate \n     the paid leave as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid \n     leave, especially vacation or personal leave, may in some \n     cases not spontaneously explain the reasons or their plans \n     for using their accrued leave.\n       (2) As noted in Sec. 825.302(c), an employee giving notice \n     of the need for unpaid FMLA leave does not need to expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA or \n     even mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation to \n     provide notice, though the employee would need to state a \n     qualifying reason for the needed leave. An employee \n     requesting or notifying the employing office of an intent to \n     use accrued paid leave, even if for a purpose covered by \n     FMLA, would not need to assert such right either. However, if \n     an employee requesting to use paid leave for an FMLA-\n     qualifying purpose does not explain the reason for the \n     leave--consistent with the employing office's established \n     policy or practice--and the employing office denies the \n     employee's request, the employee will need to provide \n     sufficient information to establish an FMLA-qualifying reason \n     for the needed leave so that the employing office is aware of \n     the employee's entitlement (i.e., that the leave may not be \n     denied) and, then, may designate that the paid leave be \n     appropriately counted against (substituted for) the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement. Similarly, an employee using \n     accrued paid vacation leave who seeks an extension of unpaid \n     leave for an FMLA-qualifying purpose will need to state the \n     reason. If this is due to an event which occurred during the \n     period of paid leave, the employing office may count the \n     leave used after the FMLA-qualifying event against the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement.\n       (b)(1) Once the employing office has acquired knowledge \n     that the leave is being taken for an FMLA required reason, \n     the employing office must promptly (within two business days \n     absent extenuating circumstances) notify the employee that \n     the paid leave is designated and will be counted as FMLA \n     leave. If there is a dispute between an employing office and \n     an employee as to whether paid leave qualifies as FMLA leave, \n     it should be resolved through discussions between the \n     employee and the employing office. Such discussions and the \n     decision must be documented.\n       (2) The employing office's notice to the employee that the \n     leave has been designated as FMLA leave may be orally or in \n     writing. If the notice is oral, it shall be confirmed in \n     writing, no later than the following payday (unless the \n     payday is less than one week after the oral notice, in which \n     case the notice must be no later than the subsequent payday). \n     The written notice may be in any form, including a notation \n     on the employee's pay stub.\n       (c) If the employing office requires paid leave to be \n     substituted for unpaid leave, or that paid leave taken under \n     an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, this \n     decision must be made by the employing office within two \n     business days of the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for leave, or, where the employing office does not \n     initially have sufficient information to make a \n     determination, when the employing office determines that the \n     leave qualifies as FMLA leave if this happens later. The \n     employing office's designation must be made before the leave \n     starts, unless the employing office does not have sufficient \n     information as to the employee's reason for taking the leave \n     until after the leave commenced. If the employing office has \n     the requisite knowledge to make a determination that the paid \n     leave is for an FMLA reason at the time the employee either \n     gives notice of the need for leave or commences leave and \n     fails to designate the leave as FMLA leave (and so notify the \n     employee in accordance with paragraph (b)), the employing \n     office may not designate leave as FMLA leave retroactively, \n     and may designate only prospectively as of the date of \n     notification to the employee of the designation. In such \n     circumstances, the employee is subject to the full \n     protections of the FMLA,\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\n     as made applicable by the CAA, but none of the absence \n     preceding the notice to the employee of the designation may \n     be counted against the employee's 12-week FMLA leave \n     entitlement.\n       (d) If the employing office learns that leave is for an \n     FMLA purpose after leave has begun, such as when an employee \n     gives notice of the need for an extension of the paid leave \n     with unpaid FMLA leave, the entire or some portion of the \n     paid leave period may be retroactively counted as FMLA leave, \n     to the extent that the leave period qualified as FMLA leave. \n     For example, an employee is granted two weeks paid vacation \n     leave for a skiing trip. In mid-week of the second week, the \n     employee contacts the employing office for an extension of \n     leave as unpaid leave and advises that at the beginning of \n     the second week of paid vacation leave the employee suffered \n     a severe accident requiring hospitalization. The employing \n     office may notify the employee that both the extension and \n     the second week of paid vacation leave (from the date of the \n     injury) is designated as FMLA leave. On the other hand, when \n     the employee takes sick leave that turns into a serious \n     health condition (e.g., bronchitis that turns into bronchial \n     pneumonia) and the employee gives notice of the need for an \n     extension of leave, the entire period of the serious health \n     condition may be counted as FMLA leave.\n       (e) Employing offices may not designate leave as FMLA leave \n     after the employee has returned to work with two exceptions:\n       (1) If the employee was absent for an FMLA reason and the \n     employing office did not learn the reason for the absence \n     until the employee's return (e.g., where the employee was \n     absent for only a brief period), the employing office may, \n     upon the employee's return to work, promptly (within two \n     business days of the employee's return to work) designate the \n     leave retroactively with appropriate notice to the employee. \n     If leave is taken for an FMLA reason but the employing office \n     was not aware of the reason, and the employee desires that \n     the leave be counted as FMLA leave, the employee must notify \n     the employing office within two business days of returning to \n     work of the reason for the leave. In the absence of such \n     timely notification by the employee, the employee may not \n     subsequently assert FMLA protections for the absence.\n       (2) If the employing office knows the reason for the leave \n     but has not been able to confirm that the leave qualifies \n     under FMLA, or where the employing office has requested \n     medical certification which has not yet been received or the \n     parties are in the process of obtaining a second or third \n     medical opinion, the employing office should make a \n     preliminary designation, and so notify the employee, at the \n     time leave begins, or as soon as the reason for the leave \n     becomes known. Upon receipt of the requisite information from \n     the employee or of the medical certification which confirms \n     the leave is for an FMLA reason, the preliminary designation \n     becomes final. If the medical certifications fail to confirm \n     that the reason for the absence was an FMLA reason, the \n     employing office must withdraw the designation (with written \n     notice to the employee).\n       (f) If, before beginning employment with an employing \n     office, an employee had been employed by another employing \n     office, the subsequent employing office may count against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement FMLA leave taken from the \n     prior employing office, except that, if the FMLA leave began \n     after the effective date of these regulations (or if the FMLA \n     leave was subject to other applicable requirement under which \n     the employing office was to have designated the leave as FMLA \n     leave), the prior employing office must have properly \n     designated the leave as FMLA under these regulations or other \n     applicable requirement.\n\n     Sec. 825.209 Is an employee entitled to benefits while using \n       FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) During any FMLA leave, the employing office must \n     maintain the employee's coverage under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program or any group health plan (as defined \n     in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) \n     on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided \n     if the employee had been continuously employed during the \n     entire leave period. All employing offices are subject to the \n     requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to \n     maintain health coverage. The definition of ``group health \n     plan'' is set forth in Sec. 825.800. For purposes of FMLA, \n     the term ``group health plan'' shall not include an insurance \n     program providing health coverage under which employees \n     purchase individual policies from insurers provided that--\n       (1) no contributions are made by the employing office;\n       (2) participation in the program is completely voluntary \n     for employees;\n       (3) the sole functions of the employing office with respect \n     to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit \n     the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect \n     premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the \n     insurer;\n       (4) the employing office receives no consideration in the \n     form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, \n     other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for \n     administrative services actually rendered in connection with \n     payroll deduction; and\n       (5) the premium charged with respect to such coverage does \n     not increase in the event the employment relationship \n     terminates.\n       (b) The same group health plan benefits provided to an \n     employee prior to taking FMLA leave must be maintained during \n     the FMLA leave. For example, if family member coverage is \n     provided to an employee, family member coverage must be \n     maintained during the FMLA leave. Similarly, benefit coverage \n     during FMLA leave for medical care, surgical care, hospital \n     care, dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, \n     substance abuse treatment, etc., must be maintained during \n     leave if provided in an employing office's group health plan, \n     including a supplement to a group health plan, whether or not \n     provided through a flexible spending account or other \n     component of a cafeteria plan.\n       (c) If an employing office provides a new health plan or \n     benefits or changes health benefits or plans while an \n     employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the \n     new or changed plan/benefits to the same extent as if the \n     employee were not on leave. For example, if an employing \n     office changes a group health plan so that dental care \n     becomes covered under the plan, an employee on FMLA leave \n     must be given the same opportunity as other employees to \n     receive (or obtain) the dental care coverage. Any other plan \n     changes (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) \n     which apply to all employees of the workforce would also \n     apply to an employee on FMLA leave.\n       (d) Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits \n     must also be given to an employee on FMLA leave. If the group \n     health plan permits an employee to change from single to \n     family coverage upon the birth of a child or otherwise add \n     new family members, such a change in benefits must be made \n     available while an employee is on FMLA leave. If the employee \n     requests the changed coverage it must be provided by the \n     employing office.\n       (e) An employee may choose not to retain group health plan \n     coverage during FMLA leave. However, when an employee returns \n     from leave, the employee is entitled to be reinstated on the \n     same terms as prior to taking the leave, including family or \n     dependent coverages, without any qualifying period, physical \n     examination, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc. See \n     Sec. 825.212(c).\n       (f) Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable, and for ``key'' employees (as \n     discussed below), an employing office's obligation to \n     maintain health benefits during leave (and to restore the \n     employee to the same or equivalent employment) under FMLA \n     ceases if and when the employment relationship would have \n     terminated if the employee had not taken FMLA leave (e.g., if \n     the employee's position is eliminated as part of a \n     nondiscriminatory reduction in force and the employee would \n     not have been transferred to another position); an employee \n     informs the employing office of his or her intent not to \n     return from leave (including before starting the leave if the \n     employing office is so informed before the leave starts); or \n     the employee fails to return from leave or continues on leave \n     after exhausting his or her FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-\n     month period.\n       (g) If a ``key employee'' (see Sec. 825.218) does not \n     return from leave when notified by the employing office that \n     substantial or grievous economic injury will result from his \n     or her reinstatement, the employee's entitlement to group \n     health plan benefits continues unless and until the employee \n     advises the employing office that the employee does not \n     desire restoration to employment at the end of the leave \n     period, or FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, or \n     reinstatement is actually denied.\n       (h) An employee's entitlement to benefits other than group \n     health benefits during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., holiday \n     pay) is to be determined by the employing office's \n     established policy for providing such benefits when the \n     employee is on other forms of leave (paid or unpaid, as \n     appropriate).\n\n     Sec. 825.210 How may employees on FMLA leave pay their share \n       of group health benefit premiums?\n\n       (a) Group health plan benefits must be maintained on the \n     same basis as coverage would have been provided if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Therefore, any share of group health plan premiums \n     which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must \n     continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave \n     period. If premiums are raised or lowered, the employee would \n     be required to pay the new premium rates. Maintenance of \n     health insurance policies which are not a part of the \n     employing office's group health plan, as described in \n     Sec. 825.209(a), are the sole responsibility of the employee. \n     The employee and the insurer should make necessary \n     arrangements for payment of premiums during periods of unpaid \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the \n     employee's share of premiums must be paid by the method \n     normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a payroll \n     deduction.\n       (c) If FMLA leave is unpaid, the employing office has a \n     number of options for obtaining payment from the employee. \n     The employing office may require that payment be made to the \n     employing office or to the insurance carrier, but no \n     additional charge may be added to the employee's premium \n     payment for administrative expenses. The employing office may \n     require employees to pay their share of premium payments in \n     any of the following ways:\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\n       (1) Payment would be due at the same time as it would be \n     made if by payroll deduction;\n       (2) Payment would be due on the same schedule as payments \n     are made under COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is \n     applicable;\n       (3) Payment would be prepaid pursuant to a cafeteria plan \n     at the employee's option;\n       (4) The employing office's existing rules for payment by \n     employees on ``leave without pay'' would be followed, \n     provided that such rules do not require prepayment (i.e., \n     prior to the commencement of the leave) of the premiums that \n     will become due during a period of unpaid FMLA leave or \n     payment of higher premiums than if the employee had continued \n     to work instead of taking leave; or\n       (5) Another system voluntarily agreed to between the \n     employing office and the employee, which may include \n     prepayment of premiums (e.g., through increased payroll \n     deductions when the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable).\n       (d) The employing office must provide the employee with \n     advance written notice of the terms and conditions under \n     which these payments must be made. (See Sec. 825.301.)\n       (e) An employing office may not require more of an employee \n     using FMLA leave than the employing office requires of other \n     employees on ``leave without pay''.\n       (f) An employee who is receiving payments as a result of a \n     workers' compensation injury must make arrangements with the \n     employing office for payment of group health plan benefits \n     when simultaneously taking unpaid FMLA leave. See paragraph \n     (c) of this section and Sec. 825.207(d)(2).\n\n     Sec. 825.211 What special health benefits maintenance rules \n       apply to multi-employer health plans?\n\n       (a) A multi-employer health plan is a plan to which more \n     than one employer is required to contribute, and which is \n     maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining \n     agreements between employee organization(s) and the \n     employers.\n       (b) An employing office under a multi-employer plan must \n     continue to make contributions on behalf of an employee using \n     FMLA leave as though the employee had been continuously \n     employed, unless the plan contains an explicit FMLA provision \n     for maintaining coverage such as through pooled contributions \n     by all employers party to the plan.\n       (c) During the duration of an employee's FMLA leave, \n     coverage by the group health plan, and benefits provided \n     pursuant to the plan, must be maintained at the level of \n     coverage and benefits which were applicable to the employee \n     at the time FMLA leave commenced.\n       (d) An employee using FMLA leave cannot be required to use \n     ``banked'' hours or pay a greater premium than the employee \n     would have been required to pay if the employee had been \n     continuously employed.\n       (e) As provided in Sec. 825.209(f), group health plan \n     coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA leave \n     until:\n       (1) the employee's FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted;\n       (2) the employing office can show that the employee would \n     have been laid off and the employment relationship \n     terminated; or\n       (3) the employee provides unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work.\n\n     Sec. 825.212 What are the consequences of an employee's \n       failure to make timely health plan premium payments?\n\n       (a)(1) In the absence of an established employing office \n     policy providing a longer grace period, an employing office's \n     obligations to maintain health insurance coverage cease under \n     FMLA if an employee's premium payment is more than 30 days \n     late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee whose \n     premium payment is late, the employing office must provide \n     written notice to the employee that the payment has not been \n     received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least \n     15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage \n     will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after \n     the date of the letter unless the payment has been received \n     by that date. If the employing office has established \n     policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that provide \n     for the employing office to cease coverage retroactively to \n     the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the employing \n     office may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in \n     accordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was \n     given. In the absence of such a policy, coverage for the \n     employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day grace \n     period, where the required 15-day notice has been provided.\n       (2) An employing office has no obligation regarding the \n     maintenance of a health insurance policy which is not a \n     ``group health plan''. See Sec. 825.209(a).\n       (3) All other obligations of an employing office under FMLA \n     would continue; for example, the employing office continues \n     to have an obligation to reinstate an employee upon return \n     from leave.\n       (b) The employing office may recover the employee's share \n     of any premium payments missed by the employee for any FMLA \n     leave period during which the employing office maintains \n     health coverage by paying the employee's share after the \n     premium payment is missed.\n       (c) If coverage lapses because an employee has not made \n     required premium payments, upon the employee's return from \n     FMLA leave the employing office must still restore the \n     employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the \n     employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the \n     premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or \n     dependent coverage. See Sec. 825.215(d) (1)-(5). In such \n     case, an employee may not be required to meet any \n     qualification requirements imposed by the plan, including any \n     new preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open \n     season, or to pass a medical examination to obtain \n     reinstatement of coverage.\n\n     Sec. 825.213 May an employing office recover costs it \n       incurred for maintaining ``group health plan'' or other \n       non-health benefits coverage during FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) In addition to the circumstances discussed in \n     Sec. 825.212(b), the share of health plan premiums paid by or \n     on behalf of the employing office during a period of unpaid \n     FMLA leave may be recovered from an employee if the employee \n     fails to return to work after the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement has been exhausted or expires, unless the reason \n     the employee does not return is due to:\n       (1) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious \n     health condition of the employee or the employee's family \n     member which would otherwise entitle the employee to leave \n     under FMLA;\n       (2) Other circumstances beyond the employee's control. \n     Examples of ``other circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control'' are necessarily broad. They include such situations \n     as where a parent chooses to stay home with a newborn child \n     who has a serious health condition; an employee's spouse is \n     unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles \n     from the employee's worksite; a relative or individual other \n     than an immediate family member has a serious health \n     condition and the employee is needed to provide care; the \n     employee is laid off while on leave; or, the employee is a \n     ``key employee'' who decides not to return to work upon being \n     notified of the employing office's intention to deny \n     restoration because of substantial and grievous economic \n     injury to the employing office's operations and is not \n     reinstated by the employing office. Other circumstances \n     beyond the employee's control would not include a situation \n     where an employee desires to remain with a parent in a \n     distant city even though the parent no longer requires the \n     employee's care, or a parent chooses not to return to work to \n     stay home with a well, newborn child; or\n       (3) When an employee fails to return to work because of the \n     continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health \n     condition, thereby precluding the employing office from \n     recovering its (share of) health benefit premium payments \n     made on the employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employing office may require medical certification \n     of the employee's or the family member's serious health \n     condition. Such certification is not required unless \n     requested by the employing office. The employee is required \n     to provide medical certification in a timely manner which, \n     for purposes of this section, is within 30 days from the date \n     of the employing office's request. For purposes of medical \n     certification, the employee may use the optional form \n     developed for this purpose (see Sec. 825.306(a) and Appendix \n     B of this part). If the employing office requests medical \n     certification and the employee does not provide such \n     certification in a timely manner (within 30 days), or the \n     reason for not returning to work does not meet the test of \n     other circumstances beyond the employee's control, the \n     employing office may recover 100 percent of the health \n     benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave.\n       (b) Under some circumstances an employing office may elect \n     to maintain other benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability \n     insurance, etc., by paying the employee's (share of) premiums \n     during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For example, to ensure \n     the employing office can meet its responsibilities to provide \n     equivalent benefits to the employee upon return from unpaid \n     FMLA leave, it may be necessary that premiums be paid \n     continuously to avoid a lapse of coverage. If the employing \n     office elects to maintain such benefits during the leave, at \n     the conclusion of leave, the employing office is entitled to \n     recover only the costs incurred for paying the employee's \n     share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to \n     work.\n       (c) An employee who returns to work for at least 30 \n     calendar days is considered to have ``returned'' to work. An \n     employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to \n     retirement, or who retires during the first 30 days after the \n     employee returns to work, is deemed to have returned to work.\n       (d) When an employee elects or an employing office requires \n     paid leave to be substituted for FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may not recover its (share of) health insurance or \n     other non-health benefit premiums for any period of FMLA \n     leave covered by paid leave. Because paid leave provided \n     under a plan covering temporary disabilities (including \n     workers' compensation) is not unpaid, recovery of health \n     insurance premiums does not apply to such paid leave.\n       (e) The amount that self-insured employing offices may \n     recover is limited to only the employing office's share of \n     allowable ``premiums'' as would be calculated under COBRA, \n     excluding the 2 percent fee for administrative costs.\n       (f) When an employee fails to return to work, any health \n     and non-health benefit premiums which this section of the \n     regulations permits an employing office to recover are a debt \n     owed by the non-returning employee to the employing office. \n     The existence of this\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\n     debt caused by the employee's failure to return to work does \n     not alter the employing office's responsibilities for health \n     benefit coverage and, under a self-insurance plan, payment of \n     claims incurred during the period of FMLA leave. To the \n     extent recovery is allowed, the employing office may recover \n     the costs through deduction from any sums due to the employee \n     (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation pay, etc.), provided such \n     deductions do not otherwise violate applicable wage payment \n     or other laws. Alternatively, the employing office may \n     initiate legal action against the employee to recover such \n     costs.\n\n     Sec. 825.214 What are an employee's rights on returning to \n       work from FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) On return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to \n     be returned to the same position the employee held when leave \n     commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     An employee is entitled to such reinstatement even if the \n     employee has been replaced or his or her position has been \n     restructured to accommodate the employee's absence. See also \n     Sec. 825.106(e) for the obligations of employing offices that \n     are joint employing offices.\n       (b) If the employee is unable to perform an essential \n     function of the position because of a physical or mental \n     condition, including the continuation of a serious health \n     condition, the employee has no right to restoration to \n     another position under the FMLA. However, the employing \n     office's obligations may be governed by the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA. See \n     Sec. 825.702.\n\n     Sec. 825.215 What is an equivalent position?\n\n       (a) An equivalent position is one that is virtually \n     identical to the employee's former position in terms of pay, \n     benefits and working conditions, including privileges, \n     perquisites and status. It must involve the same or \n     substantially similar duties and responsibilities, which must \n     entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, \n     responsibility, and authority.\n       (b) If an employee is no longer qualified for the position \n     because of the employee's inability to attend a necessary \n     course, renew a license, fly a minimum number of hours, etc., \n     as a result of the leave, the employee shall be given a \n     reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon \n     return to work.\n       (c) Equivalent Pay:\n       (1) An employee is entitled to any unconditional pay \n     increases which may have occurred during the FMLA leave \n     period, such as cost of living increases. Pay increases \n     conditioned upon seniority, length of service, or work \n     performed would not have to be granted unless it is the \n     employing office's policy or practice to do so with respect \n     to other employees on ``leave without pay''. In such case, \n     any pay increase would be granted based on the employee's \n     seniority, length of service, work performed, etc., excluding \n     the period of unpaid FMLA leave. An employee is entitled to \n     be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay \n     premiums, such as a shift differential. If an employee \n     departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime (and \n     corresponding overtime pay) each week, an employee is \n     ordinarily entitled to such a position on return from FMLA \n     leave.\n       (2) Many employing offices pay bonuses in different forms \n     to employees for job-related performance such as for perfect \n     attendance, safety (absence of injuries or accidents on the \n     job) and exceeding production goals. Bonuses for perfect \n     attendance and safety do not require performance by the \n     employee but rather contemplate the absence of occurrences. \n     To the extent an employee who takes FMLA leave had met all \n     the requirements for either or both of these bonuses before \n     FMLA leave began, the employee is entitled to continue this \n     entitlement upon return from FMLA leave, that is, the \n     employee may not be disqualified for the bonus(es) for the \n     taking of FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220 (b) and (c). A monthly \n     production bonus, on the other hand, does require performance \n     by the employee. If the employee is on FMLA leave during any \n     part of the period for which the bonus is computed, the \n     employee is entitled to the same consideration for the bonus \n     as other employees on paid or unpaid leave (as appropriate). \n     See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n       (d) Equivalent Benefits. ``Benefits'' include all benefits \n     provided or made available to employees by an employing \n     office, including group life insurance, health insurance, \n     disability insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational \n     benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether such benefits \n     are provided by a practice or written policy of an employing \n     office through an employee benefit plan.\n       (1) At the end of an employee's FMLA leave, benefits must \n     be resumed in the same manner and at the same levels as \n     provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in \n     benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of \n     FMLA leave affecting the entire workforce, unless otherwise \n     elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave, an \n     employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the \n     employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or \n     dependent coverages). For example, if an employee was covered \n     by a life insurance policy before taking leave but is not \n     covered or coverage lapses during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employee cannot be required to meet any \n     qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in \n     order to requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. \n     Accordingly, some employing offices may find it necessary to \n     modify life insurance and other benefits programs in order to \n     restore employees to equivalent benefits upon return from \n     FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued payment of costs \n     to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA leave, or pay \n     these costs subject to recovery from the employee on return \n     from leave. See Sec. 825.213(b).\n       (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any \n     additional benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Benefits accrued at the time leave began, however, (e.g., \n     paid vacation, sick or personal leave to the extent not \n     substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an employee \n     upon return from leave.\n       (3) If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to \n     continue life insurance, disability insurance, or other types \n     of benefits for which he or she typically pays, the employing \n     office is required to follow established policies or \n     practices for continuing such benefits for other instances of \n     leave without pay. If the employing office has no established \n     policy, the employee and the employing office are encouraged \n     to agree upon arrangements before FMLA leave begins.\n       (4) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any \n     period of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or \n     counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and \n     eligibility to participate. Also, if the plan requires an \n     employee to be employed on a specific date in order to be \n     credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions or \n     participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on \n     that date shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. \n     However, unpaid FMLA leave periods need not be treated as \n     credited service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and \n     eligibility to participate.\n       (5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if \n     they continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit \n     plans. They are entitled to changes in benefits plans, except \n     those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual during \n     the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to \n     the same extent they would have qualified if no leave had \n     been taken. For example if the benefit plan is predicated on \n     a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the \n     employee does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking \n     unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost. (In this regard, \n     Sec. 825.209 addresses health benefits.)\n       (e) Equivalent Terms and Conditions of Employment. An \n     equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, \n     conditions, responsibilities, privileges and status as the \n     employee's original position.\n       (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a \n     geographically proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not \n     involve a significant increase in commuting time or distance) \n     from where the employee had previously been employed. If the \n     employee's original worksite has been closed, the employee is \n     entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been \n     on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an \n     employing office transfers all employees from a closed \n     worksite to a new worksite in a different city, the employee \n     on leave is also entitled to transfer under the same \n     conditions as if he or she had continued to be employed.\n       (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the \n     same shift or the same or an equivalent work schedule.\n       (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent \n     opportunity for bonuses and other similar discretionary and \n     non-discretionary payments.\n       (4) FMLA does not prohibit an employing office from \n     accommodating an employee's request to be restored to a \n     different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the \n     employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a \n     promotion to a better position. However, an employee cannot \n     be induced by the employing office to accept a different \n     position against the employee's wishes.\n       (f) The requirement that an employee be restored to the \n     same or equivalent job with the same or equivalent pay, \n     benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not \n     extend to de minimis or intangible, unmeasurable aspects of \n     the job. However, restoration to a job slated for lay-off, \n     when the employee's original position is not, would not meet \n     the requirements of an equivalent position.\n\n     Sec. 825.216 Are there any limitations on an employing \n       office's obligation to reinstate an employee?\n\n       (a) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. An employing office must be able to show that an \n     employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time \n     reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to \n     employment. For example:\n       (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking \n     FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employing \n     office's responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain \n     group health plan benefits and restore the employee ceases at \n     the time the employee is laid off, provided the employing \n     office has no continuing obligations under a collective \n     bargaining agreement or otherwise. An employing office would \n     have the burden of proving that an employee would\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\n     have been laid off during the FMLA leave period and, \n     therefore, would not be entitled to restoration.\n       (2) If a shift has been eliminated, or overtime has been \n     decreased, an employee would not be entitled to return to \n     work that shift or the original overtime hours upon \n     restoration. However, if a position on, for example, a night \n     shift has been filled by another employee, the employee is \n     entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before \n     taking FMLA leave.\n       (b) If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to \n     perform work on a discrete project, the employing office has \n     no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term \n     or project is over and the employing office would not \n     otherwise have continued to employ the employee.\n       (c) In addition to the circumstances explained above, an \n     employing office may deny job restoration to salaried \n     eligible employees (``key employees'', as defined in \n     paragraph (c) of Sec. 825.217) if such denial is necessary to \n     prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the \n     operations of the employing office; or may delay restoration \n     to an employee who fails to provide a fitness for duty \n     certificate to return to work under the conditions described \n     in Sec. 825.310.\n       (d) If the employee has been on a workers' compensation \n     absence during which FMLA leave has been taken concurrently, \n     and after 12 weeks of FMLA leave the employee is unable to \n     return to work, the employee no longer has the protections of \n     FMLA and must look to the workers' compensation statute or \n     ADA, as made applicable by the CAA, for any relief or \n     protections.\n\n     Sec. 825.217 What is a ``key employee''?\n\n       (a) A ``key employee'' is a salaried FMLA-eligible employee \n     who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees \n     employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the \n     employee's worksite.\n       (b) The term ``salaried'' means paid on a salary basis, \n     within the meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541, \n     implementing section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313) \n     (regarding employees who may qualify as exempt from the \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, as executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees).\n       (c) A ``key employee'' must be ``among the highest paid 10 \n     percent'' of all the employees ``both salaried and non-\n     salaried, eligible and ineligible ``who are employed by the \n     employing office within 75 miles of the worksite'':\n       (1) In determining which employees are among the highest \n     paid 10 percent, year-to-date earnings are divided by weeks \n     worked by the employee (including weeks in which paid leave \n     was taken). Earnings include wages, premium pay, incentive \n     pay, and non-discretionary and discretionary bonuses. \n     Earnings do not include incentives whose value is determined \n     at some future date, e.g., benefits or perquisites.\n       (2) The determination of whether a salaried employee is \n     among the highest paid 10 percent shall be made at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave. No more than \n     10 percent of the employing office's employees within 75 \n     miles of the worksite may be ``key employees''.\n\n     Sec. 825.218 What does ``substantial and grievous economic \n       injury'' mean?\n\n       (a) In order to deny restoration to a key employee, an \n     employing office must determine that the restoration of the \n     employee to employment will cause ``substantial and grievous \n     economic injury'' to the operations of the employing office, \n     not whether the absence of the employee will cause such \n     substantial and grievous injury.\n       (b) An employing office may take into account its ability \n     to replace on a temporary basis (or temporarily do without) \n     the employee on FMLA leave. If permanent replacement is \n     unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating the employee can be \n     considered in evaluating whether substantial and grievous \n     economic injury will occur from restoration; in other words, \n     the effect on the operations of the employing office of \n     reinstating the employee in an equivalent position.\n       (c) A precise test cannot be set for the level of hardship \n     or injury to the employing office which must be sustained. If \n     the reinstatement of a ``key employee'' threatens the \n     economic viability of the employing office, that would \n     constitute ``substantial and grievous economic injury''. A \n     lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic \n     injury would also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and \n     costs that the employing office would experience in the \n     normal course would certainly not constitute ``substantial \n     and grievous economic injury''.\n       (d) FMLA's ``substantial and grievous economic injury'' \n     standard is different from and more stringent than the \n     ``undue hardship'' test under the ADA (see, also \n     Sec. 825.702).\n\n     Sec. 825.219 What are the rights of a key employee?\n\n       (a) An employing office which believes that reinstatement \n     may be denied to a key employee, must give written notice to \n     the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if \n     earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At the \n     same time, the employing office must also fully inform the \n     employee of the potential consequences with respect to \n     reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the \n     employing office should determine that substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to the employing office's operations \n     will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave. If \n     such notice cannot be given immediately because of the need \n     to determine whether the employee is a key employee, it shall \n     be given as soon as practicable after being notified of a \n     need for leave (or the commencement of leave, if earlier). It \n     is expected that in most circumstances there will be no \n     desire that an employee be denied restoration after FMLA \n     leave and, therefore, there would be no need to provide such \n     notice. However, an employing office who fails to provide \n     such timely notice will lose its right to deny restoration \n     even if substantial and grievous economic injury will result \n     from reinstatement.\n       (b) As soon as an employing office makes a good faith \n     determination, based on the facts available, that substantial \n     and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if \n     a key employee who has given notice of the need for FMLA \n     leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employing \n     office shall notify the employee in writing of its \n     determination, that it cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it \n     intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of \n     the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an employing office \n     will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the \n     employee starting leave. The employing office must serve this \n     notice either in person or by certified mail. This notice \n     must explain the basis for the employing office's finding \n     that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, \n     and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a \n     reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into \n     account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave \n     and the urgency of the need for the employee to return.\n       (c) If an employee on leave does not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notification of intent to \n     deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to \n     maintenance of health benefits and the employing office may \n     not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key \n     employee's rights under FMLA continue unless and until either \n     the employee gives notice that he or she no longer wishes to \n     return to work, or the employing office actually denies \n     reinstatement at the conclusion of the leave period.\n       (d) After notice to an employee has been given that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result if the \n     employee is reinstated to employment, an employee is still \n     entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave \n     period even if the employee did not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notice. The employing \n     office must then again determine whether there will be \n     substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, \n     based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the \n     employing office shall notify the employee in writing (in \n     person or by certified mail) of the denial of restoration.\n\n     Sec. 825.220 How are employees protected who request leave or \n       otherwise assert FMLA rights?\n\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prohibits \n     interference with an employee's rights under the law, and \n     with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employee's \n     rights. More specifically, the law contains the following \n     employee protections:\n       (1) An employing office is prohibited from interfering \n     with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to \n     exercise) any rights provided by the FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA.\n       (2) An employing office is prohibited from discharging or \n     in any other way discriminating against any covered employee \n     (whether or not an eligible employee) for opposing or \n     complaining about any unlawful practice under the FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (3) All employing offices are prohibited from discharging \n     or in any other way discriminating against any covered \n     employee (whether or not an eligible employee) because that \n     covered employee has--\n       (i) Filed any charge, or has instituted (or caused to be \n     instituted) any proceeding under or related to the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA;\n       (ii) Given, or is about to give, any information in \n     connection with an inquiry or proceeding relating to a right \n     under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA;\n       (iii) Testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or \n     proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering with, \n     restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by \n     the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA. ``Interfering with'' \n     the exercise of an employee's rights would include, for \n     example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but \n     discouraging an employee from using such leave. It would also \n     include manipulation by an employing office to avoid \n     responsibilities under FMLA, for example--\n       (1) [Reserved];\n       (2) changing the essential functions of the job in order to \n     preclude the taking of leave;\n       (3) reducing hours available to work in order to avoid \n     employee eligibility.\n       (c) An employing office is prohibited from discriminating \n     against employees or prospective employees who have used FMLA \n     leave. For example, if an employee on leave without pay would \n     otherwise be entitled to full benefits (other than health \n     benefits), the same benefits would be required to be provided \n     to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave.\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\n     By the same token, employing offices cannot use the taking of \n     FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such \n     as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA \n     leave be counted under ``no fault'' attendance policies.\n       (d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employing offices \n     induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA. For \n     example, employees (or their collective bargaining \n     representatives) cannot ``trade off'' the right to take FMLA \n     leave against some other benefit offered by the employing \n     office. This does not prevent an employee's voluntary and \n     uncoerced acceptance (not as a condition of employment) of a \n     ``light duty'' assignment while recovering from a serious \n     health condition (see Sec. 825.702(d)). In such a \n     circumstance the employee's right to restoration to the same \n     or an equivalent position is available until 12 weeks have \n     passed within the 12-month period, including all FMLA leave \n     taken and the period of ``light duty''.\n       (e) Covered employees, and not merely eligible employees, \n     are protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., file a \n     complaint about) any practice which is unlawful under the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They are similarly \n     protected if they oppose any practice which they reasonably \n     believe to be a violation of the FMLA, as made applicable by \n     the CAA or regulations.\n\nSubpart C--How do Employees Learn of Their Rights and Obligations under \n  the FMLA, as Made Applicable by the CAA, and What Can an Employing \n                     Office Require of an Employee?\n\n     Sec. 825.300 [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.301 What notices to employees are required of \n       employing offices under the FMLA as made applicable by the \n       CAA?\n\n       (a)(1) If an employing office has any eligible employees \n     and has any written guidance to employees concerning employee \n     benefits or leave rights, such as in an employee handbook, \n     information concerning both entitlements and employee \n     obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     must be included in the handbook or other document. For \n     example, if an employing office provides an employee handbook \n     to all employees that describes the employing office's \n     policies regarding leave, wages, attendance, and similar \n     matters, the handbook must incorporate information on FMLA \n     rights and responsibilities and the employing office's \n     policies regarding the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. \n     Informational publications describing the provisions of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA are available from the \n     Office of Compliance and may be incorporated in such \n     employing office handbooks or written policies.\n       (2) If such an employing office does not have written \n     policies, manuals, or handbooks describing employee benefits \n     and leave provisions, the employing office shall provide \n     written guidance to an employee concerning all the employee's \n     rights and obligations under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. This notice shall be provided to employees each time \n     notice is given pursuant to paragraph (b), and in accordance \n     with the provisions of that paragraph. Employing offices may \n     duplicate and provide the employee a copy of the FMLA Fact \n     Sheet available from the Office of Compliance to provide such \n     guidance.\n       (b)(1) The employing office shall also provide the employee \n     with written notice detailing the specific expectations and \n     obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences \n     of a failure to meet these obligations. The written notice \n     must be provided to the employee in a language in which the \n     employee is literate. Such specific notice must include, as \n     appropriate--\n       (i) that the leave will be counted against the employee's \n     annual FMLA leave entitlement (see Sec. 825.208);\n       (ii) any requirements for the employee to furnish medical \n     certification of a serious health condition and the \n     consequences of failing to do so (see Sec. 825.305);\n       (iii) the employee's right to substitute paid leave and \n     whether the employing office will require the substitution of \n     paid leave, and the conditions related to any substitution;\n       (iv) any requirement for the employee to make any premium \n     payments to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for \n     making such payments (see Sec. 825.210), and the possible \n     consequences of failure to make such payments on a timely \n     basis (i.e., the circumstances under which coverage may \n     lapse);\n       (v) any requirement for the employee to present a fitness-\n     for-duty certificate to be restored to employment (see \n     Sec. 825.310);\n       (vi) the employee's status as a ``key employee'' and the \n     potential consequence that restoration may be denied \n     following FMLA leave, explaining the conditions required for \n     such denial (see Sec. 825.218);\n       (vii) the employee's right to restoration to the same or an \n     equivalent job upon return from leave (see Sec. Sec.  825.214 \n     and 825.604); and\n       (viii) the employee's potential liability for payment of \n     health insurance premiums paid by the employing office during \n     the employee's unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to \n     return to work after taking FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.213).\n       (2) The specific notice may include other information--\n     e.g., whether the employing office will require periodic \n     reports of the employee's status and intent to return to \n     work, but is not required to do so. A prototype notice is \n     contained in Appendix D of this part, or may be obtained from \n     the Office of Compliance, which employing offices may adapt \n     for their use to meet these specific notice requirements.\n       (c) Except as provided in this subparagraph, the written \n     notice required by paragraph (b) (and by subparagraph (a)(2) \n     where applicable) must be provided to the employee no less \n     often than the first time in each six-month period that an \n     employee gives notice of the need for FMLA leave (if FMLA \n     leave is taken during the six-month period). The notice shall \n     be given within a reasonable time after notice of the need \n     for leave is given by the employee--within one or two \n     business days if feasible. If leave has already begun, the \n     notice should be mailed to the employee's address of record.\n       (1) If the specific information provided by the notice \n     changes with respect to a subsequent period of FMLA leave \n     during the six-month period, the employing office shall, \n     within one or two business days of receipt of the employee's \n     notice of need for leave, provide written notice referencing \n     the prior notice and setting forth any of the information in \n     subparagraph (b) which has changed. For example, if the \n     initial leave period were paid leave and the subsequent leave \n     period would be unpaid leave, the employing office may need \n     to give notice of the arrangements for making premium \n     payments.\n       (2)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii), if the \n     employing office is requiring medical certification or a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report, written notice of the \n     requirement shall be given with respect to each employee \n     notice of a need for leave.\n       (ii) Subsequent written notification shall not be required \n     if the initial notice in the six-month period and the \n     employing office handbook or other written documents (if any) \n     describing the employing office's leave policies, clearly \n     provided that certification or a ``fitness-for-duty'' report \n     would be required (e.g., by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases, by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases in which leave of more than a \n     specified number of days is taken, or by stating that a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report would be required in all cases \n     for back injuries for employees in a certain occupation). \n     Where subsequent written notice is not required, at least \n     oral notice shall be provided. (See Sec. 825.305(a).)\n       (d) Employing offices are also expected to responsively \n     answer questions from employees concerning their rights and \n     responsibilities under the FMLA as made applicable under the \n     CAA.\n       (e) Employing offices furnishing FMLA-required notices to \n     sensory impaired individuals must also comply with all \n     applicable requirements under law.\n       (f) If an employing office fails to provide notice in \n     accordance with the provisions of this section, the employing \n     office may not take action against an employee for failure to \n     comply with any provision required to be set forth in the \n     notice.\n\n     Sec. 825.302 What notice does an employee have to give an \n       employing office when the need for FMLA leave is \n       foreseeable?\n\n       (a) An employee must provide the employing office at least \n     30 days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the \n     need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, \n     placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical \n     treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or \n     of a family member. If 30 days notice is not practicable, \n     such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when \n     leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, \n     or a medical emergency, notice must be given as soon as \n     practicable. For example, an employee's health condition may \n     require leave to commence earlier than anticipated before the \n     birth of a child. Similarly, little opportunity for notice \n     may be given before placement for adoption. Whether the leave \n     is to be continuous or is to be taken intermittently or on a \n     reduced schedule basis, notice need only be given one time, \n     but the employee shall advise the employing office as soon as \n     practicable if dates of scheduled leave change or are \n     extended, or were initially unknown.\n       (b) ``As soon as practicable'' means as soon as both \n     possible and practical, taking into account all of the facts \n     and circumstances in the individual case. For foreseeable \n     leave where it is not possible to give as much as 30 days \n     notice, ``as soon as practicable'' ordinarily would mean at \n     least verbal notification to the employing office within one \n     or two business days of when the need for leave becomes known \n     to the employee.\n       (c) An employee shall provide at least verbal notice \n     sufficient to make the employing office aware that the \n     employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated \n     timing and duration of the leave. The employee need not \n     expressly assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that \n     leave is needed for an expected birth or adoption, for \n     example. The employing office should inquire further of the \n     employee if it is necessary to have more information about \n     whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and \n     obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. In the \n     case of medical conditions, the employing office may find it \n     necessary to inquire further to determine if the leave is \n     because of a serious health condition and may request medical \n     certification to support the need for such leave (see \n     Sec. 825.305).\n       (d) An employing office may also require an employee to \n     comply with the employing office's usual and customary notice \n     and procedural requirements for requesting leave.\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\n     For example, an employing office may require that written \n     notice set forth the reasons for the requested leave, the \n     anticipated duration of the leave, and the anticipated start \n     of the leave. However, failure to follow such internal \n     employing office procedures will not permit an employing \n     office to disallow or delay an employee's taking FMLA leave \n     if the employee gives timely verbal or other notice.\n       (e) When planning medical treatment, the employee must \n     consult with the employing office and make a reasonable \n     effort to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt unduly the \n     employing office's operations, subject to the approval of the \n     health care provider. Employees are ordinarily expected to \n     consult with their employing offices prior to the scheduling \n     of treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule which \n     best suits the needs of both the employing office and the \n     employee. If an employee who provides notice of the need to \n     take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical \n     treatment neglects to consult with the employing office to \n     make a reasonable attempt to arrange the schedule of \n     treatments so as not to unduly disrupt the employing office's \n     operations, the employing office may initiate discussions \n     with the employee and require the employee to attempt to make \n     such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider.\n       (f) In the case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule which is medically necessary, an employee \n     shall advise the employing office, upon request, of the \n     reasons why the intermittent/reduced leave schedule is \n     necessary and of the schedule for treatment, if applicable. \n     The employee and employing office shall attempt to work out a \n     schedule which meets the employee's needs without unduly \n     disrupting the employing office's operations, subject to the \n     approval of the health care provider.\n       (g) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     requirements. In addition, an employing office may not \n     require compliance with stricter FMLA notice requirements \n     where the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or \n     applicable leave plan allow less advance notice to the \n     employing office. For example, if an employee (or employing \n     office) elects to substitute paid vacation leave for unpaid \n     FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.207), and the employing office's \n     paid vacation leave plan imposes no prior notification \n     requirements for taking such vacation leave, no advance \n     notice may be required for the FMLA leave taken in these \n     circumstances. On the other hand, FMLA notice requirements \n     would apply to a period of unpaid FMLA leave, unless the \n     employing office imposes lesser notice requirements on \n     employees taking leave without pay.\n\n     Sec. 825.303  What are the requirements for an employee to \n       furnish notice to an employing office where the need for \n       FMLA leave is not foreseeable?\n\n       (a) When the approximate timing of the need for leave is \n     not foreseeable, an employee should give notice to the \n     employing office of the need for FMLA leave as soon as \n     practicable under the facts and circumstances of the \n     particular case. It is expected that an employee will give \n     notice to the employing office within no more than one or two \n     working days of learning of the need for leave, except in \n     extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not \n     feasible. In the case of a medical emergency requiring \n     leave because of an employee's own serious health \n     condition or to care for a family member with a serious \n     health condition, written advance notice pursuant to an \n     employing office's internal rules and procedures may not \n     be required when FMLA leave is involved.\n       (b) The employee should provide notice to the employing \n     office either in person or by telephone, telegraph, facsimile \n     (``fax'') machine or other electronic means. Notice may be \n     given by the employee's spokesperson (e.g., spouse, adult \n     family member or other responsible party) if the employee is \n     unable to do so personally. The employee need not expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is \n     needed. The employing office will be expected to obtain any \n     additional required information through informal means. The \n     employee or spokesperson will be expected to provide more \n     information when it can readily be accomplished as a \n     practical matter, taking into consideration the exigencies of \n     the situation.\n\n     Sec. 825.304  What recourse do employing offices have if \n       employees fail to provide the required notice?\n\n       (a) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     obligations or the employing office's own internal rules on \n     leave notice requirements.\n       (b) If an employee fails to give 30 days notice for \n     foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, \n     the employing office may delay the taking of FMLA leave until \n     at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice \n     to the employing office of the need for FMLA leave.\n       (c) In all cases, in order for the onset of an employee's \n     FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack of required notice, it \n     must be clear that the employee had actual notice of the FMLA \n     notice requirements. This condition would be satisfied by the \n     employing office's proper posting, at the worksite where the \n     employee is employed, of the information regarding the FMLA \n     provided (pursuant to section 301(h)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     1381(h)(2)) by the Office of Compliance to the employing \n     office in a manner suitable for posting. Furthermore, the \n     need for leave and the approximate date leave would be taken \n     must have been clearly foreseeable to the employee 30 days in \n     advance of the leave. For example, knowledge that an employee \n     would receive a telephone call about the availability of a \n     child for adoption at some unknown point in the future would \n     not be sufficient.\n\n     Sec. 825.305  When must an employee provide medical \n       certification to support FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) An employing office may require that an employee's \n     leave to care for the employee's seriously ill spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent, or due to the employee's own serious \n     health condition that makes the employee unable to perform \n     one or more of the essential functions of the employee's \n     position, be supported by a certification issued by the \n     health care provider of the employee or the employee's ill \n     family member. An employing office must give notice of a \n     requirement for medical certification each time a \n     certification is required; such notice must be written notice \n     whenever required by Sec. 825.301. An employing office's oral \n     request to an employee to furnish any subsequent medical \n     certification is sufficient.\n       (b) When the leave is foreseeable and at least 30 days \n     notice has been provided, the employee should provide the \n     medical certification before the leave begins. When this is \n     not possible, the employee must provide the requested \n     certification to the employing office within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 calendar days after the employing office's request), \n     unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts.\n       (c) In most cases, the employing office should request that \n     an employee furnish certification from a health care provider \n     at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave \n     or within two business days thereafter, or, in the case of \n     unforeseen leave, within two business days after the leave \n     commences. The employing office may request certification at \n     some later date if the employing office later has reason to \n     question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.\n       (d) At the time the employing office requests \n     certification, the employing office must also advise an \n     employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee's \n     failure to provide adequate certification. The employing \n     office shall advise an employee whenever the employing office \n     finds a certification incomplete, and provide the employee a \n     reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency.\n       (e) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     imposes medical certification requirements that are less \n     stringent than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's less stringent sick leave \n     certification requirements may be imposed.\n\n     Sec. 825.306  How much information may be required in medical \n       certifications of a serious health condition?\n\n       (a) The Office of Compliance has made available an optional \n     form (``Certification of Physician or Practitioner'') for \n     employees' (or their family members') use in obtaining \n     medical certification, including second and third opinions, \n     from health care providers that meets FMLA's certification \n     requirements. (See Appendix B to these regulations.) This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the health care provider to furnish appropriate \n     medical information within his or her knowledge.\n       (b) The Certification of Physician or Practitioner form is \n     modeled closely on Form WH-380, as revised, which was \n     developed by the Department of Labor (see 29 C.F.R. Part 825, \n     Appendix B). The employing office may use the Office of \n     Compliance's form, or Form WH-380, as revised, or another \n     form containing the same basic information; however, no \n     additional information may be required. In all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the serious \n     health condition for which the current need for leave exists. \n     The form identifies the health care provider and type of \n     medical practice (including pertinent specialization, if \n     any), makes maximum use of checklist entries for ease in \n     completing the form, and contains required entries for:\n       (1) A certification as to which part of the definition of \n     ``serious health condition'' (see Sec. 825.114), if any, \n     applies to the patient's condition, and the medical facts \n     which support the certification, including a brief statement \n     as to how the medical facts meet the criteria of the \n     definition.\n       (2)(i) The approximate date the serious health condition \n     commenced, and its probable duration, including the probable \n     duration of the patient's present incapacity (defined to mean \n     inability to work, attend school or perform other regular \n     daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom) if different.\n       (ii) Whether it will be necessary for the employee to take \n     leave intermittently or to work on a reduced leave schedule \n     basis (i.e., part-time) as a result of the serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.117 and Sec. 825.203), and if so, the \n     probable duration of such schedule.\n       (iii) If the condition is pregnancy or a chronic condition \n     within the meaning of\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\n     Sec. 825.114(a)(2)(iii), whether the patient is presently \n     incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of \n     episodes of incapacity.\n       (3)(i)(A) If additional treatments will be required for the \n     condition, an estimate of the probable number of such \n     treatments.\n       (B) If the patient's incapacity will be intermittent, or \n     will require a reduced leave schedule, an estimate of the \n     probable number and interval between such treatments, actual \n     or estimated dates of treatment if known, and period required \n     for recovery if any.\n       (ii) If any of the treatments referred to in subparagraph \n     (i) will be provided by another provider of health services \n     (e.g., physical therapist), the nature of the treatments.\n       (iii) If a regimen of continuing treatment by the patient \n     is required under the supervision of the health care \n     provider, a general description of the regimen (see \n     Sec. 825.114(b)).\n       (4) If medical leave is required for the employee's absence \n     from work because of the employee's own condition (including \n     absences due to pregnancy or a chronic condition), whether \n     the employee--\n       (i) is unable to perform work of any kind;\n       (ii) is unable to perform any one or more of the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, including a statement \n     of the essential functions the employee is unable to perform \n     (see Sec. 825.115), based on either information provided on a \n     statement from the employing office of the essential \n     functions of the position or, if not provided, discussion \n     with the employee about the employee's job functions; or\n       (iii) must be absent from work for treatment.\n       (5)(i) If leave is required to care for a family member of \n     the employee with a serious health condition, whether the \n     patient requires assistance for basic medical or personal \n     needs or safety, or for transportation; or if not, whether \n     the employee's presence to provide psychological comfort \n     would be beneficial to the patient or assist in the patient's \n     recovery. The employee is required to indicate on the form \n     the care he or she will provide and an estimate of the time \n     period.\n       (ii) If the employee's family member will need care only \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule basis (i.e., \n     part-time), the probable duration of the need.\n       (c) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     requires less information to be furnished in medical \n     certifications than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's lesser sick leave certification \n     requirements may be imposed.\n\n     Sec. 825.307  What may an employing office do if it questions \n       the adequacy of a medical certification?\n\n       (a) If an employee submits a complete certification signed \n     by the health care provider, the employing office may not \n     request additional information from the employee's health \n     care provider. However, a health care provider representing \n     the employing office may contact the employee's health care \n     provider, with the employee's permission, for purposes of \n     clarification and authenticity of the medical certification.\n       (1) If an employee is on FMLA leave running concurrently \n     with a workers' compensation absence, and the provisions of \n     the workers' compensation statute permit the employing office \n     or the employing office's representative to have direct \n     contact with the employee's workers' compensation health care \n     provider, the employing office may follow the workers' \n     compensation provisions.\n       (2) An employing office that has reason to doubt the \n     validity of a medical certification may require the employee \n     to obtain a second opinion at the employing office's expense. \n     Pending receipt of the second (or third) medical opinion, the \n     employee is provisionally entitled to the benefits of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA, including maintenance of \n     group health benefits. If the certifications do not \n     ultimately establish the employee's entitlement to FMLA \n     leave, the leave shall not be designated as FMLA leave and \n     may be treated as paid or unpaid leave under the employing \n     office's established leave policies. The employing office is \n     permitted to designate the health care provider to furnish \n     the second opinion, but the selected health care provider may \n     not be employed on a regular basis by the employing office. \n     See also paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.\n       (b) The employing office may not regularly contract with or \n     otherwise regularly utilize the services of the health care \n     provider furnishing the second opinion unless the employing \n     office is located in an area where access to health care is \n     extremely limited (e.g., a rural area where no more than one \n     or two doctors practice in the relevant specialty in the \n     vicinity).\n       (c) If the opinions of the employee's and the employing \n     office's designated health care providers differ, the \n     employing office may require the employee to obtain \n     certification from a third health care provider, again at the \n     employing office's expense. This third opinion shall be final \n     and binding. The third health care provider must be \n     designated or approved jointly by the employing office and \n     the employee. The employing office and the employee must each \n     act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on whom to \n     select for the third opinion provider. If the employing \n     office does not attempt in good faith to reach agreement, the \n     employing office will be bound by the first certification. If \n     the employee does not attempt in good faith to reach \n     agreement, the employee will be bound by the second \n     certification. For example, an employee who refuses to agree \n     to see a doctor in the specialty in question may be failing \n     to act in good faith. On the other hand, an employing office \n     that refuses to agree to any doctor on a list of specialists \n     in the appropriate field provided by the employee and whom \n     the employee has not previously consulted may be failing to \n     act in good faith.\n       (d) The employing office is required to provide the \n     employee with a copy of the second and third medical \n     opinions, where applicable, upon request by the employee. \n     Requested copies are to be provided within two business days \n     unless extenuating circumstances prevent such action.\n       (e) If the employing office requires the employee to obtain \n     either a second or third opinion the employing office must \n     reimburse an employee or family member for any reasonable \n     ``out of pocket'' travel expenses incurred to obtain the \n     second and third medical opinions. The employing office may \n     not require the employee or family member to travel outside \n     normal commuting distance for purposes of obtaining the \n     second or third medical opinions except in very unusual \n     circumstances.\n       (f) In circumstances when the employee or a family member \n     is visiting in another country, or a family member resides in \n     a another country, and a serious health condition develops, \n     the employing office shall accept a medical certification as \n     well as second and third opinions from a health care provider \n     who practices in that country.\n\n     Sec. 825.308  Under what circumstances may an employing \n       office request subsequent recertifications of medical \n       conditions?\n\n       (a) For pregnancy, chronic, or permanent/long-term \n     conditions under continuing supervision of a health care \n     provider (as defined in Sec. 825.114(a)(2) (ii), (iii) or \n     (iv)), an employing office may request recertification no \n     more often than every 30 days and only in connection with an \n     absence by the employee, unless:\n       (1) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration or frequency \n     of absences, the severity of the condition, complications); \n     or\n       (2) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the employee's stated reason for the absence.\n       (b)(1) If the minimum duration of the period of incapacity \n     specified on a certification furnished by the health care \n     provider is more than 30 days, the employing office may not \n     request recertification until that minimum duration has \n     passed unless one of the conditions set forth in paragraph \n     (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (2) For FMLA leave taken intermittently or on a reduced \n     leave schedule basis, the employing office may not request \n     recertification in less than the minimum period specified on \n     the certification as necessary for such leave (including \n     treatment) unless one of the conditions set forth in \n     paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (c) For circumstances not covered by paragraphs (a) or (b) \n     of this section, an employing office may request \n     recertification at any reasonable interval, but not more \n     often than every 30 days, unless:\n       (1) The employee requests an extension of leave;\n       (2) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration of the \n     illness, the nature of the illness, complications); or\n       (3) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the continuing validity of the certification.\n       (d) The employee must provide the requested recertification \n     to the employing office within the time frame requested by \n     the employing office (which must allow at least 15 calendar \n     days after the employing office's request), unless it is not \n     practicable under the particular circumstances to do so \n     despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts.\n       (e) Any recertification requested by the employing office \n     shall be at the employee's expense unless the employing \n     office provides otherwise. No second or third opinion on \n     recertification may be required.\n\n     Sec. 825.309  What notice may an employing office require \n       regarding an employee's intent to return to work?\n\n       (a) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intent to return to work. The employing office's policy \n     regarding such reports may not be discriminatory and must \n     take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances \n     related to the individual employee's leave situation.\n       (b) If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work, the employing office's obligations under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health \n     benefits (subject to requirements of COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable) and to restore the employee cease. \n     However, these obligations continue if an employee indicates \n     he or she may be unable to return to work but expresses a \n     continuing desire to do so.\n       (c) It may be necessary for an employee to take more leave \n     than originally anticipated. Conversely, an employee may \n     discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have \n     changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no \n     longer necessary. An employee may not be required to take \n     more\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n     FMLA leave than necessary to resolve the circumstance that \n     precipitated the need for leave. In both of these situations, \n     the employing office may require that the employee provide \n     the employing office reasonable notice (i.e., within two \n     business days) of the changed circumstances where \n     foreseeable. The employing office may also obtain information \n     on such changed circumstances through requested status \n     reports.\n\n     Sec. 825.310  Under what circumstances may an employing \n       office require that an employee submit a medical \n       certification that the employee is able (or unable) to \n       return to work (i.e., a ``fitness-for-duty'' report)?\n\n       (a) As a condition of restoring an employee whose FMLA \n     leave was occasioned by the employee's own serious health \n     condition that made the employee unable to perform the \n     employee's job, an employing office may have a uniformly-\n     applied policy or practice that requires all similarly-\n     situated employees (i.e., same occupation, same serious \n     health condition) who take leave for such conditions to \n     obtain and present certification from the employee's health \n     care provider that the employee is able to resume work.\n       (b) If the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \n     govern an employee's return to work, those provisions shall \n     be applied. Similarly, requirements under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA, that \n     any return-to-work physical be job-related and consistent \n     with business necessity apply. For example, an attorney could \n     not be required to submit to a medical examination or inquiry \n     just because her leg had been amputated. The essential \n     functions of an attorney's job do not require use of both \n     legs; therefore such an inquiry would not be job related. An \n     employing office may require a warehouse laborer, whose back \n     impairment affects the ability to lift, to be examined by an \n     orthopedist, but may not require this employee to submit to \n     an HIV test where the test is not related to either the \n     essential functions of his/her job or to his/her impairment.\n       (c) An employing office may seek fitness-for-duty \n     certification only with regard to the particular health \n     condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave. The \n     certification itself need only be a simple statement of an \n     employee's ability to return to work. A health care provider \n     employed by the employing office may contact the employee's \n     health care provider with the employee's permission, for \n     purposes of clarification of the employee's fitness to return \n     to work. No additional information may be acquired, and \n     clarification may be requested only for the serious health \n     condition for which FMLA leave was taken. The employing \n     office may not delay the employee's return to work while \n     contact with the health care provider is being made.\n       (d) The cost of the certification shall be borne by the \n     employee and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the \n     time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification.\n       (e) The notice that employing offices are required to give \n     to each employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     regarding their FMLA rights and obligations as made \n     applicable by the CAA (see Sec. 825.301) shall advise the \n     employee if the employing office will require fitness-for-\n     duty certification to return to work. If the employing office \n     has a handbook explaining employment policies and benefits, \n     the handbook should explain the employing office's general \n     policy regarding any requirement for fitness-for-duty \n     certification to return to work. Specific notice shall also \n     be given to any employee from whom fitness-for-duty \n     certification will be required either at the time notice of \n     the need for leave is given or immediately after leave \n     commences and the employing office is advised of the medical \n     circumstances requiring the leave, unless the employee's \n     condition changes from one that did not previously require \n     certification pursuant to the employing office's practice or \n     policy. No second or third fitness-for-duty certification may \n     be required.\n       (f) An employing office may delay restoration to employment \n     until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty \n     certification unless the employing office has failed to \n     provide the notices required in paragraph (e) of this \n     section.\n       (g) An employing office is not entitled to certification of \n     fitness to return to duty when the employee takes \n     intermittent leave as described in Sec. 825.203.\n       (h) When an employee is unable to return to work after FMLA \n     leave because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of \n     the employee's or family member's serious health condition, \n     thereby preventing the employing office from recovering its \n     share of health benefit premium payments made on the \n     employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA leave, the \n     employing office may require medical certification of the \n     employee's or the family member's serious health condition. \n     (See Sec. 825.213(a)(3).) The cost of the certification shall \n     be borne by the employee and the employee is not entitled to \n     be paid for the time or travel costs spent in acquiring the \n     certification.\n\n     Sec. 825.311  What happens if an employee fails to satisfy \n       the medical certification and/or recertification \n       requirements?\n\n       (a) In the case of foreseeable leave, an employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave to an employee who fails \n     to provide timely certification after being requested by the \n     employing office to furnish such certification (i.e., within \n     15 calendar days, if practicable), until the required \n     certification is provided.\n       (b) When the need for leave is not foreseeable, or in the \n     case of recertification, an employee must provide \n     certification (or recertification) within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 days after the employing office's request) or as soon as \n     reasonably possible under the particular facts and \n     circumstances. In the case of a medical emergency, it may not \n     be practicable for an employee to provide the required \n     certification within 15 calendar days. If an employee fails \n     to provide a medical certification within a reasonable time \n     under the pertinent circumstances, the employing office may \n     delay the employee's continuation of FMLA leave. If the \n     employee never produces the certification, the leave is not \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) When requested by the employing office pursuant to a \n     uniformly applied policy for similarly-situated employees, \n     the employee must provide medical certification at the time \n     the employee seeks reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave \n     taken for the employee's serious health condition, that the \n     employee is fit for duty and able to return to work (see \n     Sec. 825.310(a)) if the employing office has provided the \n     required notice (see Sec. 825.301(c)); the employing office \n     may delay restoration until the certification is provided. In \n     this situation, unless the employee provides either a \n     fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification \n     for a serious health condition at the time FMLA leave is \n     concluded, the employee may be terminated. See also \n     Sec. 825.213(a)(3).\n\n     Sec. 825.312  Under what circumstances may an employing \n       office refuse to provide FMLA leave or reinstatement to \n       eligible employees?\n\n       (a) If an employee fails to give timely advance notice when \n     the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave until 30 days after the \n     date the employee provides notice to the employing office of \n     the need for FMLA leave. (See Sec. 825.302.)\n       (b) If an employee fails to provide in a timely manner a \n     requested medical certification to substantiate the need for \n     FMLA leave due to a serious health condition, an employing \n     office may delay continuation of FMLA leave until an employee \n     submits the certificate. (See Sec. Sec.  825.305 and \n     825.311.) If the employee never produces the certification, \n     the leave is not FMLA leave.\n       (c) If an employee fails to provide a requested fitness-\n     for-duty certification to return to work, an employing office \n     may delay restoration until the employee submits the \n     certificate. (See Sec. Sec.  825.310 and 825.311.)\n       (d) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Thus, an employee's rights to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration cease under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, if and when the \n     employment relationship terminates (e.g., layoff), unless \n     that relationship continues, for example, by the employee \n     remaining on paid FMLA leave. If the employee is recalled or \n     otherwise re-employed, an eligible employee is immediately \n     entitled to further FMLA leave for an FMLA-qualifying reason. \n     An employing office must be able to show, when an employee \n     requests restoration, that the employee would not otherwise \n     have been employed if leave had not been taken in order to \n     deny restoration to employment. (See Sec. 825.216.)\n       (e) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intention to return to work. (See Sec. 825.309.) If an \n     employee unequivocally advises the employing office either \n     before or during the taking of leave that the employee does \n     not intend to return to work, and the employment relationship \n     is terminated, the employee's entitlement to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration ceases unless \n     the employment relationship continues, for example, by the \n     employee remaining on paid leave. An employee may not be \n     required to take more leave than necessary to address the \n     circumstances for which leave was taken. If the employee is \n     able to return to work earlier than anticipated, the employee \n     shall provide the employing office two business days notice \n     where feasible; the employing office is required to restore \n     the employee once such notice is given, or where such prior \n     notice was not feasible.\n       (f) An employing office may deny restoration to employment, \n     but not the taking of FMLA leave and the maintenance of \n     health benefits, to an eligible employee only under the terms \n     of the ``key employee'' exemption. Denial of reinstatement \n     must be necessary to prevent ``substantial and grievous \n     economic injury'' to the employing office's operations. The \n     employing office must notify the employee of the employee's \n     status as a ``key employee'' and of the employing office's \n     intent to deny reinstatement on that basis when the employing \n     office makes these determinations. If leave has started, the \n     employee must be given a reasonable opportunity to return to \n     work after being so notified. (See Sec. 825.219.)\n       (g) An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an \n     employing office is not protected by job restoration or \n     maintenance of health benefits provisions of the FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (h) If the employing office has a uniformly-applied policy \n     governing outside or supplemental employment, such a policy \n     may continue to apply to an employee while on\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\n     FMLA leave. An employing office which does not have such a \n     policy may not deny benefits to which an employee is entitled \n     under FMLA as made applicable by the CAA on this basis unless \n     the FMLA leave was fraudulently obtained as in paragraph (g) \n     of this section.\n\n      Subpart D--What Enforcement Mechanisms Does the CAA Provide?\n\n     Sec. 825.400  What can employees do who believe that their \n       rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have \n       been violated?\n\n       (a) To commence a proceeding, a covered employee alleging a \n     violation of the rights and protections of the FMLA made \n     applicable by the CAA must request counseling by the Office \n     of Compliance not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     alleged violation. If a covered employee misses this \n     deadline, the covered employee will be unable to obtain a \n     remedy under the CAA.\n       (b) The following procedures are available under title IV \n     of the CAA for covered employees who believe that their \n     rights under FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have been \n     violated--\n       (1) counseling;\n       (2) mediation; and\n       (3) election of either--\n       (A) a formal complaint, filed with the Office of \n     Compliance, and a hearing before a hearing officer, subject \n     to review by the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and judicial review in the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or\n       (B) a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Regulations of the Office of Compliance describing and \n     governing these procedures are found at [proposed rules can \n     be found at 141 Cong. Rec. S17012 (November 14, 1995)].\n\n     Sec. 825.401  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.402  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.403  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.404  [Reserved]\n\n                         Subpart E--[Reserved]\n\n      Subpart F--What Special Rules Apply to Employees of Schools?\n\n     Sec. 825.600  To whom do the special rules apply?\n\n       (a) Certain special rules apply to employees of ``local \n     educational agencies'', including public school boards and \n     elementary schools under their jurisdiction, and private \n     elementary and secondary schools. The special rules do not \n     apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such as \n     colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.\n       (b) Educational institutions are covered by FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA (and these special rules). The usual \n     requirements for employees to be ``eligible'' apply.\n       (c) The special rules affect the taking of intermittent \n     leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the \n     end of an academic term (semester), by instructional \n     employees. ``Instructional employees'' are those whose \n     principal function is to teach and instruct students in a \n     class, a small group, or an individual setting. This term \n     includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, \n     driving instructors, and special education assistants such as \n     signers for the hearing impaired. It does not include, and \n     the special rules do not apply to, teacher assistants or \n     aides who do not have as their principal job actual teaching \n     or instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such \n     as counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists. It \n     also does not include cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, \n     or bus drivers.\n       (d) Special rules which apply to restoration to an \n     equivalent position apply to all employees of local \n     educational agencies.\n\n     Sec. 825.601  What limitations apply to the taking of \n       intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year \n     and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively \n     rather than intermittently. The period during the summer \n     vacation when the employee would not have been required to \n     report for duty is not counted against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA \n     leave at the end of the school year must be provided with any \n     benefits over the summer vacation that employees would \n     normally receive if they had been working at the end of the \n     school year.\n       (1) If an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule to \n     care for a family member, or for the employee's own serious \n     health condition, which is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for \n     more than 20 percent of the total number of working days over \n     the period the leave would extend, the employing office may \n     require the employee to choose either to:\n       (i) Take leave for a period or periods of a particular \n     duration, not greater than the duration of the planned \n     treatment; or\n       (ii) Transfer temporarily to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified, which has \n     equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates \n     recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular \n     position.\n       (2) These rules apply only to a leave involving more than \n     20 percent of the working days during the period over which \n     the leave extends. For example, if an instructional employee \n     who normally works five days each week needs to take two days \n     of FMLA leave per week over a period of several weeks, the \n     special rules would apply. Employees taking leave which \n     constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the \n     leave period would not be subject to transfer to an \n     alternative position. ``Periods of a particular duration'' \n     means a block, or blocks, of time beginning no earlier than \n     the first day for which leave is needed and ending no later \n     than the last day on which leave is needed, and may include \n     one uninterrupted period of leave.\n       (b) If an instructional employee does not give required \n     notice of foreseeable FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.302) to be \n     taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the \n     employing office may require the employee to take leave of a \n     particular duration, or to transfer temporarily to an \n     alternative position. Alternatively, the employing office may \n     require the employee to delay the taking of leave until the \n     notice provision is met. See Sec. 825.207(h).\n\n     Sec. 825.602  What limitations apply to the taking of leave \n       near the end of an academic term?\n\n       (a) There are also different rules for instructional \n     employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end \n     of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and \n     less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules \n     apply except in circumstances when:\n       (1) An instructional employee begins leave more than five \n     weeks before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) the leave will last at least three weeks, and\n       (ii) the employee would return to work during the three-\n     week period before the end of the term.\n       (2) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the five-week \n     period before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) the leave will last more than two weeks, and\n       (ii) the employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term.\n       (3) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the three-week \n     period before the end of a term, and the leave will last more \n     than five working days. The employing office may require the \n     employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term.\n        (b) For purposes of these provisions, ``academic term'' \n     means the school semester, which typically ends near the end \n     of the calendar year and the end of spring each school year. \n     In no case may a school have more than two academic terms or \n     semesters each year for purposes of FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA. An example of leave falling within these \n     provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of \n     leave to care for a family member which will begin three \n     weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the \n     employing office could require the employee to stay out on \n     leave until the end of the term.\n\n     Sec. 825.603  Is all leave taken during ``periods of a \n       particular duration'' counted against the FMLA leave \n       entitlement?\n\n       (a) If an employee chooses to take leave for ``periods of a \n     particular duration'' in the case of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave, the entire period of leave taken will count \n     as FMLA leave.\n       (b) In the case of an employee who is required to take \n     leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of \n     leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work \n     shall be charged against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. The employing office has the option not to \n     require the employee to stay on leave until the end of the \n     school term. Therefore, any additional leave required by the \n     employing office to the end of the school term is not counted \n     as FMLA leave; however, the employing office shall be \n     required to maintain the employee's group health insurance \n     and restore the employee to the same or equivalent job \n     including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.604  What special rules apply to restoration to ``an \n       equivalent position''?\n\n       The determination of how an employee is to be restored to \n     ``an equivalent position'' upon return from FMLA leave will \n     be made on the basis of ``established school board policies \n     and practices, private school policies and practices, and \n     collective bargaining agreements''. The ``established \n     policies'' and collective bargaining agreements used as a \n     basis for restoration must be in writing, must be made known \n     to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must \n     clearly explain the employee's restoration rights upon return \n     from leave. Any established policy which is used as the basis \n     for restoration of an employee to ``an equivalent position'' \n     must provide substantially the same protections as provided \n     in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, for reinstated \n     employees. See Sec. 825.215. In other words, the policy or \n     collective bargaining agreement must provide for restoration \n     to an ``equivalent position'' with equivalent employment \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     For example, an employee may not be restored to a position \n     requiring additional licensure or certification.\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\n     Subpart G--How Do Other Laws, Employing Office Practices, and \nCollective Bargaining Agreements Affect Employee Rights Under the FMLA \n                     as Made Applicable by the CAA?\n\n     Sec. 825.700  What if an employing office provides more \n       generous benefits than required by FMLA as made applicable \n       by the CAA?\n\n       (a) An employing office must observe any employment benefit \n     program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave \n     rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA. \n     Conversely, the rights established by the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, may not be diminished by any \n     employment benefit program or plan. For example, a provision \n     of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which provides for \n     reinstatement to a position that is not equivalent because of \n     seniority (e.g., provides lesser pay) is superseded by FMLA. \n     If an employing office provides greater unpaid family leave \n     rights than are afforded by FMLA, the employing office is not \n     required to extend additional rights afforded by FMLA, such \n     as maintenance of health benefits (other than through COBRA \n     or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable), to the \n     additional leave period not covered by FMLA. If an employee \n     takes paid or unpaid leave and the employing office does not \n     designate the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken does not \n     count against an employee's FMLA entitlement.\n       (b) Nothing in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     prevents an employing office from amending existing leave and \n     employee benefit programs, provided they comply with FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA. However, nothing in the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, is intended to discourage \n     employing offices from adopting or retaining more generous \n     leave policies.\n       (c) [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.701  [Reserved]\n\n     Sec. 825.702  How does FMLA affect anti-discrimination laws \n       as applied by section 201 of the CAA?\n\n       (a) Nothing in FMLA modifies or affects any applicable law \n     prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, \n     color, national origin, sex, age, or disability (e.g., title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the \n     Pregnancy Discrimination Act), as made applicable by the CAA. \n     FMLA's legislative history explains that FMLA is ``not \n     intended to modify or affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n     as amended, the regulations concerning employment which have \n     been promulgated pursuant to that statute, or the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the regulations issued \n     under that Act. Thus, the leave provisions of the [FMLA] are \n     wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations \n     of employers covered under the [ADA] * * * or the Federal \n     government itself. The purpose of the FMLA is to make leave \n     available to eligible employees and employing offices within \n     its coverage, and not to limit already existing rights and \n     protection''. S. Rep. No. 3, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1993). \n     An employing office must therefore provide leave under \n     whichever statutory provision provides the greater rights to \n     employees.\n       (b) If an employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), the employing office must make \n     reasonable accommodations, etc., barring undue hardship, in \n     accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employing \n     office must afford an employee his or her FMLA rights. ADA's \n     ``disability'' and FMLA's ``serious health condition'' are \n     different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. FMLA \n     entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 12-\n     month period, whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount \n     of leave, barring undue hardship, as a reasonable \n     accommodation. FMLA requires employing offices to maintain \n     employees' group health plan coverage during FMLA leave on \n     the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if \n     the employee had been continuously employed during the leave \n     period, whereas ADA does not require maintenance of health \n     insurance unless other employees receive health insurance \n     during leave under the same circumstances.\n       (c)(1) A reasonable accommodation under the ADA might be \n     accomplished by providing an individual with a disability \n     with a part-time job with no health benefits, assuming the \n     employing office did not ordinarily provide health insurance \n     for part-time employees. However, FMLA would permit an \n     employee to work a reduced leave schedule until the \n     equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave were used, with group \n     health benefits maintained during this period. FMLA permits \n     an employing office to temporarily transfer an employee who \n     is taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     to an alternative position, whereas the ADA allows an \n     accommodation of reassignment to an equivalent, vacant \n     position only if the employee cannot perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's present position and an \n     accommodation is not possible in the employee's present \n     position, or an accommodation in the employee's present \n     position would cause an undue hardship. The examples in the \n     following paragraphs of this section demonstrate how the two \n     laws would interact with respect to a qualified individual \n     with a disability.\n       (2) A qualified individual with a disability who is also an \n     ``eligible employee'' entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 \n     weeks of medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which \n     the employing office grants because it is not an undue \n     hardship. The employing office advises the employee that the \n     10 weeks of leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and \n     will count towards the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. \n     This designation does not prevent the parties from also \n     treating the leave as a reasonable accommodation and \n     reinstating the employee into the same job, as required by \n     the ADA, rather than an equivalent position under FMLA, if \n     that is the greater right available to the employee. At the \n     same time, the employee would be entitled under FMLA to have \n     the employing office maintain group health plan coverage \n     during the leave, as that requirement provides the greater \n     right to the employee.\n       (3) If the same employee needed to work part-time (a \n     reduced leave schedule) after returning to his or her same \n     job, the employee would still be entitled under FMLA to have \n     group health plan coverage maintained for the remainder of \n     the two-week equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, \n     notwithstanding an employing office policy that part-time \n     employees do not receive health insurance. This employee \n     would be entitled under the ADA to reasonable accommodations \n     to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of \n     the part-time position. In addition, because the employee is \n     working a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, \n     the employee would be shielded from FMLA's provision for \n     temporary assignment to a different alternative position. \n     Once the employee has exhausted his or her remaining FMLA \n     leave entitlement while working the reduced (part-time) \n     schedule, if the employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability, and if the employee is unable to return to the \n     same full-time position at that time, the employee might \n     continue to work part-time as a reasonable accommodation, \n     barring undue hardship; the employee would then be entitled \n     to only those employment benefits ordinarily provided by the \n     employing office to part-time employees.\n       (4) At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, an employing \n     office is required under FMLA to reinstate the employee in \n     the same or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay and \n     benefits, to that which the employee held when leave \n     commenced. The employing office's FMLA obligations would be \n     satisfied if the employing office offered the employee an \n     equivalent full-time position. If the employee were unable to \n     perform the essential functions of that equivalent position \n     even with reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, \n     the ADA may require the employing office to make a reasonable \n     accommodation at that time by allowing the employee to work \n     part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant \n     position, barring undue hardship.\n       (d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an employing \n     office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitlement, require an \n     employee to take a job with a reasonable accommodation. \n     However, ADA may require that an employing office offer an \n     employee the opportunity to take such a position. An \n     employing office may not change the essential functions of \n     the job in order to deny FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220(b).\n       (2) An employee may be on a workers' compensation absence \n     due to an on-the-job injury or illness which also qualifies \n     as a serious health condition under FMLA. The workers' \n     compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently \n     (subject to proper notice and designation by the employing \n     office). At some point the health care provider providing \n     medical care pursuant to the workers' compensation injury may \n     certify the employee is able to return to work in a ``light \n     duty'' position. If the employing office offers such a \n     position, the employee is permitted but not required to \n     accept the position (see Sec. 825.220(d)). As a result, the \n     employee may no longer qualify for payments from the workers' \n     compensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled to \n     continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the employee is \n     able to return to the same or equivalent job the employee \n     left or until the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement is \n     exhausted. See Sec. 825.207(d)(2). If the employee returning \n     from the workers' compensation injury is a qualified \n     individual with a disability, he or she will have rights \n     under the ADA.\n       (e) If an employing office requires certifications of an \n     employee's fitness for duty to return to work, as permitted \n     by FMLA under a uniform policy, it must comply with the ADA \n     requirement that a fitness for duty physical be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity.\n       (f) Under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \n     amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, an employing office should provide the \n     same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employing \n     office provides to other employees with short-term \n     disabilities. Because title VII does not require employees to \n     be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an \n     employee employed for less than 12 months by any employing \n     office (and, therefore, not an ``eligible'' employee under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA) may not be denied \n     maternity leave if the employing office normally provides \n     short-term disability benefits to employees with the same \n     tenure who are experiencing other short-term disabilities.\n       (g) For further information on Federal anti-discrimination \n     laws applied by section 201 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311), \n     including title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA, \n     individuals are encouraged to contact the Office of \n     Compliance.\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\n                         Subpart H--Definitions\n\n     Sec. 825.800  Definitions.\n\n       For purposes of this part:\n       ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.).\n       CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (Pub.

A \n     serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a \n     health care provider includes:\n       (A) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery \n     therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days, \n     including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity \n     relating to the same condition, that also involves:\n\n       (1) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n\n       (B) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (C) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition.

Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (E) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (2) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (1) of this \n     definition includes (but is not limited to) examinations to \n     determine if a serious health condition exists and \n     evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not \n     include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, \n     or dental examinations. Under paragraph (1)(ii)(A)(2) of \n     this definition, a regimen of continuing treatment \n     includes, for example, a course of prescription medication \n     (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special \n     equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition \n     (e.g., oxygen). A regimen of continuing treatment that \n     includes the taking of over-the-counter medications such \n     as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves; or bed-rest, \n     drinking fluids, exercise, and other similar activities \n     that can be initiated without a visit to a health care \n     provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a \n     regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of FMLA \n     leave.\n       (3) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, \n     headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia \n     problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of \n     conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious \n     health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. \n     Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or \n     removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions \n     provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. \n     Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be \n     serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of \n     this section are met.\n       (4) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (5) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (1)(ii) (B) or (C) of this definition qualify for FMLA leave \n     even though the employee or the immediate family member does \n     not receive treatment from a health care provider during the \n     absence, and even if the absence does not last more than \n     three days. For example, an employee with asthma may be \n     unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma \n     attack or because the employee's health care provider has \n     advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count \n     exceeds a certain level. An employee who is pregnant may be \n     unable to report to work because of severe morning sickness.\n       Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person \n     standing in loco parentis, who is under 18 years of age or 18 \n     years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a \n     mental or physical disability.\n       Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized \n     under State law for purposes of marriage in the State where \n     the employee resides, including common law marriage in States \n     where it is recognized.\n       State means any State of the United States or the District \n     of Columbia or any Territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n       Teacher (or employee employed in an instructional capacity, \n     or instructional employee) means an employee employed \n     principally in an instructional capacity by an educational \n     agency or school whose principal function is to teach and \n     instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual \n     setting, and includes athletic coaches, driving instructors, \n     and special education assistants such as signers for the \n     hearing impaired. The term does not include teacher \n     assistants or aides who do not have as their principal \n     function actual teaching or instructing, nor auxiliary \n     personnel such as counselors, psychologists, curriculum \n     specialists, cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, bus \n     drivers, or other primarily noninstructional employees.\n\n                   Appendix A to Part 825--[Reserved]\n\n   Appendix B to Part 825--Certification of Physician or Practitioner\n\n                 Certification of Health Care Provider\n\n    (family and medical leave act of 1993 as made applicable by the \n               congressional accountability act of 1995)\n\n       1.

You  {time}  will  {time}  will not  be required to \n     furnish medical certification of a serious health condition. \n     If required, you must furnish certification by________ \n     (insert date) (must be at least 15 days after you are \n     notified of this requirement) or we may delay the \n     commencement of your leave until the certification is \n     submitted.\n       4. You may elect to substitute accrued paid leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave. We  {time}  will  {time}  will not  \n     require that you substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid \n     FMLA leave. If paid leave will be used the following \n     conditions will apply: (Explain)\n       5(a). If you normally pay a portion of the premiums for \n     your health insurance, these payments will continue during \n     the period of FMLA leave. Arrangements for payment have been \n     discussed with you and it is agreed that you will make \n     premium payments as follows: (Set forth dates, e.g., the 10th \n     of each month, or pay periods, etc. that specifically cover \n     the agreement with the employee.).\n       (b). You have a minimum 30-day (or, indicate longer period, \n     if applicable) grace period in which to make premium \n     payments. If payment is not made timely, your group health \n     insurance may be cancelled: Provided, That we notify you in \n     writing at least 15 days before the date that your health \n     coverage will lapse, or, at our option, we may pay your share \n     of the premiums during FMLA leave, and recover these payments \n     from you upon your return to work.

We  {time}  will  {time}  will not  do the same with \n     other benefits (e.g., life insurance, disability insurance, \n     etc.) while you are on FMLA leave.

If you are a ``key employee'', restoration \n     to employment may be denied following FMLA leave on the \n     grounds that such restoration will cause substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to us.\n       (b). We  {time}  have   {time}  have not  determined that \n     restoring you to employment at the conclusion of FMLA leave \n     will cause substantial and grievous economic harm to us. \n     (Explain (a) and/or (b) below.

S501.101  Purpose and scope.\n\n         (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206 (a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to \n     covered employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     Government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSA, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n         (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n         (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations \n     with respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance has adopted pursuant to sections 203(c) \n     and 304 of the CAA, which require that the Board promulgate \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section''.\n         (d) These regulations are issued by the Board of \n     Directors, Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections 203(c) \n     and 304 of the CAA, which directs the Board to promulgate \n     regulations implementing section 203 that are ``the same as \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsection (a) [of section 203 of the CAA] except insofar as \n     the Board may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section''. The regulations issued by the Board herein are on \n     all matters for which section 203 of the CAA requires \n     regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment, based on the information available to it \n     at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, that, \n     with the exception of regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     section 203 of the CAA]''.\n         (e) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n     Sec. S501.102  Definitions.\n\n         For purposes of this chapter:\n       (a) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) FLSA or Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.), as applied by \n     section 203 of the CAA to covered employees and employing \n     offices.\n       (c) Covered employee means any employee of the Senate, \n     including an applicant for employment and a former employee, \n     but shall not include an intern.\n       (d) Employee of the Senate includes any employee whose pay \n     is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but not any such \n     individual employed by (1) the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the \n     Capitol Police; (3) the Congressional Budget Office; (4) the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the \n     Attending Physician; (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the \n     Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (e) Employing office and employer mean (1) the personal \n     office of a Senator; (2) a committee of the Senate or a joint \n     committee; or (3) any other office headed by a person with \n     the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the \n     terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the Senate.\n       (f) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (h) Intern is an individual who (a) is performing services \n     in an employing office as part of a demonstrated educational \n     plan, and (b) is appointed on a temporary basis for a period \n     not to exceed 12 months: Provided, That if an intern is \n     appointed for a period shorter than 12 months, the intern may \n     be reappointed for additional periods as long as the total \n     length of the internship does not exceed 12 months: Provided \n     further, That an intern for purposes of section 203(a)(2) of \n     the CAA also includes an individual who is a senior citizen \n     appointed under S. Res. 219 (May 5, 1978, as amended by S. \n     Res. 96, April 9, 1991), but does not include volunteers, \n     fellows or pages.\n\n     Sec. S501.103  Coverage.\n\n         The coverage of section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n\n     Sec. S501.104  Administrative authority.\n\n         (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n         (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. S501.105  Effect of Interpretation of the Department of \n       Labor.\n\n         (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutory-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). See also 29 CFR \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. See \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n     reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later \n     pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to \n     persuade, if lacking power to control'', Skidmore v. Swift, \n     323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).\n         (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the \n     substantive regulations implementing section 203 of the CAA \n     shall be ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for \n     good cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division. The Board is thus not \n     adopting such statements as part of its substantive \n     regulations.\n\n     Sec. S501.106 Application of the Portal-to-Portal Act of \n       1947.\n\n         (a) Consistent with section 225 of the CAA, the Portal-\n     to-Portal Act (PPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 216 and 251 et seq., \n     is applicable in defining and delimiting the rights and \n     protections of the FLSA that are prescribed by the CAA. \n     Section 10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 259, provides in \n     pertinent part: ``[N]o employer shall be subject to any \n     liability or punishment for or on account of the failure of \n     the employer to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation \n     under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, . . . \n     if he pleads and proves that the act of omission complained \n     of was in good faith in conformity with and reliance on any \n     written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation of [the Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n     Division of the Department of Labor] . . . or any \n     administrative practice or enforcement policy of such agency \n     with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. \n     Such a defense, if established shall be a bar to the action \n     or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or \n     omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is \n     modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority \n     to be invalid or of no legal effect''.\n         (b) In defending any action or proceeding based on any \n     act or omission arising out of section 203 of the CAA, an \n     employing office may satisfy the standards set forth in \n     subsection (a) by pleading and proving good faith reliance \n     upon any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval or interpretation, of the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division of the Department of Labor: Provided, That \n     such regulation, order, ruling approval or interpretation had \n     not been superseded at the time or reliance by any \n     regulation, order, decision, or ruling of the Board or the \n     courts.\n\n     Sec.

S531.1  Definitions.\n\n         (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary \n     of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions \n     vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n         (b) Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n\n     Sec. S531.2  Purpose and scope.\n\n         (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term ``wage'' to \n     include the ``reasonable cost'', as determined by the \n     Secretary of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee \n     with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, \n     lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by the \n     employer to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives \n     the Secretary authority to determine the ``fair value'' of \n     such facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer \n     or to groups of employers similarly situated, on average \n     value to groups of employees, or other appropriate measures \n     of ``fair value''. Whenever so determined and when applicable \n     and pertinent, the ``fair value'' of the facilities involved \n     shall be includable as part of ``wages'' instead of the \n     actual measure of the costs of those facilities. The section \n     provides, however, the cost of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities shall not be included as part of ``wages'' if \n     excluded therefrom by a bona fide collective bargaining \n     agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for \n     determining the wage of a tipped employee.\n         (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the ``reasonable cost'' and ``fair value'' of board, lodging, \n     or other facilities have general application.\n\n Subpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost'' and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     Sec. S531.3  General determinations of ``reasonable cost''.\n\n         (a) The term ``reasonable cost'' as used in section 3(m) \n     of the Act is hereby determined to be not more than the \n     actual cost to the employer of the board, lodging, or other \n     facilities customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n         (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n         (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5\\1/2\\ percent) for interest on the depreciated amount \n     of capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the \n     total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the \n     fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for \n     sale), the fair rental value (or the fair price of the \n     commodities or facilities offered for sale) shall be the \n     reasonable cost. The cost of operation and maintenance, the \n     rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital \n     invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     good accounting practices does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term depreciation includes \n     obsolescence.\n         (d)(1) The cost of furnishing ``facilities'' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n         (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative \n     rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other \n     materials and services incidental to carrying on the \n     employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and \n     for the employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their \n     laundering, where the nature of the business requires the \n     employee to wear a uniform.\n\n     Sec. S531.6  Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n         (a) The cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall \n     not be included as part of the wage paid to any employee to \n     the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona \n     fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the \n     particular employee.\n         (b) A collective bargaining agreement shall be deemed to \n     be ``bona fide'' when pursuant to the provisions of section \n     7(b)(1) or 7(b)(2) of the FLSA it is made with the certified \n     representative of the employees under the provisions of the \n     CAA.\n\n PART S541--DEFINING AND DELIMITING THE TERMS ``BONA FIDE EXECUTIVE'', \n    ``ADMINISTRATIVE'', OR ``PROFESSIONAL'' CAPACITY (INCLUDING ANY \nEMPLOYEE EMPLOYED IN THE CAPACITY OF ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL \n                    OR TEACHER IN SECONDARY SCHOOL)\n\n                     Subpart A--General Regulations\n\nSec.\nS541.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nS541.01 Application of the exemptions of section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA.\nS541.1 Executive.\nS541.2 Administrative.\nS541.3 Professional.\nS541.5b Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA as applied by \n              the CAA extend to executive, administrative, and \n              professional employees.\nS541.5d Special provisions applicable to employees of public agencies.\n\n     Sec.

In determining the \n     total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the \n     FLSA requires to be included in the regular rate at which an \n     employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums \n     paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of \n     services performed by him during a given period, which are \n     paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting \n     the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n         (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a \n     single program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan \n     or trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n\n     Sec. S547.1  Essential requirements for qualifications\n\n         (a) A ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' for the \n     purpose of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the FLSA as applied by the \n     CAA is required to meet all the standards set forth in \n     paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and must not \n     contain the disqualifying provisions set forth in \n     Sec. S547.2.\n         (b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite \n     program or arrangement in writing, adopted by the employer or \n     by contract as a result of collective bargaining and \n     communicated or made available to the employees, which is \n     established and maintained, in good faith, for the purpose of \n     encouraging voluntary thrift or savings by employees by \n     providing an incentive to employees to accumulate regularly \n     and retain cash savings for a reasonable period of time or to \n     save through the regular purchase of public or private \n     securities.\n         (c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or \n     categories of employees participating and the basis of their \n     eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n         (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n         (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total \n     earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total \n     contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount \n     saved or invested by the participating employees during that \n     year.\n         (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned \n     among the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n\n     Sec. S547.2  Disqualifying provisions\n\n         (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n         (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n         (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n   PART S553--OVERTIME COMPENSATION: PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES \n     ENGAGED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE PROTECTION; OVERTIME AND \n   COMPENSATORY TIME-OFF FOR EMPLOYEES WHOSE WORK SCHEDULE DIRECTLY \n          DEPENDS UPON THE SCHEDULE OF THE HOUSE INTRODUCTION\n\nSec.\nS553.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nS553.1  Definitions\nS553.2  Purpose and scope\n\n Subpart C--Partial Exemption for Employees Engaged in Law Enforcement \n                          and Fire Protection\n\nS553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k).\nS553.202  Limitations.\nS553.211  Law enforcement activities.\nS553.212  Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work.\nS553.213  Public agency employees engaged in both fire protection and \n              law enforcement activities.\nS553.214  Trainees.\nS553.215  Ambulance and rescue service employees.\nS553.216  Other exemptions.\nS553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined.\nS553.221  Compensable hours of work.\nS553.222  Sleep time.\nS553.223  Meal time.\nS553.224  ``Work period'' defined.\nS553.225  Early relief.\nS553.226  Training time.\nS553.227  Outside employment.\nS553.230  Maximum hours standard for work periods of 7 to 28 days--\n              section 7(k).\nS553.231  Compensatory time off.\nS553.232  Overtime pay requirements.\nS553.233  ``Regular rate'' defined.\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n     Work Schedule Directly Depends Upon the Schedule of the House\n\nS553.301  Definiton of ``directly depends''.\nS553.302  Overtime compensation and compensatory time off for an \n              employee whose work schedule directly depends upon the \n              schedule of the House.\nS553.303  Using compensatory time off.\nS553.304  Payment of overtime compensation for accrued compensatory \n              time off as of termination of service.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n     Sec.

S553.1  Definitions\n\n         (a) Act or FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938, as amended (52 Stat. 1060, as amended; 29 U.S.C. 201-\n     219), as applied by the CAA.\n         (b) 1985 Amendments means the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     Amendments of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-150).\n         (c) Public agency means an employing office as the term \n     is defined in Sec. 501.102 of this chapter, including the \n     Capitol Police.\n         (d) Section 7(k) means the provisions of Sec. 7(k) of the \n     FLSA as applied to covered employees and employing offices by \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. S553.2  Purpose and scope\n\n         The purpose of part S553 is to adopt with appropriate \n     modifications the regulations of the Secretary of Labor to \n     carry out those provisions of the FLSA relating to public \n     agency employees as they are applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices of the CAA. In particular, these \n     regulations apply section 7(k) as it relates to fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies.\n\n Subpart C--Partial Exemption for Employees Engaged in Law Enforcement \n                          and Fire Protection\n\n     Sec. S553.201  Statutory provisions: section 7(k)\n\n         Section 7(k) of the Act provides a partial overtime pay \n     exemption for fire protection and law enforcement personnel \n     (including security personnel in correctional institutions) \n     who are employed by public agencies on a work period basis. \n     This section of the Act formerly permitted public agencies to \n     pay overtime compensation to such employees in work periods \n     of 28 consecutive days only after 216 hours of work. As \n     further set forth in Sec. S553.230 of this part, the 216-hour \n     standard has been replaced, pursuant to the study mandated by \n     the statute, by 212 hours for fire protection employees and \n     171 hours for law enforcement employees. In the case of such \n     employees who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, overtime compensation is required when \n     the ratio of the number of hours worked to the number of days \n     in the work period exceeds the ratio of 212 (or 171) hours to \n     28 days.\n\n     Sec. S553.202  Limitations\n\n         The application of Sec. 7(k), by its terms, is limited to \n     public agencies, and does not apply to any private \n     organization engaged in furnishing fire protection or law \n     enforcement services. This is so even if the services are \n     provided under contract with a public agency.\n\n\n                         exemption requirements\n\n     Sec. S553.211  Law enforcement activities\n\n         (a) As used in Sec. 7(k) of the Act, the term ``any \n     employee . . . in law enforcement activities'' refers to any \n     employee (1) who is a uniformed or plainclothed member of a \n     body of officers and subordinates who are empowered by law to \n     enforce laws designed to maintain public peace and order and \n     to protect both life and property from accidental or willful \n     injury, and to prevent and detect crimes, (2) who has the \n     power to arrest, and (3) who is presently undergoing or has \n     undergone or will undergo on-the-job training and/or a course \n     of instruction and study which typically includes physical \n     training, self-defense, firearm proficiency, criminal and \n     civil law principles, investigative and law enforcement \n     techniques, community relations, medical aid and ethics.\n         (b) Employees who meet these tests are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank, or of their status as ``trainee'', ``probationary'', or \n     ``permanent'', and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities such as equipment maintenance, and lecturing, or \n     to support activities of the type described in paragraph (g) \n     of this section, whether or not such assignment is for \n     training or familiarization purposes, or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity. The term would also include \n     rescue and ambulance service personnel if such personnel form \n     an integral part of the public agency's law enforcement \n     activities. See section S553.215.\n         (c) Typically, employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities include police who are regularly employed and paid \n     as such. Other agency employees with duties not specifically \n     mentioned may, depending upon the particular facts and \n     pertinent statutory provisions in that jurisdiction, meet the \n     three tests described above. If so, they will also qualify as \n     law enforcement officers. Such employees might include, for \n     example, any law enforcement employee within the legislative \n     branch concerned with keeping public peace and order and \n     protecting life and property.\n         (d) Employees who do not meet each of the three tests \n     described above are not engaged in ``law enforcement \n     activities'' as that term is used in section 7(k). Employees \n     who normally would not meet each of these tests include:\n       (1) Building inspectors (other than those defined in \n     section S553.213(a)),\n       (2) Health inspectors,\n       (3) Sanitarians,\n       (4) Civilian traffic employees who direct vehicular and \n     pedestrian traffic at specified intersections or other \n     control points,\n       (5) Civilian parking checkers who patrol assigned areas for \n     the purpose of discovering parking violations and issuing \n     appropriate warnings or appearance notices,\n       (6) Wage and hour compliance officers,\n       (7) Equal employment opportunity compliance officers, and\n       (8) Building guards whose primary duty is to protect the \n     lives and property of persons within the limited area of the \n     building.\n         (e) The term ``any employee in law enforcement \n     activities'' also includes, by express reference, ``security \n     personnel in correctional institutions''. Typically, such \n     facilities may include precinct house lockups. Employees of \n     correctional institutions who qualify as security personnel \n     for purposes of the section 7(k) exemption are those who have \n     responsibility for controlling and maintaining custody of \n     inmates and of safeguarding them from other inmates or for \n     supervising such functions, regardless of whether their \n     duties are performed inside the correctional institution or \n     outside the institution. These employees are considered to be \n     engaged in law enforcement activities regardless of their \n     rank or of their status as ``trainee'', ``probationary'', or \n     ``permanent'', and regardless of their assignment to duties \n     incidental to the performance of their law enforcement \n     activities, or to support activities of the type described in \n     paragraph (f) of this section, whether or not such assignment \n     is for training or familiarization purposes or for reasons of \n     illness, injury or infirmity.\n         (f) Not included in the term ``employee in law \n     enforcement activities'' are the so-called ``civilian'' \n     employees of law enforcement agencies or correctional \n     institutions who engage in such support activities as those \n     performed by dispatcher, radio operators, apparatus and \n     equipment maintenance and repair workers, janitors, clerks \n     and stenographers. Nor does the term include employees in \n     correctional institutions who engage in building repair and \n     maintenance, culinary services, teaching, or in \n     psychological, medical and paramedical services. This is so \n     even though such employees may, when assigned to correctional \n     institutions, come into regular contact with the inmates in \n     the performance of their duties.\n\n     Sec. S553.212  Twenty percent limitation on nonexempt work\n\n         (a) Employees engaged in fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities as described in sections S553.210 and \n     S553.211, may also engage in some nonexempt work which is not \n     performed as an incident to or in conjunction with their fire \n     protection or law enforcement activities. For example, \n     firefighters who work for forest conservation agencies may, \n     during slack times, plant trees and perform other \n     conservation activities unrelated to their firefighting \n     duties. The performance of such nonexempt work will not \n     defeat the Sec. 7(k) exemption unless it exceeds 20 percent \n     of the total hours worked by that employee during the \n     workweek or applicable work period. A person who spends more \n     than 20 percent of his/her working time in nonexempt \n     activities is not considered to be an employee engaged in \n     fire protection or law enforcement activities for purposes of \n     this part.\n         (b) Public agency fire protection and law enforcement \n     personnel may, at their own option, undertake employment for \n     the same employer on an occasional or sporadic and part-time \n     basis in a different capacity from their regular employment. \n     The performance of such work does not affect the application \n     of the Sec. 7(k) exemption with respect to the regular \n     employment. In addition, the hours of work in the different \n     capacity need not be counted as hours worked for overtime \n     purposes on the regular job, nor are such hours counted in \n     determining the 20 percent tolerance for nonexempt work \n     discussed in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n     Sec. S553.213  Public agency employees engaged in both fire \n       protection and law enforcement activities\n\n         (a) Some public agencies have employees (often called \n     ``public safety officers'') who engage in both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, depending on the \n     agency needs at the time. This dual assignment would not \n     defeat the section 7(k) exemption: Provided, That each of the \n     activities performed meets the appropriate tests set forth in \n     sections S553.210 and S553.211. This is so regardless of how \n     the employee's time is divided between the two activities. \n     However, all time spent in nonexempt activities by public \n     safety officers within the work period, whether performed in \n     connection with fire protection or law enforcement functions, \n     or with neither, must be combined for purposes of the 20 \n     percent limitation on nonexempt work discussed in section \n     S553.212.\n         (b) As specified in section S553.230, the maximum hours \n     standards under section 7(k) are different for employees \n     engaged in fire protection and for employees engaged in law \n     enforcement. For those employees who perform both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, the applicable \n     standard is the one which applies to the activity in which \n     the employee spends the majority of work time during the work \n     period.\n\n     Sec. S553.214  Trainees\n\n         The attendance at a bona fide fire or police academy or \n     other training facility, when required by the employing \n     agency, constitutes engagement in activities under section \n     7(k) only when the employee meets all the applicable tests \n     described in section S553.210 or section S553.211 (except for \n     the power of arrest for law enforcement personnel), as the\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\n     case may be. If the applicable tests are met, then basic \n     training or advanced training is considered incidental to, \n     and part of, the employee's fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities.\n\n     Sec. S553.215  Ambulance and rescue service employees\n\n         Ambulance and rescue service employees of a public agency \n     other than a fire protection or law enforcement agency may be \n     treated as employees engaged in fire protection or law \n     enforcement activities of the type contemplated by Sec. 7(k) \n     if their services are substantially related to firefighting \n     or law enforcement activities in that (1) the ambulance and \n     rescue service employees have received training in the rescue \n     of fire, crime, and accident victims or firefighters or law \n     enforcement personnel injured in the performance of their \n     respective, duties, and (2) the ambulance and rescue service \n     employees are regularly dispatched to fires, crime scenes, \n     riots, natural disasters and accidents. As provided in \n     section S553.213(b), where employees perform both fire \n     protection and law enforcement activities, the applicable \n     standard is the one which applies to the activity in which \n     the employee spends the majority of work time during the work \n     period.\n\n     Sec. S553.216  Other exemptions\n\n         Although the 1974 Amendments to the FLSA as applied by \n     the CAA provide special exemptions for employees of public \n     agencies engaged in fire protection and law enforcement \n     activities, such workers may also be subject to other \n     exemptions in the Act, and public agencies may claim such \n     other applicable exemptions in lieu of Sec. 7(k). For \n     example, section 13(a)(1) as applied by the CAA provides a \n     complete minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for any \n     employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, \n     or professional capacity, as those terms are defined and \n     delimited in Part S541. The section 13(a)(1) exemption can be \n     claimed for any fire protection or law enforcement employee \n     who meets all of the tests specified in Part S541 relating to \n     duties, responsibilities, and salary. Thus, high ranking \n     police officials who are engaged in law enforcement \n     activities, may also, depending on the facts, qualify for the \n     section 13(a)(1) exemption as ``executive'' employees. \n     Similarly, certain criminal investigative agents may qualify \n     as ``administrative'' employees under section 13(a)(1).\n\n\n            tour of duty and compensable hours of work rules\n\n     Sec. S553.220  ``Tour of duty'' defined\n\n         (a) The term ``tour of duty'' is a unique concept \n     applicable only to employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed. This term, as used in section 7(k), \n     means the period of time during which an employee is \n     considered to be on duty for purposes of determining \n     compensable hours. It may be a scheduled or unscheduled \n     period. Such periods include ``shifts'' assigned to employees \n     often days in advance of the performance of the work. \n     Scheduled periods also include time spent in work outside the \n     ``shift'' which the public agency employer assigns. For \n     example, a police officer may be assigned to crowd control \n     during a parade or other special event outside of his or her \n     shift.\n         (b) Unscheduled periods include time spent in court by \n     police officers, time spent handling emergency situations, \n     and time spent working after a shift to complete an \n     assignment. Such time must be included in the compensable \n     tour of duty even though the specific work performed may not \n     have been assigned in advance.\n         (c) The tour of duty does not include time spent working \n     for a separate and independent employer in certain types of \n     special details as provided in section S553.227.\n\n     Sec. S553.221  Compensable hours of work\n\n         (a) The rules under the FLSA as applied by the CAA on \n     compensable hours of work are applicable to employees for \n     whom the section 7(k) exemption is claimed. Special rules for \n     sleep time (section S553.222) apply to both law enforcement \n     and firefighting employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed. Also, special rules for meal time apply \n     in the case of firefighters (section S553.223).\n         (b) Compensable hours of work generally include all of \n     the time during which an employee is on duty on the \n     employer's premises or at a prescribed workplace, as well as \n     all other time during which the employee is suffered or \n     permitted to work for the employer. Such time includes all \n     pre-shift and post-shift activities which are an integral \n     part of the employee's principal activity or which are \n     closely related to the performance of the principal activity, \n     such as attending roll call, writing up and completing \n     tickets or reports, and washing and re-racking fire hoses.\n         (c) Time spent away from the employer's premises under \n     conditions that are so circumscribed that they restrict the \n     employee from effectively using the time for personal \n     pursuits also constitutes compensable hours of work. For \n     example, where a police station must be evacuated because of \n     an electrical failure and the employees are expected to \n     remain in the vicinity and return to work after the emergency \n     has passed, the entire time spent away from the premises is \n     compensable. The employees in this example cannot use the \n     time for their personal pursuits.\n         (d) An employee who is not required to remain on the \n     employer's premises but is merely required to leave word at \n     home or with company officials where he or she may be reached \n     is not working while on call. Time spent at home on call may \n     or may not be compensable depending on whether the \n     restrictions placed on the employee preclude using the time \n     for personal pursuits. Where, for example, a firefighter has \n     returned home after the shift, with the understanding that he \n     or she is expected to return to work in the event of an \n     emergency in the night, such time spent at home is normally \n     not compensable. On the other hand, where the conditions \n     placed on the employee's activities are so restrictive that \n     the employee cannot use the time effectively for personal \n     pursuits, such time spent on call is compensable.\n         (e) Normal home to work travel is not compensable, even \n     where the employee is expected to report to work at a \n     location away from the location of the employer's premises.\n         (f) A police officer, who has completed his or her tour \n     of duty and who is given a patrol car to drive home and use \n     on personal business, is not working during the travel time \n     even where the radio must be left on so that the officer can \n     respond to emergency calls. Of course, the time spent in \n     responding to such calls is compensable.\n\n     Sec. S553.222  Sleep time\n\n         (a) Where a public agency elects to pay overtime \n     compensation to firefighters and/or law enforcement personnel \n     in accordance with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public \n     agency may exclude sleep time from hours worked if all the \n     conditions for the exclusion of such time are met.\n         (b) Where the employer has elected to use the section \n     7(k) exemption, sleep time cannot be excluded from the \n     compensable hours of work where--\n       (1) the employee is on a tour of duty of less than 24 \n     hours, and\n       (2) the employee is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 hours.\n         (c) Sleep time can be excluded from compensable hours of \n     work, however, in the case of police officers or firefighters \n     who are on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, but only if \n     there is an expressed or implied agreement between the \n     employer and the employees to exclude such time. In the \n     absence of such an agreement, the sleep time is compensable. \n     In no event shall the time excluded as sleep time exceed 8 \n     hours in a 24-hour period. If the sleep time is interrupted \n     by a call to duty, the interruption must be counted as hours \n     worked. If the sleep period is interrupted to such an extent \n     that the employee cannot get a reasonable night's sleep \n     (which, for enforcement purposes means at least 5 hours), the \n     entire time must be counted as hours of work.\n\n     Sec. S553.223  Meal time\n\n         (a) If a public agency elects to pay overtime \n     compensation to firefighters and law enforcement personnel in \n     accordance with section 7(a)(1) of the Act, the public agency \n     may exclude meal time from hours worked if all the statutory \n     tests for the exclusion of such time are met.\n         (b) If a public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption, the public agency may, in the case of law \n     enforcement personnel, exclude meal time from hours worked on \n     tours of duty of 24 hours or less: Provided, That the \n     employee is completely relieved from duty during the meal \n     period, and all the other statutory tests for the exclusion \n     of such time are met. On the other hand, where law \n     enforcement personnel are required to remain on call in \n     barracks or similar quarters, or are engaged in extended \n     surveillance activities (e.g., stakeouts), they are not \n     considered to be completely relieved from duty, and any \n     such meal periods would be compensable.\n       (c) With respect to firefighters employed under section \n     7(k), who are confined to a duty station, the legislative \n     history of the Act indicates congressional intent to mandate \n     a departure from the usual FLSA ``hours of work'' rules and \n     adoption of an overtime standard keyed to the unique concept \n     of ``tour of duty'' under which firefighters are employed. \n     Where the public agency elects to use the section 7(k) \n     exemption for firefighters, meal time cannot be excluded from \n     the compensable hours of work where (1) the firefighter is on \n     a tour of duty of less than 24 hours, and (2) where the \n     firefighter is on a tour of duty of exactly 24 hours.\n       (d) In the case of police officers or firefighters who are \n     on a tour of duty of more than 24 hours, meal time may be \n     excluded from compensable hours of work provided that the \n     statutory tests for exclusion of such hours are met.\n\n     Sec. S553.224  ``Work period'' defined\n\n       (a) As used in section 7(k), the term ``work period'' \n     refers to any established and regularly recurring period of \n     work which, under the terms of the Act and legislative \n     history, cannot be less than 7 consecutive days nor more than \n     28 consecutive days. Except for this limitation, the work \n     period can be of any length, and it need not coincide with \n     the duty cycle or pay period or with a particular day of the \n     week or hour of the day. Once the beginning and ending time \n     of an employee's work period is established, however, it \n     remains fixed regardless of how many hours are worked within \n     the period. The beginning and ending of the work period may \n     be changed: Provided, That the change is intended to be \n     permanent and is not designed to evade the overtime \n     compensation requirements of the Act.\n       (b) An employer may have one work period applicable to all \n     employees, or different work periods for different employees \n     or groups of employees.\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\n     Sec. S553.225  Early relief\n\n       It is a common practice among employees engaged in fire \n     protection activities to relieve employees on the previous \n     shift prior to the scheduled starting time. Such early relief \n     time may occur pursuant to employee agreement, either \n     expressed or implied. This practice will not have the effect \n     of increasing the number of compensable hours of work for \n     employees employed under section 7(k) where it is voluntary \n     on the part of the employees and does not result, over a \n     period of time, in their failure to receive proper \n     compensation for all hours actually worked. On the other \n     hand, if the practice is required by the employer, the time \n     involved must be added to the employee's tour of duty and \n     treated as compensable hours of work.\n\n     Sec. S553.226  Training time\n\n       (a) The general rules for determining the compensability of \n     training time under the FLSA apply to employees engaged in \n     law enforcement or fire protection activities.\n       (b) While time spent in attending training required by an \n     employer is normally considered compensable hours of work, \n     following are situations where time spent by employees in \n     required training is considered to be noncompensable:\n       (1) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required by law \n     for certification of public and private sector employees \n     within a particular governmental jurisdiction (e.g., \n     certification of public and private emergency rescue \n     workers), does not constitute compensable hours of work for \n     public employees within that jurisdiction and subordinate \n     jurisdictions.\n       (2) Attendance outside of regular working hours at \n     specialized or follow-up training, which is required for \n     certification of employees of a governmental jurisdiction by \n     law of a higher level of Government, does not constitute \n     compensable hours of work.\n       (3) Time spent in the training described in paragraphs (b) \n     (1) or (2) of this section is not compensable, even if all or \n     part of the costs of the training is borne by the employer.\n       (c) Police officers or firefighters, who are in attendance \n     at a police or fire academy or other training facility, are \n     not considered to be on duty during those times when they are \n     not in class or at a training session, if they are free to \n     use such time for personal pursuits. Such free time is not \n     compensable.\n\n     Sec. S553.227  Outside employment\n\n       (a) Section 7(p)(1) makes special provision for fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees of public agencies \n     who, at their own option, perform special duty work in fire \n     protection, law enforcement or related activities for a \n     separate and independent employer (public or private) during \n     their off-duty hours. The hours of work for the separate and \n     independent employer are not combined with the hours worked \n     for the primary public agency employer for purposes of \n     overtime compensation.\n       (b) Section 7(p)(1) applies to such outside employment \n     provided (1) the special detail work is performed solely at \n     the employee's option, and (2) the two employers are in fact \n     separate and independent.\n       (c) Whether two employers are, in fact, separate and \n     independent can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n       (d) The primary employer may facilitate the employment or \n     affect the conditions of employment of such employees. For \n     example, a police department may maintain a roster of \n     officers who wish to perform such work. The department may \n     also select the officers for special details from a list of \n     those wishing to participate, negotiate their pay, and retain \n     a fee for administrative expenses. The department may require \n     that the separate and independent employer pay the fee for \n     such services directly to the department, and establish \n     procedures for the officers to receive their pay for the \n     special details through the agency's payroll system. Finally, \n     the department may require that the officers observe their \n     normal standards of conduct during such details and take \n     disciplinary action against those who fail to do so.\n       (e) Section 7(p)(1) applies to special details even where a \n     State law or local ordinance requires that such work be \n     performed and that only law enforcement or fire protection \n     employees of a public agency in the same jurisdiction perform \n     the work. For example, a city ordinance may require the \n     presence of city police officers at a convention center \n     during concerts or sports events. If the officers perform \n     such work at their own option, the hours of work need not be \n     combined with the hours of work for their primary employer in \n     computing overtime compensation.\n       (f) The principles in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this \n     section with respect to special details of public agency fire \n     protection and law enforcement employees under section \n     7(p)(1) are exceptions to the usual rules on joint employment \n     set forth in part 791 of this title.\n       (g) Where an employee is directed by the public agency to \n     perform work for a second employer, section 7(p)(1) does not \n     apply. Thus, assignments of police officers outside of their \n     normal work hours to perform crowd control at a parade, where \n     the assignments are not solely at the option of the officers, \n     would not qualify as special details subject to this \n     exception. This would be true even if the parade organizers \n     reimburse the public agency for providing such services.\n       (h) Section 7(p)(1) does not prevent a public agency from \n     prohibiting or restricting outside employment by its \n     employees.\n\n\n                      overtime compensation rules\n\n     Sec. S553.230  Maximum hours standards for work periods of 7 \n       to 28 days--section 7(k)\n\n       (a) For those employees engaged in fire protection \n     activities who have a work period of at least 7 but less than \n     28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is required \n     under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked exceeds \n     the number of hours which bears the same relationship to 212 \n     as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (b) For those employees engaged in law enforcement \n     activities (including security personnel in correctional \n     institutions) who have a work period of at least 7 but less \n     than 28 consecutive days, no overtime compensation is \n     required under section 7(k) until the number of hours worked \n     exceeds the number of hours which bears the same relationship \n     to 171 as the number of days in the work period bears to 28.\n       (c) The ratio of 212 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in fire protection activities is 7.57 hours per day (rounded) \n     and the ratio of 171 hours to 28 days for employees engaged \n     in law enforcement activities is 6.11 hours per day \n     (rounded). Accordingly, overtime compensation (in premium pay \n     or compensatory time) is required for all hours worked in \n     excess of the following maximum hours standards (rounded to \n     the nearest whole hour):\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Maximum hours standards\n                                               -------------------------\n              Work period (days)                    Fire         Law    \n                                                 protection  enforcement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n28............................................          212          171\n27............................................          204          165\n26............................................          197          159\n25............................................          189          153\n24............................................          182          147\n23............................................          174          141\n22............................................          167          134\n21............................................          159          128\n20............................................          151          122\n19............................................          144          116\n18............................................          136          110\n17............................................          129          104\n16............................................          121           98\n15............................................          114           92\n14............................................          106           86\n13............................................           98           79\n12............................................           91           73\n11............................................           83           67\n10............................................           76           61\n9.............................................           68           55\n8.............................................           61           49\n7.............................................           53           43\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Sec. S553.231  Compensatory time off\n\n       (a) Law enforcement and fire protection employees who are \n     subject to the section 7(k) exemption may receive \n     compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay for hours \n     worked in excess of the maximum for their work period as set \n     forth in section S553.230.\n       (b) Section 7(k) permits public agencies to balance the \n     hours of work over an entire work period for law enforcement \n     and fire protection employees. For example, if a \n     firefighter's work period is 28 consecutive days, and he or \n     she works 80 hours in each of the first two weeks, but only \n     52 hours in the third week, and does not work in the fourth \n     week, no overtime compensation (in cash wages or compensatory \n     time) would be required since the total hours worked do not \n     exceed 212 for the work period. If the same firefighter had a \n     work period of only 14 days, overtime compensation or \n     compensatory time off would be due for 54 hours (160 minus \n     106 hours) in the first 14 day work period.\n\n     Sec. S553.232  Overtime pay requirements\n\n       If a public agency pays employees subject to section 7(k) \n     for overtime hours worked in cash wages rather than \n     compensatory time off, such wages must be paid at one and \n     one-half times the employees' regular rates of pay.\n\n     Sec. S553.233  ``Regular rate'' defined\n\n       The statutory rules for computing an employee's ``regular \n     rate'', for purposes of the Act's overtime pay requirements \n     are applicable to employees for whom the section 7(k) \n     exemption is claimed when overtime compensation is provided \n     in cash wages.\n\nSubpart D--Compensatory Time-off for Overtime Earned by Employees Whose \n     Work Schedule Directly Depends Upon the Schedule of the Senate\n\n     Sec. S553.301  Definition of ``directly depends''\n\n       For the purposes of this Part, a covered employee's work \n     schedule ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the Senate \n     only if the eligible employee performs work that directly \n     supports the conduct of legislative or other business in the \n     chamber and works hours that regularly change in response to \n     the schedule of the House and the Senate.\n\n     Sec. S553.302  Overtime compensation and compensatory time \n       off for an employee whose work schedule directly depends \n       upon the schedule of the Senate\n\n       No employing office shall be deemed to have violated \n     section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the protections \n     of section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (``FLSA'') to \n     covered employees and employing office, by employing any \n     employee for a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable to such employee under section 7(a) of the FLSA \n     where the employee's work schedule directly depends on the \n     schedule of the Senate within the meaning of Sec. S553.301, \n     and: (a) the employee is compensated at the rate\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\n     of time-and-a-half in pay for all hours in excess of 40 and \n     up to 60 hours in a workweek, and (b) the employee is \n     compensated at the rate of time-and-a-half in either pay or \n     in time off for all hours in excess of 60 hours in a \n     workweek.\n\n     Sec. S553.303  Using compensatory time off\n\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time off under \n     Sec. S553.302, upon his or her request, shall be permitted by \n     the employing office to use such time within a reasonable \n     period after making the request, unless the employing office \n     makes a bona fide determination that the needs of the \n     operations of the office do not allow the taking of \n     compensatory time off at the time of the request. An employee \n     may renew the request at a subsequent time. An employing \n     office may also, upon reasonable notice, require an employee \n     to use accrued compensatory time-off.\n\n     Sec. S553.304  Payment of overtime compensation for accrued \n       compensatory time off as of termination of service\n\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time authorized by \n     this regulation shall, upon termination of employment, be \n     paid for the unused compensatory time at the rate earned by \n     the employee at the time the employee receives such payment.\n\n                   PART S570--CHILD LABOR REGULATIONS\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\nSec.\nS570.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nS570.1  Definitions.\nS570.2  Minimum age standards.\n\n Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (Child \n                             Labor Reg. 3)\n\nS570.31  Determination.\nS570.32  Effect of this subpart.\nS570.33  Occupations.\nS570.35  Periods and conditions of employment.\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.

L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. 1314(c)\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     SEC. 1.1  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.\n\n       Enacted into law on January 23, 1995, the Congressional \n     Accountability Act (``CAA'') directly applies the rights and \n     protections of eleven Federal labor and employment law \n     statutes to covered employees and employing offices within \n     the legislative branch. Section 204(a) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1314(a) provides that no employing office may require \n     any covered employee (including a covered employee who does \n     not work in that employing office) to take a lie detector \n     test where such test would be prohibited if required by an \n     employer under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of section 3 of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA), 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2002 (1), (2) or (3). The purpose of this Part is to set \n     forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of section \n     204 of the CAA.\n       Subpart A contains the provisions generally applicable to \n     covered employers, including the requirements relating to the \n     prohibitions on lie detector use. Subpart B sets forth rules \n     regarding the statutory exemptions from application of \n     section 204 of the CAA. Subpart C sets forth the restrictions \n     on polygraph usage under such exemptions. Subpart D sets \n     forth the rules on recordkeeping and the disclosure of \n     polygraph test information.\n\n     SEC. 1.2  DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this part:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) EPPA means the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of \n     1988 (Pub. L. 100-347, 102 Stat. 646, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2001-2009) as applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices by section 204 of the CAA.\n       (c) The term covered employee means any employee of (1) the \n     House of Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (4) the Congressional Budget Office; (5) the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (6) the Office of the \n     Attending Physician; (7) the Office of Compliance; or (8) the \n     Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (d) The term employee includes an applicant for employment \n     and a former employee.\n       (e) The term employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       (f) The term employee of the Capitol Police includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (g) The term employee of the House of Representatives \n     includes an individual occupying a position the pay for which \n     is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (c) above.\n       (h) The term employee of the Senate includes any employee \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but \n     not any such individual employed by any entity listed in \n     subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph (c) above.\n       (i) The term employing office means (1) the personal office \n     of a Member of the House of Representatives or of a Senator; \n     (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate \n     or a joint committee; (3) any other office headed by a person \n     with the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set \n     the terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives or the Senate; or \n     (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the \n     Attending Physician, the Office of Compliance, and the Office \n     of Technology Assessment. The term employing office includes \n     any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of \n     an employing office in relation to an employee or prospective \n     employee. A polygraph examiner either employed for or whose \n     services are retained for the sole purpose of administering \n     polygraph tests ordinarily would not be deemed an employing \n     office with respect to the examinees. Any reference to \n     ``employer'' in these regulations includes employing offices.\n       (j)(1) The term lie detector means a polygraph, \n     deceptograph, voice stress analyzer, psychological stress \n     evaluator, or any other similar device (whether mechanical or \n     electrical) that is used, or the results of which are used, \n     for the purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding \n     the honesty or dishonesty of an individual. Voice stress \n     analyzers, or psychological stress evaluators, include any \n     systems that utilize voice stress analysis, whether or not an \n     opinion on honesty or dishonesty is specifically rendered.\n       (2) The term lie detector does not include medical tests \n     used to determine the presence or absence of controlled \n     substances or alcohol in bodily fluids. Also not included in \n     the definition of lie detector are written or oral tests \n     commonly referred to as ``honesty'' or ``paper and pencil'' \n     tests, machine-scored or otherwise; and graphology tests \n     commonly referred to as handwriting tests.\n       (k) The term polygraph means an instrument that--\n       (1) records continuously, visually, permanently, and \n     simultaneously changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, and \n     electrodermal patterns as minimum instrumentation standards; \n     and\n       (2) is used, or the results of which are used, for the \n     purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding the \n     honesty or dishonesty of an individual.\n       (l) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (m) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n\n     SEC. 1.3  COVERAGE.\n\n       The coverage of section 204 of the Act extends to any \n     ``covered employee'' or ``covered employing office'' without \n     regard to the number of employees or the employing office's \n     effect on interstate commerce.\n\n     SEC. 1.4  PROHIBITIONS ON LIE DETECTOR USE.\n\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA provides that, subject to the \n     exemptions of the EPPA incorporated into the CAA under \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, as set forth in section 1.10 \n     through 1.12 of this Part, employing offices are prohibited \n     from:\n       (1) Requiring, requesting, suggesting or causing, directly \n     or indirectly, any covered employee or prospective employee \n     to take or submit to a lie detector test;\n       (2) Using, accepting, or inquiring about the results of a \n     lie detector test of any covered employee or prospective \n     employee; and\n       (3) Discharging, disciplining, discriminating against, \n     denying employment or promotion, or threatening any covered \n     employee or prospective employee to take such action for \n     refusal or failure to take or submit to such test, or on the \n     basis of the results of a test.\n       The above prohibitions apply irrespective of whether the \n     covered employee referred to in paragraphs (1), (2) or (3), \n     above, works in that employing office.\n       (b) An employing office that reports a theft or other \n     incident involving economic loss to police or other law \n     enforcement authorities is not engaged in conduct subject to \n     the prohibitions under paragraph (a) of this section if, \n     during the normal course of a subsequent investigation, such \n     authorities deem it necessary to administer a polygraph test \n     to a covered employee(s) suspected of involvement in the \n     reported incident. Employing offices that cooperate with \n     police authorities during the course of their investigations \n     into criminal misconduct are likewise not deemed engaged in \n     prohibitive conduct: Provided, That such cooperation is \n     passive in nature. For example, it is not uncommon for police \n     authorities to request employees suspected of theft or \n     criminal activity to submit to a polygraph test during the \n     employee's tour of duty since, as a general rule, suspect \n     employees are often difficult to locate away from their place \n     of employment. Allowing a test on the employing office's \n     premises, releasing a covered employee during working hours \n     to take a test at police headquarters, and other similar \n     types of cooperation at the request of the police authorities \n     would not be construed as ``requiring, requesting, \n     suggesting, or causing, directly or indirectly, any covered \n     employee * * * to take or submit to a lie detector test''. \n     Cooperation of this type must be distinguished from actual \n     participation in the testing of employees suspected of \n     wrongdoing, either through the administration of a test by \n     the employing office at the request or direction of police \n     authorities, or through reimbursement by the employing office \n     of tests administered by police authorities to employees. In \n     some communities, it may be a practice of police authorities \n     to request testing by employing offices of employees before a \n     police investigation is initiated on a reported incident. In \n     other communities, police examiners are available to covered \n     employing offices, on a cost reimbursement basis, to conduct \n     tests on employees suspected by an employing office of \n     wrongdoing. All such conduct on the part of employing offices \n     is deemed within the prohibitions of section 204 of the CAA.\n       (c) The receipt by an employing office of information from \n     a polygraph test administered by police authorities pursuant \n     to an investigation is prohibited by section 3(2) of the \n     EPPA. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)\n       (d) The simulated use of a polygraph instrument so as to \n     lead an individual to believe that an actual test is being or \n     may be performed (e.g., to elicit confessions or admissions \n     of guilt) constitutes conduct prohibited by paragraph (a) of \n     this section. Such use includes the connection of a covered \n     employee or prospective employee to the instrument without \n     any intention of a diagnostic purpose, the placement of the \n     instrument in a room used for interrogation unconnected to \n     the covered employee or prospective employee, or the mere \n     suggestion that the instrument may be used during the course \n     of the interview.\n       (e) The Capitol Police may not require a covered employee \n     not employed by the Capitol Police to take a lie detector \n     test (on its own initiative or at the request of another \n     employing office) except where the Capitol Police administers \n     such lie detector test as part of an ``ongoing \n     investigation'' by the Capitol Police. For the purpose of \n     this subsection, the definition of ``ongoing investigation'' \n     contained in section 1.12(b) shall apply.\n\n     SEC. 1.5  EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS OR AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA does not preempt any otherwise \n     applicable provision of Federal law or any rule or regulation \n     of the House or Senate or any negotiated collective \n     bargaining agreement that prohibits lie detector tests or is \n     more restrictive with respect to the use of lie detector \n     tests.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n       (b)(1) This provision applies to all aspects of the use of \n     lie detector tests, including procedural safeguards, the use \n     of test results, the rights and remedies provided examinees, \n     and the rights, remedies, and responsibilities of examiners \n     and employing offices.\n       (2) For example, a collective bargaining agreement that \n     provides greater protection to an examinee would apply in \n     addition to the protection provided in section 204 of the \n     CAA.\n\n     SEC. 1.6  NOTICE OF PROTECTION.\n\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for posting, a notice \n     explaining the provisions of section 204 of the CAA. Copies \n     of such notice may be obtained from the Office of Compliance.\n\n     SEC. 1.7  AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD.\n\n       Pursuant to sections 204 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections of the EPPA. Section 204(c) directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing section 204 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsections (a) and (b) [of section 204 of the \n     CAA] except insofar as the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown . . . that a modification of such regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under this section''. The regulations issued \n     by the Board herein are on all matters for which section 204 \n     of the CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, \n     it is the Board's considered judgment, based on the \n     information available to it at the time of promulgation of \n     these regulations, that, with the exception of the \n     regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsections (a) and (b) [of section 204 of the CAA]''.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover such changes, \n     in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute an \n     interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n     SEC. 1.8  EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP.\n\n       Subject to the exemptions incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f), section 204 applies the prohibitions on the \n     use of lie detectors by employing offices with respect to \n     covered employees irrespective of whether a covered employee \n     works in that employing office. Sections 101 (3), (4) and 204 \n     of the CAA also apply EPPA prohibitions against \n     discrimination to applicants for employment and former \n     employees of a covered employing office. For example, an \n     employee may quit rather than take a lie detector test. The \n     employing office cannot discriminate or threaten to \n     discriminate in any manner against that person (such as by \n     providing bad references in the future) because of that \n     person's refusal to be tested. Similarly, an employing office \n     cannot discriminate or threaten to discriminate in any manner \n     against that person because that person files a complaint, \n     institutes a proceeding, testifies in a proceeding, or \n     exercises any right under section 204 of the CAA. (See \n     section 207 of the CAA.)\n\n                         Subpart B--Exemptions\n\n     SEC. 1.10  EXCLUSION FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE CAPITOL POLICE \n                   [RESERVED].\n\n     SEC. 1.11  EXEMPTION FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY.\n\n       (a) The exemptions allowing for the administration of lie \n     detector tests in the following paragraphs (b) through (e) of \n     this section apply only to the Federal Government; they do \n     not allow covered employing offices to administer such tests. \n     For the purposes of this section, the term ``Federal \n     Government'' means any agency or entity within the Federal \n     Government authorized to administer polygraph examinations \n     which is otherwise exempt from coverage under section 7(a) of \n     the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2006(a).\n       (b) Section 7(b)(1) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA \n     under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in the \n     EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of any \n     lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any counterintelligence function, to any \n     expert, consultant or employee of any contractor under \n     contract with the Department of Defense; or with the \n     Department of Energy, in connection with the atomic energy \n     defense activities of such Department.\n       (c) Section 7(b)(2)(A) of the EPPA, incorporated into the \n     CAA under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in \n     the EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of \n     any lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any intelligence or counterintelligence \n     function of the National Security Agency, the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, or the Central Intelligence Agency, to \n     any individual employed by, assigned to, or detailed to any \n     such agency; or any expert or consultant under contract to \n     any such agency; or any employee of a contractor to such \n     agency; or any individual applying for a position in any such \n     agency; or any individual assigned to a space where sensitive \n     cryptologic information is produced, processed, or stored for \n     any such agency.\n       (d) Section 7(b)(2)(B) of the EPPA, incorporated into the \n     CAA under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in \n     the EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of \n     any lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any intelligence or counterintelligence \n     function, to any covered employee whose duties involve access \n     to information that has been classified at the level of top \n     secret or designated as being within a special access program \n     under section 4.2 (a) of Executive Order 12356 (or a \n     successor Executive order).\n       (c) Counterintelligence for purposes of the above \n     paragraphs means information gathered and activities \n     conducted to protect against espionage and other clandestine \n     intelligence activities, sabotage, terrorist activities, or \n     assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign \n     governments, or foreign or domestic organizations or persons.\n       (d) Lie detector tests of persons described in the above \n     paragraphs will be administered in accordance with applicable \n     Department of Defense directives and regulations, or other \n     regulations and directives governing the use of such tests by \n     the United States Government, as applicable.\n\n     SEC. 1.12  EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYING OFFICES CONDUCTING \n                   INVESTIGATIONS OF ECONOMIC LOSS OR INJURY.\n\n       (a) Section 7(d) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA \n     under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides a limited exemption \n     from the general prohibition on lie detector use for \n     employers conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss \n     or injury to the employer's business. An employing office may \n     request an employee, subject to the conditions set forth in \n     sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and sections 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.35 of this part, to submit to a \n     polygraph test, but no other type of lie detector test, only \n     if--\n       (1) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation involving economic loss or injury to the \n     employing office's operations, such as theft, embezzlement, \n     misappropriation or an act of unlawful industrial espionage \n     or sabotage;\n       (2) The employee had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation;\n       (3) The employing office has a reasonable suspicion that \n     the employee was involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation;\n       (4) The employing office provides the examinee with a \n     statement, in a language understood by the examinee, prior to \n     the test which fully explains with particularity the specific \n     incident or activity being investigated and the basis for \n     testing particular employees and which contains, at a \n     minimum:\n       (i) An identification with particularity of the specific \n     economic loss or injury to the operations of the employing \n     office;\n       (ii) A description of the employee's access to the property \n     that is the subject of the investigation;\n       (iii) A description in detail of the basis of the employing \n     office's reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved \n     in the incident or activity under investigation; and\n       (iv) Signature of a person (other than a polygraph \n     examiner) authorized to legally bind the employing office; \n     and\n       (5) The employing office retains a copy of the statement \n     and proof of service described in paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section for at least 3 years.\n       (b) For the exemption to apply, the condition of an \n     ``ongoing investigation'' must be met. As used in section \n     7(d) of the EPPA, the ongoing investigation must be of a \n     specific incident or activity. Thus, for example, an \n     employing office may not request that an employee or \n     employees submit to a polygraph test in an effort to \n     determine whether or not any thefts have occurred. Such \n     random testing by an employing office is precluded by the \n     EPPA. Further, because the exemption is limited to a specific \n     incident or activity, an employing office is precluded from \n     using the exemption in situations where the so-called \n     ``ongoing investigation'' is continuous. For example, the \n     fact that items are frequently missing would not be a \n     sufficient basis, standing alone, for administering a \n     polygraph test. Even if the employing office can establish \n     that unusually high amounts of property are missing in a \n     given month, this, in and of itself, would not be a \n     sufficient basis to meet the specific incident requirement. \n     On the other hand, polygraph testing in response to missing \n     property would be permitted where additional evidence is \n     obtained through subsequent investigation of specific items \n     missing through intentional wrongdoing, and a reasonable \n     suspicion that the employee to be polygraphed was involved in \n     the incident under investigation. Administering a polygraph \n     test in circumstances where the missing property is merely \n     unspecified, statistical shortages, without identification of \n     a specific incident or activity that produced the missing \n     property and a ``reasonable suspicion that the employee was \n     involved'', would amount to little more than a fishing \n     expedition and is prohibited by the EPPA as applied to \n     covered employees and employing offices by the CAA.\n       (c)(1)(i) The terms economic loss or injury to the \n     employing office's operations include both direct and \n     indirect economic loss or injury.\n       (ii) Direct loss or injury includes losses or injuries \n     resulting from theft, embezzlement,\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\n     misappropriation, espionage or sabotage. These examples, \n     cited in the EPPA, are intended to be illustrative and not \n     exhaustive. Another specific incident which would constitute \n     direct economic loss or injury is the misappropriation of \n     confidential or trade secret information.\n       (iii) Indirect loss or injury includes the use of an \n     employing office's operations to commit a crime, such as \n     check-kiting or money laundering. In such cases, the ongoing \n     investigation must be limited to criminal activity that has \n     already occurred, and to use of the employing office's \n     operations (and not simply the use of the premises) for such \n     activity. For example, the use of an employing office's \n     vehicles, warehouses, computers or equipment to smuggle or \n     facilitate the importing of illegal substances constitutes an \n     indirect loss or injury to the employing office's business \n     operations. Conversely, the mere fact that an illegal act \n     occurs on the employing office's premises (such as a drug \n     transaction that takes place in the employing office's \n     parking lot or rest room) does not constitute an indirect \n     economic loss or injury to the employing office.\n       (iv) Indirect loss or injury also includes theft or injury \n     to property of another for which the employing office \n     exercises fiduciary, managerial or security responsibility, \n     or where the office has custody of the property (but not \n     property of other offices to which the employees have access \n     by virtue of the employment relationship). For example, if a \n     maintenance employee of the manager of an apartment building \n     steals jewelry from a tenant's apartment, the theft results \n     in an indirect economic loss or injury to the employer \n     because of the manager's management responsibility with \n     respect to the tenant's apartment. A messenger on a delivery \n     of confidential business reports for a client firm who steals \n     the reports causes an indirect economic loss or injury to the \n     messenger service because the messenger service is custodian \n     of the client firm's reports, and therefore is responsible \n     for their security. Similarly, the theft of property \n     protected by a security service employer is considered an \n     economic loss or injury to that employer.\n       (v) A theft or injury to a client firm does not constitute \n     an indirect loss or injury to an employing office unless that \n     employing office has custody of, or management, or security \n     responsibility for, the property of the client that was lost \n     or stolen or injured. For example, a cleaning contractor has \n     no responsibility for the money at a client bank. If money is \n     stolen from the bank by one of the cleaning contractor's \n     employees, the cleaning contractor does not suffer an \n     indirect loss or injury.\n       (vi) Indirect loss or injury does not include loss or \n     injury which is merely threatened or potential, e.g., a \n     threatened or potential loss of an advantageous business \n     relationship.\n       (2) Economic losses or injuries which are the result of \n     unintentional or lawful conduct would not serve as a basis \n     for the administration of a polygraph test. Thus, apparently \n     unintentional losses or injuries stemming from truck, car, \n     workplace, or other similar type accidents or routine \n     inventory or cash register shortages would not meet the \n     economic loss or injury requirement. Any economic loss \n     incident to lawful union or employee activity also would not \n     satisfy this requirement.\n       (3) It is the operations of the employing office which must \n     suffer the economic loss or injury. Thus, a theft committed \n     by one employee against another employee of the same \n     employing office would not satisfy the requirement.\n       (d) While nothing in the EPPA as applied by the CAA \n     prohibits the use of medical tests to determine the presence \n     of controlled substances or alcohol in bodily fluids, the \n     section 7(d) exemption of the EPPA does not permit the use of \n     a polygraph test to learn whether an employee has used drugs \n     or alcohol, even where such possible use may have contributed \n     to an economic loss to the employing office (e.g., an \n     accident involving an employing office's vehicle).\n       (e) Section 7(d)(2) of the EPPA provides that, as a \n     condition for the use of the exemption, the employee must \n     have had access to the property that is the subject of the \n     investigation.\n       (1) The word access, as used in section 7(d)(2), refers to \n     the opportunity which an employee had to cause, or to aid or \n     abet in causing, the specific economic loss or injury under \n     investigation. The term ``access'', thus, includes more than \n     direct or physical contact during the course of employment. \n     For example, as a general matter, all employees working in or \n     with authority to enter a property storage area have \n     ``access'' to unsecured property in the area. All employees \n     with the combination to a safe have ``access'' to the \n     property in a locked safe. Employees also have ``access'' who \n     have the ability to divert possession or otherwise affect the \n     disposition of the property that is the subject of \n     investigation. For example, a bookkeeper in a jewelry store \n     with access to inventory records may aid or abet a clerk who \n     steals an expensive watch by removing the watch from the \n     employing office's inventory records. In such a situation, it \n     is clear that the bookkeeper effectively has ``access'' to \n     the property that is the subject of the investigation.\n       (2) As used in section 7(d)(2), property refers to \n     specifically identifiable property, but also includes such \n     things of value as security codes and computer data, and \n     proprietary, financial or technical information, such as \n     trade secrets, which by its availability to competitors or \n     others would cause economic harm to the employing office.\n       (f)(1) As used in section 7(d)(3), the term reasonable \n     suspicion refers to an observable, articulable basis in fact \n     which indicates that a particular employee was involved in, \n     or responsible for, an economic loss. Access in the sense of \n     possible or potential opportunity, standing alone, does not \n     constitute a basis for ``reasonable suspicion''. Information \n     from a co-worker, or an employee's behavior, demeanor, or \n     conduct may be factors in the basis for reasonable suspicion. \n     Likewise, inconsistencies between facts, claims, or \n     statements that surface during an investigation can serve as \n     a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion. While access or \n     opportunity, standing alone, does not constitute a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion, the totality of circumstances \n     surrounding the access or opportunity (such as its \n     unauthorized or unusual nature or the fact that access was \n     limited to a single individual) may constitute a factor in \n     determining whether there is a reasonable suspicion.\n       (2) For example, in an investigation of a theft of an \n     expensive piece of jewelry, an employee authorized to open \n     the establishment's safe no earlier than 9 a.m., in order to \n     place the jewelry in a window display case, is observed \n     opening the safe at 7:30 a.m. In such a situation, the \n     opening of the safe by the employee one and one-half hours \n     prior to the specified time may serve as the basis for \n     reasonable suspicion. On the other hand, in the example \n     given, if the employee is asked to bring the piece of jewelry \n     to his or her office at 7:30 a.m., and the employee then \n     opened the safe and reported the jewelry missing, such \n     access, standing alone, would not constitute a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved in the \n     incident unless access to the safe was limited solely to the \n     employee. If no one other than the employee possessed the \n     combination to the safe, and all other possible explanations \n     for the loss are ruled out, such as a break-in, a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion may be formulated based on sole access \n     by one employee.\n       (3) The employing office has the burden of establishing \n     that the specific individual or individuals to be tested are \n     ``reasonably suspected'' of involvement in the specific \n     economic loss or injury for the requirement in section \n     7(d)(3) of the EPPA to be met.\n       (g)(1) As discussed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, \n     section 7(d)(4) of the EPPA sets forth what information, at a \n     minimum, must be provided to an employee if the employing \n     office wishes to claim the exemption.\n       (2) The statement required under paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section must be received by the employee at least 48 hours, \n     excluding weekend days and holidays, prior to the time of the \n     examination. The statement must set forth the time and date \n     of receipt by the employee and be verified by the employee's \n     signature. This will provide the employee with adequate pre-\n     test notice of the specific incident or activity being \n     investigated and afford the employee sufficient time prior to \n     the test to obtain and consult with legal counsel or an \n     employee representative.\n       (3) The statement to be provided to the employee must set \n     forth with particularity the specific incident or activity \n     being investigated and the basis for testing particular \n     employees. Section 7(d)(4)(A) of the EPPA requires \n     specificity beyond the mere assertion of general statements \n     regarding economic loss, employee access, and reasonable \n     suspicion. For example, an employing office's assertion that \n     an expensive watch was stolen, and that the employee had \n     access to the watch and is therefore a suspect, would not \n     meet the ``with particularity'' criterion. If the basis for \n     an employing office's requesting an employee (or employees) \n     to take a polygraph test is not articulated with \n     particularity, and reduced to writing, then the standard is \n     not met. The identity of a co-worker or other individual \n     providing information used to establish reasonable suspicion \n     need not be revealed in the statement.\n       (4) It is further required that the statement provided to \n     the examinee be signed by the employing office, or an \n     employee or other representative of the employing office with \n     authority to legally bind the employing office. The person \n     signing the statement must not be a polygraph examiner unless \n     the examiner is acting solely in the capacity of an employing \n     office with respect to his or her own employees and does not \n     conduct the examination. The standard would not be met, and \n     the exemption would not apply if the person signing the \n     statement is not authorized to legally bind the employing \n     office.\n       (h) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in sections 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employing office to \n     remedial actions, as provided for in section 6(c) of the \n     EPPA.\n\n     SEC. 1.13  EXEMPTION OF EMPLOYING OFFICES AUTHORIZED TO \n                   MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, OR DISPENSE CONTROLLED \n                   SUBSTANCES.\n\n       (a) Section 7(f) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, provides an exemption from the \n     EPPA's general prohibition regarding the use of polygraph \n     tests for employers authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense a controlled substance listed in schedule I, II, \n     III, or IV of\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\n     section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 812). This exemption permits the administration of \n     polygraph tests, subject to the conditions set forth in \n     sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and sections 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, 1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part, to:\n       (1) A prospective employee who would have direct access to \n     the manufacture, storage, distribution, or sale of any such \n     controlled substance; or\n       (2) A current employee if the following conditions are met:\n       (i) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation of criminal or other misconduct involving, or \n     potentially involving, loss or injury to the manufacture, \n     distribution, or dispensing of any such controlled substance \n     by such employing office; and\n       (ii) The employee had access to the person or property that \n     is the subject of the investigation.\n        (b)(1) The terms manufacture, distribute, distribution, \n     dispense, storage, and sale, for the purposes of this \n     exemption, are construed within the meaning of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812 et seq.), as administered \n     by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), United States \n     Department of Justice.\n       (2) The exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA applies only \n     to employing offices that are authorized by DEA to \n     manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance. \n     Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 812) requires every person who manufactures, \n     distributes, or dispenses any controlled substance to \n     register with the Attorney General (i.e., with DEA). Common \n     or contract carriers and warehouses whose possession of the \n     controlled substance is in the usual course of their business \n     or employment are not required to register. Truck drivers and \n     warehouse employees of the persons or entities registered \n     with DEA and authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense controlled substances, are within the scope of the \n     exemption where they have direct access or access to the \n     controlled substances, as discussed below.\n       (c) In order for a polygraph examination to be performed, \n     section 7(f) of the Act requires that a prospective employee \n     have ``direct access'' to the controlled substance(s) \n     manufactured, dispensed, or distributed by the employing \n     office. Where a current employee is to be tested as a part of \n     an ongoing investigation, section 7(f) requires that the \n     employee have ``access'' to the person or property that is \n     the subject of the investigation.\n       (1) A prospective employee would have ``direct access'' if \n     the position being applied for has responsibilities which \n     include contact with or which affect the disposition of a \n     controlled substance, including participation in the process \n     of obtaining, dispensing, or otherwise distributing a \n     controlled substance. This includes contact or direct \n     involvement in the manufacture, storage, testing, \n     distribution, sale or dispensing of a controlled substance \n     and may include, for example, packaging, repackaging, \n     ordering, licensing, shipping, receiving, taking inventory, \n     providing security, prescribing, and handling of a controlled \n     substance. A prospective employee would have ``direct \n     access'' if the described job duties would give such person \n     access to the products in question, whether such employee \n     would be in physical proximity to controlled substances or \n     engaged in activity which would permit the employee to divert \n     such substances to his or her possession.\n       (2) A current employee would have ``access'' within the \n     meaning of section 7(f) if the employee had access to the \n     specific person or property which is the subject of the on-\n     going investigation, as discussed in section 1.12(e) of this \n     part. Thus, to test a current employee, the employee need not \n     have had ``direct'' access to the controlled substance, but \n     may have had only infrequent, random, or opportunistic \n     access. Such access would be sufficient to test the employee \n     if the employee could have caused, or could have aided or \n     abetted in causing, the loss of the specific property which \n     is the subject of the investigation. For example, a \n     maintenance worker in a drug warehouse, whose job duties \n     include the cleaning of areas where the controlled substances \n     which are the subject of the investigation were present, but \n     whose job duties do not include the handling of controlled \n     substances, would be deemed to have ``access'', but normally \n     not ``direct access'', to the controlled substances. On the \n     other hand, a drug warehouse truck loader, whose job duties \n     include the handling of outgoing shipment orders which \n     contain controlled substances, would have ``direct access'' \n     to such controlled substances. A pharmacy department in a \n     supermarket is another common situation which is useful in \n     illustrating the distinction between ``direct access'' and \n     ``access''. Store personnel receiving pharmaceutical orders, \n     i.e., the pharmacist, pharmacy intern, and other such \n     employees working in the pharmacy department, would \n     ordinarily have ``direct access'' to controlled substances. \n     Other store personnel whose job duties and responsibilities \n     do not include the handling of controlled substances but who \n     had occasion to enter the pharmacy department where the \n     controlled substances which are the subject of the \n     investigation were stored, such as maintenance personnel or \n     pharmacy cashiers, would have ``access''. Certain other store \n     personnel whose job duties do not permit or require entrance \n     into the pharmacy department for any reason, such as produce \n     or meat clerks, checkout cashiers, or baggers, would not \n     ordinarily have ``access''. However, any current employee, \n     regardless of described job duties, may be polygraphed if the \n     employing office's investigation of criminal or other \n     misconduct discloses that such employee in fact took action \n     to obtain ``access'' to the person or property that is the \n     subject of the investigation--e.g., by actually entering the \n     drug storage area in violation of company rules. In the case \n     of ``direct access'', the prospective employee's access to \n     controlled substances would be as a part of the \n     manufacturing, dispensing or distribution process, while a \n     current employee's ``access'' to the controlled substances \n     which are the subject of the investigation need only be \n     opportunistic.\n       (d) The term prospective employee, for the purposes of this \n     section, includes a current employee who presently holds a \n     position which does not entail direct access to controlled \n     substances, and therefore is outside the scope of the \n     exemption's provisions for preemployment polygraph testing, \n     provided the employee has applied for and is being considered \n     for transfer or promotion to another position which entails \n     such direct access. For example, an office secretary may \n     apply for promotion to a position in the vault or cage areas \n     of a drug warehouse, where controlled substances are kept. In \n     such a situation, the current employee would be deemed a \n     ``prospective employee'' for the purposes of this exemption, \n     and thus could be subject to preemployment polygraph \n     screening, prior to such a change in position. However, any \n     adverse action which is based in part on a polygraph test \n     against a current employee who is considered a ``prospective \n     employee'' for purposes of this section may be taken only \n     with respect to the prospective position and may not affect \n     the employee's employment in the current position.\n       (e) Section 7(f) of the EPPA, as applied by the CAA, makes \n     no specific reference to a requirement that employing offices \n     provide current employees with a written statement prior to \n     polygraph testing. Thus, employing offices to whom this \n     exemption is available are not required to furnish a written \n     statement such as that specified in section 7(d) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.12(a)(4) of this part.\n       (f) For the section 7(f) exemption to apply, the polygraph \n     testing of current employees must be administered in \n     connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal or other \n     misconduct involving, or potentially involving, loss or \n     injury to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of any \n     such controlled substance by such employing office.\n       (1) Current employees may only be administered polygraph \n     tests in connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal \n     or other misconduct, relating to a specific incident or \n     activity, or potential incident or activity. Thus, an \n     employing office is precluded from using the exemption in \n     connection with continuing investigations or on a random \n     basis to determine if thefts are occurring. However, unlike \n     the exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for employing \n     offices conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss or \n     injury, the section 7(f) exemption includes ongoing \n     investigations of misconduct involving potential drug losses. \n     Nor does the latter exemption include the requirement for \n     ``reasonable suspicion'' contained in the section 7(d) \n     exemption. Thus, a drug store operator is permitted to \n     polygraph all current employees who have access to a \n     controlled substance stolen from the inventory, or where \n     there is evidence that such a theft is planned. Polygraph \n     testing based on an inventory shortage of the drug during a \n     particular accounting period would not be permitted unless \n     there is extrinsic evidence of misconduct.\n       (2) In addition, the test must be administered in \n     connection with loss or injury, or potential loss or injury, \n     to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of a \n     controlled substance.\n       (i) Retail drugstores and wholesale drug warehouses \n     typically carry inventory of so-called health and beauty \n     aids, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, and a variety of \n     other similar products, in addition to their product lines of \n     controlled drugs. The noncontrolled products usually \n     constitute the majority of such firms' sales volumes. An \n     economic loss or injury related to such noncontrolled \n     substances would not constitute a basis of applicability of \n     the section 7(f) exemption. For example, an investigation \n     into the theft of a gross of cosmetic products could not be a \n     basis for polygraph testing under section 7(f), but the theft \n     of a container of valium could be.\n       (ii) Polygraph testing, with respect to an ongoing \n     investigation concerning products other than controlled \n     substances might be initiated under section 7(d) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.12 of this part. However, the exemption in \n     section 7(f) of the EPPA and this section is limited solely \n     to losses or injury associated with controlled substances.\n       (g) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in sections 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employing office to \n     the remedies authorized in section 204 of the CAA. The \n     administration of such tests is also subject to collective \n     bargaining agreements, which may either prohibit lie detector \n     tests, or\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\n     contain more restrictive provisions with respect to polygraph \n     testing.\n\n      Subpart C--Restrictions on Polygraph Usage Under Exemptions\n\n     SEC. 1.20  ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION UNDER ONGOING \n                   INVESTIGATION EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Section 8(a)(1) of the EPPA provides that the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA and section 1.12 of \n     this part for ongoing investigations shall not apply if an \n     employing office discharges, disciplines, denies employment \n     or promotion or otherwise discriminates in any manner against \n     a current employee based upon the analysis of a polygraph \n     test chart or the refusal to take a polygraph test, without \n     additional supporting evidence.\n       (b) ``Additional supporting evidence'', for purposes of \n     section 8(a) of the EPPA, includes, but is not limited to, \n     the following:\n       (1)(i) Evidence indicating that the employee had access to \n     the missing or damaged property that is the subject of an \n     ongoing investigation; and\n       (ii) Evidence leading to the employing office's reasonable \n     suspicion that the employee was involved in the incident or \n     activity under investigation; or\n       (2) Admissions or statements made by an employee before, \n     during or following a polygraph examination.\n       (c) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with additional supporting evidence, \n     unless the employing office observes all the requirements \n     of sections 7(d) and 8(b) of the EPPA, as applied by the \n     CAA and described in sections 1.12, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and \n     1.25 of this part.\n\n     SEC. 1.21 ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION UNDER CONTROLLED \n                   SUBSTANCE EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Section 8(a)(2) of the EPPA provides that the \n     controlled substance exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.13 of this part shall not apply if an employing \n     office discharges, disciplines, denies employment or \n     promotion, or otherwise discriminates in any manner against a \n     current employee or prospective employee based solely on the \n     analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusal to take a \n     polygraph test.\n       (b) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may serve as one basis for adverse employment \n     actions of the type described in paragraph (a) of this \n     section: Provided, That the adverse action was also based on \n     another bona fide reason, with supporting evidence therefor. \n     For example, traditional factors such as prior employment \n     experience, education, job performance, etc. may be used as a \n     basis for employment decisions. Employment decisions based on \n     admissions or statements made by an employee or prospective \n     employee before, during or following a polygraph examination \n     may, likewise, serve as a basis for such decisions.\n       (c) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusal to \n     take a polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with another legitimate basis for \n     such action, unless the employing office observes all the \n     requirements of section 7(f) of the EPPA, as appropriate, and \n     section 8(b) of the EPPA, as described in sections 1.13, \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 of this part.\n\n     SEC. 1.22 RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--GENERAL.\n\n       (a) Pursuant to section 8(b) of the EPPA, the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations (described in sections 1.12 and 1.13 of this \n     part) shall not apply unless all of the requirements set \n     forth in this section and sections 1.23 through 1.25 of this \n     part are met.\n       (b) During all phases of the polygraph testing the person \n     being examined has the following rights:\n       (1) The examinee may terminate the test at any time.\n       (2) The examinee may not be asked any questions in a \n     degrading or unnecessarily intrusive manner.\n       (3) The examinee may not be asked any questions dealing \n     with:\n       (i) Religious beliefs or affiliations;\n       (ii) Beliefs or opinions regarding racial matters;\n       (iii) Political beliefs or affiliations;\n       (iv) Sexual preferences or behavior; or\n       (v) Beliefs, affiliations, opinions, or lawful activities \n     concerning unions or labor organizations.\n       (4) The examinee may not be subjected to a test when there \n     is sufficient written evidence by a physician that the \n     examinee is suffering from any medical or psychological \n     condition or undergoing any treatment that might cause \n     abnormal responses during the actual testing phase. \n     ``Sufficient written evidence'' shall constitute, at a \n     minimum, a statement by a physician specifically describing \n     the examinee's medical or psychological condition or \n     treatment and the basis for the physician's opinion that the \n     condition or treatment might result in such abnormal \n     responses.\n       (5) An employee or prospective employee who exercises the \n     right to terminate the test, or who for medical reasons with \n     sufficient supporting evidence is not administered the test, \n     shall be subject to adverse employment action only on the \n     same basis as one who refuses to take a polygraph test, as \n     described in sections 1.20 and 1.21 of this part.\n       (c) Any polygraph examination shall consist of one or more \n     pretest phases, actual testing phases, and post-test phases, \n     which must be conducted in accordance with the rights of \n     examinees described in sections 1.23 through 1.25 of this \n     part.\n\n     SEC. 1.23 RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--PRETEST PHASE.\n\n       (a) The pretest phase consists of the questioning and other \n     preparation of the prospective examinee before the actual use \n     of the polygraph instrument. During the initial pretest \n     phase, the examinee must be:\n       (1) Provided with written notice, in a language understood \n     by the examinee, as to when and where the examination will \n     take place and that the examinee has the right to consult \n     with counsel or an employee representative before each phase \n     of the test. Such notice shall be received by the examinee at \n     least forty-eight hours, excluding weekend days and holidays, \n     before the time of the examination, except that a prospective \n     employee may, at the employee's option, give written consent \n     to administration of a test anytime within 48 hours but no \n     earlier than 24 hours after receipt of the written notice. \n     The written notice or proof of service must set forth the \n     time and date of receipt by the employee or prospective \n     employee and be verified by his or her signature. The purpose \n     of this requirement is to provide a sufficient opportunity \n     prior to the examination for the examinee to consult with \n     counsel or an employee representative. Provision shall also \n     be made for a convenient place on the premises where the \n     examination will take place at which the examinee may consult \n     privately with an attorney or an employee representative \n     before each phase of the test. The attorney or representative \n     may be excluded from the room where the examination is \n     administered during the actual testing phase.\n       (2) Informed orally and in writing of the nature and \n     characteristics of the polygraph instrument and examination, \n     including an explanation of the physical operation of the \n     polygraph instrument and the procedure used during the \n     examination.\n       (3) Provided with a written notice prior to the testing \n     phase, in a language understood by the examinee, which shall \n     be read to and signed by the examinee. Use of Appendix A to \n     this part, if properly completed, will constitute compliance \n     with the contents of the notice requirement of this \n     paragraph. If a format other than in Appendix A is used, it \n     must contain at least the following information:\n       (i) Whether or not the polygraph examination area contains \n     a two-way mirror, a camera, or other device through which the \n     examinee may be observed;\n       (ii) Whether or not any other device, such as those used in \n     conversation or recording will be used during the \n     examination;\n       (iii) That both the examinee and the employing office have \n     the right, with the other's knowledge, to make a recording of \n     the entire examination;\n       (iv) That the examinee has the right to terminate the test \n     at any time;\n       (v) That the examinee has the right, and will be given the \n     opportunity, to review all questions to be asked during the \n     test;\n       (vi) That the examinee may not be asked questions in a \n     manner which degrades, or needlessly intrudes;\n       (vii) That the examinee may not be asked any questions \n     concerning religious beliefs or opinions; beliefs regarding \n     racial matters; political beliefs or affiliations; matters \n     relating to sexual behavior; beliefs, affiliations, opinions, \n     or lawful activities regarding unions or labor organizations;\n       (viii) That the test may not be conducted if there is \n     sufficient written evidence by a physician that the examinee \n     is suffering from a medical or psychological condition or \n     undergoing treatment that might cause abnormal responses \n     during the examination;\n       (ix) That the test is not and cannot be required as a \n     condition of employment;\n       (x) That the employing office may not discharge, dismiss, \n     discipline, deny employment or promotion, or otherwise \n     discriminate against the examinee based on the analysis of a \n     polygraph test, or based on the examinee's refusal to take \n     such a test, without additional evidence which would support \n     such action;\n       (xi)(A) In connection with an ongoing investigation, that \n     the additional evidence required for the employing office to \n     take adverse action against the examinee, including \n     termination, may be evidence that the examinee had access to \n     the property that is the subject of the investigation, \n     together with evidence supporting the employing office's \n     reasonable suspicion that the examinee was involved in the \n     incident or activity under investigation;\n       (B) That any statement made by the examinee before or \n     during the test may serve as additional supporting evidence \n     for an adverse employment action, as described in paragraph \n     (a)(3)(x) of this section, and that any admission of criminal \n     conduct by the examinee may be transmitted to an appropriate \n     Government law enforcement agency;\n       (xii) That information acquired from a polygraph test may \n     be disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n       (A) To the examinee or any other person specifically \n     designated in writing by the examinee to receive such \n     information;\n       (B) To the employing office that requested the test;\n       (C) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or \n     mediator pursuant to a court order;\n       (D) By the employing office, to an appropriate governmental \n     agency without a court\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\n     order where, and only insofar as, the information disclosed \n     is an admission of criminal conduct;\n       (xiii) That if any of the examinee's rights or protections \n     under the law are violated, the examinee has the right to \n     take action against the employing office under sections 401-\n     404 of the CAA. Employing offices that violate this law are \n     liable to the affected examinee, who may recover such legal \n     or equitable relief as may be appropriate, including, but not \n     limited to, employment, reinstatement, and promotion, payment \n     of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable costs, including \n     attorney's fees;\n       (xiv) That the examinee has the right to obtain and consult \n     with legal counsel or other representative before each phase \n     of the test, although the legal counsel or representative may \n     be excluded from the room where the test is administered \n     during the actual testing phase.\n       (xv) That the employee's rights under the CAA may not be \n     waived, either voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or \n     otherwise, except as part of a written settlement to a \n     pending action or complaint under the CAA, agreed to and \n     signed by the parties.\n       (b) During the initial or any subsequent pretest phases, \n     the examinee must be given the opportunity, prior to the \n     actual testing phase, to review all questions in writing that \n     the examiner will ask during each testing phase. Such \n     questions may be presented at any point in time prior to the \n     testing phase.\n\n     SEC. 1.24  RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--ACTUAL TESTING PHASE.\n\n       (a) The actual testing phase refers to that time during \n     which the examiner administers the examination by using a \n     polygraph instrument with respect to the examinee and then \n     analyzes the charts derived from the test. Throughout the \n     actual testing phase, the examiner shall not ask any question \n     that was not presented in writing for review prior to the \n     testing phase. An examiner may, however, recess the testing \n     phase and return to the pre-test phase to review additional \n     relevant questions with the examinee. In the case of an \n     ongoing investigation, the examiner shall ensure that all \n     relevant questions (as distinguished from technical baseline \n     questions) pertain to the investigation.\n       (b) No testing period subject to the provisions of the Act \n     shall be less than ninety minutes in length. Such ``test \n     period'' begins at the time that the examiner begins \n     informing the examinee of the nature and characteristics of \n     the examination and the instruments involved, as prescribed \n     in section 8(b)(2)(B) of the EPPA and section 1.23(a)(2) of \n     this part, and ends when the examiner completes the review of \n     the test results with the examinee as provided in section \n     1.25 of this part. The ninety-minute minimum duration shall \n     not apply if the examinee voluntarily acts to terminate the \n     test before the completion thereof, in which event the \n     examiner may not render an opinion regarding the employee's \n     truthfulness.\n\n     SEC. 1.25  RIGHTS OF EXAMINEE--POST-TEST PHASE.\n\n       (a) The post-test phase refers to any questioning or other \n     communication with the examinee following the use of the \n     polygraph instrument, including review of the results of the \n     test with the examinee. Before any adverse employment action, \n     the employing office must:\n       (1) Further interview the examinee on the basis of the test \n     results; and\n       (2) Give to the examinee a written copy of any opinions or \n     conclusions rendered in response to the test, as well as the \n     questions asked during the test, with the corresponding \n     charted responses. The term ``corresponding charted \n     responses'' refers to copies of the entire examination charts \n     recording the employee's physiological responses, and not \n     just the examiner's written report which describes the \n     examinee's responses to the questions as ``charted'' by the \n     instrument.\n\n     SEC. 1.26  QUALIFICATIONS OF AND REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMINERS.\n\n       (a) Section 8 (b) and (c) of the EPPA provides that the \n     limited exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations shall not apply unless the person conducting \n     the polygraph examination meets specified qualifications and \n     requirements.\n       (b) An examiner must meet the following qualifications:\n       (1) Have a valid current license, if required by the State \n     in which the test is to be conducted; and\n       (2) Carry a minimum bond of $50,000 provided by a surety \n     incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any \n     State, which may under those laws guarantee the fidelity of \n     persons holding positions of trust, or carry an equivalent \n     amount of professional liability coverage.\n       (c) An examiner must also, with respect to examinees \n     identified by the employing office pursuant to section \n     1.30(c) of this part:\n       (1) Observe all rights of examinees, as set out in sections \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25 of this part;\n       (2) Administer no more than five polygraph examinations in \n     any one calendar day on which a test or tests subject to the \n     provisions of EPPA are administered, not counting those \n     instances where an examinee voluntarily terminates an \n     examination prior to the actual testing phase;\n       (3) Administer no polygraph examination subject to the \n     provisions of the EPPA which is less than ninety minutes in \n     duration, as described in section 1.24(b) of this part; and\n       (4) Render any opinion or conclusion regarding truthfulness \n     or deception in writing. Such opinion or conclusion must be \n     based solely on the polygraph test results. The written \n     report shall not contain any information other than \n     admissions, information, case facts, and interpretation of \n     the charts relevant to the stated purpose of the polygraph \n     test and shall not include any recommendation concerning the \n     employment of the examinee.\n       (5) Maintain all opinions, reports, charts, written \n     questions, lists, and other records relating to the test, \n     including, statements signed by examinees advising them of \n     rights under the CAA (as described in section 1.23(a)(3) of \n     this part) and any electronic recordings of examinations, for \n     at least three years from the date of the administration of \n     the test.

Such action would not constitute disclosure under \n     this part provided that the other examiner has no direct or \n     indirect interest in the matter.\n\n                         Subpart E--[Reserved]\n\n     SEC. 1.40  [RESERVED].\n\n               Appendix A to Part 801--Notice to Examinee\n\n       Section 204 of the Congressional Accountability Act, which \n     applies the rights and protections of section 8(b) of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act to covered employees and \n     employing offices, and the regulations of the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance (sections 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, and 1.25), require that you be given the following \n     information before taking a polygraph examination:\n\n     1.

(a) The test is not and cannot be required as a condition \n     of employment.\n\n     (b) The employing office may not discharge, dismiss, \n     discipline, deny employment or promotion, or otherwise \n     discriminate against you based on the analysis of a polygraph \n     test, or based on your refusal to take such a test without \n     additional evidence which would support such action.\n\n     (c)(1) In connection with an ongoing investigation, the \n     additional evidence required for an employing office to take \n     adverse action against you, including termination, may be (A) \n     evidence that you had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation, together with (B) the evidence \n     supporting the employing office's reasonable suspicion that \n     you were involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation.\n\n     (2) Any statement made by you before or during the test may \n     serve as additional supporting evidence for an adverse \n     employment action, as described in 3(b) above, and any \n     admission of criminal conduct by you may be transmitted to an \n     appropriate Government law enforcement agency.\n\n     4. (a) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n\n     (1) To you or any other person specifically designated in \n     writing by you to receive such information;\n\n     (2) To the employing office that requested the test;\n\n     (3) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or mediator \n     that obtains a court order.\n\n     (b) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the employing office to an appropriate \n     governmental agency without a court order where, and only \n     insofar as, the information disclosed is an admission of \n     criminal conduct.\n\n     5. If any of your rights or protections under the law are \n     violated, you have the right to take action against the \n     employing office by filing a request for counseling with the \n     Office of Compliance under section 402 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. Employing offices that violate this law \n     are liable to the affected examinee, who may recover such \n     legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate, including, \n     but not limited to, employment, reinstatement, and promotion, \n     payment of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable costs, \n     including attorney's fees.\n\n     6. Your rights under the CAA may not be waived, either \n     voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or otherwise, \n     except as part of a written settlement to a pending action or \n     complaint under the CAA, and agreed to and signed by the \n     parties.\n\n     I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the above \n     notice, and that it has been read to me.\n\n     ________________________________________\n     (Date)\n     ________________________________________\n     (Signature)\n\n    APPLICATION OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS OF THE WORKER ADJUSTMENT \n RETRAINING AND NOTIFICATION ACT OF 1988 (IMPLEMENTING SECTION 204 OF \n                                THE CAA)\n\nSec.\n639.1  Purpose and scope.\n639.2  What does WARN require?\n639.3  Definitions.\n639.4  Who must give notice?\n639.5  When must notice be given?\n639.6  Who must receive notice?\n639.7  What must the notice contain?\n639.8  How is the notice served?\n639.9  When may notice be given less than 60 days in advance?\n639.10  When may notice be extended?\n639.11  [Reserved].\n\n     Sec. 639.1  Purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Purpose of WARN as Applied by the CAA.--Section 205 of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act, Public Law 104-1 \n     (``CAA''), provides protection to covered employees and their \n     families by requiring employing offices to provide \n     notification 60 calendar days in advance of office closings \n     and mass layoffs within the meaning of section 3 of the \n     Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2102. Advance notice provides workers and their \n     families some transition time to adjust to the prospective \n     loss of employment, to seek and obtain alternative jobs and, \n     if necessary, to enter skill training or retraining that will \n     allow these workers to successfully compete in the job \n     market. As used in these regulations, WARN shall refer to the \n     provisions of WARN applied to covered employing offices by \n     section 205 of the CAA.\n       (b) Scope of These Regulations.--These regulations are \n     issued by the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, \n     pursuant to sections 205(c) and 304 of the CAA, which directs \n     the Board to promulgate regulations implementing section 205 \n     that are ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) [of section 205 of the CAA] \n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown . . . that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section''. The regulations issued by \n     the Board herein are on all matters for which section 205 of \n     the CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, it \n     is the Board's considered judgment, based on the information \n     available to it at the time of promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of regulations adopted \n     and set forth herein, there are no other ``substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 205 of the CAA]''.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these sections and those of the Secretary \n     from which they are derived. Moreover, such changes, in and \n     of themselves, are not intended to constitute an \n     interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n       These regulations establish basic definitions and rules for \n     giving notice, implementing the provisions of WARN. The \n     objective of these regulations is to establish clear \n     principles and broad guidelines which can be applied in \n     specific circumstances. However, it is recognized that \n     rulemaking cannot address the multitude of employing office-\n     specific situations in which advance notice will be given.\n       (c) Notice in Ambiguous Situations.--It is civically \n     desirable and it would appear to be good business practice \n     for an employing office to provide advance notice, where \n     reasonably possible, to its workers or unions when \n     terminating a significant number of employees. The Office \n     encourages employing offices to give notice in such \n     circumstances.\n       (d) WARN not to Supersede Other Laws and Contracts.--The \n     provisions of WARN do not supersede any otherwise applicable \n     laws or collective bargaining agreements that provide for \n     additional notice or additional rights and remedies. If such \n     law or agreement provides for a longer notice period, WARN \n     notice shall run concurrently with that additional notice \n     period. Collective bargaining agreements may be used to \n     clarify or amplify the terms and conditions of WARN, but may \n     not reduce WARN rights.\n\n     Sec. 639.2 What does WARN require?\n\n       WARN requires employing offices that are planning an office \n     closing or a mass layoff to give affected employees at least \n     60 days' notice of such an employment action. While the 60-\n     day period is the minimum for advance notice, this provision \n     is not intended to discourage employing offices from \n     voluntarily providing longer periods of advance notice. Not \n     all office closings and layoffs are subject to WARN, and \n     certain employment thresholds must be reached before WARN \n     applies. WARN sets out specific exemptions, and provides for \n     a reduction in the notification period in particular \n     circumstances. Remedies authorized under section 205 of the \n     CAA may be assessed against employing offices that violate \n     WARN requirements.\n\n     Sec. 639.3 Definitions\n\n       (a) Employing Office.--(1) The term ``employing office'' \n     means any of the entities listed in section 101(9) of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9) that employs--\n       (i) 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; \n     or\n       (ii) employs 100 or more employees, including part-time \n     employees, who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per \n     week, exclusive of overtime.\n\n     Workers on temporary layoff or on leave who have a reasonable \n     expectation of recall are counted as employees. An employee \n     has a ``reasonable expectation of recall'' when he/she \n     understands, through notification or through common practice, \n     that his/her employment with the employing office has been \n     temporarily interrupted and that he/she will be recalled to \n     the same or to a similar job.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN, are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     employing office.\n       (3) An employing office may have one or more sites of \n     employment under common control.\n       (b) Office Closing.--The term ``office closing'' means the \n     permanent or temporary shutdown of a ``single site of \n     employment'', or one or more ``facilities or operating \n     units'' within a single site of employment, if the shutdown \n     results in an ``employment loss'' during any 30-day period at \n     the single site of employment for 50 or more employees, \n     excluding any part-time employees. An employment action that \n     results in the effective cessation of the work performed by a \n     unit, even if a few employees remain, is a shutdown. A \n     ``temporary shutdown'' triggers the notice requirement only \n     if there are a sufficient number of terminations, layoffs \n     exceeding 6 months, or reductions in hours of work as \n     specified under the definition of ``employment loss''.\n       (c) Mass Layoff.--(1) The term ``mass layoff'' means a \n     reduction in force which first, is not the result of an \n     office closing, and second, results in an employment loss at \n     the\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\n     single site of employment during any 30-day period for:\n       (i) At least 33 percent of the active employees, excluding \n     part-time employees, and\n       (ii) At least 50 employees, excluding part-time employees.\n\n     Where 500 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) \n     are affected, the 33 percent requirement does not apply, and \n     notice is required if the other criteria are met. Office \n     closings involve employment loss which results from the \n     shutdown of one or more distinct units within a single site \n     or the entire site. A mass layoff involves employment loss, \n     regardless of whether one or more units are shut down at the \n     site.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     office closing or mass layoff. For example, if an employing \n     office closes a temporary project on which 10 permanent and \n     40 temporary workers are employed, a covered office closing \n     has occurred although only 10 workers are entitled to notice.\n       (d) Representative.--The term ``representative'' means an \n     exclusive representative of employees within the meaning of 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7101 et seq., as applied to covered \n     employees and employing offices by section 220 of the CAA, 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1351.\n       (e) Affected Employees.--The term ``affected employees'' \n     means employees who may reasonably be expected to experience \n     an employment loss as a consequence of a proposed office \n     closing or mass layoff by their employing office. This \n     includes individually identifiable employees who will likely \n     lose their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, \n     to the extent that such individual workers reasonably can be \n     identified at the time notice is required to be given. The \n     term affected employees includes managerial and supervisory \n     employees. Consultant or contract employees who have a \n     separate employment relationship with another employing \n     office or employer and are paid by that other employing \n     office or employer, or who are self-employed, are not \n     ``affected employees'' of the operations to which they are \n     assigned. In addition, for purposes of determining whether \n     coverage thresholds are met, either incumbent workers in jobs \n     being eliminated or, if known 60 days in advance, the actual \n     employees who suffer an employment loss may be counted.\n       (f) Employment Loss.--(1) The term employment loss means \n     (i) an employment termination, other than a discharge for \n     cause, voluntary departure, or retirement, (ii) a layoff \n     exceeding 6 months, or (iii) a reduction in hours of work of \n     individual employees of more than 50 percent during each \n     month of any 6-month period.\n       (2) Where a termination or a layoff (see paragraphs (f)(1) \n     (i) and (ii) of this section) is involved, an employment loss \n     does not occur when an employee is reassigned or transferred \n     to employing office-sponsored programs, such as retraining or \n     job search activities, as long as the reassignment does not \n     constitute a constructive discharge or other involuntary \n     termination.\n       (3) An employee is not considered to have experienced an \n     employment loss if the closing or layoff is the result of the \n     relocation or consolidation of part or all of the employing \n     office's operations and, prior to the closing or layoff--\n       (i) The employing office offers to transfer the employee to \n     a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting \n     distance with no more than a 6-month break in employment, or\n       (ii) The employing office offers to transfer the employee \n     to any other site of employment regardless of distance with \n     no more than a 6-month break in employment, and the employee \n     accepts within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or \n     layoff, whichever is later.\n       (4) A ``relocation or consolidation'' of part or all of an \n     employing office's operations, for purposes of paragraph \n     Sec. 639.3(f)(3), means that some definable operations are \n     transferred to a different site of employment and that \n     transfer results in an office closing or mass layoff.\n       (g) Part-time Employee.--The term ``part-time'' employee \n     means an employee who is employed for an average of fewer \n     than 20 hours per week or who has been employed for fewer \n     than 6 of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice is \n     required, including workers who work full-time. This term may \n     include workers who would traditionally be understood as \n     ``seasonal'' employees. The period to be used for calculating \n     whether a worker has worked ``an average of fewer than 20 \n     hours per week'' is the shorter of the actual time the worker \n     has been employed or the most recent 90 days.\n       (h) Single Site of Employment.--(1) A single site of \n     employment can refer to either a single location or a group \n     of contiguous locations. Separate facilities across the \n     street from one another may be considered a single site of \n     employment.\n       (2) There may be several single sites of employment within \n     a single building, such as an office building, if separate \n     employing offices conduct activities within such a building. \n     For example, an office building housing 50 different \n     employing offices will contain 50 single sites of employment. \n     The offices of each employing office will be its single site \n     of employment.\n       (3) Separate buildings or areas which are not directly \n     connected or in immediate proximity may be considered a \n     single site of employment if they are in reasonable \n     geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share \n     the same staff and equipment.\n       (4) Non-contiguous sites in the same geographic area which \n     do not share the same staff or operational purpose should not \n     be considered a single site.\n       (5) Contiguous buildings operated by the same employing \n     office which have separate management and have separate \n     workforces are considered separate single sites of \n     employment.\n       (6) For workers whose primary duties require travel from \n     point to point, who are outstationed, or whose primary duties \n     involve work outside any of the employing office's regular \n     employment sites (e.g., railroad workers, bus drivers, \n     salespersons), the single site of employment to which they \n     are assigned as their home base, from which their work is \n     assigned, or to which they report will be the single site in \n     which they are covered for WARN purposes.\n       (7) Foreign sites of employment are not covered under WARN. \n     United States workers at such sites are counted to determine \n     whether an employing office is covered as an employing office \n     under Sec. 639.3(a).\n       (8) The term ``single site of employment'' may also apply \n     to truly unusual organizational situations where the above \n     criteria do not reasonably apply. The application of this \n     definition with the intent to evade the purpose of WARN to \n     provide notice is not acceptable.\n       (i) Facility or Operating Unit.--The term ``facility'' \n     refers to a building or buildings. The term ``operating \n     unit'' refers to an organizationally or operationally \n     distinct product, operation, or specific work function within \n     or across facilities at the single site.\n\n     Sec. 639.4 Who must give notice?\n\n       Section 205(a)(1) of the CAA states that ``[n]o employing \n     office shall be closed or a mass layoff ordered within the \n     meaning of section 3 of [WARN] until the end of a 60-day \n     period after the employing office serves written notice of \n     such prospective closing or layoff . . . ''. Therefore, an \n     employing office that is anticipating carrying out an office \n     closing or mass layoff is required to give notice to affected \n     employees or their representative(s). (See definitions in \n     Sec. 639.3 of this part.)\n       (a) It is the responsibility of the employing office to \n     decide the most appropriate person within the employing \n     office's organization to prepare and deliver the notice to \n     affected employees or their representative(s). In most \n     instances, this may be the local site office manager, the \n     local personnel director or a labor relations officer.\n       (b) An employing office that has previously announced and \n     carried out a short-term layoff (6 months or less) which is \n     being extended beyond 6 months due to circumstances not \n     reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff is \n     required to give notice when it becomes reasonably \n     foreseeable that the extension is required. A layoff \n     extending beyond 6 months from the date the layoff commenced \n     for any other reason shall be treated as an employment loss \n     from the date of its commencement.\n       (c) In the case of the privatization or sale of part or all \n     of an employing office's operations, the employing office is \n     responsible for providing notice of any office closing or \n     mass layoff which takes place up to and including the \n     effective date (time) of the privatization or sale, and the \n     contractor or buyer is responsible for providing any required \n     notice of any office closing or mass layoff that takes place \n     thereafter.\n       (1) If the employing office is made aware of any definite \n     plans on the part of the buyer or contractor to carry out an \n     office closing or mass layoff within 60 days of purchase, the \n     employing office may give notice to affected employees as an \n     agent of the buyer or contractor, if so empowered. If the \n     employing office does not give notice, the buyer or \n     contractor is, nevertheless, responsible to give notice. If \n     the employing office gives notice as the agent of the buyer \n     or contractor, the responsibility for notice still remains \n     with the buyer or contractor.\n       (2) It may be prudent for the buyer or contractor and \n     employing office to determine the impacts of the \n     privatization or sale on workers, and to arrange between them \n     for advance notice to be given to affected employees or their \n     representative(s), if a mass layoff or office closing is \n     planned.\n\n     Sec. 639.5 When must notice be given?\n\n       (a) General Rule.--(1) With certain exceptions discussed in \n     paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in Sec. 639.9 of \n     this part, notice must be given at least 60 calendar days \n     prior to any planned office closing or mass layoff, as \n     defined in these regulations. When all employees are not \n     terminated on the same date, the date of the first individual \n     termination within the statutory 30-day or 90-day period \n     triggers the 60-day notice requirement. A worker's last day \n     of employment is considered the date of that worker's layoff. \n     The first and each subsequent group of terminees are entitled \n     to a full 60 days' notice. In order for an employing office \n     to decide whether issuing notice is required, the employing \n     office should--\n       (i) look ahead 30 days and behind 30 days to determine \n     whether employment actions both taken and planned will, in \n     the aggregate for any 30-day period, reach the minimum \n     numbers for an office closing or a mass layoff and thus \n     trigger the notice requirement; and\n       (ii) look ahead 90 days and behind 90 days to determine \n     whether employment actions both taken and planned each of \n     which separately is not of sufficient size to trigger\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\n     WARN coverage will, in the aggregate for any 90-day period, \n     reach the minimum numbers for an office closing or a mass \n     layoff and thus trigger the notice requirement. An employing \n     office is not, however, required under section 3(d) to give \n     notice if the employing office demonstrates that the separate \n     employment losses are the result of separate and distinct \n     actions and causes, and are not an attempt to evade the \n     requirements of WARN.\n       (2) The point in time at which the number of employees is \n     to be measured for the purpose of determining coverage is the \n     date the first notice is required to be given. If this \n     ``snapshot'' of the number of employees employed on that date \n     is clearly unrepresentative of the ordinary or average \n     employment level, then a more representative number can be \n     used to determine coverage. Examples of unrepresentative \n     employment levels include cases when the level is near the \n     peak or trough of an employment cycle or when large upward or \n     downward shifts in the number of employees occur around the \n     time notice is to be given. A more representative number may \n     be an average number of employees over a recent period of \n     time or the number of employees on an alternative date which \n     is more representative of normal employment levels. \n     Alternative methods cannot be used to evade the purpose of \n     WARN, and should only be used in unusual circumstances.\n       (b) Transfers.--(1) Notice is not required in certain cases \n     involving transfers, as described under the definition of \n     ``employment loss'' at Sec. 639.3(f) of this part.\n       (2) An offer of reassignment to a different site of \n     employment should not be deemed to be a ``transfer'' if the \n     new job constitutes a constructive discharge.\n       (3) The meaning of the term ``reasonable commuting \n     distance'' will vary with local conditions. In determining \n     what is a ``reasonable commuting distance'', consideration \n     should be given to the following factors: geographic \n     accessibility of the place of work, the quality of the roads, \n     customarily available transportation, and the usual travel \n     time.\n       (4) In cases where the transfer is beyond reasonable \n     commuting distance, the employing office may become liable \n     for failure to give notice if an offer to transfer is not \n     accepted within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or \n     layoff (whichever is later). Depending upon when the offer of \n     transfer was made by the employing office, the normal 60-day \n     notice period may have expired and the office closing or mass \n     layoff may have occurred. An employing office is, therefore, \n     well advised to provide 60-day advance notice as part of the \n     transfer offer.\n       (c) Temporary Employment.--(1) No notice is required if the \n     closing is of a temporary facility, or if the closing or \n     layoff is the result of the completion of a particular \n     project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired \n     with the understanding that their employment was limited to \n     the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking.\n       (2) Employees must clearly understand at the time of hire \n     that their employment is temporary. When such understandings \n     exist will be determined by reference to employment \n     contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or employment \n     practices of other employing offices or a locality, but the \n     burden of proof will lie with the employing office to show \n     that the temporary nature of the project or facility was \n     clearly communicated should questions arise regarding the \n     temporary employment understandings.\n\n     Sec. 639.6  Who must receive notice?\n\n       Section 3(a) of WARN provides for notice to each \n     representative of the affected employees as of the time \n     notice is required to be given or, if there is no such \n     representative at that time, to each affected employee.\n       (a) Representative(s) of Affected Employees.--Written \n     notice is to be served upon the chief elected officer of the \n     exclusive representative(s) or bargaining agent(s) of \n     affected employees at the time of the notice. If this person \n     is not the same as the officer of the local union(s) \n     representing affected employees, it is recommended that a \n     copy also be given to the local union official(s).\n       (b) Affected Employees.--Notice is required to be given to \n     employees who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss. This includes employees who will likely lose \n     their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, to the \n     extent that such workers can be identified at the time notice \n     is required to be given. If, at the time notice is required \n     to be given, the employing office cannot identify the \n     employee who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss due to the elimination of a particular \n     position, the employing office must provide notice to the \n     incumbent in that position. While part-time employees are not \n     counted in determining whether office closing or mass layoff \n     thresholds are reached, such workers are due notice.\n\n     Sec. 639.7  What must the notice contain?\n\n       (a) Notice Must be Specific.--(1) All notice must be \n     specific.\n       (2) Where voluntary notice has been given more than 60 days \n     in advance, but does not contain all of the required elements \n     set out in this section, the employing office must ensure \n     that all of the information required by this section is \n     provided in writing to the parties listed in Sec. 639.6 at \n     least 60 days in advance of a covered employment action.\n       (3) Notice may be given conditional upon the occurrence or \n     nonoccurrence of an event only when the event is definite and \n     the consequences of its occurrence or nonoccurrence will \n     necessarily, in the normal course of operations, lead to a \n     covered office closing or mass layoff less than 60 days after \n     the event. The notice must contain each of the elements set \n     out in this section.\n       (4) The information provided in the notice shall be based \n     on the best information available to the employing office at \n     the time the notice is served. It is not the intent of the \n     regulations that errors in the information provided in a \n     notice that occur because events subsequently change or that \n     are minor, inadvertent errors are to be the basis for finding \n     a violation of WARN.\n       (b) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``date'' \n     refers to a specific date or to a 14-day period during which \n     a separation or separations are expected to occur. If \n     separations are planned according to a schedule, the schedule \n     should indicate the specific dates on which or the beginning \n     date of each 14-day period during which any separations are \n     expected to occur. Where a 14-day period is used, notice must \n     be given at least 60 days in advance of the first day of the \n     period.\n       (c) Notice.--Notice to each representative of affected \n     employees is to contain:\n       (1) The name and address of the employment site where the \n     office closing or mass layoff will occur, and the name and \n     telephone number of an employing office official to contact \n     for further information;\n       (2) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (3) The expected date of the first separation and the \n     anticipated schedule for making separations;\n       (4) The job titles of positions to be affected and the \n     names of the workers currently holding affected jobs.\n\n     The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n       (d) Employees not Represented.--Notice to each affected \n     employee who does not have a representative is to be written \n     in language understandable to the employees and is to \n     contain:\n       (1) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (2) The expected date when the office closing or mass \n     layoff will commence and the expected date when the \n     individual employee will be separated;\n       (3) An indication whether or not bumping rights exist;\n       (4) The name and telephone number of an employing office \n     official to contact for further information.\n\n     The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n\n     Sec. 639.8  How is the notice served?\n\n       Any reasonable method of delivery to the parties listed \n     under Sec. 639.6 of this part which is designed to ensure \n     receipt of notice of at least 60 days before separation is \n     acceptable (e.g., first class mail, personal delivery with \n     optional signed receipt). In the case of notification \n     directly to affected employees, insertion of notice into pay \n     envelopes is another viable option. A ticketed notice, i.e., \n     preprinted notice regularly included in each employee's pay \n     check or pay envelope, does not meet the requirements of \n     WARN.\n\n     Sec. 639.9  When may notice be given less than 60 days in \n       advance?\n\n       Section 3(b) of WARN, as applied by section 205 of the CAA, \n     sets forth two conditions under which the notification period \n     may be reduced to less than 60 days. The employing office \n     bears the burden of proof that conditions for the exceptions \n     have been met. If one of the exceptions is applicable, the \n     employing office must give as much notice as is practicable \n     to the union and non-represented employees and this may, in \n     some circumstances, be notice after the fact. The employing \n     office must, at the time notice actually is given, provide a \n     brief statement of the reason for reducing the notice period, \n     in addition to the other elements set out in Sec. 639.7.\n       (a) The ``unforeseeable business circumstances'' exception \n     under section 3(b)(2)(A) of WARN, as applied under the CAA, \n     applies to office closings and mass layoffs caused by \n     circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the \n     time that 60-day notice would have been required.\n       (1) An important indicator of a circumstance that is not \n     reasonably foreseeable is that the circumstance is caused by \n     some sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition \n     outside the employing office's control.\n       (2) The test for determining when circumstances are not \n     reasonably foreseeable focuses on an employing office's \n     business judgment. The employing office must exercise such \n     reasonable business judgment as would a similarly situated \n     employing office in predicting the demands of its operations. \n     The employing office is not required, however, to accurately \n     predict general economic conditions that also may affect its \n     operations.\n       (b) The ``natural disaster'' exception in section \n     3(b)(2)(B) of WARN applies to office\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\n     closings and mass layoffs due to any form of a natural \n     disaster.\n       (1) Floods, earthquakes, droughts, storms, tidal waves or \n     tsunamis and similar effects of nature are natural disasters \n     under this provision.\n       (2) To qualify for this exception, an employing office must \n     be able to demonstrate that its office closing or mass layoff \n     is a direct result of a natural disaster.\n       (3) While a disaster may preclude full or any advance \n     notice, such notice as is practicable, containing as much of \n     the information required in Sec. 639.7 as is available in the \n     circumstances of the disaster still must be given, whether in \n     advance or after the fact of an employment loss caused by a \n     natural disaster.\n       (4) Where an office closing or mass layoff occurs as an \n     indirect result of a natural disaster, the exception does not \n     apply but the ``unforeseeable business circumstance'' \n     exception described in paragraph (a) of this section may be \n     applicable.\n\n     Sec. 639.10 When may notice be extended?\n\n       Additional notice is required when the date or schedule of \n     dates of a planned office closing or mass layoff is extended \n     beyond the date or the ending date of any 14-day period \n     announced in the original notice as follows:\n       (a) If the postponement is for less than 60 days, the \n     additional notice should be given as soon as possible to the \n     parties identified in Sec. 639.6 and should include reference \n     to the earlier notice, the date (or 14-day period) to which \n     the planned action is postponed, and the reasons for the \n     postponement. The notice should be given in a manner which \n     will provide the information to all affected employees.\n       (b) If the postponement is for 60 days or more, the \n     additional notice should be treated as new notice subject to \n     the provisions of Sec. Sec. 639.5, 639.6 and 639.7 of this \n     part. Rolling notice, in the sense of routine periodic \n     notice, given whether or not an office closing or mass layoff \n     is impending, and with the intent to evade the purpose of the \n     Act rather than give specific notice as required by WARN, is \n     not acceptable.\n\n     Sec. 639.11 [Reserved]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S3959-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3997-S3999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n           CONGRESSIONAL TERMS LIMIT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 3703\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEAHY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 3692 proposed by Mr. Ashcroft to the joint resolution \n(S.J.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to \nrecognize April 22, 1996, as Earth Day.\n  On their 1804 expedition through my present day State of Montana, \nMeriwether Lewis and William Clark wrote of the abundant game, vast \nhorizons, shining mountains and crystal clear streams littered with \nrainbow and cutthroat trout.\n  Today the Treasure State remains largely unchanged. As stewards of \nthe land, Montana's farmers realize the importance of sound \nconservation methods in cultivating the soil. Montana ranchers have \nemployed grazing practices that renew healthy foragable grasslands.\n  In an effort to increase the sustainability of Montana's ranges, \nMontana stockgrowers with grazing lands around Fleecer Mountain just \nsouth of Butte and in the Wall Creek area near Ennis participate in a \nrotational grazing practice that utilizes and stimulates healthier \nforage on state lands.\n  This new grazing practice ensures that livestock and wildlife alike \nwill have access to healthy forage without overgrazing lands managed by \nthe Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Department.\n  This effort of cooperation is just one example of what can be \naccomplished when local decisions are made in place of those coming out \nof Washington, DC. It is another piece of evidence that Montanans make \nsound environmental decisions compared to what has been mandated at a \nFederal level.\n  I believe we need to protect our environment. Generations of \nMontanans have made their living off the land and in return have \nlearned to reap the benefits of preserving the land.\n  I greatly appreciate the environmental beauty of Big Sky Country, and \nI want my children and grandchildren to be able to appreciate it in the \nsame way I have been able to. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S4000-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DOCTORS WILLING TO ACCEPT MEDICAID PATIENTS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to call to your attention to \nthe extraordinary generosity of a few outstanding citizens in my home \nState. Dr. James Elliot, Dr. Rae Johnston, and Dr. Van Kirke Nelson \ntreated more Medicaid patients than any other doctors in Montana. These \ndoctors are willing to accept Medicaid patients--and lots of them--even \nthough they know that Medicaid will reimburse only a fraction of what a \nprivate insurance company would pay.\n  I want to publicly thank these doctors for their dedication to the \nmedical profession and for helping people who depend on Medicaid. Dr. \nElliot, Dr. Johnston, and Dr. Nelson are willing to make sacrifices for \nthe benefit of others. We can learn from their benevolence and their \nvaluable community service.\n  On average, Medicaid pays only 70 percent of what a doctor charges. \nThe doctor is forced to either swallow the cost, or choose not to see \nMedicaid patients. This is what makes physicians like Dr. Elliot, Dr. \nJohnston, and Dr. Nelson so special.\n  For example, Dr. Elliot averages a staggering caseload of 40 to 60 \npatients a day, not counting the trips he makes to the emergency room. \nIn 1995, he treated more Medicaid patients than any other doctor in \nMontana. His Medicaid caseload was so high that the State audited him a \nfew years ago. The State not only found no evidence of improprieties, \nthey also found that Dr. Elliot charges less than average for most \nservices.\n  And listen to Dr. Nelson, a personal friend of mine, describe his \nMedicaid patients to the Daily Inter Lake:\n\n       These are real people who may be on tough luck--\n  He explains,--\n\n     people struggling to make ends meet on low-paying jobs, and \n     single mothers with little income. These are the sons and \n     daughters of a lot of my friends.\n\n  So when the Senate debates legislation concerning Medicaid, I urge \nyou to remember these outstanding citizens--these doctors who are \nwilling to make sacrifices in order to assure that ``people on tough \nluck'' receive the health care they deserve. Dr. Elliot, who serves \nMedicaid recipients in the Havre area; Dr. Johnston, a Missoula area \nphysician; and Dr. Nelson of Kalispell, whose daughter and daughter-in-\nlaw, both physicians, will probably continue the tradition of caring \nfor underprivileged patients, deserve our admiration. The State of \nMontana is indebted to them, and to all the physicians in my State who \nserve Medicaid patients, regardless of their income or ability to pay. \nI am proud to commend them before the U.S. Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S4000-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WELCOME TO MICHIGAN CONSTITUENTS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome a large \ngroup of Michigan constituents who have come here to Washington, DC, to \nexpress their opinions on the recent violence in Lebanon. I was pleased \nto be able to welcome them to the Senate this morning and host them for \nmorning coffee prior to their planned events for the day.\n  Mr. President, this group comes here today with very deep sentiments \nand emotions about this issue. In fact many of them have family or \nfriends who have lost their loved ones in the tragic bombing of the \nU.N. shelter in Qana. I share their deep sentiments and support the \noverall message of the urgency of an immediate end to this bloodshed in \nthe form of a cease-fire and the need to deliver humanitarian aid to \nthe refugees in Lebanon.\n  As I have been reiterating the past 2 days on the floor of the \nSenate, I urge the administration to persist in trying to negotiate a \ncease-fire in this region and to bring an end to the hostility \nimmediately. The resulting peace will benefit everyone, but especially \nthose innocent civilians and refugees in Lebanon, who have been most \naffected by the violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S4000-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4000-S4001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF JUDGE WILL\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today, there is a memorial \nservice for Judge Hugh Will, a distinguished Illinois jurist and active \nhumanitarian, who died in December after a long and productive career. \nUnfortunately, my Senate duties prevent me from being in Illinois to \nshare my memories of Judge Will with his family, friends, and \ncolleagues, so I would like to take this opportunity to express my \ngratitude for his many contributions and my sense of loss at his \npassing.\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n  Judge Will had a long history of public service. Upon graduation from \nUniversity of Chicago Law School in 1937, Judge Will came to \nWashington, working at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and then \nthe Department of Justice. When the United States entered World War II, \nhe served as chief of the Office of Strategic Services counterespionage \nbranch in Europe. His country awarded him a Bronze Star for his work in \norganizing counterintelligence groups, which handled captured German \nagents. In 1946, he returned to Chicago, first working at the firm of \nPope & Ballard, and then becoming a partner at Nelson, Boodell & Will, \nwhere he worked until 1961, when President Kennedy appointed him to the \nFederal bench.\n  Thousands of cases came before Judge Will, all of which received the \nsame high level of careful attention. His handling of complex, high \nprofile cases was widely renowned, but he derived as much pleasure and \nsatisfaction from smaller cases, where he provided solutions for the \nproblems of ordinary people. He considered judging to be an art form, \ncomparing the perfect trial to the perfect symphony. And what a \nconductor he was! No jurist, in any court, engendered the respect and \nadmiration commanded by Hugh Will. He was at once a judges' judge and a \n``people person.'' His extraordinary intellect could at times be \nastonishing, but his overarching humanity was so much a part of his \napproach to the law that litigants were forewarned not to expect \nspecial interests ever to overcome the public good. He was a patriot, \nwho retained an optimistic vision of America. That vision guided a \nconsistent search for a living Constitution which kept faith with the \nhighest ideals of our Nation. Had timing and opportunity been \notherwise, Hugh Will would have distinguished himself and honored his \ncountry by serving on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Judge Will's contributions to the judiciary do not end with his case \nlaw. He pioneered the use of innovative administrative procedures, such \nas establishing a final pretrial order now used in courts nationwide. \nHis guiding hand helped many budding jurists at the onset of their \ncareers. He served as a mentor for many judges and participated in \nseminars for newly appointed jurists for over 20 years. Finally, he \nserved as lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit, challenging the \ncongressional withholding of cost-of-living adjustments due to judges \nunder Federal law. In 1980, the Supreme Court decided Will versus U.S. \nin favor of the judges, protecting the Constitutional separation of \npowers our Founding Fathers intended.\n  Judge Will was also active in the community, serving on dozens of \ncommittees and boards of directors throughout his career, and receiving \nnumerous honors and awards, including the Clarence Darrow Humanitarian \nAward in 1962. In 1991, he received one of the highest honors available \nto judges, the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award, \nbestowed by judges across the country to the Nation's outstanding \njurists.\n  Judge Will also showed strength in times of personal adversity. When \nhis beloved daughter died in 1982 at age 39, Judge Will founded the \nWendy Will Case Cancer Fund. The fund has distributed over $1.5 million \nto cancer researchers, in the hope that they may someday put an end to \nthe suffering experienced by cancer victims and their survivors.\n  Judge Will has served in many ways, he will be sorely missed by all. \nHowever, his legacy of service will live on, through his deeds, and \nmost importantly through the people whose lives he has touched.\n  I will miss him. He reached out to me, when I was just starting a \ncareer in the law, and became a mentor to me. Upon my election to the \nSenate, he sought to help me get established in the best traditions of \nthis body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S4000-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF THE SUNNYSIDE SCHOOL DISTRICT VOLUNTEER PROGRAM\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \nSunnyside School District's volunteer program for its dedication to the \nenrichment of the lives of children in Washington State.\n  I applaud the effort and enthusiasm of the many members of our \ncommunity working to ensure a bright future for our children, and I \nbelieve the innovative and resourceful programs developed by educators \nand community members deserve more recognition. In January 1994, I \nbegan recognizing outstanding school programs through the U.S. Senate \nAward for Excellence in Education. The 300 volunteers who selflessly \ndedicate their time to the children of the Sunnyside School District \ndeserve such recognition.\n  Whether working one-on-one with children in academic subjects, \nhelping on the playground, or sharing their talents and hobbies, the \nvolunteers for the Sunnyside School District can be found assisting in \nevery aspect of school operations. During the 1994-95 school year, \nthese volunteers gave 37,226 hours of service to the district. This \nkind of partnership between families, community members and schools has \nmade Sunnyside School District a leader in promoting a health learning \nenvironment for its students.\n  I hope their vision of excellence in education serves as an example \nto others in Washington State and the rest of the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S4001-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4001-S4002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROBERT DONOVAN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments today \nto commemorate the life of Robert Donovan, President of ABB \nIncorporated, who so tragically perished with Commerce Secretary Ron \nBrown in Croatia.\n  Over the past few weeks, the Nation has come together in an \noutpouring of support and remembrance for the life of Commerce \nSecretary Ron Brown.\n  And deservedly so. Ron Brown was a great American who faithfully, and \nwith quiet dignity, served his country and his party.\n  But, we must not forget those in our own community who were taken \naway from us on that wind-swept mountain in Croatia.\n  Robert Donovan, as well as all the others who were killed, deserve \nour special praise and commemoration because they died while on a \nhumanitarian mission of mercy.\n  Robert Donovan didn't have to travel to the Balkans. He certainly \ncould have stayed in Connecticut. But, Robert Donovan believed, as did \neveryone else on that plane, that in the global economy of the 21st \ncentury, Americans have a need and a responsibility to reach beyond \ntheir borders.\n  And, what's more, he believed the business community had a solemn \nobligation to do all it could to help those nations that are in the \nmidst of the difficult process of rebuilding and reconciliation.\n  Some may cynically suggest that Robert Donovan and the other business \nleaders who traveled to Croatia were interested only in a financial \nbottom line. But one doesn't journey to Bosnia to make money.\n  Robert Donovan went to the Balkans because he believed that the \ndynamism of American business could help bring lasting peace to regions \nthat for years knew only violence and hatred.\n  And he believed that his efforts could make a real difference in \nhealing the lingering anguish of ethnic violence.\n  This spirit of altruism was evident in everything that Robert Donovan \ndid.\n  At a time when pundits and politicians alike have made corporate \nCEO's Public Enemy No. 1, Robert Donovan proved the stereotype wrong. \nHe was a man who remained strongly committed and loyal to his workers \nand his company.\n  He was as comfortable dealing with ABB employees, either in the \nworkplace or running in the neighborhoods around this plant as he was \ndealing with international wheelers and dealers.\n  And his generosity spread beyond the workplace. He took an active, \npersonal interest in helping out at the 1995 Special Olympics World \nGames in New Haven.\n  But, Robert Donovan was a man who didn't hesitate from taking on \ndifficult tasks and that was never more obvious than on his last \nmission to the Balkans.\n  And, while I know this is a difficult time for Robert Donovan's \nfriends, family and colleagues, it is important to remember that last \nmission and all the tireless work that he did on behalf of ABB, his \nfamily, and his country. It's that enduring legacy that we must all \nremember in this time of tragedy.\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\n  My thoughts and prayers remain with his wife Margaret, and his \nchildren Kevin and Kara.\n\n\n                              claudio elia\n\n  Mr. President, I also wanted to take a few moments to remember \nanother Connecticut resident who tragically perished with Commerce \nSecretary Brown in Croatia--Claudio Elia, of Greenwich, CT, who was \nchairman and CEO of Air & Water Technologies Corp.\n  Like Ron Brown and all the others who died in Croatia, Claudio Elia \nwas on a solemn mission of mercy and he deserves particular recognition \nfrom this body.\n  Claudio Elia came to this country from Italy and took advantage of \nthe vast economic opportunities available to all Americans. He started \nhis business career in 1968 at the Boston Consulting Group and from \nthere he quickly worked his way up the corporate ladder.\n  In fact, Elia's value at Air & Water Technologies was so significant \nthat it took three top executives to replace him.\n  But, as Claudio Elia reveled in the economic opportunities that he \nreceived in his country, he traveled to Bosnia so that others would \nrealize the same opportunities.\n  Claudio Elia didn't have to travel to the Balkans. There are \nexcellent business opportunities elsewhere. But, Claudio Elia \nrecognized that in the global economy of the 21st century, Americans \nmust often look beyond its borders for new possibilities.\n  One of Claudio Elia's former classmates said at his funeral that: \n``His presence on that flight was vintage Claudio. He was constantly \npushing the envelope, looking for new opportunities and business \nrelationships.''\n  And those words were most true on the final mission of his life to \nthe former Yugoslavia. He believed that American businessmen have an \nobligation to play a role in helping nations that are on the difficult \njourney toward peace.\n  There are those who have cynically insinuated that Claudio Elia and \nthe other business leaders who traveled to Croatia were interested more \nin their financial bottom line then the well-being of the Bosnian \npeople. Well, as I said before, one doesn't journey to Bosnia to make \nmoney.\n  I believe that Claudio Elia and everyone else on that flight ventured \nto the Balkans because they shared the vision of Ron Brown.\n  They believed that through the machinations of the free market they \ncould make a real difference in the lives of the Bosnian, Serb, and \nCroatian people. They understood that even though peace had been \nachieved, the chance for a real and lasting peace would depend on all \npeoples having the same opportunity for a brighter future.\n  Claudio Elia took with him to the Balkers who unquenchable spirit of \nAmerican optimism and idealism that has infused our Nation for 220 \nyears.\n  That spirit was as evident when he was in the boardroom or on an \noverseas mission, as it was when he was sailing his yacht in the Long \nIsland Sound or dealing with his employees in the same manner he dealt \nwith everyone else.\n  Claudio Elia was a man who didn't hesitate from taking on difficult \ntasks and that was never more obvious than on his last mission to the \nBalkans.\n  And, while I know this is a difficult time for Claudio Elia's \nfriends, family and colleagues, it is important to remember that last \nmission and all the tireless work that he did on behalf of his family, \nand his country.\n  My thoughts and prayers remain with his wife Susan and his children \nChristine and Marc.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S4001-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE NAACP ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 41ST ANNUAL FREEDOM \n                              FUND DINNER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nextend warm greetings to the Detroit chapter of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People [NAACP] on the \noccasion of its 41st Annual Freedom Fund Dinner, to be held on April \n28.\n  The struggles of the NAACP have had an immeasurable impact on local, \nnational, and world events, advancing educational, housing and \nemployment opportunities for America's voiceless. The Detroit chapter \nof this organization in particular has shown a commitment to both local \nand national action in the interests of its neighbors and community. \nThe rewards of these efforts are shared by all throughout Michigan and \nour entire Nation.\n  Of course, Mr. President, we must continue to pursue every means by \nwhich to improve the quality of life for all Michigan residents. \nEnsuring that all of our citizens share in the resurgence of Michigan \nas a national and world leader is an important priority to me, as it is \nto the Detroit NAACP. My voice echoes with the many members and \nsupporters of the Detroit NAACP in their calls for more jobs, better \nschools, and safer communities.\n  It is clear to me that the NAACP stands, as it always has stood, for \nself-determination, hard work, and leadership. I think Frederick \nDouglass best captured this philosophy when he said: ``The whole \nhistory of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet \nmade to her August claims have been born of earnest struggle. . . If \nthere is no struggle there is no progress.''\n  I am sure that all concerned citizens who hope and pray for a unified \nAmerica where we can celebrate opportunity and justice join me in \nextending our sincere best wishes to the Detroit chapter of the \nNAACP.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/23/senate-section/article/S4002-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
