Mr. President, over the last several days, the Senate has \nbeen engaged in a debate over the balanced budget amendment. It was \nduring that period of time that those opposed to it chose to use the \nargument of Social Security, as somehow the amendment would throw in \njeopardy that system of funding supplemental retirement for the elderly \nand the old age of our country, and the other benefits that go along \nwith the system. They argued loudly that changes should be made, but \nmost assuredly that the amendment ought to take Social Security out of \nthe current budget process.\n  There were several of us who at that time argued that the Social \nSecurity receipts were now a part of the unified Federal budget. They \nhad been since 1969. They were part of what we budget today, and every \nSenator on this floor, at least more than once, had voted to include \nthose by action of voting for the passage of a budget of our Federal \nGovernment.\n  While it was argued loudly--and loudly ignored by the opposition--\nthat that was part of what we do today and it was clear that that is \nwhat we do, it was part of that effort to try to bring Members of the \nother side aboard in support of that amendment that an offer of good \nfaith was made as a phasing out of the use of those funds as we moved \ntoward a balanced budget beyond the year 2002. That offer was rejected.\n  What I thought was interesting over the weekend and why I bring this \nissue once again before the Senate is that as many of our leaders are \non talk shows during the weekends, I thought one that is worth \nmentioning appeared in an article in the Washington Times this morning \nwhich came from the White House itself. Let me read from that article. \nIt said:\n\n       [[Page S3486]] Meanwhile, the White House conceded \n     yesterday that Social Security trust fund surpluses currently \n     mask the size of the deficit, undermining the argument Senate \n     Democrats had used to defend their opposition to the balanced \n     budget amendment. White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta \n     said the 1996 deficit is actually $50 billion higher than \n     reported because the administration uses Social Security \n     trust fund surpluses to reduce the deficit. Previous \n     administrations used the same accounting technique.\n\n  And, of course, that is exactly what we referred to on the floor on \nthe Senate time after time over the debate of the last several weeks \nwhen we talked about the unified budget and the need to correct that \nand the ability to correct that through the authorizing legislation and \nthe implementing legislation that would occur following the passage of \na balanced budget amendment.\n  The article went on to say:\n\n       Six Senate Democrats who voted for the amendment in 1994 \n     reversed themselves last week saying they feared Republicans \n     would use the trust fund to balance the budget.\n\n  Many of us argued at that time that that argument was false and that, \nof course, those Democrats knew that they were now using the trust \nfunds, like every other person serving in the U.S. Congress, to deal \nwith the current budget because it was part of the unified budget.\n\n       Mr. Panetta said on the ABC-TV show ``This Week'' that \n     funds for the Social Security trust fund are \n     indistinguishable from other revenues because funds flow into \n     the same general Government account.\n       ``When you look at the Federal budget, and even when you \n     look at Social security, the reality is that those are funds \n     that flow into a central trust for Social Security,'' Mr. \n     Panetta said. ``Government basically operates that program, \n     even though it flows into that trust. So it really ought to \n     be considered part and parcel of the overall as we consider \n     the budget.''\n\n  That is what Mr. Panetta said. That is what many of us have attempted \nto argue, and yet last week, for some reason, those who chose to be in \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment grabbed onto this very thin \nthread and, in my opinion, the thread broke when the White House agreed \nwith us that current unified budgets use Social Security trust funds, \nand it was Republicans who had offered in good faith an alternative \nthat would move us away from that process as we moved toward a balanced \nbudget, and it was that offer that was rejected.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                     Two Wrongs Do Not Make a Right\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I came to the floor this morning, the \nlast thing I wanted to talk about was balanced budgets and Social \nSecurity. But my friend from Idaho, in effect, made the argument that I \nmade 4 weeks ago when I offered the amendment on Social Security, and \nthat argument is--I guess it could be summed up best as my mother told \nme on numerous occasions: Two wrongs do not make a right.\n  It is not right that we have, contrary to law, since 1990 raided the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is against the law to do that. We have \ngone ahead and done it anyway and, as my friend from Idaho stated, we \nare still doing it. We should stop doing it, and that is the whole \npoint of the debate on Social Security.\n  Social Security has not contributed 1 cent to the deficit, not a \npenny. What right do we then have to take 6.2 percent out of the check \nof any of the personnel around here, any of the people in the audience, \n6.2 percent of their paycheck, of their money and then the employer \nmatches it 6.2 percent. So 12.4 percent of every person's paycheck is \nput into a trust fund. For what? For retirement so that when they \nretire, they will have Social Security benefits. That is a program we \nhave had for 60 years.\n  That money, contrary to what my friend from Idaho said, is not to be \nused for foreign aid. It is not a tax to pay for the peacekeeping \nmission in Haiti. It is not money to pay for farm subsidies. It is not \ntaxes paying for B-2 bombers. It is money that is set aside not for a \nwelfare program but a retirement program.\n  I hope this budget that will be reported out by the Budget Committee, \nby my friend from New Mexico and my friend from Nebraska, both renowned \ndeficit hawks, people who believe in having a frugal, fiscally \nresponsible budget, deletes Social Security, that no longer masks the \ndeficit.\n  I think we should be honest about it. I hope they will do that. \nOtherwise, Mr. President, we are going to get into another debate on \nthe budget resolution, because the time has come to start following the \nlaw. We do not need to phase it out. This is the first admission we had \nthey wanted to use Social Security moneys. Remember, all the statements \nin the past from the House and Senate were that we are going to protect \nSocial Security.\n  Some way to protect it, just take the money and spend it. We should \nnot do that.\n  So, Mr. President, the debate on the balanced budget amendment was a \ngood debate. It proved to me that we have a problem with the deficit; \nit proved to me that we must do something about that deficit; and, \nthird, it proved to me we should do it without Social Security.\n  I am willing to stand up on this floor and walk down in the well, or \nfrom my chair, whatever we are directed to do, and cast votes to do \njust that.\n  Now, Mr. President, I came here today not to speak about this. I came \nto speak about another issue.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Nevada will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n\n\n                 Misuse of Social Security Trust Funds\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the discussion in the \nChamber and heard once again an attempt to create a misimpression about \nthe debate last week on the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. The argument has been made, ``Gee, the trust funds in the \nSocial Security system are being misused now, so I do not know what \nanybody was concerned about, and the notion of the trust funds being in \njeopardy was all a lot of nonsense.''\n  We heard a lot of that last week, but I also want to correct the \nrecord here, and the record is this. No matter how often someone stands \nand makes this argument, it is not true. If they say the balanced \nbudget amendment has nothing to do with the Social Security trust \nfunds, in my judgment, they are simply overlooking the facts.\n  The fact is that as the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget was written, the Social Security trust funds would have been \nused to reduce the Federal budget deficit. The fact is while people \nwere saying in public ``We have no intention of using the Social \nSecurity trust funds,'' in private they were in effect saying, ``Look, \nfellows, let us be honest. We cannot balance the budget without using \nthe Social Security trust funds.'' They were saying one thing in \npublic, another thing in private.\n  Now, I helped write the 1983 bill called the Social Security Reform \nAct. When we wrote it, we decided to impose payroll taxes in a way to \nraise more money than was necessary on a yearly basis to be put into \nthe Social Security system to save for the future.\n  In 1983, in the markup, I raised the question about whether, in fact, \nthe money would be saved and, of course, since that time it has been \nhistorically used by Republicans to offset the budget deficit balance \nin this country.\n  The proposal last week would have made that misuse of the trust funds \nconstitutional. It would have redefined receipts and expenditures in \nthe constitutional amendment in a manner that guarantees you will use \nall of those so-called forced savings in the Social Security system to \noffset the Federal budget deficit, the operating budget deficit of the \nUnited States.\n  Frankly, that is not an honest thing to do. Either we are not going \nto balance the Federal budget or we are going to save Social Security \ntrust funds and balance the Federal budget. But last week, the proposal \nwas to let us use the Social Security trust funds to balance the \nFederal budget.\n  That is bad public policy no matter how you slice it or how you \ndescribe it. It does not matter what is said in the coming days; it \ndoes not alter the facts. The facts are we are talking about $1.3 \ntrillion in the next 12 years of dedicated taxes to be paid into a \ntrust fund that will not be there under \n[[Page S3487]] the circumstances of that constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. Some things are worth standing and fighting for--\n$1.3 trillion and the future of the Social Security system, it seems to \nme, is worth standing and fighting for.\n  Mr. REID. If I could direct--the Senator from North Dakota now has \nthe floor--a question to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would say, one of the misunderstandings also has been \nthat we, those of us who supported the exemption of Social Security \nfrom the balanced budget amendment, there is a misapprehension that we \ndid not want Social Security ever touched again. I ask my friend from \nNorth Dakota, was it not our intention clearly--we made statements in \nthe Chamber and to the press--that Social Security should rise or fall \non its own merits; if we had to tinker with it on the edges to make \nsure that it was actuarially sound, we could do this, did we not?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely. And the fact is there will be adjustments \nmade in the Social Security system. To the extent they are made, they \nought to be made to make that system actuarially sound.\n  Mr. REID. As it has been in the past.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not support misusing the trust funds to balance the \nFederal operating budget. That is a dishonest way of budgeting, in my \njudgment.\n  Mr. REID. We should not be using those moneys, I say to my friend, \nthose tax moneys, 12.4 percent of a person's check, for foreign aid, is \nthat not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. For the military or highway construction? It should be used \nfor retirement, is that not right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Exactly. They are dedicated taxes to be put only in a \ntrust fund to be used only for that purpose.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n               Raiding of the Social Security Trust Funds\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I heard, as I was having lunch downstairs, the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho attempt to, what I can only say is \nrewrite history with respect to the debate last week.\n  Let me say, as one who was involved in those negotiations, I think \nthe record is abundantly clear. Those who were proponents of the \namendment clearly intended to raid Social Security trust funds in order \nto pay for other Government expenses to reduce the budget deficit. That \nis precisely what was going on last week. Any attempt to say that is \nnot the case is to rewrite history.\n  Now, as one who was involved in that negotiation, let us review what \noccurred. Some have said we are raiding the trust funds now. Well, that \nis absolutely correct. We are raiding the trust funds now. It does not \nmake it right. And to suggest we ought to enshrine that principle and \nthat policy in the Constitution of the United States is dead wrong. To \nconstitutionalize a raiding of trust funds to pay for other Government \nexpenses I believe is a wrong principle.\n  Let me just say that when I was tax commissioner of the State of \nNorth Dakota, I opposed raiding trust funds to pay for Government \nexpenses. I think it is a wrong principle. We should not be doing it at \nthis level either.\n  Mr. President, the hard reality is the trust fund surpluses that we \nare running now are about to explode. They are about to become much \nbigger surpluses, and the reason for that is to get ready for the day \nthe baby boom generation retires, when the number of people eligible is \ngoing to double in this country. But what they are going to find is the \ncupboard is bare. There is no money in the trust funds. There is not a \nnickel in the trust funds. All the money has been spent.\n  Mr. President, I want to go back to what occurred last week. I laid \nout on the 28th, on the morning of the 28th the criteria that were \nnecessary to secure my vote. I was thought then to be a key swing vote. \nI laid out very clearly in the Congressional Record what the criteria \nwere that I would apply in order to get my vote.\n  During those negotiations, Republican leaders came to me, and they \nsaid we understand your concern about taking Social Security trust fund \nmoney and using it for Government expenses. We will agree to stop using \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses by the year 2012.\n  Let me repeat that. After saying for weeks that they had no intention \nof taking Social Security trust fund money, last week on Tuesday, the \n28th, Republican leaders told me they would agree to stop using the \ntrust fund surpluses by the year 2012. That is about $2 trillion of \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses that they were saying they were \ngoing to use.\n  When I said, no, that certainly was not something I could agree to, \nthey came back to me and said we will stop using Social Security trust \nfund surpluses by the year 2008.\n Again, this is after saying for weeks they had no intention of using \nany of those moneys. But they came to me and said we will stop using \nthe Social Security trust fund surpluses by the year 2008.\n\n  What could be more clear as to what their intention was? What could \nbe more clear? They said to me they intended to be using the money, \nfirst until 2012 and then until 2008. It was only then, after I had \nobjected to that, that they talked about a phasing out and we discussed \na formula for phasing out of the Social Security trust fund money. But \neven that proposal, even that suggestion was flawed because when they \nput in writing what they had in mind, it was a statute. I told them on \nthat night: I am not a lawyer. I am not a constitutional expert. But if \nyou tell me that this will protect the funds over time, I will go to \nlegal experts and ask them for their opinions.\n  The next day, they sent to me a draft of a formula that we had \ndiscussed the night before. But again it was in statute form, which had \nnever been my idea. That was their idea.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I can just complete the thought?\n  Then I got the document the next morning. I got the document the next \nmorning. It was their draft of how they said they could protect Social \nSecurity funds. I met with legal experts from the Budget Committee, \nfrom the Congressional Research Service, and they said this is not \ngoing to protect anything because a constitutional amendment supersedes \nany statute.\n  So when we hear the other side here today say they had a plan to \nphase out using Social Security trust funds, it was not an effective \nplan. It was not a plan that had legal force and effect --at least \naccording to the constitutional experts that I talked to. They told me \nvery clearly that what they were offering was eyewash. It made it look \nlike they were going to do something or were willing to do something, \nbut it would not have legal force and effect.\n  That is, I believe, the review of what happened last week. For the \nother side to now say they had no intention of using Social Security \nfunds--please, that is just not the case. It is clearly not the case. \nThey had every intention of using $1.3 trillion of Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses by the year 2008. It would have been about $2 \ntrillion if we had taken their first offer to stop using the funds by \n2012. And to say their final offer was to phase out the use of the \nfunds overlooks the point that they were suggesting that a statute \nwould provide that protection when the legal experts I consulted said \nin fact that would have no legal force and effect.\n  I want to thank my colleague. I just felt the need to set the record \nstraight here, at least with respect to my belief of what happened last \nweek.\n\n\n                     The Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to say to my friend, he was \npresent, is it not true, one day last week prior to the vote when we \nwere in an office in the Dirksen Building and we called in a \nconstitutional law expert to go over once again the fact that section 7 \nof the underlying constitutional amendment said that all revenues must \nbe included? The report language and everything else pointed to the \nfact that that includes Social Security revenues. Then we asked him, \ngoing over the argument again, would a speech, a letter, or a statute \nin effect do away with section 7 of the constitutional amendment?\n  It is true, is it not, that the scholar said it would not? Once a \nconstitutional amendment passed, Social Security would be there, it \nwould be used \n[[Page S3488]] for balancing the budget, unless you again amended the \nConstitution? Is that not true?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. We met with a legal expert, \na constitutional law expert from the Congressional Research Service, \nwho told us that the statute that had been proposed by the other side \nto protect Social Security over time, phasing out the using of Social \nSecurity surplus funds by the year 2012, would not work.\n  I had been advised earlier in the day by a budget expert from the \nBudget Committee itself, a constitutional law expert from the Budget \nCommittee itself, that it would not work. We were advised later on that \nday that, in fact, that was the case.\n\n\n                     The Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a couple \nof minutes, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his leadership and \nparticularly both Senators from North Dakota for their leadership on \nthis issue.\n  We are talking about truth in budgeting. I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer believes in the truth. And the truth is, that when \nRepublicans point fingers and talk in terms of a flip-flop, they should \nexamine their own records and realize that many on there side who \npreviously voted to protect Social Security have now flip-flopped to \nvoting against it.\n  The Record will show that the Senator from South Carolina voted for \npractically the same language in voting for the constitutional \namendment in 1993. As I stated long before the vote, at that particular \ntime I had not carefully focused on the details of the Simon amendment. \nI was told: Fritz, this is the same balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. It is not going anywhere. They talked about protecting \nSocial Security, and I thought, frankly, it did.\n  When I saw the House of Representatives pass this legislation for the \nfirst time this year, I began to study in detail whether or not the \nlanguage complied with the 1990 Hollings-Heinz law, section 13301 of \nthe Budget Enforcement Act, that we struggled to put on the books.\n  Why the struggle? Because I have been down this road before. I \nremember Arthur Burns, who was then Director of the Federal Reserve \nback in the 1970's, talked the need for a unified budget. I went along \nwith the unified budget in 1983 because there were not any surpluses. \nThat was the problem, the dilemma that the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota is pointing out. We were trying to make up, with a tax on \npayrolls, not only the short-term deficit in Social Security, but also \nto protect the fiscal soundness of Social Security into the middle of \nthe next century.\n  But then, during the late 1980's, a funny thing happened on the way \nto the forum--the Federal deficit exploded. The Social Security \nsurpluses were growing as a result of the increased payroll tax. But to \nhide our fiscal profligacy Congress, Republican and Democrat, used \nthose funds to mask the true size of the problem. Rather than changing \ncourse and taking steps to reduce our spending habits, we were content \nto move the deficit from the Federal Government over to the Social \nSecurity trust.\n  That bothered Senator Heinz, the late Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nthis Senator. Senator Heinz was not on the Budget Committee, but I was. \nSo I brought it up and on July 10, 1990, we had, by a vote of 20 to 1--\nwhere the distinguished Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] was the lone \nvote against. Thereafter, by a vote of 98 to 2 on the floor of this \nbody, we passed my amendment and saw it signed into law by President \nBush on November 5, 1990.\n  So comes this particular amendment. I checked closely, and I read and \nreread it. As I said, we went to better constitutional experts than \nmyself, but everybody knows that you cannot amend the Constitution by \nstatute. As President Washington said in his Farewell Address:\n\n       If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \n     modification under the constitutional powers be in any \n     particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the \n     way in which the constitution designates--But let there be no \n     change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may \n     be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by \n     which free governments are destroyed.\n\n  So I knew it. I had been into this court before.\n   I said, ``Wait a minute. When it says that all receipts and all \noutlays will be included in this deficit, that means that all Social \nSecurity receipts and all Social Security outlays will be included in \ncalculating the deficit, thereby repealing section 13301.''\n\n  Now that got my attention. If I am flipping and flopping, at least, \nas Adlai Stevenson said years ago, it is not a question of whether I am \nconservative or I am liberal. The question is whether I am headed in \nthe right direction. I am headed in the direction of complying with the \nlaw. I will yield, because I did not intend to speak until I had my \nlunch, but I was disturbed by this nonsense that I heard a little while \nago.\n  I will ask our distinguished friends, at least in The Washington \nPost, to report that five Democratic Senators are ready, willing, and \nable to vote for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget if \nthey protect Social Security. The majority leader said they are going \nto protect it. I heard him yesterday on ``Face the Nation''. He said, \n``We are going to protect Social Security.'' All I am saying is that \nthey need to put it in black and white. They need to put it in writing \nfor the American people.\n  We wrote a formal letter so there would be no misunderstanding. We \nsaid that you can pass a constitutional amendment with 70 votes if you \nonly protect Social Security.\n  I honor the representations made by the distinguished Senator from \nNevada and the distinguished Senator from North Dakota today on the \nfloor about the need for truth in budgeting. The five votes were there \nthat could have easily passed the amendment. They acted like the offer \nwas never made. It was formally made.\n  I am still prepared, and make the same offer, as one of the \nparticular five. You could get one vote and pass it right now. It is \n1:30 now. You could do it at 1:35 p.m., in the next 5 minutes; anytime. \nBut that is not the position they take. The Record is clear. If they \nwanted to pass it, they could have passed it in a flash.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nmorning business of the Senate, Larry Ferderfer, a congressional \nfellow, be allowed privileges of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If I may further ask unanimous consent, Mr. President. I \ncan see the time is running. I know Senator Bryan is here to give a \nstatement and Senator Bingaman is here to give a statement. I wanted to \ngive a statement on something other than Social Security and the \nbalanced budget.\n  I am wondering if we could have the permission of the Chair, and I \nask unanimous consent to extend morning business also for Senator \nBryan, Senator Bingaman, myself, and Senator Dorgan until 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. Regular order will be enforced with Senators allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes of morning business. Under the order, \nmorning business is allowed for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me add a final comment about this, and \nto say that in the coming days, if and when Senators come to the floor \nto try to revise history or describe what happened in a manner that \ndoes not comport with what I think happened last week, others of us \nwill come to the floor to correct it. We will not let stand assertions \nby some who say ``Gee, the only reason we lost this vote on the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget was because some people \ndid not understand what we were trying to do. We had no intention of \nusing the Social Security trust funds.''\n  Well, in private conversations, we were told, ``Look, fellows; in \nthis language, we all understand you cannot balance the budget without \nusing the Social Security trust funds.''\n   [[Page S3489]] I wish we had heard that in public, as well, and \nmaybe the American people would understand more clearly what was behind \nthe political circumstances last week.\n  In fact, a lot of this was just politics, as all of us know. Twenty-\nfour hours after the vote, the Republican National Committee already \nhad their advertisements on the air, paid for and running. They knew \nwhat they were doing. The slash and burn attack of politics is fine. \nThey can do that. They have the money. But it is all about politics. \nThe fact is, we have a serious budget deficit problem in this country. \nWe ought to fix it. We ought not raid the Social Security trust fund to \ndo it.\n  When Abraham Lincoln was debating Stephen Douglas, he was apparently \nexasperated. He could not get Douglas to understand a point he was \ntrying to make. Finally, he stopped and looked at him. ``Tell me, sir. \nHow many legs does a cow have?'' Douglas said, ``Four.'' ``Well, sir. \nNow, if you called the tail a leg, how many legs would the cow have?'' \nDouglas said, ``Five.'' Lincoln said, ``That is where you are wrong. \nJust because you call a tail a leg does not at all make it a leg.''\n  The folks come here and say they want a balanced budget at the end of \n7 years, and at the end of the 7 years, they have taken the trust fund \nto balance the budget. They do not have a balanced budget. They might \ncall it that. But they have raided the Social Security trust funds to \ndo it. I do not know what arithmetic books they studied to give them \nthis sort of advice on how to achieve these things.\n  The people who spoke the loudest about changing the American \nConstitution on the deficit are the same ones who, through polling, \nhave devised this Contract With America that would also have us enact a \nvery big tax cut right now. They would cut three-quarters of a trillion \ndollars from revenue with a big tax cut because that is popular. So \nthey say, ``Let us have a big tax cut. Let us have a defense increase, \none of the biggest areas of public spending. Let us increase defense \nspending. Let us cut taxes. And let us change the Constitution to \nrequire a balanced budget.'' And while they change the Constitution, \nthey would define revenues and expenditures in a way that would raid \nthe Social Security trust funds to balance the budget.\n  Some of us say, ``No. It does not make any sense.'' They say: ``It \ndoes not make sense to you? Then we attack you back home with paid \nads.'' That is fine. They have a right to do that in this country. But \nthe American people deserve to know the truth, as well.\n  There is an old virtue in this country about saving. One of the \nsobering things we did in the 1980's was to decide in 1983 that we \nwould save for the future in the Social Security trust funds. I was \npart of that. I helped write it. Unfortunately, in these circumstances, \nin recent years, and also, if we passed a constitutional amendment \nenshrining in that language forever in the future, we would have \nmisspent the Social Security trust funds. At least, I am not willing to \nbe a part of that. Others can describe it the way they see it, or the \nway they want to. But I would simply leave it at this: We were told in \nprivate, by the same people who said in public, ``We have no intention \nof using the Social Security trust funds,'' we were told in private, \n``Look, fellows. The only way we can balance the budget is by using the \nSocial Security trust funds.''\n  If I told the folks in my hometown that the only way you can balance \nthe budget is by raiding the Social Security trust funds, they would \nthen say you need to take a new course in budget balancing. Of course, \nyou need to balance the Federal budget. You can, and you should. But at \nthe same time, you can, should, and must save the money you promised \nthe workers in this country and the retired people in this country that \nyou would have in the Social Security trust funds.\n  You promised them you would do that. You owe it to them to do that. \nIt is not a case where you do one or the other. You do both--balance \nthe Federal budget and be honest with the trust funds. And, if someone \ntries to do it differently, tries to shortcut by saying let us use the \ntrust funds to balance the budget, I think a lot of people would \nappreciate somebody who says, ``No, it does not make any sense.''\n  This is not about politics. It is about principle. If you are not \nwilling to stand for principle from time to time, then you should not \nbe here. I am not complaining about the political pressure. They can \nattack forever. But when they come to the floor to revise the story of \nwhat happened last week, then I intend to be on the floor, and I hope \nthe Senator from Nevada and others will be prepared to correct the \nRecord every single day they do it.\n The American people need to understand what happened. And we have an \nobligation to tell them the truth about what went on in the Senate last \nweek.\n\n  We did not start this. I heard this discussion and felt the need to \ncome over and respond to it. I prefer that we not have these \ndiscussions. I prefer instead that we decide that what happened last \nweek happened last week. Let us try to work this week on what benefits \nthis country.\n  But to forever, today, every day, and every way, bring this up is \njust politics. It is just: ``How do we win and how do we force the \nothers to lose?'' I know I am representing myself in an assertive way \nbecause of what I just heard. I say that the Presiding Officer at this \npoint is someone who I know believes the less politics the better. We \nare all elected through the political system, and I am proud of the \nsystem. I support the system.\n  John F. Kennedy used to say, ``Every mother hopes their child can \ngrow up to be President as long as they do not get involved in \npolitics.'' But we must make public decisions and it is a necessary \nsystem. Party politics, it seems to me, ought to play a lesser role \nthan public principle on important public issues.\n  I hope we can put all that aside and decide to march in unison toward \nthe goals of the people. They want a better economy and more \nopportunity in the future. Both political parties have an obligation to \njoin hands and see if we can find ways to try to bring that about and \ngive to the American people an economy that is growing and provides \nmore opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3485-6", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3489-S3493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NUCLEAR WASTE DEBATE AT LOS ALAMOS\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to focus my colleagues' attention on \na subject that has consumed a good bit of my energy now for more than a \ndecade. It is the subject of a high-level nuclear waste repository and \nan ill-conceived proposal by the nuclear power industry that Yucca \nMountain in Nevada is the ideal place to do that.\n  I want to further call to my colleagues' attention the front page \narticle in the New York Times yesterday which, in my judgment, says it \nall. I have had it blown up here. ``Scientists Fear Atomic Explosion of \nBuried Waste, Debate by Researchers, Argument Strikes New Blow Against \na Proposal for a Repository in Nevada.''\n  That does pretty well sum it up, because for the past 13 years, there \nhas been an unremitting, relentless effort to locate a high-level \nnuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain, assuring us in Nevada that it is \nperfectly safe, nothing to worry about. This article reveals that, \nsince last summer, Department of Energy scientists at Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory, one of the most distinguished laboratories in \nAmerica, have been studying a premise advanced by one of their \ncolleagues that nuclear waste stored in a geologic repository in \nvolcanic tuff risks ``going critical.'' That is nuclear jargon--``going \ncritical.'' To those of us who are laymen, it means an explosion, a \ndetonation, in which radioactive material would be scattered for miles \nand miles.\n  Needless to say, the consequences of a spontaneous nuclear explosion \n90 miles from the city of Las Vegas would have a devastating impact. I \nmust say, Mr. President, I continue to be shocked and outraged that the \nDepartment of Energy and the nuclear power industry continue to force \nthe acceptance of a dump on Nevada when it appears that their own \nscientists cannot reach consensus on the most fundamental safety \nquestions related to nuclear waste.\n  As the New York Times article points out, ``even if scientists can \ndebunk the new argument that buried \n[[Page S3490]] waste at Yucca Mountain might eventually explode, the \nexistence of so serious a dispute so late in the planning process might \ncripple the plan or even kill it.''\n  Nevadans are no strangers to the uncertainties of science when it \ncomes to nuclear matters. I must say, the distinguished occupant of the \nchair and the great State that he represents are no strangers to this \nissue either. It has been 41 years since the first atmospheric \ndetonation occurred at the Nevada test site outside of Las Vegas. \nNevadans, Utahans, and Americans alike were assured there was \nabsolutely no risk, no safety hazard, nothing to be concerned about. \nLet us in the scientific community reassure you that you have nothing \nto be concerned about.\n  Mr. President, I have used this opportunity on the floor to share my \nown reaction. I was initially in the eighth grade at that time. Our \nscience teachers had us go out and, using a scientific calculation \nafter seeing that flash that was embellished in the early morning dawn \nand feeling the seismic impact, you could actually ascertain the \ndistance from ground zero to where that flash was being received. We \nwere pretty excited about it. I was 13 at the time. By the time we were \nin high school, it had become such a part of the southern Nevada \nculture that businesses, wishing to demonstrate their own patriotism, \nwere renaming business establishments atomic this and atomic that. Some \nmay recall there was a fashion in America, an atomic hair-do. We who \nwere students of Las Vegas High School were so enthralled by the \nexperience that the cover of our annual, the Wildcat Echo, had the \nnuclear mushroom cloud on it. We thought we were part of something that \nwas very exciting and important to the country and that it contained no \nrisk for us.\n  The constituents of the distinguished occupant of the chair were told \nthis as well. We know, decades later, that the people who were \ndownwind--most of them, fortunately for us in Nevada, were not in \nNevada; unfortunately for our sister State to the east, they were in \nUtah. They suffered the genetic effects, the cancer and the other \nserious illnesses because we were all told, and as good Americans we \nbelieved, there is absolutely no risk to health or safety.\n  Well, fast forward, Mr. President. We are now told that burying high-\nlevel nuclear waste is absolutely safe. As I have indicated, there is a \nrelentless drumbeat of pressure and publicity, coordinated, if you \nwill, between the Department of Energy, which on this issue simply \nserves as a surrogate of a nuclear power industry.\n  But why are the public officials in Nevada opposed to this, because \nis it really safe? Is it just a matter of science and nothing to be \nconcerned about?\n  Mr. President, if I am appearing a bit cynical, it is because that \nhas, sadly, been my experience. My senior colleague and I, Senator \nReid, have lived in southern Nevada. This has been part of our \nexperience from the time of our youth until the time we entered public \nlife, and now as we have service together in the U.S. Senate.\n  Last Thursday, before this story broke, the Senate Energy Committee \nheld a hearing. May I say to the new chairman, the distinguished \nchairman from Alaska, it was a very fair hearing. We in Nevada had a \nchance to express our view, and the Secretary of Energy and the \ncivilian radioactive waste manager, Mr. Dreyfus, was there, and those \nin the nuclear power industry were there. This was last Thursday.\n  Let me put this in context. In this debate in the scientific \ncommunity in which there are three teams comprised of 10 scientists--\nthat is 30 scientists--they have been unable to rebut the assertion \nthat there is genuine fear that an explosion can occur in a geologic \nrepository. This discussion has been going on for months and months and \nmonths.\n  I knew nothing about this discussion. Like Senator Reid, I have \nmeetings at least monthly, probably more frequently, asking, ``What is \nthe latest?'' ``What is happening?'' ``What are you going to do?'' My \npoint is that as recently as this past Thursday, the nuclear power \nindustry and its advocates repeatedly assert that there is no \nscientific or engineering basis holding back progress at Yucca \nMountain, that all of the opposition to Yucca Mountain is purely \npolitical.\n  Bunk. These people that have formulated this premise, which has been \nunable to be rebutted, are not people that have been hired by Senator \nReid, myself, the Governor of Nevada, or antinuclear activists. These \nare people within the Department of Energy's own distinguished \nlaboratory at Los Alamos. Not a word of this was shared with us. We \nlearned it, as did millions of Americans, by becoming aware of the \nstory yesterday in the New York Times and in subsequent news accounts \nthat have followed.\n  For 13 years, blindly they have proceeded on the premise that it has \nto be a deep geological burial and Yucca Mountain is the only place it \nhas to be. I must say that some public officials from my own State came \nto the hearing last Thursday to say, look, maybe we ought to cop out, \nsell out for a few bucks and see what we can get--the so-called \nbenefits argument.\n  That is to their disgrace, Mr. President. There can be no compromise \nwith the health and safety of the citizens of our State. And I must say \nthat the nuclear power industry, in its cynicism, continues to advocate \n``just negotiate for benefits; just negotiate for benefits.''\n  Well, the newest proposal now is that we have to have an interim \nstorage facility; not a permanent, but an interim is what we need. And, \nyou guessed it, the interim storage proposal, well, that should go to \nNevada, too. And the premise for that is because Yucca Mountain is \ngoing to be a permanent repository, let us just have them all next \ndoor. That will require a statutory legislative change to the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. And, I must say, in light of this concern here, I do \nnot know how any fair-minded Member of the U.S. Senate cannot take a \nlook and say, ``Maybe we ought to take a little time out and take a \npulse on this.''\n  Even before this revelation, the testimony before the committee on \nThursday was that there is about a 50-50 chance of the permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain ever being licensed. As I say, this most \nrecent revelation should put that into further context.\n  Senator Reid and I for some time, joined by our government and \ndistrict political officeholders, Democrat and Republican alike, in our \nState, have called for an independent review, an independent review. We \nhave been joined by the GAO, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \nand many, many others in the community.\n  Secretary O'Leary has simply refused our request. We waste billions \non the program--proponents of the dump and opponents of the dump agree \non that--more than $4 billion. And now, Mr. President, it is time to \ninsist upon this independent review.\n  I do not expect Secretary O'Leary will change her position, but it \nwill be my purpose to introduce an independent review process by \nlegislation later this week.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Sunday \nNew York Times article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 5, 1995]\n\nScientists Fear Atomic Explosion of Buried Waste; Debate by Researchers\n\n                         (By William J. Broad)\n\n       Debate has broken out among Federal scientists over whether \n     the planned underground dump for the nation's high-level \n     atomic wastes in Nevada might erupt in a nuclear explosion, \n     scattering radioactivity to the winds or into ground water or \n     both.\n       The debate, set off by scientists at the Los Alamos \n     National Laboratory in New Mexico, is the latest blow to the \n     planned repository deep below Yucca Mountain in the desert \n     about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Opponents of nuclear \n     power and Nevada officials have long assailed the project as \n     ill-conceived and ill-managed, and it has encountered \n     numerous delays.\n       Even if scientists can debunk the new argument that buried \n     waste at Yucca Mountain might eventually explode, the \n     existence of so serious a dispute so late in the planning \n     process might cripple the plan or even kill it. Planning for \n     the repository began eight years ago and studies of its \n     feasibility have so far cost more than $1.7 billion. The \n     Federal Government wants to open the repository in 2010 as a \n     permanent solution to the problem of disposing of wastes from \n     nuclear power plants and from the production of nuclear \n     warheads.\n       [[Page S3491]] The possibility that buried wastes might \n     detonate in a nuclear explosion was raised privately last \n     year by Dr. Charles D. Bowman and Dr. Francesco Venneri, both \n     physicists at Los Alamos, the birthplace of the atomic bomb. \n     In response, lab managers formed three teams with a total of \n     30 scientsts to investigate the idea and, if possible, \n     disprove it.\n       While uncovering many problems with the thesis, the teams \n     were unable to lay it to rest, laboratory officials say. So \n     the lab is now making the dispute public in scientific papers \n     and is considering having it aired at large scientific \n     meetings as well.\n       ``If we knew how to put the stake through it's heart, we'd \n     do it,'' Dr. John C. Browne, head of energy research at the \n     lab, said in an interview. Going further, some panel members \n     said they felt that the new thesis had been refuted.\n       Dr. Bowman, the idea's chief advocate, said the internal \n     debate had changed some elements of the thesis but over all \n     had left it honed and strenghened.\n       ``We think there's a generic problem with putting fissile \n     materials underground,'' he said in an interview, referring \n     to substances that fission, or split part, in a nuclear chain \n     reaction.\n       The few scientists outside the laboratory who have become \n     aware of the debate say the explosion thesis is provocative \n     and probably wrong. Nonetheless, they say, the stakes are too \n     high to sweep the idea under the rug.\n       ``It is important to see whether it has anything to do with \n     the situation that might arise in an actual repository,'' \n     said Dr. Richard L. Garwin, a prominent physicist at the \n     International Business Machines Corporation who has long \n     advised the Federal Government on nuclear arms and their \n     dismantlement.\n       Highly radioactive wastes are the main orphan of the \n     nuclear era, having found no permanent home over the decades. \n     In theory, if the Yucca plan wins approval after a careful \n     study of the area's geology, a labyrinth of bunkers carved \n     beneath the mountain would hold thousands of steel canisters \n     for 10,000 years, until radioactive decay rendered the wastes \n     less hazardous.\n       The spent fuel from nuclear reactors is permeated with \n     plutonium, which is a main ingredient used in making nuclear \n     bombs.\n       Since plutonium 239 has a half-life of 24,360 years, \n     significant amounts of it would remain active for more than \n     50,000 years, long after the steel canisters that once held \n     the radioactive material had dissolved. (A radioactive \n     substance's half-life is the period required for the \n     disintegration of half of its atoms.)\n       With the end of the cold war, the Nevada site has \n     increasingly been studied for a possible added role as a \n     repository for the plutonium from scrapped nuclear arms. In \n     January 1994, the National Academy of Sciences, which advises \n     the Federal Government, suggested that the plutonium be mixed \n     with highly radioactive wastes and buried, or burned in \n     reactors and then buried. In either case, some plutonium \n     would end up going underground.\n       On Wednesday, President Clinton, trying to win a permanent \n     global ban on the spread of nuclear arms, ordered substantial \n     cuts in American stockpiles of weapons plutonium but did not \n     say what would become of the deadly substance. Officials said \n     it would remain in temporary storage above ground until a \n     decision was made on its ultimate disposition.\n       The scientist leading the charge against the burial of \n     fissile materials, Dr. Bowman, has an alternative plan in \n     which particle accelerators would, by a kind of nuclear \n     alchemy, transmute radioactive wastes, as well as plutonium, \n     into more benign elements before they were buried. Dr. Bowman \n     is the head of the planning effort for the proposed project.\n       Although that gives him a personal stake in the explosion \n     argument, experts say that such situations are common in \n     science and that ideas must be judged on their merits.\n       Last summer and fall, Dr. Bowman began talking of the \n     dangers of underground storage and was urged to set them down \n     in an internal Los Alamos report, which he did by November. \n     The crux of his argument was that serious dangers would arise \n     thousands of years from now after the steel canisters \n     dissolved and plutonium slowly began to disperse into \n     surrounding rock.\n       The rocky material, he said, could aid the start of a chain \n     reaction by slowing down speeding subatomic particles known \n     as neutrons that fly out of plutonium atoms undergoing \n     spontaneous decay. Neutrons of a certain speed can act like \n     bullets to split atoms in two in a burst of nuclear energy.\n       Under some circumstances, Dr. Bowman theorized, the slowing \n     of the neutrons could make an individual pile of plutonium \n     explode in a nuclear blast equal in force to about a thousand \n     tons of high explosive, setting off other blasts throughout \n     the vast repository.\n       The team assembled to review the thesis concluded that it \n     held serious flaws, said Dr. Browne of Los Alamos. First, \n     dispersal of plutonium, if it happened at all, would take \n     much longer than envisioned--so long that the plutonium would \n     have mostly decayed.\n       Second, the review team felt that if a plutonium pile did \n     begin to heat up, the reaction would automatically slow down \n     and stop as the heat made the pile expand.\n       Third, the team felt that any reaction would be too slow to \n     cause an explosion and that, at worst, a pile would simply \n     heat up like a reactor.\n       ``The burden of proof rests on Charlie,'' said Dr. Browne, \n     referring to Dr. Bowman. ``He's hypothesized some scenarios \n     that, if correct, are clearly very important. In spite of the \n     fact that there is a sizable amount of opposition to \n     Charlie's paper, our feeling is that the subject is so \n     important that it deserves additional peer review outside the \n     laboratory, since we could not resolve the disagreement \n     internally.''\n       Dr. Bowman says the explosion thesis is alive and well. On \n     Friday he finished an 11-page draft paper thick with graphs \n     and equations that lays it out in new detail.\n       The team criticisms, he said in an interview, repeatedly \n     fall flat. For instance, dispersal could happen relatively \n     quickly, especially if water percolated through the dump. \n     Even if slow, plutonium 239 decays into uranium 235, which \n     harbors the same explosive risks but requires millions of \n     years to decay into less dangerous elements.\n       So too with the other criticisms, he says. Water could aid \n     the slowing of neutrons and make sure the reaction went \n     forward rather than automatically slowing down. And a pile \n     could explode, he insists, while conceding that the blast \n     from a single one might have a force of a few hundred tons of \n     high explosive rather than the thousand or more originally \n     envisioned.\n       On the other hand, his new paper says plutonium in amounts \n     as small as one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, could be dangerous.\n       ``We got some helpful criticism and that, combined with \n     additional work, has made our thesis even stronger,'' he \n     said.\n       The most basic solution, Dr. Bowman said, would be removing \n     all fissionable material from nuclear waste in a process \n     known as reprocessing or by transmuting it in his proposed \n     accelerator. Other possible steps would include making steel \n     canisters smaller and spreading them out over larger areas in \n     underground galleries--expensive steps in a project already \n     expected to cost $15 billion or more.\n       A different precaution, Dr. Bowman said, would be to \n     abandon the Yucca site, where the volcanic ground is \n     relatively soluble. Instead, the deep repository might be dug \n     in granite, where migration of materials would be slower and \n     more difficult.\n       Cathy Roche, vice president for communications of the \n     Nuclear Energy Institute, a nuclear industry trade group \n     based in Washington, said the debate suggested the need for \n     more study of the Yucca site, not less.\n       ``We're concerned that this not be used as an excuse by the \n     opponents of waste solutions to stop the scientific analysis \n     of the mountain,'' she said.\n       Dr. Daniel A. Dreyfus, the head of civilian radioactive \n     waste management at the Energy Department in Washington, \n     which runs Los Alamos and the Yucca Mountain studies, said he \n     was keeping an open mind on whether Dr. Bowman's thesis might \n     trigger an overhaul of the project.\n       ``The characterization work has any number of \n     uncertainties,'' he said in an interview. ``Criticality is \n     clearly a major consideration when you put a whole bunch of \n     high-level waste anywhere. Whether Yucca Mountain is the \n     right site, I don't know.\n       ``Maybe there's no good solution,'' he added. ``But walking \n     away from the problem is no solution either. We better keep \n     trying, because we already made the decision to have the \n     wastes in the first place.''\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield back any time I may have remaining.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation publicly, as I have \ndone privately on a number of occasions, for the leadership of Richard \nBryan on this issue. And I say Richard Bryan, because his leadership on \nthis issue started long before he became a Member of the U.S. Senate. \nDuring his tenure as Governor of the State of Nevada, he was a leader \nin recognizing the fallacy of attempting to geologically bury nuclear \nwaste next to the No. 1 destination resort of the world--Las Vegas.\n  Mr. President, I, like my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada, as \na little boy used to watch the flashes in the morning sky. I lived \nabout 60 miles from Las Vegas, 60 miles farther away from the explosion \nthan did Senator Bryan. We would get up--it would be dark--a bunch of \nlittle kids, and we would see that flash in the sky. Sometimes in \nSearchlight, where I was born and raised, we would hear the explosion, \nbecause by the time it got to Searchlight, a lot of times the sound \nwould bounce clear over Searchlight.\n  But, as I told many people, we were the lucky ones, because the winds \ndid not blow toward Searchlight. The winds blew toward St. George, they \nblew toward Enterprise in Utah, and those young men and women who \nwatched the night sky explode got diseases and some died. I have talked \nto parents, I have talked to children, sons and daughters. And, of \ncourse, there are the stories that have been written about sheep, \npeople herding sheep. Herders would get up in the morning and the wool \nwould just come off their \n[[Page S3492]] animals, even though they were still alive.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a serious matter, and I know everyone \nrecognizes it is a serious matter.\n  But for those of us who have lived with this since 1982, to see this \nheadline in the New York Times yesterday says it all. ``Scientists Fear \nAtomic Explosion of Buried Waste''; just like on Senator Bryan's chart, \nhis visual aid, on the front page of the New York Times.\n  And what troubles me so much is this has been going on for months and \nmonths. It is easy for the people in charge of the program, when \nsomebody says, ``Oh, don't worry about it.'' They come and testify. \nThey write papers. But when there is evidence by a scientific community \nthat says an explosion could occur, we do not hear about it.\n  How many congressional hearings have we had since this took place? \nSeveral. How many public gatherings have we had where Department of \nEnergy officials have come forward? Numerous.\n  The Secretary of Energy, I say to my friend from Nevada, has recently \nsaid that this is a priority with her to get nuclear waste in Nevada. I \nwonder if there would be a sting of conscience that would say, ``I \nwonder if we should be worried about this atomic explosion.''\n  And, Mr. President, it is not as if it has not happened before. In \nthe former Soviet Union, they had an explosion from nuclear waste.\n  The article is frightening, to say the least. ``Debate has broken \nout''--I am reading directly from this article-- ``among Federal \nscientists whether the planned underground dump for the Nation's high-\nlevel atomic wastes in Nevada might erupt in a nuclear explosion, \nscattering radioactivity to the winds or ground water or both.''\n  This is not sensationalism that the Senators from Nevada has created. \nThis is a newspaper article and it comes from the scientific community.\n  We have been called everything--``unpatriotic'' was one of the better \nterms we have been called--because we have stood in the road to try to \nstop this thing from happening.\n  ``The debate, set off by scientists at the Los Alamos National \nLaboratory in New Mexico''-- one of the finest scientific institutions \nin the world--``is the latest blow to the planned repository.''\n  I wish I believed that.\n  It says, ``Even if scientists can debunk the new argument that buried \nwaste at Yucca Mountain might eventually explode, the existence of so \nserious a dispute so late in the planning process might cripple the \nplan or even kill it.''\n  I hope so, because, as I say, Mr. President, rather than do as they \ndo with all the so-called good news that comes in relation to the \nrepository, they hid this. This has been hidden. And they did it by \nsaying, ``We do not believe it is possible.'' And here we are going to \nhave 30 scientists prove this wrong. They have tried to prove that it \nis wrong for almost 10 months. They cannot. They admit this. The \nscientists, the three teams, were not told to go prove how it could \nhappen, I say to my friend from Nevada, they were asked to prove how it \ncould not happen, and they could not do it.\n\n       The possibility that buried wastes might detonate in a \n     nuclear explosion was raised privately last year by Dr. \n     Charles D. Bowman and Dr. Francesco Venneri, both physicists \n     at Los Alamos * * * the teams were unable to lay it to rest * \n     * *.\n\n  Dr. Bowman, among other things, said, ``We think there's a generic \nproblem with putting fissile materials underground.'' That is an \nunderstatement, reading the rest of this stuff.\n\n       Highly radioactive wastes are the main orphan of the \n     nuclear era, having found no permanent home over the decades.\n       The spent fuel from nuclear reactors is permeated with \n     plutonium, which is a main ingredient used in making nuclear \n     bombs.\n\n  ``Since plutonium 239,'' listen to this, ``has a half-life of 24,360 \nyears, significant amounts of it would remain active,'' to say the \nleast.\n  Should we not stop and just relax a little bit and not be driven by \nthe nuclear power industry? Sure, they have invested a lot of money in \nnuclear waste disposal in Nevada. That is the only place they have cast \ntheir lot.\n  Should we not stop and let common sense dictate proper policy? We are \nnot talking here about storing wheat. We are not talking about storing \ntires that may burn for a little while. We are talking about storing \nnuclear waste that will explode like an atomic bomb that occurred at \nNagasaki and Hiroshima. And hundreds of times they have been exploded \nin the deserts of Nevada.\n  I have heard many times people say, ``Well, what is the \nalternative?'' There are a lot of alternatives. The No. 1 alternative \nhas been created, again, by scientists. During this period of 13 years \nthey have been trying to figure out a way we can transport nuclear \nwaste, and scientists came up with an idea that might work pretty well. \nThat is a dry cast storage container.\n  But why transport it? If it is safe to haul in a truck, why do we not \nleave it where it is, and then it is really safe. Now, this is not \nsomething that Harry Reid, who has a very inadequate scientific \nbackground, came up with. Scientists came up with this. And they have \nsaid leave it where it is.\n  It is really time to step back, think, and study this issue. It is \ntime to do some scientific investigation, to look at other \ntechnologies, to look at other sites. It is time to drop the efforts to \namend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, to drop efforts to speed the \nprocess up. It is premature to change our strategy, to accelerate our \nstrategy, to think about moving nuclear waste anywhere else.\n  In this newspaper article one of the scientists said, I think you \nbetter give up on Nevada and start looking someplace else. Mr. \nPresident, I do not want to create this problem for somebody else. We \nhave to know what we are going to do before we start talking about \nburying geological waste. One scientist here said we better look to \ngranite formation because the water will not come through and water \ncould help accelerate the process that could lead to an explosion.\n  There are some who say that there is another crisis that exists. Our \ncooling ponds are filled. I say, leave them filled. Move the spent fuel \nrods out and put them into dry cast storage containers at the reactor \nsites. We have time. It is perfectly safe to store the waste where it \nis.\n  Why the rush? The rush is because the nuclear waste power industry is \nfixated on this. It is like an obsession. They do not want to be proven \nthat they may have been wrong and spent billions of dollars of the \nratepayers money wrongly. That is what it amounts to.\n  Mr. President, I am happy this came out, even if it was through the \nnewspaper. I think it would have been more appropriate had people from \nthe Department of Energy at the hearing that was held the other day \ntestified that we have another problem that has come up: Scientists \nfear atomic explosion of buried waste.\n  I do not know how the newspaper got this information. There is \nnothing in the article to indicate how or where they got it. I do not \nknow if they got it from the Department of Energy. However they got it, \nthis is not an appropriate way to do business when we are dealing with \nthe most poisonous substance known to man, namely, plutonium.\n  It gives me pause about the Department of Energy. I have called \npublicly for doing away with the Department of Energy. This certainly \ndoes not distract from my initial goal. I think it adds to it. I think \nthe functions of the Department of Energy should be spread out among \nother agencies, some to the Department of Defense, some to Interior, \nsome to the EPA.\n  I am very disappointed in my Government, especially the Department of \nEnergy. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

MIKE CAUDLE FINDS FOREIGN SOIL, COMMON GROUND\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, all of us think and talk a lot about \npriorities these days, and that it is good. And ever so often we read \nor hear about a special person with special priorities and principles. \nWhen we do, a sense of admiration wells up within us--and, in my own \ncase, a sense of regret that I haven't done more than I have in terms \nof what my father used to call the Lord's work.\n  I have reached the age, Mr. President, when far younger men and women \nthan I are doing wonderful and remarkable things. Many of them I have \nmet; some are like members of the family. One in particular came to \nmind the other night when I was reading the 1994 annual report of the \nKnoxville Medical Center, of the University of Tennessee.\n  But I am moving ahead of my story. Many years ago I met a young man \nnamed Bob Caudle whom I found impressive. I was then one of the senior \nofficers of Capitol Broadcasting Co. in Raleigh which owned and \noperated a television station, a radio station, two statewide radio \nnetworks and an assortment of other related enterprises.\n  I persuaded Bob Caudle to join Capitol Broadcasting's team. He served \nwell until he retired and then agreed to become a part of the Helms \nSenate family. We don't have a staff, Mr. President--not in Washington \nnor in Raleigh nor in Hickory. We're a family that is praised by even \nmy strongest critics for the splendid constituent service they render--\nnot only to North Carolinians but to citizens all over the country who \ncontact us seeking assistance.\n  Bob and Jackie Caudle had two little boys when Bob began work at the \ntelevision station. Later a precious little baby girl, Lisa, rounded \nout the Caudle family.\n  Lisa Caudle is today a beautiful young woman with one of the most \nbeautiful voices I've ever heard. Both of the Caudle boys long ago \nbecame men, both became highly respected physicians. Dr. Bob Caudle, \nJr., is in practice in Raleigh. Dr. Michael Caudle, hereinafter \nreferred to as Mike, is now chairman of the University of Tennessee's \nMedical Center's department of obstetrics and gynecology.\n  I mentioned the 1994 annual report of the University of Tennessee's \nMedical Center of Knoxville. The entire issue is devoted to the subject \nof compassion. The foreword discloses to all of us the definition of \ncompassion. Note these eloquent words, Mr. President:\n\n       Deep inside ourselves, there is a place where compassion \n     knows no limits; where love and concern for our fellow human \n     beings become omnipotent. But for many, limited courage and \n     determination leave this wellspring untapped. For others, \n     this wellspring is where they find their life's purpose.\n       Such is the case for the physicians, staff and volunteers \n     features in these pages. The Medical Center was their \n     starting point, but their compassion has led them beyond the \n     institution's walls. They have gone where others are weak, \n     vulnerable, lonely and broken. Their journeys have changed \n     them forever.\n\n  Mr. President, there follows immediately in that annual report a \nfull-page color picture of Dr. Mike Caudle, striding along a walkway at \nthe medical center, stethoscope in the right pocket of his white \nphysician's jacket. And then, on the next page, begins an in-depth \ntribute to that distinguished physician who, it seems, was a polite \nlittle boy visiting his dad at the Raleigh television station--surely \nit could be no longer than a few weeks ago.\n  No, Mr. President, it was awhile ago, and I want Senators, and others \nwho peruse the Congressional Record, to have this tribute, headed \n``Foreign Soil, Common Ground'' available for reading.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \naforementioned article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In August of 1961, 10-year-old Michael Caudle sat \n     mesmerized by the family television set on which he saw the \n     raising of the Berlin Wall. He wondered what life would be \n     like for those people who were literally being sealed off \n     from the rest of the world. He later learned that ``the \n     wall'' was only part of something called the Iron Curtain, a \n     symbol of Soviet domination throughout Eastern Europe. \n     Thirty-two years later in 1993, Caudle's childhood wonderings \n     were realized when he visited Romania on a medical mission \n     trip. Now a physician serving as chairman of University \n     Medical Center's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dr. \n     Caudle was persuaded to make the journey after listening to a \n     speech given at his church by a Romanian Parliament member. \n     Touched by this description of the many needs in Romania, he \n     decided to serve as a link to the country, spending a week \n     teaching at the medical school in Timisoara and performing \n     obstetrical and gynecological procedures at rural clinics.\n       Although Dr. Caudle had always wanted to visit Eastern \n     Europe, he found his first few minutes there a bit \n     unsettling. ``When I got off the airplane, they bodily \n     searched me. They have these military people with AK-47s and \n     they X-ray your luggage,'' he explained. ``They asked what I \n     was doing there, and I told them I was working for the \n     Romanian doctors who were waiting for me outside. They looked \n     outside and slammed my luggage down and left. When I asked my \n     Romanian colleagues why the guards suddenly left me alone, \n     they said, `Every gun in that airport needs an OB/GYN doctor \n     for his wife. They aren't going to mess with you,'''.\n       As Dr. Caudle began his work, he soon discovered that many \n     women were desperate for sterilization, a procedure that was \n     previously illegal in Romania. ``I told the doctors `I don't \n     think it's a good idea for women to be pregnant all the time. \n     What you should be doing is a sterilization procedure called \n     tubal ligation,''' Dr. Caudle recalled. ``I explained it to \n     some patients with the help of one of their doctors, and \n     several volunteered to have it done. The word spread quickly \n     once the women realized what this could mean for them. This \n     was a big step toward getting at least a few people out of a \n     cycle that has kept women constantly pregnant, anemic and \n     sick.''\n       This cycle was only part of a ``reign of terror'' begun \n     under Romania's ruthless dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, who \n     ruled Romania from 1965 until 1989. Wanting to limit \n     individuality and thoughts of freedom, Ceausescu banned \n     education of the humanities and sciences. His rules grew even \n     more despotic when he banned contraceptives and demanded that \n     women bear at least five children.\n       Ceausescu's restrictions and demands bankrupted the country \n     and alienated its people. Romania's discontent led to a \n     revolution in December 1989 when a revolt occurred in the \n     city of Timisoara over the deportation of an ethnic Hungarian \n     pastor. The uprising resulted in the deaths of hundreds when \n     Ceausescu ordered his army to fire on the crowd. Protests \n     began in many cities the day after the massacre, and on \n     December 22, the dictator was forced to leave the country. He \n     was soon captured, however, and executed after a brief trial.\n       In the aftermath of the revolution, Romania is still in a \n     state of social and economic despair. Every aspect of life is \n     reduced to a minimal level, particularly health care. In this \n     setting, Dr. Caudle found himself playing the multiple roles \n     of physician, technician, engineer and teacher.\n       ``You can see the value of people like me spending time \n     there and providing technical instruction. They are finally \n     getting some equipment, but it has just been collecting dust \n     because they don't know how to use it. The key is education. \n     I could go over there and see patients for the rest of my \n     life, but teaching through the university multiplies the \n     effort,'' Dr. Caudle said.\n       With the aid of a translator, Dr. Caudle gave several \n     lectures to the medical students. ``They are very bright. It \n     is quite difficult to get into medical school there,'' he \n     explained. ``They came to class with lists of questions they \n     had spent hours preparing. `How do you do this in America?' \n     or `How do you do that?' They were very well read, but they \n     have old textbooks.''\n       This teaching experience, however, was a two-way street, \n     particularly in the rural settings. Dr. Caudle had to learn \n     to function without the technology he has grown used to in \n     the States. He also learned that maturity and a proven track \n     record are advantageous for medical missions like this one.\n       ``They challenge your authority on everything because they \n     are so well read. They have their own reasons for doing \n     things, and they argue with you,'' Dr. Caudle remembered. \n     ``What I have learned is that there are some things we do in \n     the States that I'm not sure are right anymore. We do them as \n     a habit and they do it differently. Now I can't decide which \n     way is right.''\n       The questions went beyond obstetrical and gynecological \n     issues as Dr. Caudle's first visit came to a close. He \n     realized that the time spent in Romania had influenced him in \n     a profound way. ``Dr. Dragulescu, the rector of the medical \n     school in Timisoara, was thanking me for making sacrifices to \n     come to his country and I said, `Your people died in the \n     streets, your children died. What is it for me to come here \n     for a week compared to what you've been through?' I went over \n     there to help, but what happened was that I found out what \n     was really important to me. It reorients your priorities and \n     how you spend your time,'' he explained.\n       Although he could justifiably feel overwhelmed at the \n     enormity of the problems which exist there, Dr. Caudle feels \n     that he and others can make a difference. ``Romania \n     [[Page S3494]] is like much of the rest of the world. Life \n     there is filled with chronic misery. It's the slow drip of \n     the economy that drags Romanians down, and that's why \n     Americans need to go over there to help,'' he urged. ``Beyond \n     what Americans can accomplish, it's such a privilege to meet \n     so many of these people who are to Romanians what our \n     revolutionary patriots are to us.''\n       This emotional experience was translated into action as Dr. \n     Caudle returned home and began a search to legitimize these \n     types of visits. That search led him to discover an \n     organization on The University of Tennessee's Knoxville \n     campus called the Alliance of Universities for Democracy. \n     Founded in 1990, the group is an alliance of American \n     universities and more than 100 Eastern European members. The \n     Alliance promotes democracy and encourages Eastern European \n     Universities to develop closer relationships with their \n     communities.\n       Beyond legitimizing medical missions, the Alliance also \n     serves as a way for equipment to be shared. ``There are \n     companies in the States that dispose of medical equipment in \n     landfills. Some of that equipment is 20 years ahead of what \n     they have in Romania. These companies are willing to send it \n     over there, and the Alliance gives these kinds of efforts a \n     name--a way to do this sort of thing,'' Dr. Caudle explained.\n       Dr. Caudle completed his second mission trip in June 1994. \n     He also arranged this past October for Rector Dragulescu's \n     first visit to the United States. Dragulescu, a cardiologist, \n     spent time comparing medical technologies with University \n     Medical Center's faculty, as well as formulating an overall \n     picture of health care in this country.\n       Although the rector's visit lasted only two weeks, one of \n     the graduates of a Romanian medical school will be doing a \n     five-year OB/GYN residency at University Medical Center. \n     Totally unrelated to Dr. Caudle's visit, medical student \n     Cristian Andronic applied for the residency program here. \n     Because Dr. Caudle was impressed by and familiar with the \n     medical schools in Romania, he granted Andronic an interview.\n       ``I told him that if he wanted to find a way to get here, \n     we would take a look at him. I'll be darned if he didn't \n     scrape up the money to come, which was close to a year's \n     salary for someone over there. He flew to Chicago and caught \n     a bus to Knoxville,'' Dr. Caudle said. ``He'll be here for \n     several years. My hope is that he will then return to Romania \n     to practice and teach.''\n       These types of exchanges, both short and long term, provide \n     a more realistic view of the United States than the \n     idealistic ones held by many Romanians. ``They love \n     Americans, particularly in western Romania. You see little \n     American flags in the backs of their cars. It's an ideal we \n     can't possibly live up to, but it's also a great opportunity \n     for us,'' Dr. Caudle commented.\n       ``It's a huge obligation to be an American in Romania,'' he \n     added. ``They have read all about George Washington and the \n     founding of our country on principles of freedom and `one \n     nation under God' and they take it all very seriously.''\n       It seems to have all come full circle. He was a post-war \n     boy interested in and bothered by events more than half a \n     world away. He grew up and pursued a career seemingly \n     unrelated to these interests. But his career is precisely \n     what led him to discover this other world. The ideals upon \n     which his country was founded are now held sacred by these \n     faraway people who are no longer strangers.\n       ``My relationship with my friends in Romania has brought \n     all these things about the Iron Curtain, my faith and the \n     reality of these people into one form. You know, they are \n     more like us than they are different. They have the same \n     basic hopes, needs and desires,'' Dr. Caudle concluded.\n       ``Their courage is tremendous and they have taught me a \n     lot. I feel like I'm helping to fight for their freedom \n     because they still don't have it yet--not in the sense of a \n     workable economy, which is necessary to stay free. It would \n     be easy to slowly drift right back into some kind of \n     communistic or totalitarian regime. They have to continue to \n     fight for freedom--it's an elusive thing.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3493-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBILE?

But many \nof them regularly vote in support of bloated spending bills that roll \nthrough the Senate, and the American people took note of that on \nNovember 8.\n  As of Friday, March 3, at the close of business, the Federal debt \nstood--down to the penny--at exactly $4,840,472,285,419.16. \nThis debt, remember, was run up by the Congress of the United States.\n  The Founding Fathers decreed that the big-spending bureaucrats in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government must never be able to spend \neven a dime unless and until authorized and appropriated by the U.S. \nCongress.\n  The U.S. Constitution is quite specific about that, as every \nschoolboy is supposed to know.\n  Do not be misled by politicians who declare that the Federal debt was \nrun up by some previous President or another, depending on party \naffiliation. Sometimes you hear false claims that Ronald Reagan ran it \nup; sometimes they play hit-and-run with George Bush.\n  These buck-passing declarations are false, as I said earlier, because \nthe Congress of the United States is the culprit. The Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives are the big spenders.\n  Mr. President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. It may provide a bit of perspective to \nbear in mind that a billion seconds ago, Mr. President, the Cuban \nmissile crisis was in progress. A billion minutes ago, the crucifixion \nof Jesus Christ had occurred not long before.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective, does it not, that Congress has \nrun up this incredible Federal debt totaling 4,808 of this billions--of \ndollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said earlier, stood \nthis morning at 4 trillion, 840 billion, 472 million, 285 thousand, 419 \ndollars, and 16 cents. It will be even greater at closing time today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3494-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n DEATH OF HOWARD W. HUNTER, PRESIDENT OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF \n                           LATTER-DAY SAINTS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with the family, friends and over 9 \nmillion members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in \ngrieving the death of Howard W. Hunter, president of the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.\n  President Hunter was born November 14, 1907, in Boise, ID, the son of \nJohn William and Nellie Marie Rasmussen Hunter. He had been President \nof the Latter-Day Saints church since June 5, 1994, when he succeeded \nanother Idahoan, the late Ezra Taft Benson. He was known as a gentle, \nkind, and humble man. He will be remembered for his compassionate \nnature, which blended well with his thoughtful, orderly leadership \nstyle. Howard W. Hunter was a soft-spoken man who stressed love, \nforgiveness, and attendance at the temples of the church.\n  During his long life, Howard W. Hunter was noted for his hard work \nand strength of character.\n  President Hunter began working early in life in Boise, selling \nnewspapers on street corners, delivering telegrams, and later working \nin a newspaper office. He excelled scholastically and was active in the \nScouting Program, becoming the second Boy Scout in Idaho to attain the \nrank of Eagle Scout. He became interested in music as a young boy, won \na marimba in a high school contest and became proficient with the \nsaxophone, clarinet, violin, and drums. As a young man he organized a \ndance band and in 1927 the band, called Hunter's Croonaders, went on a \n5-month Asian cruise abroad the S.S. President Jackson. He gave up a \npromising musical profession in favor of marriage, family life, church \nservice, and his law career.\n  Howard W. Hunter enjoyed a successful career as a corporate attorney \nand served as a director of a number corporations, including Beneficial \nLife Insurance Co., First Security Corp., and New World Archaeological \nFoundation.\n  President Howard H. Hunter spent a life of service to others and will \nbe missed by all those who came to know him and were the recipient of \nhis many years of dedicated service.\n  I would ask all Senators to join with me in a heartfelt thank you to \nHoward W. Hunter and an expression of comfort to his surviving wife, \nInis Bernice Egan, his sons John J. Hunter and Richard A. Hunter, and \nhis 18 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3494-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3494-S3495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               MATT URBAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a friend of mine named Matt Urban passed \naway over the weekend, leaving a legacy of superlative achievement in a \nmilitary career that will enlighten generations to come about what it \nmeans to be a soldier, a patriot and a hero.\n  [[Page S3495]] I would like to share my memory of Matt Urban and a \nfew of the things that impressed us in Michigan about this citizen and \ncivic leader, this family man who was I believe the most decorated \nsoldier in the history of the U.S. military.\n  He will be remembered in our hearts and in our history books for his \nstaggering courage and fearless valor in the face of the grave danger \nthat comes with war. Duty to country and loyalty to the men with whom \nhe fought side-by-side drove him on the battlefields of victorious \ncampaigns across North Africa, Sicily, Normandy, and Belgium in World \nWar II.\n  Matt's military career was legendary. Indeed, his exploits on the \nbattlefield are larger than life. He earned 29 combat medals, including \nseven Purple Hearts, the Medal of Honor, the American Campaign Medal, \nand French Croix de Guerre with a Silver gilt Star. Each and every \nmedal tells a story of a man who seemed to show no fear, a man \ndetermined to carry on the fight for freedom for his countrymen.\n  His final Medal of Honor, awarded in a White House ceremony in 1980, \nmarked an act of heroism that had come to characterize his feats in \ncombat. He rescued his men, who were caught in a hail of German \ngunfire, by climbing aboard an empty tank and training its cannon on \nthe enemy.\n  We all pray the battles Matt Urban survived are the likes of which no \nsoldier will ever see again.\n  These battles were waged at a great cost, but they also gained great \nand lasting rewards for our Nation and our allies. Matt Urban was a \ndisciple for democracy, fighting hard battles in the trenches of Europe \nso that we and our grandchildren may live free from tyranny and \nprosper.\n  Matt Urban's greatness was not just on the battlefield. In Monroe and \nlater in Holland, MI he served as a valued employee in their recreation \ndepartments working to make the lives of children from those towns \nbrighter and happier. He capped his career as a city employee in \nHolland managing the civic center, an ideal vocation for one of our \nState's leading citizens.\n  While Matt Urban's body is laid to rest, his memory and impact on our \nlives lingers on. As a member of a screening committee I assembled to \nnominate Michigan's finest young men and women for appointments at our \nmilitary academies, he served as the vibrant link connecting \nyesterday's soldier to tomorrow's generation of new leadership. The \ntradition of duty, honor, and country and the motivation to do right \nthat he inspired in the lives he touched continues today in the spirits \nof the young men and women he helped usher into new military careers.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3494-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3495-S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT--A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Tuesday last, February 28, 1995, the \nSenate was supposed to vote on the final disposition of the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. It may be of interest \nto my colleagues to know that exactly 200 hundred years ago, on \nFebruary 28, 1795, the Senate was meeting at Congress Hall in \nPhiladelphia, then the nation's capital. Our information is incomplete \nabout the details of that day's session because, as was its practice at \nthat time, the Senate met behind closed doors and kept only the \nbriefest of minutes as required by the Constitution. What we do know, \nbased on news accounts derived from members who were willing to talk to \nlocal journalists, is that Senators were most concerned that day about \npaying the government's debts and raising further income to meet \ngrowing expenses.\n  The Senate debated and approved, by a vote of 21-1, ``An act making \nfurther provision for the support of Public Credit, and for the \nRedemption of the Public Debt.'' The Senate rejected four proposed \namendments, including an amendment offered by Senator Aaron Burr to \nrequire repayment, during a 12-20-year period, of the principal on a \nsubscription loan to fund the foreign debt. As ultimately enacted, the \nbill required that ``the principal of the said loan may be reimbursed \nat any time, at the pleasure of the United States.'' This suggested the \nSenate's majority recognized that the government might not be in a \nposition to repay its loans within Burr's 12-20-year period. Lenders to \nthe government would have to be satisfied with repayment at some \nindefinite time in the future.\n  Related to this concern about managing for government expenditures, \nthe Senate also approved committee amendments to a bill to require the \nComptroller of the Treasury to order the submission of accounts and \nvouchers by all individuals who had received public funds, and to file \nsuit against individuals who had failed to comply, and ordered that the \nbill pass to a third reading.\n  Concerned with revenue sources, the Senate also received from the \nHouse and referred to a committee a bill that would impose duties on \nsnuff and refined sugar.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings of \nFebruary 28, 1795, as shown in the ``Annals of Congress,'' along with \nthe ``Act for the Support of Public Credit and for the Redemption of \nthe Public Debt,'' which was passed on March 3, 1795, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the historical material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the ``Annals of Congress''--Senate Proceedings, February 28, \n                                 1795]\n\nSaturday, February 28.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       On motion, to insert the following section after the 5th, \n     to wit:\n       ``Be it further enacted, That a Loan be opened at the \n     Treasury to the full amount of the outstanding and unbarred \n     new emission bills of credit, the sums which shall be \n     subscribed to be payable in the principal and interest of \n     such bills, computing the interest thereon to the first day \n     of January next, and that the subscriber or subscribers shall \n     be entitled to receive therefor a certificate for the amount \n     of the principal sum so subscribed and paid, bearing an \n     interest of five per centum per annum from the first day of \n     January next, payable quarter yearly at the Treasury, and \n     redeemable at the pleasure of the United States, by the \n     payment of the sum specified therein, and containing a \n     stipulation that the United States will redeem the same \n     before the expiration of thirty years from the passing of \n     this act, and also to another certificate for the amount of \n     the interest on the sum so subscribed, computing the same to \n     the first of January next, bearing an interest of three per \n     centum per annum from the first day of January next, payable \n     quarter yearly at the Treasury, and redeemable at the \n     pleasure of the United States, by the payment of the sum \n     specified therein:''\n       It passed in the negative.\n       On motion, by Mr. Burr, to add the following proviso to the \n     11th section, to wit:\n       ``Provided, nevertheless, That, whenever the six per cent. \n     stock shall be under par, it shall be the duty of the \n     Commissioners of the Sinking Fund to lay out, in the purchase \n     of the said stock, the money applicable to the payment of the \n     said two per cent. of principal, or so much thereof as can be \n     laid out in the purchase thereof, at a rate under par:''\n       It passed in the negative.\n       On motion, by Mr. Burr, to expunge the last section of the \n     bill, to wit:\n       ``Sec. 20.

Mr. President, let me just take a moment to indicate that \nwe have not yet given up on this side of the Capitol on the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  I view the one-vote loss as a temporary setback. I am very optimistic \nabout passing the balanced budget amendment with the necessary two-\nthirds vote in this Congress. It means either this year or next year. \nWe will be making every effort, not only on this side of the aisle, but \nalong with Senator Simon on the other side of the aisle, to secure one \nadditional vote. That is all it takes, one additional vote. We can call \nit up, reconsider it, no debate, and then vote on the balanced budget \namendment; no debate, 67 votes, and it will then go to the States for \nratification.\n  I hope that any of my colleagues who may have voted the other way \nhave had time to think about this seriously. It is an item supported by \n80 percent of the American people. It is a discipline we need in the \nCongress of the United States. My view is its time has come and, in my \nview, it will happen this Congress. And I hope that we will have even \nmore than the 67 votes required.\n  All those who have been frightening and trying to scare senior \ncitizens, I suggest that has not been effective. We have indicated from \nthe start that we are not touching Social Security, and we will proceed \non that basis in the budget discussions. I guess we will determine \nbefore many weeks who really is serious about reducing the deficit and \nabout getting to a balanced budget. For all those who indicated in \ntheir statements that we do not need a balanced budget amendment to do \nthat, we will have an opportunity to determine which one of those \nSenators meant what they said, or which others were just saying it \nbecause it might be something people like to hear in their States.\n  But, again, I ask those who voted with us last year on the balanced \nbudget amendment to search their conscience, dig out their old speeches \nand their old press releases and their old campaign spots, and take \nanother look at the amendment that lost by one vote. It was identical, \nwith the exception of a change of date from 2001 to 2002 and with the \nso-called Nunn language, which we think improved the amendment.\n  This is something that should not be given up easily. We intend to \npursue it.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nbipartisan efforts to reach the magic number of 67.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3504-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3504-S3510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 244, the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995. This legislation was, this year as last year, \nreported out unanimously from the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nreflecting the bipartisan efforts of Senators Nunn, Glenn, and myself.\n  The legislation reaffirms the fundamental purpose of the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1980--to reduce the paperwork burden imposed on the \npublic by the Federal Government. But it does much more. It increases \nthe scope of the act by 50 percent in overturning the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Dole v. United Steelworkers of America. In that case the \nSupreme Court surprised many of us who had worked on fashioning this \nlegislation by limiting OMB's authority to review Government \ncollections of information only to those instances where the paperwork \nflowed from a private party to the Government and thus excluded \ninstances where the Government requires information to be provided to \nanother party.\n  By overturning the Dole case, all paperwork falls under the act and \nis thereby subject to review by the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs.\n  Under the act, each agency--and the act covers all agencies, even \nindependent agencies--must analyze each information collection for its \nneed and its practical utility. All such information collections, even \nthose of independent agencies, must be approved by OIRA before they \nbecome effective.\n  The legislation also authorizes appropriations for OIRA for 5 more \nyears at $8 million each year. OIRA is not only the hub of the wheel in \nenforcing this act but has come to play a significant role in executing \nexecutive orders on the subject of regulatory review. As we work in \ncommittee to draft comprehensive regulatory reform legislation, it is \nclear that OIRA will have even a greater role. This authorization of \ngreater appropriations is a very important provision.\n  The paperwork burden produced by Government's enormous appetite for \ninformation is an ever increasing problem. The fact that the problem is \ngrowing does not mean that the efforts under the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1980 have not been worthwhile. The problem would have been even \nworse without such efforts. The mechanism for reducing burdens cannot \nbe faulted because Congress passes more laws that generate more \npaperwork.\n  Now, the legislation before us recognizes that an information \ncollection may be problematic not only because the collection has no \npublic utility but also because the collector may already have access \nto the information and need not bother our citizenry with a request for \nthe same information. I applaud the efforts of GAO to underscore this \nsimple truth by highlighting the \n[[Page S3505]] benefits of information resources management. This \nlegislation effectuates the principle that information resources \nmanagement and reduction of paperwork burden are two sides of the same \ncoin. While some may view the two aspects as competing for scarce OIRA \nresources, that view is mistaken. The two aspects are inextricably \nlinked.\n  This legislation enjoys widespread support among the business \ncommunity, both big and small, as well as among State and local \ngovernments and the people, all who bear the burden of Federal \nGovernment paperwork collections. They all will be pleased to see that \nthis legislation strengthens the paperwork reduction aspects of the act \nand that, in particular, it retains the direction of OIRA that it \nmanage the paperwork burden on the public to achieve a 5-percent annual \nreduction.\n  Paperwork burdens, like other regulatory burdens, are a hidden tax on \nthe American people--a tax without measure, a tax unrestricted by \nbudgetary or constitutional limitations, but a tax no less real.\n  Government paperwork collections are a burden on the public. The \nlegislation indicates an increased sensitivity to that fact by \nrequiring each agency to develop a paperwork clearance process to \nreview and solicit public comment on proposed information collections \nbefore submitting them to OMB for review. Public accountability is also \nstrengthened through requirements for public disclosure of \ncommunications with OMB regarding information collections--with \nprotections for whistleblowers complaining of unauthorized \ncollections--and for OMB to review the status of any information \ncollection upon public request. In combination with more general \nrequirements, such as encouraging data sharing between the Federal \nGovernment and State and local and tribal governments, this legislation \nstrives to further the goals of the act of minimizing government \ninformation collection burdens while maximizing the utility of \ngovernment information.\n  With regard to the act's over-arching information resources \nmanagement--IRM--policies, the legislation charges agency heads with \nthe responsibility to carry out agency IRM activities to improve agency \nproductivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It makes program officials \nresponsible and accountable for those information resources supporting \ntheir programs. The IRM mandate is strengthened by focusing on managing \ninformation resources in order to improve program performance, \nincluding the delivery of services to the public and the reduction of \ninformation collection burdens on the public.\n  With the Federal Government spending approximately $25 billion a year \non information technology, the stakes are too high not to press for the \nmost efficient and effective management of information resources. With \nsuch improvements in information resources management, the reduction of \ninformation collection burdens on the public and maximizing the utility \nof government information will not otherwise occur.\n  This legislation is not the final word on the very important subject \nof information technology. The committee will be fashioning legislation \nlater this session to restructure and redesign the Federal Government \nfor the 21st century. One essential aspect of a modern Federal \nGovernment is the effective use of information technology to better \naccomplish public missions at lower costs. We will be back.\n  Finally, I want to underscore a point to which Senators Glenn, Nunn, \nand I gave considerable attention. This legislation is a rewrite of the \n1980 act. Its form is necessitated by the number of technical and other \nchanges made. This form is in no way intended to start a new \nlegislative history with the 1995 act. Rather, this legislation is only \na pro tanto modification intended to carry on the legislative history \nof the 1980 act. The report, at page 3, makes this very same point. \nThis is an important point. It should be noted by anyone interested in \nthe legislative history that guides the interpretation of the Paperwork \nReduction Act.\n  In closing, I wish to commend my colleagues, Senator Glenn and \nSenator Nunn, for their cooperation and patience in fashioning \nlegislation on a very, very complex subject. This legislation, in my \nopinion, merits the full support of every Member.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, today, the Senate turns to consideration of \nS. 244, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. As the Senator from \nDelaware, my good friend, Senator Roth, has already explained, this \nbill reauthorizes appropriations for the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs [OIRA] and it strengthens the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1980. This represents years of hard work which began in the \n100th Congress.\n  S. 244 is substantially identical to S. 560, the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1994, which was approved by the Senate, not once but twice in \nthe closing days of the last Congress. It passed the Senate by \nunanimous voice vote on October 6, 1994. the following day, the text of \nS. 560 was attached to a House-passed measure, H.R. 2561, and returned \nto the House. Unfortunately, it was not cleared for action before the \nadjournment of the 103d Congress. The House of Representatives did not \nact on it.\n  Like S. 560 in the last Congress, S. 244 enjoys strong bipartisan \nsupport. Chairman Roth and Senator Glenn are both original cosponsors. \nBoth have worked long and hard on this needed legislation to strengthen \nthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and to reauthorize appropriations \nfor OIRA. The crafting of a consensus bill in the last Congress was \nmade possible by the skill and leadership of my friend from Ohio, Mr. \nGlenn, and my friend from Delaware, Mr. Roth.\n  Leading cosponsors of S. 244 also include the new chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business, Senator Kit Bond, and the committee's \nranking Democratic member, Senator Bumpers. Former Chairman Bumpers and \nsuccessive ranking Republican members of the Committee on Small \nBusiness, including Senators Boschwitz, Kasten, and Pressler, have been \noriginal cosponsors of the predecessor legislation in the 101st and \n102d Congress. The Committee on Small Business, of which I am a member \nas well as the Governmental Affairs Committee, has played a crucial \nsupporting role in sustaining the effort to enact legislation to \nstrengthen the 1980 act. Such support is not surprising since relief \nfrom paperwork and regulatory burdens is vital to the small business \ncommunity. It has become a focus of activity for the Committee on Small \nBusiness, the Committee on Governmental Affairs, and several other \ncommittees in the Senate as well as their counterparts in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This year we are being joined by colleagues from both sides of the \naisle, many of whom are present or former members of the Committee on \nSmall Business as well as the Committee on Governmental Affairs. When \nintroduced, S. 244 had 21 bipartisan cosponsors. My friend from \nMississippi, Mr. Lott, as inadvertently omitted from the list. He \nshould have been on the list when it was originally introduced.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lott be added to \nlist of original cosponsors to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as additional cosponsors--Senator Stevens, \nSenator Akaka, Senator Grassley, Senator Thomas, Senator Cohen, Senator \nThompson, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator D'Amato.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. In this Congress, the House of Representatives is decidedly \nmore receptive to this legislation. A modified version of S. 560 was \nincluded in H.R. 9, the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995, \nwhich includes many of the regulatory and paperwork relief provisions \nof the Republican Contract With America. Representatives Bill Clinger, \nthe new chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform and \nOversight, the new name for the Committee on Government Operations, was \nthe principal Republican cosponsor to H.R. 2995, the House companion to \nS. 560 in the last Congress. So he has been working on this a long \ntime. In this Congress, he introduced H.R. 830, the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1995, with Representatives Norm Sisisky as the principal \nDemocratic cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\n  I might add Representative Sisisky has worked on this legislation for \nseveral years with me, including trying last year to get this \nlegislation through the House in the last couple of weeks of the \nsession. On February 22, the House passed H.R. 830 by a rollcall vote \nof 418-0.\n  Like the reported version of S. 560 in the last Congress, S. 244 has \nthe support of the Clinton administration. During testimony before the \nHouse Small Business Committee on Friday, January 27, Sally Katzen, \nAdministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, \nstated the administration's support for S. 244.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 enjoys strong support from the \nbusiness community, especially the small business committee. It has the \nsupport of a broad Paperwork Reduction Act coalition, representing \nvirtually every segment of the business community. Participating in the \ncoalition are the major national small business associations--the \nNational Federation of Independent Business [NFIB], the Small Business \nLegislative Council [SBLC], and National Small Business United [NSBU], \nas well as the many specialized national small business association, \nlike the American Subcontractors Association, that comprise the \nmembership of SBLC or NSBU. Other participants represent manufacturers, \naerospace and electronics firms, construction firms, providers of \nprofessional and technical services, retailers of various products and \nservices, and the wholesalers and distributors who support them.\n  Leadership for the coalition is being provided by the Council on \nRegulatory and Information Management, known as C-RIM and by the U.S \nChamber of Commerce. C-RIM is the new name for the Business Council on \nthe Reduction of Paperwork, which has dedicated itself to paperwork \nreduction and regulatory reform issues for more than a half century. \nWhile he was C-RIM's executive director, Bob Coakley worked tirelessly \non advancing this legislation. Bob came to C-RIM after many years of \nservice to the Committee on Governmental Affairs, especially for our \nformer colleague, Lawton Chiles, the father of the Paperwork Reduction \nAct of 1980, when he was in the Senate. Of course he is now Governor of \nFlorida.\n  The coalition also includes a number of professional associations and \npublic interest groups that support strengthening the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1980. These include the Association of Records \nManagers and Administrators [ARMA] and Citizens for a Sound Economy \n[CSE], to name but two very active coalition members.\n  Given the regulatory and paperwork burdens faced by State and local \ngovernments, legislation to strengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act is \nhigh on the agenda of the associations representing elected officials. \nAs Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, has worked hard on this issue \nwithin the National Governors Association. During its 1994 annual \nmeeting, the National Governors Association adopted a resolution in \nsupport of legislation to strengthen the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1980.\n  The principal purpose of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 is to \nreaffirm and provide additional tools by which to attain the \nfundamental objective of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980--to \nminimize the Federal paperwork burdens imposed on individuals, \nbusinesses, especially small businesses, educational and nonprofit \ninstitutions, and State and local governments.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 provides a 5-year reauthorization \nof appropriations for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n[OIRA]. Created by the 1980 act, OIRA serves as the focal point at OMB \nfor the Act' implementation. OIRA is also the\n focal point for the regulatory review process, which is exercised \nunder an Executive order. As the Congress undertakes its fundamental \nchanges to the Government processes for the formulation of regulations, \nOIRA's role and its broad authorities under the Paperwork Reduction Act \nwill be become even more obvious.\n\n  I would like to highlight just a few of the provisions of the bill. \nIt reemphasizes the fundamental responsibilities of each Federal agency \nto minimize new paperwork burdens by thoroughly reviewing each proposed \ncollection of information for need and practical utility, the act's \nfundamental standards--need and practical utility. The bill makes \nexplicit the responsibility of each Federal agency to conduct this \nreview itself, before submitting the proposed collection of information \nfor public comment and clearance by OIRA in the Office of Management \nand Budget.\n  The bill before us reflects the provisions of S. 560 that further \nenhance public participation in the review of paperwork burdens, when \nthey are first being proposed or when an agency is seeking to obtain \napproval to continue to use an existing paperwork requirement. \nStrengthening public participation is at the core of the 1980 act and \nis strengthened even further in this act.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 maintains the 1980 act's \nGovernmentwide 5-percent goal for the reduction of paperwork burdens on \nthe public. Given past experience, some question the effectiveness of \nsuch goals in producing net reductions in Governmentwide paperwork \nburdens. The Coalition believe that the bill should reflect individual \nagency goals as well. If seriously implemented, the proponents argue \nthat such agency goals can become an effective restraint on the \ncumulative growth of Government-sponsored paperwork burdens. Although \nthis provision is not in the bill before the committee today, I am \nhopeful that it will be strengthened in this manner before becoming \nlaw.\n  The bill includes amendments to the 1980 act which further empower \nmembers of the public to help police Federal agency compliance with the \nact. I would like to describe two of these provisions.\n  One provision would enable a member of the public to obtain a written \ndetermination from the OIRA Administrator regarding whether a federally \nsponsored paperwork requirement is in compliance with the act. If the \nagency paperwork requirement is found to be noncompliant, the \nAdministrator is charged with taking appropriate remedial action. This \nprovision is based upon a similar process added to the Office of \nFederal Procurement Policy Act in 1988.\n  The second provision encourages members of the public to identify \npaperwork requirements that have not been submitted for review and \napproval pursuant to the act's requirements. Although the act's public \nprotection provisions explicitly shield the public from the imposition \nof any formal agency penalty for failing to comply with such an \nunapproved, or bootleg, paperwork requirement, individuals often feel \ncompelled to comply. This is especially true when the individual has an \nongoing relationship with the agency and that relationship accords the \nagency substantial discretion that could be used to redefine their \nfuture dealings. In other words, leverage. Under S. 244, a member of \nthe public can blow the whistle on such a bootleg paperwork requirement \nand be accorded the protection of anonymity.\n  Next, I would like to emphasize that the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1995 clarifies the 1980 act to make explicit that it applies to \nGovernment-sponsored third-party paperwork burdens. These are \nrecordkeeping, disclosure, or other paperwork burdens that one private \nparty imposes on another private party at the direction of a Federal \nagency. In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that such Government-\nsponsored third-party paperwork burdens were not subject to the \nPaperwork Reduction Act.\n  That was contrary to the authors' original intent as has been often \nstated by the Governor of Florida, then-Senator Lawton Chiles.\n  The Court's decision in Dole versus United Steelworkers of America \ncreated a potentially vast loophole. The public could be denied the \nact's protections on the basis of the manner in which a Federal agency \nchose to impose a paperwork burden, indirectly rather than directly. It \nis worthy of note that Lawton Chiles went to the trouble and expense of \nfiling an amicus brief to the Supreme Court arguing that no such \nexemption for third-party paperwork burdens was intended. Given the \nplain works of the statute, the Court decided otherwise. The bill makes \nexplicit the act's coverage of all Government-sponsored paperwork \nburdens. Once this bill is enacted, we can feel confident that this \nmajor loophole \n[[Page S3507]] will be closed. But given more than a decade of \nexperience under the act, it is prudent to remain vigilant to \nadditional efforts to restrict the act's reach and public protections.\n  The smart use of information by the Government, and its potential to \nminimize the burdens placed on the public, is a core concept of the \n1980 act. The information resources management [IRM] provisions of the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995 build upon the foundation laid more \nthan a decade ago by our former colleague from Florida. These \nprovisions of S. 244 are the major contribution of my friend from Ohio, \nwho has emphasized the potential of improved IRM policies to make \nGovernment more effective in serving the Public.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize the contributions of several \nstaff members. First, David Plocher, counsel for Senator Glenn, who \nalong with Tony Coe, an associate counsel in the Office of Senate \nLegislative Counsel, did much of the drafting. Next, I would like to \nrecognize Frank Polk, the committee's Republican staff director, who \nassisted Senator Roth over the many years of effort that have gotten us \nto this point,\n and also on my staff Rocky Rief and Matthew Sikes, who have been \ndiligent in working on this legislation; and, finally, certainly not \nleast and probably more than any other individual person, Bill \nMontalto, who has provided assistance to me as well as Chairman Bumpers \nand the ranking Republican members of the Small Business Committee. In \nthis and many other efforts Bill has served well many Members of the \nSenate, the Committee on Small Business, and indeed the entire small \nbusiness community. For 13 years, Bill Montalto has served the Small \nBusiness Committee. Six years prior to that he was in the service of \nthe U.S. Army. He was there a lawyer and counsel and a logistics \nspecialist.\n\n  I have had an opportunity to work with this remarkable public servant \nfor all of those 13 years as he served the Small Business Committee. We \nhave worked on a number of legislative initiatives, such as the mentor-\nprotege program which is now functioning. On the Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act, Bill brought his expertise in the small business \narena to bear in that legislation which was passed by the Armed \nServices Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee, and helped \ninitiate and further small business development centers that are \noperating all over the country. Bill was invaluable in his creation of \nthe concept of developing that legislation. The SBA 504 program, no one \nknows more about that program than Bill, and the SBA Preferred Surety \nBond Program and numerous others which have helped our small business \ncommunity.\n  Bill will be leaving the Small Business Committee on the Senate side, \nand my understanding is that he will be going to a key position on the \nSmall Business Committee on the House side. So we will continue, \nhopefully, to benefit from his advice and his expertise and his \ndedication in all of these areas.\n  So to Bill Montalto I owe a special debt of gratitude today, and I am \nsure Senator Bumpers, who was chairman of the Small Business Committee, \nnow ranking Democrat, and others who have worked with him would echo my \nsentiments expressed here today. I am sure Senator Bond and others who \nhave worked on this legislation, also, would certainly know that Bill \nhas done a wonderful job here.\n  Mr. President, with those comments, I urge my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation. I hope we can pass it today or certainly tomorrow. And I \nhope that we will be able to have a meeting of the minds with the House \nand send this bill to the President. It is long overdue. I think it \nwill help begin to alleviate some of the crushing burden of paperwork \nfor so much of our business community.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise in \nsupport of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, S. 244. As an original \ncosponsor, I see this legislation playing a critical role in the \nbroader initiative to minimize Government regulatory and paperwork \nburdens imposed at the Federal level.\n  I want to say a very special thanks to Chairman Roth for moving this \nbill through his committee. We have given his committee the great \nblessing of about two-thirds of the urgent legislation to be brought \nbefore the Senate. We thank him for moving this bill forward.\n  In addition, a very special thanks to the Senator from Georgia [Mr. \nNunn] who has long been a champion of paperwork reduction who has \nworked long and hard. With his leadership we passed this several times \nin the Senate. As he indicated in his opening remarks, it now looks \nlike we have a receptive majority in the House. I am hopeful that the \ngood work that those two friends, as well as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio, Senator Glenn, have put in, along with Senator Bumpers, my \npredecessor, will bear fruit.\n  Small businesses are especially hard hit by excessive regulatory and \npaperwork burdens imposed by the Federal bureaucracy. Each time I \nreturn home to my State of Missouri, small business owners come up to \nme and say how the unnecessary burdens of Federal regulations are \nreally crushing them. The Federal requirements too often force these \nhard-working men and women and small business owners to divert time, \nenergy, and their resources away from productive activities, reducing \nthe competitiveness of the business and impeding their growth.\n  As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I have had the \nopportunity to hear a lot from people around the country in the last \nfew months. They are the ones who seem to be crying ``enough'' during \nlast November's election. They have told us they are fed up with \nGovernment that is inefficient and wasteful. They want that to change. \nThey are unhappy with the Government's failure to meet their \nexpectations in carrying out its responsibility.\n  People want Government to work well. Basic governmental functions to \ninsure we have clean water to drink, safe medicines to take, and safe \nfood to eat are sought by all Americans. But they look at our \nGovernment today and see an institution that must be brought under \ncontrol.\n  And it is not hard to understand their frustration. The paperwork \nburden imposed on Americans in 1993 totaled 6.6 billion hours. Small \nbusinesses alone spend 1 billion hours simply filling out Government \npaperwork at an annual cost of $100 billion. Furthermore, Government \nregulation costs individuals and businesses more than $500 billion \nannually or about $5,000 per family. Just imagine the potential benefit \nto our economy if some of this valuable time could have been spent on \nproduct development or sales.\n  First, let me assure my colleagues that the Paperwork Reduction Act \nof 1995 will not impose new regulatory burdens on individuals and \nbusinesses. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, we expect more from the \nagencies, not from the public. Whenever an agency imposes a paperwork \nrequirement, it must estimate the total amount of time needed to \nfulfill the requirement. The burden is not merely how long it takes to \ncomplete the Government form, report or survey. A greater burden is \nlikely to be the time necessary to understand the requirement, identify \nthe information needed to respond, compile the data, and then submit it \nin the required format. It is likely the Government format is vastly \ndifferent from how the small business owner maintains the data.\n  The Council on Regulation and Information Management [C-RIM], a group \nwhich has sought since 1942 to rationalize and minimize the Federal \nregulatory and paperwork reduction processes, believes that Federal \nagencies underestimate the total time burden imposed by their paperwork \nby nearly one-third. C-RIM believes the actual burden is closer to 10 \nbillion hours, not the 6.6 billion claimed by Federal agencies. If you \nestimate compliance cost at $50 per hour, the annual cost of federally \nimposed paperwork burdens totals $500 billion.\n  As a nation, we cannot afford to continue to heap new paperwork and \nregulatory burdens on individuals and businesses. While recognizing \nthat the total Federal paperwork burden has continued to grow, the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 has brought some successes. First, the \n1980 act assures that the public will have an opportunity to comment \nupon proposed Federal paperwork burdens and to suggest \n[[Page S3508]] ways to collect necessary information in a less \nburdensome way. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 strengthens \nparticipation by the public. Small businesses will have an opportunity \nearlier in the process to shed light on the practical business reality \non a proposed paperwork requirement. In this bill, we are giving them \nopportunities to point out when nearly identical information is being \ncollected by another Federal agency. In addition, small businesses will \nbe able to comment on the timing of the submission of the data as well \nas the format.\n  Recently, the House of Representatives passed its version of the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995. It is very appropriate that we in the \nSenate act on this important legislation today. This act is part of a \nbroad down payment on the regulatory relief program we must pass if\n we expect Americans to maintain trust and respect in their Government.\n\n  Another bill I hope we will consider soon is S. 350, the Regulatory \nFlexibility Amendments Act of 1995. Earlier this year, I introduced \nthis bill to remove the prohibition against judicial review of agency \ncompliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The purpose of the Reg \nFlex Act is very simple. It rejects the notion that one size fits all \nunder Government regulations. Under this act, Federal regulators must \ntake into account the needs of small business in drafting new \nregulations.\n  The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy is charged with monitoring Federal \nagency compliance with the Reg Flex Act. Unfortunately, too often \nregulators in some Federal agencies give mere lipservice to the Reg \nFlex Act requirements, because the Reg Flex Act specifically prohibits \njudicial enforcement of the law's requirements. As a result, too many \nFederal regulators have ignored their responsibilities under the act, \neven when the Chief Counsel for Advocacy notifies the agencies of their \nfailure to comply.\n  My bill is intended to encourage Federal agencies to comply with \ntheir reg flex obligations by permitting small businesses to go into \nFederal court to enforce compliance by an agency. The judge also will \nhave the freedom to stay implementation of a regulation until the \nagency comes into compliance. On March 8, I will chair a hearing before \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business to receive testimony from public \nand private witnesses on how to implement better the Reg Flex Act. It \nis my intention to review other administrative remedies to enforce the \nReg Flex Act so new regulations are written correctly in the first \nplace, so the need to challenge agencies in Federal court might be \nminimized.\n  Mr. President, when I first elected to the U.S. Senate, I did not \nrealize so much of my time would be devoted to getting the Government \noff the backs of individuals and small businesses. As the co-chair of \nthe Senate Regulatory Relief Task Force, we have targeted for reform \nthe 10 worst regulatory burdens. This move will help small businesses, \nwho are the hardest hit by many of these burdensome regulations. We \nneed to reinforce the notion that our Government should be a friend of \nsmall business. Government should not be an enemy of growth and new \njobs. Unfortunately, today we find a regulatory environment that \ncreates too many roadblocks that impede the growth of small business.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 is an important step toward \nbringing our Government under control. For our Government to demand \npaperwork requiring 10 billion hours per year to fill out is a sign \nthat much work needs to be done to reach this goal. This bill will help \nmove us in the right direction, and I urge to support its passage.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today we begin consideration of S. 244, the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This is a badly needed piece of \nlegislation, and enjoys broad bipartisan support. Americans are \ndrowning in paperwork and need relief now.\n  This legislation is an important part of our package of reforms to \ndownsize Government; to get the Government off the backs of the \nAmerican people. Together with regulatory reform and unfunded mandates \nlegislation, paperwork reduction is an important step forward toward \nimproving the lives of ordinary Americans by injecting some common \nsense into the requirements of the Federal Government on our citizens.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 strengthens the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1980 by setting a goal of reducing the paperwork \nburdens imposed by the Federal Government by 5 percent; clarifying that \nthe act will apply to all Government-sponsored collections of \ninformation; and strengthening and improving both information \ntechnology management and information dissemination. These are reforms \nand improvements that are long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I have had many people, particularly those with small \nbusinesses, tell me that they would be willing to forgo some aspects of \na Federal program that might benefit them if only they could be \nprotected from unnecessary paperwork as well. As it is, the burdens \ninvolved are nothing more than a tax: a tax on our productivity. This \ncosts America jobs. It deters those who would otherwise open businesses \nfrom doing so; and it is often the difference between a successful and \na failing business.\n  The American people spoke clearly in last November's elections: \n``rein in big government.'' They want and deserve a smaller and more \nresponsive Government. They also want and deserve a system of \nGovernment that respects the intentions of the Founding Fathers as \nreflected in the 10th amendment to the Constitution: Those powers not \ndelegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the people and to \nthe States.\n  The 10th amendment is not merely an abstract point of political \nphilosophy--it reflects the voice of experience by those who understood \nthat Government works best when it governs least and when decisions are \nmade at the level closest to the people. Decisions about what to \nrequire in the way of forms, justifications, documentation and \nrecordkeeping made in Washington, DC, often lack this sense of the \npractical limits on Government. Thus, what may seem perfectly \nreasonable to a bureaucrat in Washington, DC--who only deals with his \nor her specific program--is experienced by many Americans as an \nexercise in frustration, and often of harassment. When you multiply \nthat one bureaucrat by the literally thousands of programs that seem \nreasonable in a vacuum, it does not take long to see that we have the \nrecipe for disaster.\n  Mr. President, when everyone is in charge, no one is in charge. Thus, \nwe cannot absolve ourselves of the burdens caused by the executive \nbranch that is, after all, attempting to carry our what it believes to \nthe dictates of Congress. Congress has an important role--indeed, an \nobligation--to exercise the kind of oversight that reins in the \nexcesses of Government. S. 244 is an important step forward, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am very happy that we are today one \nimportant step closer to reauthorization of the Paperwork Reduction \nAct. This law is essential to reducing the burdens of Government \npaperwork on the American people. The law is also key to improving the \nmanagement of Federal Government information systems--this is essential \nbecause the Federal Government is now spending $25 billion a year on \ninformation technology.\n  The bill we bring to the floor today is the product of several years \nof bipartisan effort. In fact, this bill is virtually identical to the \nbill passed by unanimous consent in October 1994. This year, I hope we \ncan quickly go all the way and get the bill signed into law.\n  Our bill makes important improvements to the 1980 Paperwork Reduction \nAct. It strengthens the paperwork clearance process and information \nresources management--both in OMB and the agencies:\n  We reauthorize the act for 5 years;\n  We overturn the Dole versus United Steelworkers Supreme Court \ndecision, so that information disclosure requirements are covered by \nthe OMB paperwork clearance process;\n  We require agencies to evaluate paperwork proposals and solicit \npublic comment on them before the proposals go to OMB for review;\n  We create additional opportunities for the public to participate in \npaperwork clearance and other information management decisions;\n  [[Page S3509]] We strengthen agency and OMB information resources \nmanagement [IRM] requirements;\n  We establish information dissemination standards and require the \ndevelopment of a Government Information Locator Service [GILS] to \nensure improved public access to Government information, especially \nthat maintained in electronic format; and\n  We make other improvements in the areas of Government statistics, \nrecords management, computer security, and the management of \ninformation technology.\n  These are important reforms and improvements to the act. We should \nact on this legislation quickly.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nsupport from the Paperwork Reduction Act Coalition and individual \nmember organizations may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Paperwork Reduction\n\n\n                                                Act Coalition,\n\n                                                    March 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: The organizations comprising the \n     steering committee of the Paperwork Reduction Act Coalition \n     wish to express our strong and enthusiastic support for S. \n     244, the ``Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.''\n       As you know, we have been steadfastly working for enactment \n     of this legislation since 1989. This commitment stems from \n     our belief that S. 244 will significantly strengthen the \n     ability of the federal government to reduce the regulatory \n     paperwork burden upon the private sector and the American \n     public. Time and again it has been demonstrated that \n     unnecessary regulatory costs hinder economic growth and \n     retard job creation and retention. With as much as nine \n     percent of the gross domestic product involved in meeting the \n     federal government's information needs, it is imperative that \n     a strengthened Paperwork Reduction Act be aggressively used \n     to improve productivity, eliminate waste, and reduce the \n     burdens upon businesses and taxpayers.\n       To illustrate the breadth of support for this legislation, \n     we have attached a partial list of the members of the \n     Paperwork Reduction Act Coalition. Their commitment to this \n     issue is every bit as sincere as ours.\n       We came so close last Congress with passage of S. 560. Now \n     that the House has passed its companion legislation, we have \n     the opportunity to successfully bring this debate to a close. \n     We look forward to helping you achieve that goal.\n

Cut Government Redtape and Excessive Paperwork--Support S. 244\n\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 600,000 small \n     business owners of NFIB, I am writing to express our strong \n     support for S. 244, legislation to strengthen the Paperwork \n     Reduction Act (PRA).\n       Small business is struggling to swim against the rising \n     tide of regulatory paperwork required by the federal \n     government. This flood of paperwork is overwhelming to small \n     business owners and threatens their ability to survive and \n     prosper. In fact, a recent NFIB Education Foundation survey \n     found that the burden of federal regulation and paperwork was \n     the fastest rising problem facing small business owners. \n     Strengthening the PRA is essential to the livelihood of small \n     business in America.\n       If you want entrepreneurs in your state to spend less time \n     filling out forms and more time creating jobs then vote YES \n     on S. 244. Final passage of S. 244 will be a Key Small \n     Business Vote for the 104th Congress.\n           Sincerely.\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1995.\n     To Members of the United States Senate:\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Federation of 215,000 \n     businesses, 3,000 state and local chambers of commerce, 1,200 \n     trade and professional associations, and 72 American Chambers \n     of Commerce abroad identified the need for federal paperwork \n     reduction as its number three issue of greatest significance \n     for the 104th Congress. Accordingly, I urge your strong \n     support for S. 244, the ``Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.''\n       Consider this:\n       Paperwork burdens carry a $510 billion price tag annually \n     for the American economy;\n       The American public spends 6.8 billion hours annually \n     complying with federal paperwork mandates;\n       Businesses pay at least twice as much in paperwork costs \n     than for corporate taxes;\n       Businesses (both small and large) carry more than 60 \n     percent of the paperwork burden; and\n       The financial impact from paperwork burdens equals about \n     nine percent of the Gross Domestic Product annually.\n       Clearly, this problem has reached gargantuan proportions \n     and must be reversed. The ``Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995'' \n     is essential to this goal. If enacted, S. 244 would provide \n     for a stronger Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n     (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget to conduct \n     centralized reviews of proposed and existing paperwork \n     burdens. It also would provide for increased opportunities \n     for the public to comment on proposed paperwork mandates and \n     for realistic assessments of estimated reporting and \n     recordkeeping. Significantly, S. 244 would reverse the 1990 \n     Supreme Court decision in Dole vs. United Steelworkers, which \n     had the effect of limiting OIRA's ability to oversee a \n     substantial amount of the federally imposed paperwork burden, \n     despite the intentions of the authors of the original \n     Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

Mr. President, last month I spoke on the floor detailing \nfor my colleagues the exciting history of the Paralympic games. Many \nAmericans are aware of, and excited about, the 16 days of Centennial \nOlympic games competition to be held in Atlanta during July and August, \n1996. However, a number of people remain unaware of the 12 days of \nParalympic competition that will be held less than 2 weeks after the \nconclusion of the Olympic Games. Atlanta is proud to host the \nParalympics games along with the 4,000 athletes, 1,000 coaches, and \nteam staff that it will bring to Georgia from more than 100 nations.\n  The Paralympic movement, dating back to 1946, has involved scores of \noutstanding men and women with a wide variety of disabilities. Last \nmonth, I spoke of the accomplishments of Al Mead, an above-the-knee \namputee. Al lost his leg due to a fall he took as a nine year old that \nled to complications requiring amputation. He is a former world record-\nholder in the long jump and the 100 meters, and a long jump silver-\nmedalist in the Barcelona Paralympics. His accomplishments are awe-\ninspiring, and I look forward to watching Al perform, along with \nthousands or other people, in Atlanta in 1996.\n  Today, I would like to call attention to another outstanding \nParalympian, a young woman named Trischa Zorn. Trischa has been legally \nblind since birth with a condition called anaridia--the absence of an \niris. Despite her condition, she has been a top performer in both the \nParalympics and the Olympic swimming competitions. At age 7, she began \nswimming along with her sister's swim team in Tustin, CA. By the age of \n10, her family moved to Mission Viejo where she began training in \nearnest.\n  Due to her 20/1000 vision, Trischa had difficulty knowing when it was \ntime to make her turns at the end of each length of the pool. Over the \nyears she trained herself to count each stroke across the length of the \npool so that she would know when she was approaching turns. With \nincredible dedication and determination, Trischa, in 1980 at the age of \n16, was named first alternate on the U.S. Olympic swimming team. As we \nall know, to be selected as first alternate for the U.S. Olympic team \nis a tremendous achievement for the most able-bodied among us. It means \ncompeting at levels most of us will never approach. However, to be \nnamed first alternate to the U.S. Olympic team and to be legally blind \nis truly an incredible achievement.\n  After a highly successful high school swimming career, Trischa was \nrecruited by the University of Nebraska's women's swimming program. By \nher sophomore year at Nebraska, Trischa was named to the Big Eight all-\nacademic team along with receiving All-American honors her junior and \nsenior years.\n  After graduating from Nebraska in 1987, Trischa got her master's \ndegree in school administration from Indiana University/Purdue \nUniversity at Indianapolis. She obtained her certification to teach \nboth in the pool and in the classroom, all the while maintaining her \nvigorous training schedule.\n  At the 1992 Paralympic games in Barcelona, Trischa was the top \noverall medalist. She won 12 medals--10 gold, 2 silver--and broke 6 \nworld records. At the 1990 World Championships for the Disabled, she \nscored a ``Perfect 11,'' winning a gold medal in every swimming event. \nIn the 1988 Seoul Paralympics, she won 12 gold medals, \n[[Page S3511]] earning the nickname ``The Golden Girl.'' Trischa has \nbeen awarded such titles as the first-ever Physically Challenged \nAthlete of the Year, Indianapolis Woman of the Year, and she was \nnominated for the 1988 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year Award.\n  Obviously, Mr. President and my colleagues, this is a woman who has \nfocused on her abilities and almost dismissed her disabilities. She is \nnow focusing on the 1996 Paralympics. All of us in Atlanta, and all who \nwill be coming from all over the world to those events, look forward to \nwatching ``The Golden Girl'' add more medals and records to her already \nimpressive list of accomplishments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3510-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3511-S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to en bloc, that they be considered original text \nfor purposes of further amendment, and that no points of order be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the manager of the bill \na few questions.\n  Mr. ROTH. I am available to answer the questions of the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the chairman. Under section 3505 the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget has a duty to, in consultation with \nagency heads, set annual agency goals to reduce information collection \nburdens. Would the chairman agree that the Secretary of Commerce may \ntake this opportunity to reduce the paperwork burden on persons \nrelating to the compilation and publication of censuses of agriculture \nand irrigation, of manufactures, of mineral industries, and other \nbusinesses, including the distributive trades, service establishments, \nand transportation?\n  Mr. ROTH. I believe it would be appropriate for the Secretary of \nCommerce to review the paperwork burden associated with this census \ncollection.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for that clarification. Under section \n3506, each agency shall reduce the information collection burdens on \nthe public. These industry and economic censuses cause business owners \nand farmers to maintain a great deal of paperwork in order to complete \nthe census. The 1992 Agriculture Census alone required farmers and \nranchers to answer more than 200 questions. It is my understanding that \nif a hospital, for example, has a garden where they grow lettuce or \nfruits only for their patients, they may still be considered a farmer \nand be required to fill out the 200 questions in the agriculture census \neven though their crops never go to market. Would the chairman agree \nthat this section would require the Secretary of Commerce to reduce \nburdens created by the compilation and publication of censuses of \nagriculture and irrigation, of manufactures, of mineral industries, and \nother businesses, including the distributive trades, service \nestablishments, and transportation?\n  Mr. ROTH. Clearly this section requires agencies to review the \ninformation collection actions it carries out. To the extent that the \nSecretary is able to reduce the information collection burden on the \naffected public in this area, this section requires the Secretary to do \nso.\n  Mr. BROWN. I am particularly concerned about the unnecessary \nduplication in the collection of information in these censuses. Would \nthe Senator agree that sections 3509 and 3510 are intended to encourage \nagencies to share information and avoid repetitive collections of the \nsame information?\n  Mr. ROTH. This act not only encourages information sharing, section \n3509 in particular authorizes the OMB Director to designate a central \ncollection agency to obtain information for two or more agencies where \nit is not inconsistent with applicable law.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the chairman for his assistance and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 317\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify certain definitions and intelligence related \n                  provisions, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

OREGON OPTION PROPOSAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal, State and local governments are dealing with \n     increasingly complex problems which require the delivery of \n     many kinds of social services at all levels of government;\n       (2) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n     Nation's problems by providing categorical assistance with \n     detailed requirements relating to the use of funds which are \n     often delivered by State and local governments;\n       (3) although the current approach is one method of service \n     delivery, a number of problems exist in the current \n     intergovernmental structure that impede effective delivery of \n     vital services by State and local governments;\n       (4) it is more important than ever to provide programs that \n     respond flexibly to the needs of the Nation's States and \n     communities, reduce the barriers between programs that impede \n     Federal, State and local governments' ability to effectively \n     deliver services, encourage the Nation's Federal, State and \n     local governments to be innovative in creating programs that \n     meet the unique needs of the people in their communities \n     while continuing to address national goals, and improve the \n     accountability of all levels of government by better \n     measuring government performance and better meeting the needs \n     of service recipients;\n       (5) the State and local governments of Oregon have begun a \n     pilot project, called the Oregon Option, that will utilize \n     strategic planning and performance-based management that may \n     provide new models for intergovernmental social service \n     delivery;\n       (6) the Oregon Option is a prototype of a new \n     intergovernmental relations system, and it has the potential \n     to completely transform the relationships among Federal, \n     State and local governments by creating a system of \n     intergovernmental service delivery and funding that is based \n     on measurable performance, customer satisfaction, prevention, \n     flexibility, and service integration; and\n       (7) the Oregon Option has the potential to dramatically \n     improve the quality of Federal, State and local services to \n     Oregonians.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Oregon Option project has the potential to improve \n     intergovernmental service delivery by shifting accountability \n     from compliance to performance results and that the Federal \n     Government should continue in its partnership with the State \n     and local governments of Oregon to fully implement the Oregon \n     Option.\n       On page 58, line 3, strike out ``SEC. 3.'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``SEC. 5.''.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the managers' amendment I have sent to the \ndesk contains four parts. The first part is a series of committee \namendments. The second consists of a few technical amendments requested \nby the intelligence community. The third is an amendment authored by \nSenator Coverdell which eases compliance with the Census Bureau's \nQuarterly Financial Reports requirements. The fourth is a provision \nauthored by Senator Hatfield relating to the Oregon option.\n  The first part, amendments reported by the committee, was developed \nby Senators Cohen, Glenn, Nunn, and myself. It modifies several \nprovisions of the bill regarding procurement of information technology. \nIn the time since the language of this legislation was drafted last \nyear, the Congress passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and \nthe President signed it into law. That act and other events have \ncreated the opportunity to revise portions of the Paperwork Reduction \nAct. In summary, the amendment will better focus the information \ntechnology provisions on achieving results.\n  This amendment was the result of a collaborative effort by Senators \nCohen, Glenn, Nunn, and myself. Senators Nunn, Glenn, and I developed \nthe bill now before the Senate. With Senator Cohen, we also had primary \nresponsibility for the drafting and passage of last year's acquisition \nreform bill. So, there is broad agreement by the key sponsors of both \nefforts on the value of the Cohen-Roth-Glenn-Nunn amendment for the \nPaperwork Reduction Act.\n  More work is needed to fix the Government's problems in using \ninformation technology. We have had hearings at the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, and the General Accounting Office is doing a major \naudit of the situation. Beyond that, Senator Cohen and I are working on \nlegislation to follow up on the committee's acquisition reform efforts. \nThe language in the committee's version of the Paperwork Reduction Act \nalso will remove potential areas of conflict between this bill and the \nacquisition reform efforts the committee is currently pursuing.\n  The second part consists of technical amendments intended to assure \nthat the responsibilities given to OMB in the bill concerning the \noversight of information technology activities within the Department of \nDefense and the intelligence community are the same as the authorities \nin the current Paperwork Reduction Act.\n  I understand that, during the development of these amendments, \nconcern was expressed about computer security within the executive \nbranch. In the previous Congress Senator Glenn and I asked the Office \nof Technology Assessment to study security and privacy in the \nelectronic age. In its report, entitled ``Information Security and \nPrivacy in Network Environments,'' OTA outlined important legal and \npolicy issues involved in the security of such environments and \nrecommended substantial congressional involvement in addressing those \nissues. The report also describes the organizational relationships \nconcerning these matters and the delicacy with which they were crafted \nin enacting the Computer Security Act of 1987. These are complex issues \nwhich the committee intends to address in depth later this session. In \nthe meantime, however, the bill we are considering today leaves \nexisting authorities unchanged.\n  The third portion of the amendment is the Coverdell provision to \nestablish a demonstration program within the Census Bureau to reduce \nthe paperwork burden on small business resulting from the Quarterly \nFinancial Report Program. The demonstration program expires on \nSeptember 30, 1998, the date on which the Quarterly Financial Report \nProgram itself expires, or if such program is itself further extended, \nthen the demonstration expires in such later year.\n  During such time the Census Bureau is required to assist first-time \nrespondents in fulfilling the information collection under the \nQuarterly Report Program, or if the program is reauthorized for a \nsubsequent period, the demonstration would expire on that later date. \nParticularly, the Bureau is mandated to establish a toll-free telephone \nnumber for those seeking such assistance.\n  Perhaps more important than the assistance for first-time respondents \nis the Coverdell provision's protection against a firm's repeated \nrequirement of participation. No firm with assets of $50 million or \nless may be required to participate twice if it has participated since \nOctober 1, 1989. And no firm of $100 million or less may be required to \nparticipate if it has participated within the last eight quarters.\n  I support the provision authored by Senator Coverdell and commend him \nfor his initiative.\n  The fourth provision is a sense of the Senate resolution expressing \nsupport for an innovative statewide effort to \n[[Page S3513]] improve intergovernmental assistance and service \ndelivery. Authored by Senator Hatfield, the resolution recognizes that \nthe State and local governments of Oregon have begun a comprehensive \nproject to coordinate their use of Federal funds to address social \nneeds. Joined by the Federal Government in this effort, they are \nattempting to trade more flexibility in the use of those funds for more \naccountability for measurable performance. This provision expresses a \nrecognition that this approach has the potential to improve \nintergovernmental service delivery and ought to be encouraged.\n  I support all four parts of the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware has explained the \nmanagers' amendment. I think there is nothing to add. I urge adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 317) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have enjoyed this exchange. While I \nhave the floor, I would like to talk briefly about the issue that I \ncame to the floor to talk about before I became fascinated with the \narguments by my friend from Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, I happen to be chairman of the Senate prayer breakfast \ngroup. In that role, I attended the National Prayer Breakfast addressed \nby President Clinton and the Reverend Andrew Young. While we were \nthere, we had Scripture readings, one from the New Testament and one \nfrom the Old Testament. Ruth Bader Ginsburg from the Supreme Court read \nthe Scripture from the Old Testament. And I would like to repeat that \nwhich she read here on the floor of the Senate today because it covers \nbeautifully the issue I want to address briefly.\n  It is from Deuteronomy, chapter 25, and starts with verse 13.\n\n       Do not have two differing weights in your bag, one heavy, \n     one light.

We \nrecognize that the dollar for us is the unit of account that we use to \nmeasure the value of our work, measure the value of our products, and \nmeasure the value of our lands. All of these things are measured by the \nnumber of dollars that they can bring. In Japan the measure is the yen. \nNow, says the Bible, do not have two measures in your bag, one big and \none small, one heavy and one light. Do not switch the measures.\n  Yet, when it comes to the unit of account between national economies, \nwe seem to have gotten into the idea that we can switch the measures. \nWe have gone through that with the Mexicans. When we debated NAFTA on \nthis floor, the unit of account was 3.5 pesos equals $1. Oh, it varied \na little. It was in a band between 3.1 and 3.5. But we adopted NAFTA. \nWe supported NAFTA on the firm assumption that the relationship between \nthe dollar and the peso would be as stable as the weights and measures \ndescribed in the Bible, that there would not be a breaking of the trust \nbetween those two countries.\n  Then, in December there was, as our friends to the South said, \n``Well, we are no longer going to hold the rigidity of that weight and \nmeasure between those two currencies. We are going to say the dollar \nbuys you 4.5 pesos. We are going to have a lighter weight in our bag \nthan we had before.''\n  I have spoken about the peso. I have perhaps spent too much time in \nthe Senate talking about the peso. I tried to get the administration to \nwork toward trying to get the weights and measures back to where they \nwere. The administration does not seem to be interested in that. I will \ncontinue to bring it up from time to time. But today, I want to talk \nabout the dollar and the yen because that is on the front pages. Mexico \nfor some reason seems to have disappeared from the front pages even \nthough the economic disaster in Mexico probably has more impact on our \ncountry long term than the relationship between the dollar and the yen.\n  We are being told in this morning's papers that the dollar is falling \nagainst the yen, that the problem is in the free flight of the dollar, \nthat we must do something to defend the dollar. There is an explicit \nassumption in that statement that I would like to challenge. What if--\njust think about it--what if the dollar is the stable measure and it is \nthe yen that is fluctuating in the wrong direction? What if, as you \nreach into your bag, you pull out the weight that the Bible talks about \nand it is the dollar that you find there? How are we going to know, if \nwe have two fluctuating against each other, which one is the stable \none? Or maybe neither is the stable one? But the unspoken assumption in \nthis morning's paper that the yen is stable and it is the dollar that \nis falling is the assumption I want to challenge. How can you challenge \nit?\n  Well, there is a third unit of measure that I would like to introduce \ninto the equation. That is the measure that has been used for a unit of \naccount of value since biblical times and probably before. There were \nno dollars, there were no yens when Moses wrote what I have read in \nDeuteronomy. But there was a measure for money, and it was called gold.\n  How is the dollar valued currently with respect to that ancient \nmetal? We have been talking about it--the Senator from Arkansas and I--\nin terms of mining. Let us talk about it in terms of money for just a \nminute.\n  The dollar is currently somewhere in the neighborhood where $380 buys \nyou an ounce of gold; a little below that right now, down in the \n$370's. But the dollar has been fairly stable for months, maybe even \ngoing back to a year, around the $380 to $385 mark.\n  You look at it today. The dollar is still stable in that area with \nrespect to gold. The yen, on the other hand, has been falling with \nrespect to gold. The price of gold in yen is $320 to the ounce. When we \nadd this third element to the equation, it begins to change our \nperception just a little. Maybe it is the dollar that is stable and the \nyen that is fluctuating improperly instead of the other way around as \nthis morning's papers indicate.\n  What would happen if Alan Greenspan, who follows these things more \ncarefully perhaps than any of us, got on the telephone and called his \noffice number in Japan and said, Why don't you start printing extra \nyen? Do you know what would happen if they started printing extra yen? \nThe value of the yen with respect to gold would begin to change. Of \ncourse, if we stayed stable with the price of gold, the value of the \nyen with respect to dollars would begin to change. And you would see \nthe dollar-yen relationship begin to come together around the common \npoint.\n  For the sake of illustrating the point, let us say it was at $380 an \nounce of gold and the yen would come to the point where you could buy \ngold at $380 an ounce with yen as well. So the yen and the dollar \nrelationship would be solidified around their common relationship to \ngold.\n  I think a number of very interesting things would happen in the world \nif that were to happen. I leave you with \n[[Page S3514]] this intriguing thought which Mr. Greenspan left with us \nwhen he testified before the Banking Committee. He said, ``If the \nUnited States were on a gold standard, the Mexican peso crisis would \nnot have occurred,''\n because, you see, what he is really saying is, if we pegged our unit \nof account to a weight and a measure that did not change, to a weight \nand a measure that did not have a light version and a small version, to \nuse the language of the Bible, but had only one, our currency would be \nthe strongest in the world and the other nations would peg their \ncurrency to our currency, instead of having a situation where both \ncurrencies are constantly moving and producing the kind of uncertainty \nthat this morning's headlines give us.\n\n  Mr. President, I have no legislation to offer on this. I expect I \nprobably will have as the Congress unfolds. But I take the occasion of \nthis morning's headlines to once again raise the issue. I raised it \nlast year in the last Congress when Mr. Greenspan first suggested in \nhis testimony before the Banking Committee that pegging the dollar to \ngold might be a good idea. I have been watching it closely ever since \nMr. Greenspan said that. I have been trying to become a student of this \nissue ever since Mr. Greenspan said that. I have talked about it on the \nfloor of the Senate ever since Mr. Greenspan said that. So far, nobody \nhas noticed. Perhaps nobody will notice it today.\n  I find it very interesting that in this morning's paper, everybody is \ninterested in the relationship between the dollar and the yen and the \ndollar and the deutsche marks, just as they were all interested in the \nrelationship between the dollar and the peso. Nobody is addressing the \nfundamental question raised in the scriptural reference that Ruth Bader \nGinsburg gave us at the National Prayer Breakfast when she told us, as \nthe Bible has told us, that we must have stability and honesty in our \nweights and measures.\n  I can think of no place where it is more vital to have that stability \nand honesty than in the weight and measure that we use to measure value \nthroughout the world, which is our currency.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I have just returned from California, \nwhere there was obviously great interest in the vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment. I have to say that the response to my vote, in \ngeneral, was one that greatly encourages me. I have to say, however, \nthat what is of greater interest to my constituency, the people of \nCalifornia, the largest State in the Nation--31 million people--is that \nwe get down to working on the actual budget.\n  It is one thing to debate a balanced budget amendment that would not \ntake effect until 2002 or later. Depending on if and when the States \nratify it, it could be the year 3000, for all we know. It is another \nthing to actually sit down at the table and work together, Republicans \nand Democrats alike, and bring back a budget that we can all be proud \nof. Since I am on the Senate Budget Committee, I truly look forward to \nthat exercise. I hope we can come back here with a bipartisan product \nthat cuts into that deficit and gets us on that glidepath toward a \nbalanced budget that we have been talking about.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that the vote last week on the \nbalanced budget amendment was clearly one of the most important votes \nin this Congress. There is talk among some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle that there could be retribution against those \nwho voted no, including punishing the senior Senator from Oregon who, \nin my view, simply did what we are supposed to do around here--listen \nto our conscience, adhere to our principles, and vote those principles \nand vote that conscience. We only have that chance here once in awhile, \nthat these issues of principle and conscience come before us.\n  To hear some of my colleagues tell it, the voters will be raging \nagainst any one of us who voted against this part of the Contract With \nAmerica. Well, I have to say to you that threats and political \nmaneuvering have no place in this debate, particularly when we are \ntalking about amending the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica. When we do that, every Member of Congress should have the \nright to vote in the best interest of his or her constituency, as that \nSenator sees it, without fear of political retribution from his or her \nparty. The stakes are too great and they are too long lasting.\n  This is not some bill that can be overturned easily. We are talking \nabout the Constitution of the United States of America, the most long-\nlasting symbol of our freedom.\n  In the case of the balanced budget amendment, to me, the stakes were \nenormous. First, the very viability of the Social Security system and, \nsecond, the real fear that the amendment, as drafted, would have \nrendered the Federal Government helpless to respond in cases of \neconomic recession or natural disaster. I have talked about that on the \nSenate floor.\n  I showed the pictures of disaster emergencies that have been visited \nupon States over the recent years, and how terrible it would be if we \nhad to go and look at the faces of our constituency at the very moment \nof their need and say: We cannot do anything about it because this \namendment says you cannot really do it unless you get a supermajority \nvote, and we simply cannot get those 60 votes.\n  I think back to my father telling me about the dark days of the \nDepression. I was born after that, and my dad said, ``You cannot \nbelieve what it was like.'' He said, ``Until FDR came in there, you had \nHerbert Hoover saying, `Let the States take care of it.''' I went back \nand I checked some of the quotes. It is unbelievable. It is the same \nthing you hear today: ``The States can take care of all of these \nproblems. You do not need the Federal Government.''\n  Meanwhile, people were jumping out of windows and selling apples on \nthe street. I am not going to be here and vote for an amendment that \nwould cause us to make that same mistake again. If I do, in my view, I \nam not being true to my conscience nor to the people that I represent. \nWhen I came here, I said I was going to fight for them--not against \nthem, but for them.\n  I want it clear that in 1992, as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, I voted for a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. But there was a very big difference in that amendment in 1992 \nand this amendment that I opposed just last week. That amendment would \nhave protected Social Security, and it was flexible enough so that a \nsimple majority vote could have allowed us to act in an emergency. It \ngave the President the ability to declare an urgency--it was called a \ndeclaration of urgency--if in a particular budget year the country \nneeded special spending to solve a crisis.\n  That is an amendment I would vote for again today. But I want to make \nsomething perfectly clear. During this debate, Democrats offered many \nconstructive changes to the Republican balanced budget amendment, which \nI felt was so inflexible. But of the many amendments offered, the \nRepublicans accepted only one, which was the amendment offered by the \nsenior Senator from Georgia, Sam Nunn. That clarified, somewhat, the \nrole of the power of the Federal courts in balancing the budget. All of \nthe other amendments--and there were many--were tabled, basically on a \nparty-line vote.\n  Republicans appeared to be under strict instructions to vote down any \nchange to the amendment--even changes they supported in the past. They \ndid vote for the Nunn amendment, but the basic message to the Democrats \nwas: Offer all of the suggestions you like, but we are not really going \nto accept them. And then when Democrats, who had clearly laid out their \nproblems with the amendment, voted against the amendment, they were \nberated for voting no, as if they were doing something that was so \nunusual, when we had spent all of that \n[[Page S3515]] time trying to offer constructive amendments.\n  The majority leader even delayed the vote for one day. That is very \nunusual. He wanted to make sure the heat was put on us. He wanted to \nmake sure he could get that final vote so that the Contract With \nAmerica--that Republican Contract With America--could move forward.\n  I happen to believe that move backfired, because in that 24-hour \nperiod, the focus was on the amendment. And, as our colleague, Senator \nRobert Byrd, who was such a leader in this debate, has said, the \namendment could be compared to a used car--and I agree with him--a used \ncar that looks great on the outside, but when the public looked under \nthe hood, it did not look so good.\n  Our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, told the Social Security \nstory, and that changed the public support for this amendment. Although \n70 percent support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nsupport drops to 30 percent when those questioned understand that the \nSocial Security trust fund would not be protected and could be looted. \nLet me repeat that: seventy percent of the people support a balanced \nbudget amendment in the abstract, but when you tell them that Social \nSecurity trust funds can be looted to balance the budget, it flip-flops \ncompletely and 70 percent then oppose it.\n  By the way, that same poll was taken in my home State of California \nwith exactly the same result.\n  I thought Senator Kent Conrad said it best when he described the raid \non Social Security like this. He said, if your boss came into your \noffice one day and said, ``Look, I think you are doing a great job, but \nI can't meet my operating expenses this year, so I am going to take the \nmoney you put into your pension fund and I am going to use it to pay \nthe bills. After all,'' the boss could say, ``you are a young person. \nYou are not going to retire for a long time. So if I take that money, \nyou don't have to worry. Someday I will put it back.''\n  Well, I say if your boss does that, you ought to call the police, and \nyou have a right to do it, because that is pure theft.\n  But that was exactly what was going to happen to Social Security. It \nis not a matter of never touching the benefits. We have touched \nbenefits before. We have changed the system before. We will probably \nhave to do it again. But it is a matter of the Social Security trust \nfund itself.\n  The Republican leadership refused to protect Social Security in that \nbalanced budget amendment. During the debate, they said they would \nnever touch it. They would never touch Social Security. They said they \nhad no intention of ever using the surplus or raiding Social Security. \nThey even had an amendment that said they would not do it.\n  Well, that is why several of my Democratic colleagues thought, \n``Well, gee. They say they are never going to touch Social Security. \nMaybe we have a chance here to make this amendment work, to change it, \nto build the protections of Social Security into the amendment \nitself.''\n  Well, in private negotiations, it went something like this, according \nto what I have been told. The Republicans said to my colleagues, \n``Look, we need your vote. We promise, we will put it in writing, we \nwill stop using the surplus in Social Security by the year 2012.''\n  Well, my colleagues were not happy with that.\n  They said, ``What about 2008? We will stop using the surplus in the \nyear 2008.''\n  Well, I ask you: If someone says they will not ever touch Social \nSecurity in one breathe and in the next breathe they say they will stop \ntouching it in 2012, what does that mean to you? It is like getting \nbeaten up by a bully and all the while you are getting hit, he says, \n``I'm not hitting you.'' And then he says, ``OK, I'll stop hitting you \nin 5 minutes, but, remember, I'm not hitting you now.'' That is \ndoublespeak.\n  So I think it is important to remember every time you hear the \nRepublicans say that they would never hurt Social Security, ask them \nwhy they refused to change their constitutional amendment to make it \nimpossible for anyone to raid it. Keep asking them that question, \nbecause all the talk is simply that. They would not protect Social \nSecurity, period. We gave them every chance.\n  I want every single person who paid a FICA tax--that is the Social \nSecurity payroll tax--to realize the benefits. We know now--there was a \nvery recent survey--that four out of five families are not prepared \nenough for their retirement. They are going to need Social Security in \norder to survive. Let us not ruin a system that has worked so well.\n  If the Republicans want an amendment to the Constitution--and I know \nthey want it; they are going to bring it back up here--they can have it \nif they protect Social Security.\n  I, myself, felt, as I said before, that there are other crucial \nissues to address--the issue of recession, the issue of disaster--but \nclearly there are enough votes on the Democratic side of the aisle to \nget that amendment through if the Republicans agree to protect Social \nSecurity.\n  My colleagues put it in writing and they sent the letter over to the \nother side.\n  So, where are we now? The balanced budget amendment for now is off \nthe table, but what is on the table is the budget itself, which takes \nme back to my opening remarks.\n  I am on the Budget Committee and I am waiting to see the Republican \nbudget for next year. I look forward to making progress on the deficit.\n  We saw President Clinton's budget. He has deficit reduction in it. \nThere are some who say it is not enough. Maybe we can do more. I look \nforward to doing more, as long as we ensure that our Nation takes care \nof its basic needs and its future. You do not want to destroy this \ncountry. We want to get this country on a glidepath toward a balanced \nbudget; frankly, towards a surplus budget. That is what we really \nshould be going for.\n  I think it is important to note that, had the balanced budget \namendment passed and were we back here today, there would have been a \nlot of hoopla, but the deficit would not have declined by one penny. \nDeficit reduction will begin in the Budget Committee with real cuts.\n  Two years ago, we made real progress on the deficit by carrying out \nPresident Clinton's plan to cut the deficit by $500 billion. That was a \ntough deficit reduction vote. We did not get one Republican vote. So it \nwas hard, but it passed.\n  Again, the President has submitted a follow-up budget. He says it \nreflects his priorities, what he thinks we need to invest in--\neducation, technology, et cetera--and that it achieves deficit \nreduction. And he includes a middle-class tax plan in there.\n  I am ready, willing, and able to look at the President's budget, look \nat my Republican friends' budget, and to work on a budget with my \nDemocratic colleagues so that we can really put our best ideas together \nand start doing our work. But I want to make one thing clear tonight. I \nwill not work in any way to injure the children of this country. No \nway. But if we look at the product that is coming over from the House \nof Representatives, that is exactly what is going on.\n  I will never forget the new chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee telling the press that he is having the time of his life as \nhe ends the Federal school lunch program and the nutrition program for \nwomen, infants and children. He actually held up a knife at the opening \nsession and waived it around. Even the children in the country saw it.\n  In my mind, that knife is a symbol--a symbol--of what is happening \nhere in Washington. It is going too far. It is slashing. It is \ninjuring. It is hurting.\n  What are we, as a people, if we take effective feeding programs and \ngut them? Do we want to become a nation where old people become bag \nladies because Social Security has been looted, and little children \nhave their hands out and their tummies swollen like they do in some \nfaraway land? I do not think that is what the American people want.\n  I do not care if it is in somebody's contract. It is not in my \ncontract. Anything I can do to protect the children under the rules of \nthis Senate, I will do. I am here to announce that I will do anything I \nhave to do to protect the children.\n  [[Page S3516]] Do the people want change? Yes. Do the people want \ndeficit reduction? Yes. But do they want us to hurt the innocents in \nour country? No. And I will not and others will not.\n  Often I read the Constitution. I carry it around, a little pocket-\nsized version, and I say God bless this Constitution for giving us a \nbicameral legislature so that the impact of a radical revolution--and \nit has been called such--the impact of a radical revolution can be \nstudied or modified or turned back.\n  I have been in politics for a while. This is a time of rough rhetoric \nand threats and the worst type of politics I have ever seen. When I got \nelected to the Senate I really made a very basic promise to the people \nof California: That is, I would fight for them, for their environment, \nfor their families, for their grandmas and grandpas, and for their \njobs. I also promised to fight for what I believe in. I said I would \nnever be intimidated by threats. I repeat that today.\n  There are some awfully good men and women in this U.S. Senate, across \nparty lines. I think it is time that we change the atmosphere of the \nCongress--we can do it here in the U.S. Senate--and that we work \ntogether for the people. I think if we do that we will make great \nprogress on the deficit, on this economy, and on restoring the American \ndream. We can do it.\n  However, we need to look at some of these proposals that truly will \nhurt our Nation, because when we wage an assault on the most vulnerable \npeople in our country, we wage an assault on all of America.

Mr. President, this amendment is based on S. 233, the \nReporting Requirements Sunset Act of 1995. The amendment would sunset \nall congressionally mandated reports after 5 years except those \nrequired by the Inspector General Act and the Chief Financial Officers \nAct.\n  The objective of the amendment, Mr. President, is very clear. It is \nto alleviate the massive costs to taxpayers and the huge burdens \nCongress has placed upon Federal agencies with statutory reporting \nrequirements.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President, this amendment calls for sunset of all \ncongressionally required, mandated reports in 5 years. It does not \nrequire that those congressionally mandated reports be ended \nimmediately. These reports, many of which are very important to keep \nthe Congress informed as to the activities of the executive branch of \nGovernment, can be reauthorized and probably should be reauthorized. \nBut what I am seeking here is simply a sunset of all these reports over \na 5-year period.\n  Now, Mr. President, I use as my source no less an important person \nthan the Vice President of the United States. When sending his report \nto the Congress, called ``Creating a Government That Works Better and \nCosts Less, Report of the National Performance Review,'' by Vice \nPresident Al Gore, on September 7, 1993, he said:\n       Action: Reduce the burden of congressionally mandated \n     reports.\n       Woodrow Wilson was right. Our country's 28th president once \n     wrote that ``there is no distincter tendency in congressional \n     history than the tendency to subject even the details of \n     administration'' to constant congressional supervision.\n       One place to start in liberating agencies from \n     congressional micromanagement is the issue of reporting \n     requirements. Over the past decades, we have thrown layer \n     upon layer of reporting requirements on federal agencies, \n     creating an almost endless series of required audits, \n     reports, and exhibits.\n       Today the annual calendar is jammed with report deadlines. \n     On August 31 of each year, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) \n     Act requires that agencies file a 5-year financial plan and a \n     CFO annual report. On September 1, budget exhibits for \n     financial management activities and high risk areas are due.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In fiscal year 1993, Congress required executive branch \n     agencies to prepare 5,348 reports. Much of this work is \n     duplicative. And because there are so many different sources \n     of information, not one gets an integrated view of an \n     agency's condition--least of all the agency manager who needs \n     accurate and up to date numbers. Meanwhile, trapped in this \n     blizzard of paperwork, no one is looking at results.\n       We propose to consolidate and simplify reporting \n     requirements, and to redesign them so that the manager will \n     have a clear picture of the agency's financial condition, the \n     condition of individual programs, and the extent to which the \n     agency is meeting its objectives. We will ask Congress to \n     pass legislation granting OMB the flexibility to consolidate \n     and simplify statutory reports and establishing a sunset \n     provision in any reporting requirement adopted by Congress in \n     the future.\n  That is the recommendation of the Vice President.\n  Mr. President, some Americans might be interested to know some of the \nrequirements, some of the reports that are required, which have been \nmandated by the Congress to be submitted to Congress every year:\n  ``Transportation, Sale, and Handling of animals for research and \npets.'' That is a report which is required annually.\n  ``Effects of Changes in the Stratosphere Upon Animals.'' That is only \nrequired every 2 years.\n  ``U.S.-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.'' That is an annual \nreport.\n  ``Operation of Mobile Trade Fairs.'' That is an annual report \nrequired, mandated by the Congress.\n  ``Studies of the Striped Bass.'' That is an annual report.\n  ``Number of Customs Service Undercover Operations Commenced, Pending, \nand Closed''; an annual report.\n  ``Monitoring of the Stratosphere''; that is biennially.\n  ``Effectiveness of Ice Control Programs on the Kankakee River in \nWilmington, Illinois.'' That is a mandated annual report.\n  ``Activities Involving Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research''; \nannually.\n  ``International Coffee Agreement.'' That is an annual report.\n  And, as appropriate: ``Recommendations for Correcting High Coffee \nPrices.''\n  ``Summary and Analysis of Agency Statements With Respect to Motor \nVehicle Use.'' That is an annual report.\n  ``World Food Day.'' This is an annual report that is mandated by the \nCongress; a report on World Food Day.\n  Here is another one which is probably a compelling report that \neveryone in \n[[Page S3517]] the Congress reads, I am sure, every year when it comes \nin:\n  ``The Air Force Participation in State Department Housing Pools.''\n  ``The Telephone Bank Board.''\n  ``The Financial Report of the Agricultural Hall of Fame.''\n  Mr. President, I have always been interested in the Agricultural Hall \nof Fame. I am just not sure that I need a report every year on its \ncondition.\n  ``Developing an Agricultural Information Exchange Program With \nIreland.''\n  ``Investigations Into Increased Use of Protein By-Products From \nAlcohol Fuel Production''; annually.\n  ``Continuation Pay for Armed Forces Dentists.''\n  Mr. President, I have to make a confession right now. I have been on \nthe Armed Services Committee, now in my 9th year, and I have never read \nthe annual report that is required concerning the continuation pay for \nArmed Forces dentists. I am probably doubly guilty because for 8 of \nthose years, I was a member of the Personnel Subcommittee, and I still \nnever read that congressionally mandated report requiring the Congress \nto be updated annually on the Continuation Pay for Armed Forces \nDentists. So I am one of those guilty parties who has failed to pay \nattention to these vital reports that are sent to the Congress on an \nannual basis.\n  ``Average Cost per-Mile of Privately Owned Motorcycles, Automobiles, \nand Airplanes''; annually.\n  ``Proposed Reductions in Pricing Policy for Space Transportation \nSystem For Commercial and Foreign Users.''\n  And finally, last but not least, the Congress is requiring a report \nannually concerning the condition of the ``Ladies of the Grand Army of \nthe Republic,'' on an annual basis.\n  I do not know if that report requires an update on the individual \nhealth of the members or perhaps the status of the Grand Army of the \nRepublic's finances. But again, although I must confess my deep and \nabiding interest in the activities of the Ladies of the Grand Army of \nthe Republic, I have not read that annual report, either. But I intend \nto do so at least once because for the life of me I cannot imagine--I \ncannot imagine--why the Congress of the United States would require an \nannual report concerning the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic. \nI am sure that Senator Nunn would want, perhaps, to have included in \nthat a report on the Daughters of the Confederacy, given his regional \ninterests.\n  However, I do not think that either of these, frankly, are required. \nAnd the reality is that each of these reports costs money. Someone has \nto take time from his or her duties and go to work and compile these \nreports and send them over to the Congress of the United States. And \nthe fact is, I am sorry to be a bit jocular about this issue, but no \none reads most of these reports.\n  What we do to the bureaucrats and the people who are hard-working men \nand women is two things. One, waste their time; and then, two, we do \nnot get the emphasis that we really need on the reports that are vital \nto Congress, the reports that are necessary to help us do our work. \nInstead, we clutter it up with 5,300 reports.\n  In case you think we have been doing this forever, let me remind you, \nfor the Record, in 1970 the GAO stated that Congress mandated only 750 \nreports. Now we have spiraled past 5,300. I believe the number, to be \nexact, is 5,348 reports last year. Further, the GAO study states that \nCongress imposes about 300 new requirements on Federal agencies each \nyear.\n  Mr. President, we should sunset these and we should also have a \nrequirement that any report that is mandated by Congress have a sunset \nprovision in it. If the report is necessary, if it is vital, if it is \nsomething that the Congress needs in order to do its work, then we can \neasily reauthorize these every 5 years.\n  As Senators Levin and Cohen, who have worked very hard on this issue \nhave noted, the Department of Agriculture alone has estimated the cost \nof preparing the 280 reports it had to submit to Congress last year at \n$40 million.\n  The sum of $40 million was spent last year just by the Department of \nAgriculture alone in preparing the 280 reports that they had to submit \nto Congress.\n  Mr. President, I support the bills that have been proposed by Senator \nLevin and Senator Cohen to eliminate several hundred specific reports. \nI think many of them should be done away with now. I hope that we can \nconsider Senator Levin's and Senator Cohen's legislation as soon as \npossible. In the meantime, why do we not get about the business of \nsunsetting these?\n  Mr. President, I am joined by my friends at the National Taxpayers \nUnion and the Citizens for a Sound Economy. Let me just quote briefly \nfrom the National Taxpayers Union letter and the letter from Citizens \nfor a Sound Economy.\n\n       National Taxpayers Union, America's largest taxpayer \n     organization, is pleased to endorse * * * the bill to \n     terminate all congressionally mandated reports after five \n     years. This legislation would save millions of taxpayer \n     dollars that are now wasted on unnecessary reports.\n       National Taxpayers Union is pleased to support this \n     important ``sunset'' bill and encourages you to offer it as \n     an amendment to pending legislation on the Senate floor. The \n     sooner wasteful government reports can be eliminated, the \n     better it will be for America's taxpayers.\n\n  The Citizens Against Government Waste are also in support of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, Citizens for a Sound Economy says:\n\n       While it is important for Congress to keep a watchful eye \n     on the activities of Federal agencies, requiring more than \n     5,300 reports from the executive branch each year is a costly \n     case of extreme micromanagement. These reports--most of which \n     are probably never read and many of which are redundant--\n     constitute a monumental waste of time, money and manpower. \n     Ultimately, American taxpayers pay for these unnecessary \n     reports. The price tag on these reports was $757 million in \n     1993.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that is an important point that the Citizens \nfor a Sound Economy have made. The price tag on this 5,300 reports last \nyear, in 1993, 2 years ago, was $757 million.\n  So I urge my colleagues. I would like to see, frankly, this amendment \naccepted by both sides. I would be more than happy to discuss this \nissue with my friends on the other side, the managers of the bill. I \nwant to thank them for their hard work on this issue.\n  Let me also point out the final report of the Senate members of the \nJoint Committee on the Organization of Congress which was issued in \nDecember 1993. On page 22, it said--this is the report of a bipartisan \ngroup of Senate members chaired by Senator Boren and Senator Domenici. \nThe other members were Senators Sasser, Ford, Reid, Sarbanes, Pryor, \nKassebaum, Lott, Stevens, Cohen, and Lugar.\n  Item 33 of this report, Organization of Congress recommendation, the \nrequirement for an executive agency to report to Congress should be \neffective for no more than 5 years. They go on to say the proliferation \nof mandatory agency reporting is a matter of wide concern. Several \ntimes in recent years the House Government Operations Committee and the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee have acted to eliminate the \nreports which have outlived their usefulness. However, the recent \nreports should not continue in perpetuity without some clear evidence \nthat the report serves a useful policy and purpose. The proliferation \nof mandatory agency reports has been a matter of wide concern in the \nCongress and in the executive branch. This provision would \nautomatically terminate such reports and will encourage committees and \nMembers who find a particular report valuable to act to extend the \nstatutory requirement for a specific report.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Roth, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, and Senator Nunn for their hard work on this \nbill. I believe that this amendment is an appropriate addition to it. I \nwould like to see us understand that, if this amendment were passed, we \nmay not save $757 million because I think we all are aware that there \nare a number of reports that need to be made to Congress and there are \nmany areas which the Congress needs to be aware of. But there is also \nliterally thousands that have long outlived their usefulness, if they \never had any, and it is time that we sunseted them all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters from the \nCitizens for a Sound Economy and the National \n[[Page S3518]] Taxpayers Union be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Citizens for a Sound Economy,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1994.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: This is to express the support of \n     Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE) for S. 1971, which would \n     eliminate all congressionally mandated reports after five \n     years. CSE is a 250,000 member grassroots advocacy group that \n     promotes free market economic policies.\n       While it is important for Congress to keep a watchful eye \n     on the activities of federal agencies, requiring more than \n     5300 reports from the executive branch each year is a costly \n     case of extreme micromanagement. These reports--most of which \n     are probably never read and many of which are redundant--\n     constitute a monumental waste of time, money and manpower. \n     Ultimately, American taxpayers pay for these unnecessary \n     reports. The price tag on these reports was $757 million in \n     1993. S. 1971 would reduce that burden substantially.\n       Citizens for a Sound Economy therefore applauds your \n     sponsorship of S. 1971, and we urge you and your colleagues \n     to pass this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Beckner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         National Taxpayers Union,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1994.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: National Taxpayers Union, America's \n     largest taxpayer organization, is pleased to endorse S. 1971, \n     your bill to terminate all congressionally mandated reports \n     after five years. This legislation would save millions of \n     taxpayer dollars that are now wasted on unnecessary reports.\n       S. 1971 would ``sunset'' the more than 5,300 Executive \n     Branch department and agency reports that Congress now \n     requires. It would provide a five-year window of opportunity \n     for important and necessary reports to be reauthorized. This \n     would alleviate the present avalanche of reports mandated by \n     laws enacted over the years.\n       In the words of Vice President Gore's National Performance \n     Review Report, ``over the past decades, we have thrown layer \n     upon layer of reporting requirements on federal agencies, \n     creating an almost endless series of required audits, \n     reports, and exhibits.''\n       NTU agrees with that analysis as well as the recommendation \n     of the Senate members of the Joint Committee on the \n     Organization of Congress, to limit all agency reporting \n     requirements enacted by Congress to an effective period of no \n     more than five years. Again, as in S. 1971, those reports \n     that are particularly valuable could be reauthorized for a \n     specific period.\n       National Taxpayers Union is pleased to support this \n     important ``sunset'' bill and encourages you to offer it as \n     an amendment to pending legislation on the Senate floor. The \n     sooner wasteful government reports can be eliminated, the \n     better it will be for America's taxpayers.\n       We urge your Senate colleagues to join with you to enact \n     the provisions of S. 1971.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Al Cors, Jr.,\n                                   Director, Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, it is my hope that we can accept this \namendment. I am checking right now to make sure there is no one who has \na strong feeling otherwise.\n  But I think the Senator from Arizona makes a good case. These reports \noftentimes are needed when first requested and then they get into law \nand they become permanent fixtures. So where we can eliminate a lot of \nthese reports, I would certainly welcome that.\n  We have done some similar things in the authorization bill in the \ndefense report. Once, I recall, DOD complained very much about all the \nreports. We gave them the authority to come up and tell us all they did \nnot want. Lo and behold, they ended up wanting most of them.\n  So you never know who has decided they like reports until you test \nthe waters. But I think that is what the Senator from Arizona is doing \nhere. He is testing the water. It would be up to those, I understand, \nwho want to keep a report to have it specifically reviewed as well as \nhave it go on in perpetuity. I hope we accept this, and I think we will \nget an affirmative OK of that in just a minute.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I wonder if the managers of the bill would \nobject if I went off this while they are looking for that approval and \nspoke as if in morning business for a short period of time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator that \nthere will be no objection so long as we are able to come back for a \nunanimous-consent request and that we be free to do so.\n  Mr. GORTON. There will be no problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3516-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3518-S3519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last Thursday at the end of the dramatic \nvote on the balanced budget amendment and its rejection by a single \nvote, there were many who felt that this was a tragedy with respect to \ndealing with the problems facing the United States and its huge budget \ndeficits now and during the course of this year.\n  While I was a strong supporter of that amendment, and while I hope \nthat the majority leader is able to bring it back up for another and \nmore successful vote sometime in future, I believe that its rejection \nnot only did not reduce the pressure on Members of the U.S. Senate, \nHouse of Representatives or the President of the United States to work \ntoward a balanced budget, but I believe that in fact it increased that \npressure.\n  On several occasions during the 5-week long debate on that \nproposition, I observed, as did others, that this body was divided \nessentially into three groups of Members with respect to the balanced \nbudget and the balanced budget amendment:\n  First, the rather large majority, those who believe that the present \nsystem was broken and needed to be fixed by radical and dramatic \naction, the imposition of an outside discipline on all of us to see to \nit that we did what we know needs to be done, but against which \npolitical pressures have for some 30 years been invariably successful;\n  A smaller group of Members, who not only thought that a balanced \nbudget amendment was undesirable but thought that a balanced budget \nitself was undesirable, who favor the status quo, not only with respect \nto the Constitution, but with respect to our own fiscal actions;\n  And a third group who were very prominent in the debate who agreed \nwith the proposition that we need a more responsible fiscal policy, \nthat we need to work toward a balanced budget, but that we did not need \nthe discipline of a constitutional amendment to cause that to take \nplace.\n  It is in one sense to that group, but also those who supported the \nconstitutional amendment, that I speak here this evening. I believe \nthat all of us are under the gun at this point.\n  I think it behooves the party on this side of the aisle, the \nconservatives in this body, to seriously attempt to pass a budget \nresolution which, if followed for a 7-year period, would lead to a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002, and to do that without touching \nSocial Security and to do it with at least a modest tax cut on the \nlevel proposed by the President of the United States.\n  I think that Members on this side will undertake that very, very \ndifficult task. I believe that, if anything, the great majority of \nthose who voted for the constitutional amendment find themselves even \nmore determined today than they were a week ago to follow in fact the \ndiscipline they wanted to set for the indefinite future, even without \nthat constitutional discipline. But I believe that goal encompasses not \njust those on this side of the aisle, not just the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, but his distinguished ranking Democratic \nmember, who also voted for the constitutional amendment, and the \nmajority of the members of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  More important, however, Mr. President, I hope that that goal, in \nreality, will be shown to be the goal of all of those Members who said \nthat they believe in a balanced budget but not in the amendment. If \nthey will join with us, if they will express their support for a course \nof action bringing us to a \n[[Page S3519]] balanced budget within 7 years, without any reductions \nin Social Security benefits, and with some reduction in taxes, they \nwill have done in fact what they claim to support in theory. And if \nthey will join with the 66 Members who voted for the constitutional \namendment, we should have upward of 80 votes in this body for a \nresponsible budget resolution, for the actions in reconciliation and \noutside of reconciliation necessary, to meet that goal this year, right \nnow.\n  I am optimistic, Mr. President. I think that determination is there, \nand I hope that the leadership of this body will be able to see to it \nthat we start working toward it in fact, not just in theory, very soon, \nin the course of the next few weeks.\n  We have all had our say. Those of us for the constitutional amendment \nshould remain committed. Those against it, who claim to believe in a \nbalanced budget, should be even more dedicated to the proposition that \nwe do the job. If that is the result of last week's debate, our loss \nwill not have been in vain.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3518-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be asking unanimous consent to \nmodify my amendment, in language to be worked out amongst staff, that \nthis amendment not be in application to reports that are triggered by \nspecific legislation that is on the books.\n  For example, the War Powers Act requires a report from the executive \nbranch to the Congress, and there are certain pieces of legislation \nthat are on the books and in law that require specific reports to be \nmade in the event of certain actions or events taking place. In arms \nsales, there is a report that needs to be made to Congress in the event \nof an arms sale to certain countries under certain circumstances. So \nthe staff understands and Senator Levin and Senator Roth understand.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may modify my amendment in a technical \nway to ensure that the language exempts those reports that are \ntriggered by acts of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank, first of all, my friend from \nArizona for this modification. His amendment is right on target. We \nshould be sunsetting reports which are automatically and routinely \nfiled. Many of them are not needed. We should sunset those reports \nafter a period of time as his amendment does.\n  On the other hand, we should not put into jeopardy those reports, \nsuch as the War Powers Act reports and arms sales reports, which are \nnot those routine, regular reports that are automatic, but rather are \ntriggered by events that are important to Congress, as indicated by the \nlegislation that is already on the books.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Arizona for that modification.\n  In addition, I believe that the Senator from Delaware will be seeking \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to offer an amendment--which I \nbelieve will be accepted--in the morning, which will eliminate a number \nof reports, I believe 200 reports, which have been cleared by various \ncommittees that are no longer needed.\n  Senator McCain's amendment is a sunset amendment, a very important \namendment. What my amendment does is take a smaller number of reports \nthat are currently required which should no longer be filed, which take \na lot of time and take a lot of money. We have methodically gone \nthrough, report by report by report, and have determined, I believe, \nfrom memory, that there are in the area of 200 to 300 reports that we \ncan eliminate--not just sunset, but absolutely eliminate.\n  I think the Senator from Delaware will be making a unanimous-consent \nrequest, if a unanimous-consent request is required--I am not sure what \nthe status is--but will be offering a unanimous-consent request that \nwould allow me to offer an amendment tomorrow morning, with 10 minutes \nof debate.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend from \nMichigan that that is my intent.\n  I, first of all, wish to congratulate the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for his amendment, because I do think it is a valuable one. We \nlook forward to seeing it adopted.\n  I believe the proposal of the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nadds a positive factor. We are trying to work out a unanimous-consent \nthat would allow him to bring it up the first thing tomorrow morning at \n10:30.\n  I very much appreciate that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

App.; \n     Public Law 95-452);\n       (B) the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law \n     101-576).\n       (b) Identification of Wasteful Reports.--The President \n     shall include in the first annual budget submitted pursuant \n     to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, after the \n     date of enactment of this Act a list of reports that the \n     President has determined are unnecessary or wasteful and the \n     reasons for such determination.\n       (c) List of Reports.--The list referred to under subsection \n     (a) includes only the annual semiannual, or other regular \n     periodic reports on the list prepared by the Clerk of the \n     House of Representatives for the first session of the 103d \n     Congress under clause 2 of rule III of the Rules of the House \n     of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think that amendment is self-explanatory. \nIt has already been explained. I think it is acceptable to the minority \nas well as the majority.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senators from Delaware \nand Arizona for the modification. It now makes it apply only to those \nreports which are filed annually, semiannually, or at other regular \nintervals, regular periodic intervals. It will not include reports \nwhich are triggered by events, or possible events, such as a War Powers \nAct report or weapons sales report where the requirement is based on an \nexternal event which is not a regular periodic event like a date on a \ncalendar.\n  That was acceptable to the Senator from Arizona, and I think it now \nwill make this accomplish its goal, which is to try to get rid of a \nwhole bunch of reports which we get every year or 6 months which nobody \nreally relies on but not wipe out reports, or sunset reports which we \ndo heavily rely on which are those reports such as the War Powers Act \nor weapons sales reports which are triggered by specific events covered \nby statute which the Congress indicated its intent to obtain reports on \nfor those other external reasons.\n  So we do very much appreciate the modification.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, if there is no further debate, I urge \nacceptance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 318), as modified, was agreed to.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3519-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3520-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3520-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the provisions of section 504(h) of Public Law 98-164, as \namended (22 U.S.C. 4413(i)), I transmit herewith the 11th Annual Report \nof the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers fiscal year 1994.\n  Promoting democracy abroad is one of the central pillars of the \nUnited States security strategy.

The Unified National Program \nresponds to section 1302(c) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 \n(Public Law 90-448), which calls upon the President to report to the \nCongress on a Unified National Program. The report sets forth a \nconceptual framework for managing the Nation's floodplains to achieve \nthe dual goals of reducing the loss of life and property caused by \nfloods and protecting and restoring the natural resources of \nfloodplains. This document was prepared by the Federal Interagency \nFloodplain Management Task Force, which is chaired by FEMA.\n  This report differs from the 1986 and 1979 versions in that it \nrecommends four national goals with supporting objectives for improving \nthe implementation of floodplain management at all levels of \ngovernment. It also urges the formulation of a more comprehensive, \ncoordinated approach to protecting and managing human and natural \nsystems to ensure sustainable development relative to long-term \neconomic and ecological health. This report was prepared independent of \nSharing the Challenge: Floodplain Management Into the 21st Century \ndeveloped by the Floodplain Management Review Committee, which was \nestablished following the Great Midwest Flood of 1993. However, these \ntwo reports complement and reinforce each other by the commonality of \ntheir findings and recommendations. For example, both reports recognize \nthe importance of continuing to improve our efforts to reduce the loss \nof life and property caused by floods and to preserve and restore the \nnatural resources and functions of floodplains in an economically and \nenvironmentally sound manner. This is significant in that the natural \nresources and functions of our riverine and coastal floodplains help to \nmaintain the viability of natural systems and provide multiple benefits \nfor people.\n  Effective implementation of the Unified National Program for \nFloodplain Management will mitigate the tragic loss of life and \nproperty, and disruption of families and communities, that are caused \nby floods every year in the United States. It will also mitigate the \nunacceptable losses of natural resources and result in a reduction in \nthe financial burdens placed upon governments to compensate for flood \ndamages caused by unwise land use decisions made by individuals, as \nwell as governments.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title XVI of the Social Security Act to deny \nSSI benefits for individuals whose disability is based on alcoholism or \ndrug addiction, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  legislation to deny ssi benefits to individuals whose disability is \n                   based on drug or alcohol addiction\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill this \nmorning because there is something fundamentally wrong with a \nGovernment program that pays drug addicts to remain addicted and pays \nalcoholics to continue being addicted to alcohol. Yet, that is \nprecisely what the Supplemental Security Income Program currently does: \nIt grants substance abusers an entitlement based upon their addiction.\n  Most Americans are surprised to learn that drug abuse is now \nclassified as a disability and that addicts and alcoholics are given \nSSI payments which they use to supply their addictions rather than to \nobtain food, shelter, and treatment which, of course, was the purpose \nof the program.\n  This simply defies the commonsense test. It wastes resources and does \nactual harm to those it claims to help. SSI payments may, under these \ncircumstances, provide a perverse incentive to beneficiaries. We pay \nthem to stay on drugs, we pay them not to work, and we pay them to \navoid recovery.\n  In the words of one doctor who has spent her entire professional \ncareer dealing with the problems of addiction, SSI payments ``* * * \nundermine the very thing they are supposed to be doing for my \npatients--promoting their rehabilitation.''\n  In 1994, 100,000 drug addicts and alcoholics were on the SSI rolls \nand received an estimated $382 million in Federal benefits, benefits \nthat came out of the pockets of responsible, hardworking, taxpaying \nAmericans.\n  The SSI caseload of drug addicts and alcoholics has expanded more \nthan 700 percent since 1988 when there were only 13,000 such \nindividuals in the programs. At their current rate of increase, their \nnumbers are expected to rise to 200,000 within 5 years.\n  Sadly, only 10 percent ever recover and escape the SSI rolls. Such a \nrecovery rate is devastating. We have botched our attempt to provide a \nsafety net and have instead provided these individuals the means to \ncontinue their free-fall into addiction. Congress cannot in good \nconscience continue this policy.\n  So today, I am introducing a bill to stop payments to individual \naddicts and instead rededicate those resources to put addiction \nresearch and treatment programs on the books. These funds will be put \nto much more constructive alternative uses. Society as a whole will \nbenefit because treatment programs reduce criminal justice costs and \nlost productivity.\n  Drug addicts and alcoholics do not need an allowance from the \nGovernment which they can then use to feed their addictions. What they \nneed is treatment. The drug addicts and alcoholics program within SSI \nwas intended to support these individuals while they were under \ntreatment. But that is not how things worked out. The program has been \ndifficult to monitor and they have, in fact, not found that people who \nare taking the benefits are going into rehabilitation programs. In \nfact, rehabilitation is actually discouraged because rehabilitation \nresults in loss of benefits of the program.\n  Substance abuse is taking a horrible toll on our society. The current \nSSI Program is doing nothing to remedy that unfortunate fact. My bill \nwould alter our fundamental approach to substance abuse and abusers. \nInstead of general monthly payments, the abusers would be given \ntreatment programs that require participation by them and commitment by \nthem to stop their habit and rehabilitate themselves to be responsible \ncitizens. It will save money, and it will put our taxpayer dollars to \nbetter use.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSTON:\n  S. 499. A bill to provide an exception to the coverage of State and \nlocal employees under Social Security; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 500. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat certain deductions of schoolbus drivers shall be allowable in \ncomputing adjusted gross income; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 legislation to help schoolbus drivers\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to help assist our Nation's schoolbus drivers who provide a \nvery important role in the education of our children. Recently, several \nbroad-based tax provisions have been enacted into law which adversely \naffect schoolbus drivers. The bills I am introducing today will provide \nsome of our most dedicated school employees with relief which they need \nand deserve.\n  The first measure would permit busdrivers to deduct actual operating \nexpenses, regardless of whether or not they itemize on their Federal \ntax returns. This was the law prior to enactment of the Tax Reform Act \nof 1986. Under current law, however, schoolbus drivers' actual expenses \nare treated as miscellaneous expenses, thus limiting the deduction to \nthose who itemize and subjecting it to the 2-percent floor. The floor \nhas prevented many schoolbus drivers from qualifying for any deduction \nfor their actual operational expenses because they cannot meet the 2-\npercent floor applicable to miscellaneous itemized deductions. The \nresult has been a substantial increase in schoolbus drivers' annual \nincome tax liability. Moreover, even those busdrivers who itemize and \nqualify for deductions under the 2-percent floor have been penalized, \nespecially those who file joint returns.\n  The second measure would exempt schoolbus drivers--and other State \nand local employees who work on a part-time, seasonal, or temporary \nbasis-- \n[[Page S3522]] from paying Social Security taxes. Many of these \nindividuals are already covered under State and local retirement \nsystems; however, the law currently requires that they pay into Social \nSecurity as well. The result is increased costs to the employer and \nsmaller take-home paychecks for the employees. Perversely, some States \nmay even decide to remove these workers from their retirement systems, \nwhich could result in a reduction in, or loss of, retirement benefits \nfor which the employees have worked for many years.\n  Our schoolbus drivers do a yeoman's job in transporting future \ngenerations to and from school. We all agree that education of our \nyouth should be one of our highest priorities. Let's pass this \nlegislation and provide some relief to those individuals who make it \npossible for our children to arrive at school in a safe and timely \nmanner.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Johnston):\n  S. 501. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nthe tax-free rollover of certain payments made by employers to \nseparated employees.\n\n\n      tax free rollover of certain payments to separated employees\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce \nlegislation to help those employees who are living under a new reality \nof the 1990's--corporate downsizing. This bill will allow taxpayers who \nlose their jobs due to corporate downsizing to roll over, tax-free, any \nlump sum payment received as part of the termination into an individual \nretirement account [IRA] or similar qualified plan. Taxes would be paid \nwhen the funds are withdrawn at retirement. This will allow the upfront \npayment to serve the purpose of providing the necessary income for \nretirement. This legislation will relieve an enormous tax burden on \nthousands of Americans and further encourage retirement savings. Last \nyear the bill was estimated to cost $405 million over 5 years.\n  Without this legislation, many workers, generally 5 to 10 years from \nretirement age, will see between 40 to 50 percent of these payments \nimmediately eaten up by Federal, State, and local income taxes. Of \ncourse, if these payments are made out of excess funds in a qualified \nretirement plan funded by the employer, this problem does not arise. \nThis however, is not always the case. Given the generally dismal rate \nof underfunded private retirement plans, payments will often come out \nof the general revenues of the company rather than from a qualified \nplan, and thus will not qualify for the tax exempt rollover provisions \nthat currently exist under the code.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join me by cosponsoring \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 502. A bill to clarify the tax treatment of certain disability \nbenefits received by former police officers or firefighters; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             police and firefighters tax clarification act\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing an important \npiece of legislation that will provide a measure of tax fairness for \nmore than 1,000 police officers, firefighters and their families in my \nhome State of Connecticut. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Lieberman.\n  This bill clarifies the tax treatment of heart and hypertension \nbenefits awarded to Connecticut's police officers and firefighters \nprior to 1992. The clarification is necessary because of an error made \nin the original version of Connecticut's heart and hypertension law. \nUnder the law, Connecticut intended to treat heart and hypertension \nbenefits as workmen's compensation for tax purposes. Unfortunately, \nbecause of the language used in the State statute, the heart and \nhypertension benefits became taxable under a ruling by the Internal \nRevenue Service [IRS] in 1991.\n  Since the IRS ruling, Connecticut has amended its law. But that \nchange does not help those police officers, firefighters, and their \nfamilies, who received benefits prior to the amendment. These law-\nabiding citizens accepted the benefits with the understanding that they \nwere not taxable. Now, as a result of the problem with the State law, \nand through no fault of their own, they are being charged with back \ntaxes, interest, and penalties by the IRS.\n  Mr. President, we must address this unfortunate situation. Our \nfirefighters and police officers are dedicated public servants. Every \nday, they face enormous difficulties and dangers protecting our homes \nand neighborhoods. The hazards they face make their jobs particularly \nstressful. They need the security provided by heart and hypertension \nbenefits. They should not have to contend with back taxes and penalties \nthat are being assessed due to an error in State law.\n  Under this legislation, which would exempt heart and hypertension \nbenefits from taxable income for the years prior to the IRS ruling--\n1989, 1990, and 1991--we can treat these public servants and their \nfamilies more fairly. This bill is narrowly drafted to accomplish that \nlimited purpose and would not affect the tax treatment of heart and \nhypertension benefits awarded after January 1, 1992.\n  Mr. President, my efforts to pass this legislation date back to the \n102d Congress. During that Congress, Senator Lieberman and I worked \nwith Representatives Barbara Kennelly and Rosa DeLauro and this bill \nbecame a part of the Revenue Act of 1992. Although the Revenue Act was \npassed by Congress, it was vetoed by President Bush 1 day after he lost \nthe election. We tried again during the 103d Congress, but we were \nunable to move the bill through the relevant committees.\n  I am hopeful that we can pass this legislation quickly this year so \nthat we can remove the threat of back taxes and penalties that hangs \nover Connecticut's police officers, firefighters, and their \nfamilies.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Levin, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Pell):\n  S. 504. A bill to modify the requirements applicable to locatable \nminerals on public domain lands, consistent with the principles of \nself-initiation of mining claims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                mineral exploration and development act\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mineral Exploration and \nDevelopment Act of 1995.\n\n  This is the fourth Congress that I have proposed comprehensive \nlegislation to reform the 1872 mining law. Obviously, if I had been \nsuccessful in the past, I would not be here again today. There are few \nissues around here that I have such strong feelings about as I have on \nthis subject.\n  Mr. President, as it provided for in 1872, and what it still permits \ntoday, the 1872 mining law allows for any citizen of this country to go \non any of the 550 million acres of Federal lands open to mining, drive \ndown four stakes encompassing 20 acres of land and notify the Bureau of \nLand Management that the land is subject to a mining claim. If, at some \ntime in the future, the claimant decides that that 20-acre claim has \ngold, silver, copper, platinum, or any other hardrock mineral under it, \nthe claimant can demand--literally demand--a deed from the U.S. \nGovernment for that 20 acres. If the BLM decides that yes, it does \nindeed have commercially mineable minerals under the claim, the \nGovernment will give you a deed to the land. Mr. President, they will \ngive you a deed for either $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre, depending on \nthe type of mining claim you have.\n  Mr. President, it is very difficult to make this case because the \npeople across the country say that this simply cannot be true. No \ngovernment in its right mind, especially a government that is in debt \n$4.6 trillion, would give away the public domain and billions of \ndollars worth of minerals for $2.50 an acre, with billions of dollars \nworth of gold under it. Well, unhappily, we are crazy enough to do just \nthat, and we have been doing it since 1872.\n  Mr. President, there are estimates that between $1 and $4 billion \nworth of gold and other minerals are removed from our public lands \nevery year. The taxpayers, the very owners of the public lands, don't \neven receive one red cent in return.\n  [[Page S3523]] Mr. President, the Goldstrike Mine in Nevada is owned \nby a subsidiary of American Barrick Resources, which is a Canadian \ncorporation. Incidentally, many of the top gold-mining companies in \nthis country are foreign owned.\n  On September 10, 1992, Barrick filed an application for patents on \n1,800 acres of its Golstrike Mine with the Bureau of Land Management. \nThe BLM checked it out and found that there were commercial quantities \nof gold underneath that 1,800 acres.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BUMPERS. As a result, the Bureau of Land Management had no choice \nbut to give Barrick a deed to the 1,800 acres of land for $9,000; $5 an \nacre. According to Barrick--not Dale Bumpers--the land contains $10 \nbillion dollars' worth of gold.\n  And so Barrick is going to mine 10 billion dollars' worth of gold--\nand what do you think Uncle Sam's return will be? Absolutely nothing.\n  Let me ask my colleagues: If you had 1,800 acres of land and Barrick \nMining Co. was getting ready to mine 10 billion dollars' worth of gold \noff your land, what would you expect in return? Five percent? Ten \npercent? As a matter of fact, the Newmont Mining Co. in Nevada pays an \n18-percent royalty to a private landowner in the Carlin Trend of \nNevada.\n  However, the U.S. taxpayers will not receive one red cent in \nroyalties. And it is our land. It is our gold. It belongs to the people \nof this country.\n  People who watch speeches like this on the floor of the Senate say \nthis couldn't possibly be true.\n  It not only can happen, but it has been happening for years and years \nand years. And I can tell you, with the makeup of the Senate in the \n104th Congress, it will likely continue to happen. While I may not win \nthis battle this year, I am certainly not going to quit speaking out \nabout it.\n   While the hardrock mining companies argue that the imposition of a \nreasonable royalty would put them out of business, they continue to \nignore the fact that gross royalties are paid for all other minerals \nthat are extracted from the taxpayer-owned land. We charge people who \nmine coal 12.5 percent. If you extract natural gas from Federal lands, \nyou pay the U.S. Government a 12.5-percent royalty. If you mine \ngeothermal resources, as we do out West, it is 10 to 15 percent of \ngross revenues. If you drill oil on Federal lands, you pay a 12.5-\npercent royalty.\n  However, if you mine for gold, silver, or copper, you do not pay one \nred cent to the U.S. Government.\n  Why? Because the mining companies have the political clout in this \nbody to prevent the enactment of comprehensive mining law reform. Last \nyear the House of Representatives passed a comprehensive and reasonable \nmining law reform bill. However, when it came over to the Senate it \nfell into the same old sump hole.\n  Occasionally, ``60 Minutes'' or ``20-20'' or ``Prime Time Live'' will \ndo a 10- to 20-minute segment on this issue. Sam Donaldson will say, \n``Can you believe this?'' And the next morning, my phone rings off the \nwall.\n  Several years ago, after ABC did a story on the mining law, a Senator \ncalled and said, ``For God's sake, get me on your bill as a cosponsor. \nMy phone hasn't stopped ringing.'' We put him on as a cosponsor. \nHowever, when it came time to vote on my amendment to impose a \nmoratorium on the issuance of patents, he voted against it. He just had \nnot yet heard from the mining industry when he cosponsored my bill.\n  The 1872 mining law does not reflect modern environmental protection \npolicies. Past mining activities have left a legacy of unreclaimed \nlands, acid mine drainage, and hazardous waste. Approximately 60 \nabandoned hardrock mining sites are currently on the Superfund National \nPriority List. Some estimate that it could cost taxpayers upward of $50 \nbillion to clean up these sites.\n  The 1872 mining law does not contain any bonding or reclamation \nrequirements or any requirements for protecting the environment. While \nBLM and Forest Service regulations address these issues, their \nregulations, particularly BLM's, are full of loopholes and weak.\n  The Mineral Exploration and Development Act of 1995 would provide BLM \nand the Forest Service with sufficient authority to regulate mining to \nminimize adverse impacts to the environment. It would mandate \nreclamation and bonding and would direct the agencies to promulgate \nspecific reclamation standards.\n  Some of the Senators who come on this floor and make these long \nspeeches about what a wonderful thing the 1872 mining law is and how \nwonderful it has been to their States, should take a look at what the \nState governments do. For example, Arizona charges a 2-percent royalty \non the gross value of the minerals extracted from State-owned land. If \nyou mine on private or Federal lands, Arizona charges a 2.5-percent \nseverance tax.\n  What do we charge? Nothing.\n  Montana gets a 5-percent royalty for raw metallic minerals mined on \nState lands and they charge a severance tax of 1.6 percent of the gross \nvalue in excess of $250,000 for gold, silver, and platinum mined on all \nlands in the State.\n  The State of Utah charges a 4-percent gross value royalty on \nnonfissionable metalliferous metals.\n  Utah also charges a 2.6-percent severance tax on all metalliferous \nminerals, including those that are on Federal lands. Whether there is a \npatent on it or not, whether it is private lands or Federal lands, you \npay a severance tax in the State of Utah.\n  What does the U.S. Government charge? absolutely nothing.\n  Wyoming charges a 5-percent royalty on the gross sales value of gold, \nsilver, and trona mined on State-owned land, and a 2-percent net of the \nminemouth value severance tax on everything that is mined anywhere in \nthat State.\n  However, the mining industry will continue to insist that if my bill \nor anything even close to it passes, it will be the end of the world as \nwe know it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I started out talking about the fact that this is \nthe sixth year I have fought this battle. When I first started back \nabout 1990, I could not even fathom that this was actually going on in \nthis country. Sadly, it continues unabated.\n  The argument of the mining industry then was, ``It will put us out of \nbusiness if you charge us a royalty.'' ``How about 3 percent?'' ``No, \nwe cannot afford 3 percent.'' ``Two percent?'' ``No, we cannot afford 2 \npercent. Cannot afford anything.'' Now they say: ``We will pay a small \nroyalty, but you must allow us to deduct every imaginable and \nunimaginable cost of mining first''.\n  Mr. President, at the beginning of the 103d Congress gold was selling \nin this country for $333 an ounce. The mining industry said, ``we \ncannot afford to pay an 8-percent royalty or even a 5-percent royalty \nwhen we are selling gold for $333 an ounce. It would bankrupt us.'' \nGold is now selling for approximately $375 an ounce. However, the \nmining industry is still claiming poverty.\n  Mr. President, when I first started fighting on this issue in 1990 we \nhad 1.2 million mining claims in this country. Today, because a person \nnow has to pay $100 a year in order to hold his claim, that number has \nbeen reduced to 330,000 claims. Do you know why there has been such a \nprecipitous drop in the number of claims? All those claims out there \nwere filed to build summer homes on the land or they were filed hoping \nsome big mining company would come along and say, ``How about letting \nus explore your claim?'' because they did not have to pay a red cent to \nkeep that claim viable.\n  Mr. President, almost every one of these mining companies do, in \nfact, pay royalties. However, they don't pay royalties to the \nlandowner--the American taxpayer. Rather, they pay royalties to \nsomebody they bought the claim from. So who is really getting the \nroyalty? It is the guy who had the claim.\n  If I had claims amounting to 1,000 acres, never touched it, a mining \ncompany could come by and say, ``We would like to have that claim to \nmine on.'' If I said, ``OK,'' they will look it over. If they find out \nit has gold on it, they will say, ``We will pay you a 5-percent royalty \non all the gold we take off of your land.'' That goes on time and time \nagain. Virtually every major mining company in the United States that \nmines on Federal lands is paying a pretty good-sized royalty to the guy \nwho went out there and drove the stakes into the ground with no \nintention of ever doing anything.\n  [[Page S3524]] Mr. President, I have tried every year to convince the \nSenate to enact comprehensive mining law reform. In addition, I have \ntried to impose a moratorium to prohibit the Interior Department from \ngranting patents. The House of Representatives passed such a moratorium \nevery year since I started this fight, and every year the Senate has \nkilled it. Last year the Senate finally agreed to the moratorium during \na House-Senate Appropriations conference.\n  In 1991 I came within a single vote of passing the patent moratorium. \nJust 4 days later, the Stillwater Mining Co. filed applications for \npatents on a little more than 2,000 acres of land in Montana. It took \nthem just 4 days to figure out that they might have to pay a royalty \none of these days if they did not get a patent. Assuming they get these \npatents, Stillwater will pay just $10,000 for the 2,000 acres of land. \nAccording to Stillwater's own figures, the land contains roughly 35 to \n38 billion dollars' worth of platinum and palladium.\n  And, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, what do you think you are going to get \nfor the 38 billion dollars' worth of platinum and palladium that you \nown? You guessed it. Not one penny.\n  Mr. President, I will just make this little summation. The patent \nmoratorium that we passed last year grandfathered-in about 350 patent \napplications. If we do not keep the moratorium pending until Congress \nis ready to enact comprehensive reform, the U.S. Government will \ncontinue to give away our public lands.\n  In addition, we will continue to permit mining companies to walk away \nfrom unmitigated environmental disasters leaving the taxpayers to pick \nup the tab. They did not get a red cent out of it, but the taxpayers \nget the luxury of cleaning up the mess.\n  Mr. President, my bill constitutes what I believe to be the minimum \nrequired for comprehensive mining law reform. It provides for the \nSecretary to have considerable input into the siting of mining \noperations to ensure that areas such as Yellowstone National Park are \nnot ruined.\n  My bill provides for an 8-percent gross royalty. It provides for \nbonding to make sure that the land is put back in half decent shape \nwhen mining operations are completed. It stops this business of giving \ndeeds to people for $2.50 an acre.\n  Opponents of comprehensive reform will soon introduce a bill that \nwould continue to permit patenting. Rather than $2.50 or $5 an acre, \nthe claimant would have to pay the fair market value for the surface of \nthe land. That is only marginally better than the $5 an acre they pay \nnow.\n  Senators trying to pass this as reform will say: ``Well, they are \npaying fair market value.'' You give me the Gulf of Mexico; I will pay \nfor the fair market of the surface of the Gulf of Mexico if you give me \nall the oil underneath it.\n  Mr. President, I intend to pursue this matter as long as I am in the \nU.S. Senate. I want to say to my colleagues and to the American people, \nthere is no greater travesty--no greater travesty--than the \ncontinuation of this mining law and allowing the mining interests of \nthis country to take the valuable resources that belong to every \ntaxpayer in the country.\n  We have a $4.6 trillion debt and Speaker Gingrich and the proponents \nof the Contract With America want to put children in orphanages, take \naway school lunches, and dramatically cut food stamps. But the mining \ncompanies can't compensate the taxpayers because there are enough \nwestern Senators here to stop it. Where are our priorities?\n  So I will probably not succeed this year. If I could not succeed last \nyear, given the makeup of the Senate this year, I will not prevail and \nI am tired of fighting the battle, but I am not tired enough to quit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The term shall be no \n     greater than that necessary to accomplish the proposed \n     operations, and in no case for more than 10 years, unless the \n     applicant demonstrates that a specified longer term is \n     reasonably needed to obtain financing for equipment and the \n     opening of the operation.\n       (2) Failure by the operator to commence mineral activities \n     within one year of the date scheduled in an approved plan of \n     operations shall be deemed to require a modification of the \n     plan.\n       (3) A plan of operations shall carry with it the right of \n     successive renewal upon expiration only with respect to \n     operations on areas within the boundaries of the existing \n     plan of operations, as approved. An application for renewal \n     of such plan of operations shall be approved unless the \n     Secretary determines, in writing, any of the following:\n       (A) The terms and conditions of the existing plan of \n     operations are not being met.\n       (B) Mineral activities and reclamation activities as \n     approved under the plan of operations are not in compliance \n     with the surface management requirements of this Act.\n       (C) The operator has not demonstrated that the financial \n     guarantee would continue to apply in full force and effect \n     for the renewal term.\n       (D) Any additional revised or updated information required \n     by the Secretary has not been provided.\n       (E) The applicant has not demonstrated that the plan of \n     operations will be in compliance with the requirements of all \n     other applicable Federal requirements, and any State \n     requirements agreed to by the Secretary pursuant to \n     subsection 203(c).\n       (4) A renewal of a plan of operations shall be for a term \n     not to exceed the period of the original plan as provided in \n     paragraph (1). Application for plan renewal shall be made at \n     least 120 days prior to the expiration of an approved plan.\n       (5) Any person that is, or may be, adversely affected by \n     the proposed mineral activities may request a public hearing \n     to be held in the county in which the mineral activities \n     [[Page S3528]] are proposed. If a hearing is requested, the \n     Secretary shall conduct a hearing. When a hearing is held, \n     notice of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of \n     local circulation for 2 weeks prior to the\n      hearing date.\n       (i) Plan Modification.--(1) Except as provided under \n     section 405, during the term of a plan of operations the \n     operator may submit an application to modify the plan. To \n     approve a proposed modification to a plan of operations the \n     Secretary shall make the determinations set forth under \n     subsection (g)(1). The Secretary shall establish guidelines \n     regarding the extent to which requirements for plans of \n     operations under this section shall apply to applications to \n     modify a plan of operations based on whether such \n     modifications are deemed significant or minor; except that:\n       (A) any significant modifications shall at a minimum be \n     subject to subsection (f), and\n       (B) any modification proposing to extend the area covered \n     by the plan of operations (except for incidental boundary \n     revisions) must be made by application for a new plan of \n     operations.\n       (2) The Secretary may, upon a review of a plan of \n     operations or a renewal application, require reasonable \n     modification to such plan upon a determination that the \n     requirements of this Act cannot be met if the plan is \n     followed as approved. Such determination shall be based on a \n     written finding and subject to notice and hearing \n     requirements established by the Secretary.\n       (j) Temporary Cessation of Operations.--(1) Before \n     temporarily ceasing mineral activities or reclamation for a \n     period of 180 days or more under an approved plan of \n     operations or portions thereof, an operator shall first \n     submit a complete application for temporary cessation of \n     operations to the Secretary for approval.\n       (2) The application for approval of temporary cessation of \n     operations shall include such terms and conditions as \n     prescribed by the Secretary, including but not limited to the \n     steps that shall be taken during the cessation of operations \n     period to minimize impacts on the environment. After receipt \n     of a complete application for temporary cessation of \n     operations the Secretary shall conduct an inspection of the \n     area for which temporary cessation of operations has been \n     requested.\n       (3) To approve an application for temporary cessation of \n     operations, the Secretary shall make each of the following \n     determinations:\n       (A) The methods for securing surface facilities and \n     restricting access to the permit area, or relevant portions \n     thereof, shall effectively ensure against hazards to the \n     health and safety of the public and fish and wildlife.\n       (B) Reclamation is contemporaneous with mineral activities \n     as required under the approved reclamation plan, except in \n     those areas specifically designated in the application for \n     temporary cessation of operations for which a delay in \n     meeting such standards is necessary to facilitate the \n     resumption of operations.\n       (C) The amount of financial assurance filed with the plan \n     of operations is sufficient to assure completion of the \n     reclamation plan in the event of forfeiture.\n       (D) Any outstanding notices of violation and cessation \n     orders incurred in connection with the plan of operations for \n     which temporary cessation is being requested are either \n     stayed pursuant to an administrative or judicial appeal \n     proceeding or are in the process of being abated to the \n     satisfaction of the Secretary.\n       (k) Review.--Any decision made by the Secretary under \n     subsections (g), (h), (i), (j) or (l) shall be subject to \n     review under section 202(f).\n       (l) Bonds.--(1) Before any plan of operations is approved \n     pursuant to this Act, or any mineral activities are conducted \n     pursuant to subsection (b)(2), the operator shall file with \n     the Secretary financial assurance payable to the United \n     States and conditional upon faithful performance of all \n     requirements of this Act. The financial assurance shall be \n     provided in the form of a surety bond, trust fund, cash or \n     equivalent. The amount of the financial assurance shall be \n     sufficient to assure the completion of reclamation satisfying \n     the requirements of this Act if the work had to be performed \n     by the Secretary in the event of\n      forfeiture, and the calculation shall take into account the \n     maximum level of financial exposure which shall arise \n     during the mineral activity including, but not limited to, \n     provision for accident contingencies.\n       (2) The financial assurance shall be held for the duration \n     of the mineral activities and for an additional period to \n     cover the operator's responsibility for revegetation under \n     subsection (n)(6)(B).\n       (3) The amount of the financial assurance and the terms of \n     the acceptance of the assurance shall be adjusted by the \n     Secretary from time to time as the area requiring coverage is \n     increased or decreased, or where the costs of reclamation or \n     treatment change, but the financial assurance must otherwise \n     be in compliance with this section. The Secretary shall \n     specify periodic times, or set a schedule, for reevaluating \n     or adjusting the amount of financial assurance.\n       (4) Upon request, and after notice and opportunity for \n     public comment, the Secretary may release in whole or in part \n     the financial assurance if the Secretary determines each of \n     the following:\n       (A) Reclamation covered by the financial assurance has been \n     accomplished as required by this Act.\n       (B) The operator has declared that the terms and conditions \n     of any other applicable Federal requirements, and State \n     requirements pursuant to subsection 203(b), have been \n     fulfilled.\n       (5) The release referred to in paragraph (4) shall be \n     according to the following schedule:\n       (A) After the operator has completed the backfilling, \n     regrading and drainage control of an area subject to mineral \n     activities and covered by the financial assurance, and has \n     commenced revegetation on the regraded areas subject to \n     mineral activities in accordance with the approved plan of \n     operations, 50 percent of the total financial assurance \n     secured for the area subject to mineral activities may be \n     released.\n       (B) After the operator has completed successfully all \n     mineral activities and reclamation activities and all \n     requirements of the plan of operations and the reclamation \n     plan and all the requirements of this Act have in fact been \n     fully met, the remaining portion of the financial assurance \n     may be released.\n       (6) During the period following release of the financial \n     assurance as specified in paragraph (5)(A), until the \n     remaining portion of the financial assurance is released as \n     provided in paragraph (5)(B), the operator shall be required \n     to meet all applicable standards of this Act and the plan of \n     operations and the reclamation plan.\n       (7) Where any discharge from the area subject to mineral \n     activities requires treatment in order to meet the applicable \n     effluent limitations, the treatment shall be monitored during \n     the conduct of mineral activities and reclamation and shall \n     be fully covered by financial assurance and no financial \n     assurance or portion thereof for the plan of operations shall \n     be released until the operator has met all applicable \n     effluent limitations and water quality standards for one full \n     year without treatment.\n       (8) Jurisdiction under this Act shall terminate upon \n     release of the final bond. If the Secretary determines, after \n     final bond release, that an environmental hazard resulting \n     from the mineral activities exists, or the terms and \n     conditions of the plan of operations or the surface \n     management requirements of this Act were not fulfilled in \n     fact at the time of release, the Secretary shall reassert \n     jurisdiction and all applicable surface management and \n     enforcement provisions shall apply for correction of the \n     condition.\n       (m) Reclamation.--(1) Except as provided under paragraphs \n     (5) and (7) of subsection (n), lands subject to mineral \n     activities shall be restored to a condition capable of \n     supporting the uses to which such lands were capable of \n     supporting prior to surface disturbance, or other beneficial \n     uses, provided such other uses are not inconsistent with \n     applicable land use plans.\n       (2) All required reclamation shall proceed as\n        contemporaneously as practicable with the conduct of \n     mineral activities and shall use the best technology \n     currently available.\n       (n) Reclamation Standards.--The Secretary shall establish \n     reclamation standards which shall include, but not \n     necessarily be limited to, provisions to require each of the \n     following:\n       (1) Soils.--(A) Topsoil removed from lands subject to \n     mineral activities shall be segregated from other spoil \n     material and protected for later use in reclamation. If such \n     topsoil is not replaced on a backfill area within a time-\n     frame short enough to avoid deterioration of the topsoil, \n     vegetative cover or other means shall be used so that the \n     topsoil is preserved from wind and water erosion, remains \n     free of any contamination by acid or other toxic material, \n     and is in a usable condition for sustaining vegetation when \n     restored during reclamation.\n       (B) In the event the topsoil from lands subject to mineral \n     activities is of insufficient quantity or of inferior quality \n     for sustaining vegetation, and other suitable growth media \n     removed from the lands subject to the mineral activities are \n     available that shall support vegetation, the best available \n     growth medium shall be removed, segregated and preserved in \n     alike manner as under subparagraph (A) for sustaining \n     vegetation when restored during reclamation.\n       (C) Mineral activities shall be conducted to prevent any \n     contamination or toxification of soils. If any contamination \n     or toxification occurs in violation of this subparagraph, the \n     operator shall neutralize the toxic material, decontaminate \n     the soil, and dispose of any toxic or acid materials in a \n     manner which complies with this section and any other \n     applicable Federal or State law.\n       (2) Stabilization.--All surface areas subject to mineral \n     activities, including spoil material piles, waste material \n     piles, ore piles, subgrade ore piles, and open or partially \n     backfilled mine pits which meet the requirements of paragraph \n     (5) shall be stabilized and protected during mineral \n     activities and reclamation so as to effectively control \n     erosion and minimize attendant air and water pollution.\n       (3) Erosion.--Facilities such as but not limited to basins, \n     ditches, streambank stabilization, diversions or other \n     measures, shall be designed, constructed and maintained where \n     necessary to control erosion and drainage of the area subject \n     to mineral activities, including spoil material piles and \n     waste material piles prior to the use of such material to \n     comply with the requirements of paragraph (5) and for the \n     purposes of paragraph (7), and including ore piles and \n     subgrade ore piles.\n       [[Page S3529]] (4) Hydrologic balance.--(A) Mineral \n     activities shall be conducted to minimize disturbances to the \n     prevailing hydrologic balance of the area subject to mineral \n     activities and adjacent areas and to the quality and quantity \n     of water in surface and ground water systems, including \n     stream flow, in the area subject to mineral activities and \n     adjacent areas, and in all cases the operator shall comply \n     with applicable Federal or State effluent limitations and \n     water quality standards.\n       (B) Mineral activities shall prevent the generation of acid \n     or toxic drainage during the mineral activities and \n     reclamation, to the extent possible using the best available \n     demonstrated control technology; and the operator shall \n     prevent any contamination of surface and ground water with \n     acid or other toxic mine drainage and shall prevent or remove \n     water from contact with acid or toxic producing deposits.\n       (C) Reclamation shall, to the extent possible, also include \n     restoration of the recharge capacity of the area subject to \n     mineral activities to approximate premining condition.\n       (D) Where surface or underground water sources used for \n     domestic or agricultural use have been diminished, \n     contaminated or interrupted as a proximate result of mineral\n      activities, such water resource shall be restored or \n     replaced.\n       (5) Grading.--(A) Except as provided under this paragraph \n     (7), the surface area disturbed by mineral activities shall \n     be backfilled, graded and contoured to its natural \n     topography.\n       (B) The requirement of subparagraph (A) shall not apply \n     with respect to an open mine pit if the Secretary finds that \n     such open pit or partially backfilled pit would not pose a \n     threat to the public health or safety or have an adverse \n     effect on the environment in terms of surface or groundwater \n     pollution.\n       (C) In instances where complete backfilling of an open pit \n     is not required, the pit shall be graded to blend with the \n     surrounding topography as much as practicable and revegetated \n     in accordance with paragraph (6).\n       (6) Revegetation.--(A) Except in such instances where the \n     complete backfill of an open mine pit is not required under \n     paragraph (5), the area subject to mineral activities, \n     including any excess spoil material pile and excess waste \n     pile, shall be revegetated in order to establish a diverse, \n     effective and permanent vegetative cover of the same seasonal \n     variety native to the area subject to mineral activities, \n     capable of self-regeneration and plant succession and at \n     least equal in extent of cover to the natural revegetation of \n     the surrounding area.\n       (B) In order to insure compliance with subparagraph (A), \n     the period for determining successful revegetation shall be \n     for a period of 5 full years after the last year of augmented \n     seeding, fertilizing, irrigation or other work, except that \n     such period shall be 10 full years where the annual average \n     precipitation is 26 inches or less.\n       (7) Excess spoil and waste.--(A) Spoil material and waste \n     material in excess of that required to comply with paragraph \n     (5) shall be transported and placed in approved areas, in a \n     controlled manner in such a way so as to assure long-term \n     mass stability and to prevent mass movement. In addition to \n     the measures described under paragraph (3), internal drainage \n     systems shall be employed, as may be required, to control \n     erosion and drainage. The design of such excess spoil \n     material piles and excess waste material piles shall be \n     certified by a qualified professional engineer.\n       (B) Excess spoil material piles and excess waste material \n     piles shall be graded and contoured to blend with the \n     surrounding topography as much as practicable and revegetated \n     in accordance with paragraph (6).\n       (8) Sealing.--All drill holes, and openings on the surface \n     associated with underground mineral activities, shall be \n     sealed when no longer needed for the conduct of mineral \n     activities to ensure protection of the public, fish and \n     wildlife, and the environment.\n       (9) Structures.--All buildings, structures or equipment \n     constructed, used or improved during mineral activities shall \n     be removed, unless the Secretary determines that the \n     buildings, structures or equipment shall be of beneficial use \n     in accomplishing the postmining uses or for environmental \n     monitoring.\n       (10) Fish and wildlife.--All fish and wildlife habitat in \n     areas subject to mineral activities shall be restored in a \n     manner commensurate with or superior to habitat conditions \n     which existed prior to the mineral activities, including such \n     conditions as may be prescribed by the Director, Fish and \n     Wildlife Service.\n       (o) Additional Standards.--The Secretary may, by \n     regulation, establish additional standards to address the \n     specific environmental impacts of selected methods of mineral \n     activities, such as, but not limited to, cyanide leach \n     mining.\n       (p) Definitions.--As used in subsections (m) and (n):\n       (1) The term ``best technology currently available'' means \n     equipment, devices, systems, methods, or techniques which are \n     currently available anywhere even if not in\n      routine use in mineral activities. The term includes, but is \n     not limited to, construction practices, siting \n     requirements, vegetative selection and planting \n     requirements, scheduling of activities and design of \n     sedimentation ponds. Within the constraints of the surface \n     management requirements of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     have the discretion to determine the best technology \n     currently available on a case-by-case basis.\n       (2) The term ``best available demonstrated control \n     technology'' means equipment, devices, systems, methods, or \n     techniques which have demonstrated engineering and economic \n     feasibility and practicality in preventing disturbances to \n     hydrologic balance during mineral activities and reclamation. \n     Such techniques will have shown to be effective and practical \n     methods of acid and other mine water pollution elimination or \n     control, and other pollution affecting water quality. The \n     ``best available demonstrated control technology'' will not \n     generally be in routine use in mineral activities. Within the \n     constraints of the surface management requirements of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall have the discretion to determine the \n     best available demonstrated control technology on a case-by-\n     case basis.\n       (3) The term ``spoil material'' means the overburden, or \n     nonmineralized material of any nature, consolidated or \n     unconsolidated, that overlies a deposit of any locatable \n     mineral that is removed in gaining access to, and extracting, \n     any locatable mineral, or any such material disturbed during \n     the conduct of mineral activities.\n       (4) The term ``waste material'' means the material \n     resulting from mineral activities involving beneficiation, \n     including but not limited to tailings, and such material \n     resulting from mineral activities involving processing, to \n     the extent such material is not subject to subtitle C of the \n     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 or the Uranium \n     Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act.\n       (5) The term ``ore piles'' means ore stockpiled for \n     beneficiation prior to the completion of mineral activities \n     and reclamation.\n       (6) The term ``subgrade ore'' means ore that is too low in \n     grade to be of economic value at the time of extraction but \n     which could reasonably be economical in the foreseeable \n     future.\n       (7) The term ``excess spoil'' means spoil material that may \n     be excess of the amount necessary to comply with the \n     requirements of subsection (m)(3).\n       (8) The term ``excess waste'' means waste material that may \n     be excess of the amount necessary to comply with the \n     requirements of subsection (m)(3).\n     SEC. 202. INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.\n       (a) Inspections and Monitoring.--(1) The Secretary shall \n     make such inspections of mineral activities so as to ensure \n     compliance with the surface management requirements. The \n     Secretary shall establish a frequency of inspections for \n     mineral activities conducted under an approved plan of \n     operations, but in no event shall such inspection frequency \n     be less than one complete inspection per calendar quarter or \n     two complete inspections annually for a plan of operations \n     for which the Secretary approves an application under section \n     201(j).\n       (2)(A) Any person who has reason to believe they are or may \n     be adversely affected by mineral activities due to any \n     violation of the surface management requirements may request \n     an inspection. The Secretary shall determine within 10 days \n     of receipt of the request whether the request states a reason \n     to believe that a violation exists, except in the event the \n     person alleges and provides reason to believe that an \n     imminent danger as provided by subsection (b)(2) exists, the \n     10-day period shall be waived and the inspection conducted \n     immediately. When an inspection is conducted under this \n     paragraph, the Secretary shall notify the person filing the \n     complaint and such person shall be allowed to accompany the \n     inspector during the inspection. The identity of the person \n     supplying information to the Secretary relating to a possible \n     violation or imminent danger or harm shall remain \n     confidential with the Secretary if so requested by that \n     person, unless that person elects to accompany an inspector \n     on the inspection.\n       (B) The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish \n     procedures for the review of any decision by his authorized \n     representative not to inspect or by a refusal by such \n     representative to ensure remedial actions are taken the \n     respect to any alleged violation. The Secretary shall furnish \n     such persons requesting the review a written statement of the \n     reasons for the Secretary's final disposition of the case.\n       (3)(A) The Secretary shall require all operators to develop \n     and maintain a monitoring and evaluation system which shall \n     be capable of identifying compliance with all surface \n     management requirements.\n       (B) Monitoring shall be conducted as close as technically \n     feasible to the mineral activity or reclamation involved, and \n     in all cases the monitoring shall be conducted within the \n     area affected by mineral activities and reclamation.\n       (C) The point of compliance shall be as close to the \n     mineral activity involved as is technically feasible, but in \n     any event shall be located to comply with applicable State \n     and Federal standards. In no event shall the point of \n     compliance be outside the area affected by mineral activities \n     and reclamation.\n       (D) The operator shall file reports with the Secretary on a \n     quarterly basis on the results of the monitoring and \n     evaluation process except that if the monitoring and \n     evaluation show a violation of the surface management \n     requirements, it shall be reported immediately to the \n     Secretary.\n       (E) The Secretary shall determine what information must be \n     reported by the operator \n     [[Page S3530]] pursuant to subparagraph (B). A failure to \n     report as required by the Secretary shall constitute a \n     violation of this Act and subject the operator to enforcement \n     action pursuant to this section.\n       (F) The Secretary shall evaluate the reports submitted \n     pursuant to this paragraph, and based on those reports and \n     any necessary inspection shall take enforcement action \n     pursuant to this section.\n       (b) Enforcement.--(1) If the Secretary or authorized \n     representative determines, on the basis of an inspection that \n     an operator, or any person conducting mineral activities \n     under section 201(b)(2), is in violation of any surface \n     management requirement, the Secretary or authorized \n     representative shall issue a notice of violation to the \n     operator or person describing the violation and the \n     corrective measures to be taken. The Secretary or authorized \n     representative shall provide such operator or person with a \n     reasonable period of time to abate the violation. If, upon \n     the expiration of time provided for such abatement, the \n     Secretary or authorized representative finds that\n      the violation has not been abated he shall immediately order \n     a cessation of all mineral activities or the portion \n     thereof relevant to the violation.\n       (2) If the Secretary or authorized representative \n     determines, on the basis of an inspection, that any condition \n     or practice exists, or that an operator, or any person \n     conducting mineral activities under section 201(b)(2), is in \n     violation of the surface management requirements, and such \n     condition, practice or violation is causing, or can \n     reasonably be expected to cause--\n       (A) an imminent danger to the health or safety of the \n     public; or\n       (B) significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air \n     or water resources;\n\n     the Secretary or authorized representative shall immediately \n     order a cessation of mineral activities or the portion \n     thereof relevant to the condition, practice or violation.\n       (3)(A) a cession order by the Secretary or authorized \n     representative pursuant to paragraphs (1) or (2) shall remain \n     in effect until the Secretary or authorized representative \n     determines that the condition, practice or violation has been \n     abated, or until modified, vacated or terminated by the \n     Secretary or authorized representative. In any such order, \n     the Secretary or authorized representative shall determine \n     the steps necessary to abate the violation in the most \n     expeditious manner possible, and shall include the necessary \n     measures in the order. The Secretary shall require \n     appropriate financial assurances to insure that the abatement \n     obligations are met.\n       (B) Any notice or order issued pursuant to paragraphs (1) \n     or (2) may be modified, vacated or terminated by the \n     Secretary or authorized representative. An operator, or \n     person conducting mineral activities under section 201(b)(2), \n     issued any such notice or order shall be entitled to a \n     hearing on the record pursuant to subsection (f).\n       (4) If, after 30 days of the date of the order referred to \n     in paragraph (3)(A), the required abatement has not occurred \n     the Secretary shall take such alternative enforcement action \n     against the responsible parties as will most likely bring \n     about abatement in the most expeditious manner possible. Such \n     alternative enforcement action shall include, but is not \n     necessarily limited to, seeking appropriate injunctive relief \n     to bring about abatement.\n       (5) In the event an operator, or person conducting mineral \n     activities under section 201(b)(2), is unable to abate a \n     violation or defaults on the terms of the plan of operation \n     the Secretary shall forfeit the financial assurance for the \n     plan of operations if necessary to ensure abatement and \n     reclamation under this Act.\n       (6) The Secretary shall not forfeit the financial assurance \n     while a review is pending pursuant to subsections (f) and \n     (g).\n       (c) Compliance.--(1) The Secretary may request the Attorney \n     General to institute a civil action for relief, including a \n     permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order, in \n     the district court of the United States for the district in \n     which the mineral activities are located whenever an \n     operator, or person conducting mineral activities under \n     section 201(b)(2):\n       (A) violates, fails or refuses to comply with any order \n     issued by the Secretary under subsection (b); or\n       (B) interferes with, hinders or delays the Secretary in \n     carrying out an inspection under subsection (a). Such court \n     shall have jurisdiction to provide such relief as may be \n     appropriate. Any relief granted by the court to enforce an \n     order under clause (A) shall continue in effect until the \n     completion or final termination of all proceedings for review \n     of such order under subsections (f) and (g), unless the \n     district court granting such relief sets it aside or modifies \n     it.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary shall utilize enforcement personnel from the Office \n     of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to augment \n     personnel of the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest \n     Service to ensure compliance with the surface management \n     requirements, and inspection requirements of subsection (a). \n     The Bureau of Land\n      Management and the Forest Service shall each enter into a \n     memorandum of understanding with the Office of Surface \n     Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for this purpose.\n       (d) Penalties.--(1) Any operator, or person conducting \n     mineral activities under section 201(b)(2), who fails to \n     comply with the surface management requirements shall be \n     liable for a penalty of not more than $5,000 per violation. \n     Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate \n     violation for purposes of penalty assessments. No civil \n     penalty under this subsection shall be assessed until the \n     operator charged with the violation has been given the \n     opportunity for a hearing under subsection (f).\n       (2) An operator, or person conducting mineral activities \n     under section 201(b)(2), who fails to correct a violation for \n     which a cessation order has been issued under subsection (b) \n     within the period permitted for its correction shall be \n     assessed a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 per \n     violation for each day during which such failure continues, \n     but in no event shall such assessment exceed a 30-day period.\n       (3) Whenever a corporation is in violation of the surface \n     management requirements or fails or refuses to comply with an \n     order issued under subsection (b), any director, officer or \n     agent of such corporation who knowingly authorized, ordered, \n     or carried out such violation, failure or refusal shall be \n     subject to the same penalties that may be imposed upon an \n     operator under paragraph (1).\n       (e) Citizen Suits.--(1) Except as provided under paragraph \n     (2), any person having an interest which is or may be \n     adversely affected may commence a civil action on his or her \n     own behalf to compel compliance--\n       (A) against the Secretary where there is alleged a \n     violation of any of the provisions of this Act or any \n     regulation promulgated pursuant to this Act or terms and \n     conditions of any plan of operations approved pursuant to \n     this Act;\n       (B) against any other person alleged to be in violation of \n     any of the provisions of this Act or any regulation \n     promulgated pursuant to this Act or terms and conditions of \n     any plan of operations approved pursuant to this Act;\n       (C) against the Secretary where there is alleged a failure \n     of the Secretary to perform any act or duty under this Act or \n     any regulation promulgated pursuant to this Act which is not \n     within the discretion of the Secretary; or\n       (D) against the Secretary where it is alleged that the \n     Secretary acts arbitrarily or capriciously or in a manner \n     inconsistent with this Act or any regulation promulgated \n     pursuant to this Act. The United States district courts shall \n     have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in \n     controversy or the citizenship of the parties. (2) No action \n     may be commenced except as follows:\n       (A) Under paragraph (1)(A) prior to 60 days after the \n     plaintiff has given notice in writing of such alleged \n     violation to the Secretary, or to the person alleged to be in \n     violation; except no action may be commenced against any \n     person alleged to be in violation if the Secretary has \n     commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a \n     court of the United States to require compliance with the \n     provisions of this title (but in any such action in a court \n     of the United States the person making the allegation may \n     intervene as a matter of right.)\n       (B) Under paragraph (1)(B) prior to 60 days after the \n     plaintiff has given notice in writing of such action to the \n     Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary shall by \n     regulation prescribe, except that such action may be brought \n     immediately after such notification in the case where the \n     violation or order complained of constitutes an imminent \n     threat to the environment or to the health or safety of the \n     public or would immediately affect a legal interest of the \n     plaintiff.\n       (3) Venue of all actions brought under this subsection \n     shall be determined in accordance with title 28 U.S.C. \n     1391(a).\n       (4) The court, in issuing any final order in any action\n        brought pursuant to paragraph (1) may award costs of \n     litigation (including attorney and expert witness fees) to \n     any party whenever the court determines such award is \n     appropriate. The court may, if a temporary restraining \n     order or preliminary injunction is sought, require the \n     filing of a bond or equivalent security in accordance with \n     the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n       (5) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict any right \n     which any person (or class of persons) may have under any \n     statute or common law to seek enforcement of any of the \n     provisions of this Act and the regulations thereunder, or to \n     seek any other relief, including relief against the \n     Secretary.\n       (f) Review by Secretary.--(1)(A) Any, operator, or person \n     conducting mineral activities under section 201(b)(2), issued \n     a notice of violation or cessation order under subsection \n     (b), or any person having an interest which is or may be \n     adversely affected by such decisions, notice or order, may \n     apply to the Secretary for review of the notice or order \n     within 30 days of receipt thereof, or as the case may be, \n     within 30 days of such notice or order being modified, \n     vacated or terminated.\n       (B) Any operator, or person conducting mineral activities \n     under section 201(b)(2), who is subject to a penalty under \n     subsection (d) or section 105 may apply to the Secretary for \n     review of the assessment within 30 days of notification of \n     such penalty.\n       (C) Any person having an interest which is or may be \n     adversely affected by a decision made by the Secretary under \n     subsections (g), (h), (i), (j), and (l) of section 201, or \n     subsection 202(a)(2), or subsection 204(g), may apply to the \n     Secretary for review of the decision within 30 days after it \n     is made.\n       (2) The Secretary shall provide an opportunity for a public \n     hearing at the request of any party. Any hearing conducted \n     pursuant \n     [[Page S3531]] to this subsection shall be on record and \n     shall be subject to section 554 of title 5 of the United \n     States Code. The filing of an application for review under \n     this subsection shall not operate as a stay on any order or \n     notice issued under subsection (b).\n       (3) Following the hearing referred to in paragraph (2), if \n     requested, but in any event the Secretary shall make findings \n     of fact and shall issue a written decision incorporating \n     therein an order vacating, affirming, modifying or \n     terminating the notice, order or decision, or with respect to \n     an assessment, the amount of penalty that is warranted. Where \n     the application for review concerns a cessation order issued \n     under subsection (b), the Secretary shall issue the written \n     decision within 30 days of the receipt of the application for \n     review, unless temporary relief has been granted by the \n     Secretary under paragraph (4).\n       (4) Pending completion of any proceedings under this \n     subsection, the applicant may file with the Secretary a \n     written request that the Secretary grant temporary relief \n     from any order issued under subsection (b) together with a \n     detailed statement giving reasons for such relief. The \n     Secretary shall expeditiously issue an order or decision \n     granting or denying such relief. The Secretary may grant such \n     relief under such conditions as he may prescribe only if such \n     relief shall not adversely affected the health or safety of \n     the public or cause significant, imminent environmental harm \n     to lad, air or water resources.\n       (5) The availability of review under this subsection shall \n     not be construed to limit the operation of rights established \n     under subsection (e).\n       (g) Judicial Review.--(1) Any action by the Secretary in \n     promulgating regulations to implement this Act, or any other \n     actions constituting rulemaking by the Secretary to implement \n     this Act, shall be subject to judicial review in the United \n     States District of Columbia. Any action subject to judicial \n     review under this subsection shall be affirmed unless the \n     court concludes that such action is arbitrary, capricious, or \n     otherwise inconsistent with law. A petition for review of any \n     action subject to judicial review under this subsection shall \n     be filed in the United States District Court for the District \n     of Columbia within 60 days from the date of such action, or \n     after such date if the petition is\n      based solely on grounds arising after the sixtieth day. Any \n     such petition may be made by any person who commented or \n     otherwise participated in the rulemaking or who may be \n     adversely affected by the action of the Secretary.\n       (2) Final agency action under this Act, including such \n     final action on those matters described under subsection (f), \n     shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with \n     paragraph (4) and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(a) of the United \n     States Code on or before 60 days from the date of such final \n     action.\n       (3) The availability of judicial review established in this \n     subsection shall not be construed to limit the operations of \n     rights established under subsection (e).\n       (4) The court shall hear any petition or complaint filed \n     under this subsection solely on the record made before the \n     Secretary. The court may affirm, vacate, or modify any order \n     or decision or may remand the proceedings to the Secretary \n     for such further action as it may direct.\n       (5) The commencement of a proceeding under this section \n     shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate \n     as a stay of the action, order or decision of the Secretary.\n       (h) Proceedings.--Whenever a proceeding occurs under \n     subsection (a), (f), or (g), or under section 201, or under \n     section 204(g), at the request of any person, a sum equal to \n     the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including \n     attorney fees) as determined by the Secretary or the court to \n     have been reasonably incurred by such person for or in \n     connection with participation in such proceedings, including \n     any judicial review of the proceeding, may be assessed \n     against either party as the court, resulting from judicial \n     review or the Secretary, resulting from administrative \n     proceedings, deems proper.\n\n     SEC. 203. STATE LAW AND REGULATION.\n\n       (a) State Law.--(1) Any reclamation standard or requirement \n     in State law or regulation that meets or exceeds the \n     requirements of subsections (m) and (n) of section 201 shall \n     not be construed to be inconsistent with any such standard.\n       (2) Any bonding standard or requirement in State law or \n     regulation that meets or exceeds the requirements of section \n     201(1) shall not be construed to be inconsistent with such \n     requirements.\n       (3) Any inspection standard or requirement in State law or \n     regulation that meets or exceeds the requirements of section \n     202 shall not be construed to be inconsistent with such \n     requirements.\n       (b) Applicability of Other State Requirements.--(1) Nothing \n     in this Act shall be construed as affecting any air or water \n     quality standard or requirement of any State law or \n     regulation which may be applicable to mineral activities on \n     lands subject to this Act.\n       (2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting in \n     any way the right of any person or enforce or protect, under \n     applicable law, such person's interest in water resources \n     affected by mineral activities on lands subject to this Act.\n       (c) Cooperative Agreements.--(1) Any State may enter into a \n     cooperative agreement with the Secretary for the purposes of \n     the Secretary applying such standards and requirements \n     referred to in subsection (a) and subsection (b) to mineral \n     activities or reclamation on lands subject to this Act.\n       (2) In such instances where the proposed mineral activities \n     would affect lands not subject to this Act in addition to \n     lands subject to this Act, in order to approve a plan of \n     operations the Secretary shall enter into a cooperative \n     agreement with the State that sets forth a common regulatory \n     framework consistent with the surface management requirements \n     of this Act for the purposes of such plan of operations.\n       (3) The Secretary shall not enter into a cooperative \n     agreement with any State under this section until after \n     notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for public \n     comment.\n       (d) Prior Agreements.--Any cooperative agreement or such \n     other understanding between the Secretary and any State, or \n     political subdivision thereof, relating to the surface \n     management of mineral activities on lands subject to this Act \n     that was in existence on the date of enactment of this Act \n     may only continue in force until the effective date of this \n     Act, after which time the terms and conditions of any such \n     agreement or understanding\n      shall only be applicable to plans of operations approved by \n     the Secretary prior to the effective date of this Act \n     except as provided under section 405.\n       (e) Delegation.--The Secretary shall not delegate to any \n     State, or political subdivision thereof, the Secretary's \n     authorities, duties and obligations under this Act, including \n     with respect to any cooperative agreements entered into under \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 204. UNSUITABILITY REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior in preparing \n     land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976, and the Secretary of Agriculture in preparing \n     land use plans under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the National \n     Forest Management Act of 1976, shall each conduct a review of \n     lands that are subject to this Act in order to determine \n     whether there are any areas which are unsuitable for all or \n     certain types of mineral activities pursuant to the standards \n     set forth under subsection (e). In the event such a \n     determination is made, the review shall be included in the \n     applicable land use plan.\n       (b) Specific Areas.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, on the basis of any information \n     available, shall each publish a notice in the Federal \n     Register identifying and listing the lands subject to this \n     Act which are or may be determined to be unsuitable for all \n     or certain types of mineral activities according to the \n     standards set forth in subsection (e). After opportunity for \n     public comment and proposals for modifications to such \n     listing, but not later than the effective date of this Act, \n     each Secretary shall begin to review the lands identified \n     pursuant to this subsection to determine whether such lands \n     are unsuitable for all or certain types of mineral activities \n     according to the standards set forth in subsection (e).\n       (c) Land Use Plans.--(1) At such time as the Secretary \n     revises or amends a land use plan pursuant to the provisions \n     of law other than this Act, the Secretary shall identify \n     lands determined to be unsuitable for all or certain types of \n     mineral activities according to the standards set forth in \n     subsection (e). The Secretary shall incorporate such \n     determinations in the applicable land use plans.\n       (c) If lands covered by a proposed plan of operations have \n     not been reviewed pursuant to this section at the time of \n     submission of a plan of operations, the Secretary shall, \n     prior to the consideration of the proposed plan of \n     operations, review the areas that would be affected by the \n     proposed mineral activities to determine whether the area is \n     unsuitable for all or certain types of mineral activities \n     according to the standards set forth in subsection (e). The \n     Secretary shall use such review in the next revision or \n     amendment to the applicable land use plan to the extent \n     necessary to reflect the unsuitability of such lands for all \n     or certain types of mineral activities according to the \n     standards set forth in subsection (e).\n       (3) This section does not require land use plans to be \n     amended until such plans are adopted, revised, or amended \n     pursuant to provisions of law other than this Act.\n       (d) Effect of Determination.--(1) If the Secretary \n     determines an area to be unsuitable under this section for \n     all or certain types of mineral activities, he shall do one \n     of the following:\n       (A) In any instance where a determination is made that an \n     area is unsuitable for all types of mineral activities, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, with the consent of the Secretary \n     of Agriculture for lands under the jurisdiction of the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, shall withdraw such area pursuant \n     to section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n     of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1714).\n       (B) In any instance where a determination is made that an \n     area is unsuitable for certain types of mineral activities, \n     the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to limit or \n     prohibit such types of mineral activities. (2) Nothing in \n     this section may be construed as affecting\n      lands where mineral activities under approved plans of \n     operations or under notice (as provided for in the \n     regulations of the Secretary of the Interior in effect \n     prior to the effective date of this Act relating to \n     [[Page S3532]] operations that cause a cumulative disturbance \n     of five acres or less) were being conducted on the effective \n     date of this Act, except as provided under subsection (g).\n       (3) Nothing in this section may be construed as prohibiting \n     mineral activities not subject to paragraph (2) where \n     substantial legal and financial commitments in such mineral \n     activities were in existence on the effective date of this \n     Act, but nothing in this section may be construed as limiting \n     any existing authority of the Secretary to regulate such \n     activities.\n       (4) Any unsuitability determination under this section \n     shall not prevent the types of mineral activities referred to \n     in section 201(b)(2)(A), but nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as authorizing such activities in areas withdrawn \n     pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1714).\n       (e) Review Standards.--(1) An area containing lands that \n     are subject to this Act shall be determined to be unsuitable \n     for all or certain types of mineral activities if the \n     Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for public \n     comment, that reclamation pursuant to the standards set forth \n     in subsections (m) and (n) of section 201 would not be \n     technologically and economically feasible for any such \n     mineral activities in such area and where--\n       (A) such mineral activities would substantially impair \n     water quality or supplies within the area subject to the \n     mining plan or adjacent lands, such as impacts on aquifers \n     and aquifer recharge areas;\n       (B) such mineral activities would occur on areas of \n     unstable geology that could if undertaken substantially \n     endanger life and property;\n       (C) such mineral activities would adversely affect \n     publicly-owned places which are listed on or are eligible for \n     listing on the National Register of Historic Places, unless \n     the Secretary and the State approve all or certain mineral \n     activities, in which case the area shall not be determined to \n     be unsuitable for such approved mineral activities;\n       (D) such mineral activities would cause loss of or damage \n     to riparian areas;\n       (E) such mineral activities would impair the productivity \n     of the land subject to such mineral activities;\n       (F) such mineral activities would adversely affect \n     candidate species for threatened and endangered species \n     status;

I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about another \nmatter, but I must respond to my friend from Arkansas--and he is, \nindeed, my friend--and say to him that I would be happy to cosponsor \nwith him a bill that will call for royalty on mining claims. However, \nwe have one slight disagreement about the definition of royalty. My \nfriend from Arkansas wants a royalty on gross revenues, where I am \nwilling to give him a royalty on net revenues.\n  I know the arguments about that and the answers about that. People \nsay, ``Oh, the bookkeepers will juggle the books in such a way as to \nguarantee there are no net revenues; therefore, royalty on net will not \nproduce anything of value.''\n  Royalty on gross, however, has the same impact as a decrease in \nprice. Coming from the State of Utah, where we have had direct \nexperience with what happens when there is a decrease in price in \nhardrock mining minerals, I know how devastating that can be to the \neconomy.\n  One of the largest employers in my State is Kennecott, with the \nlargest open-pit copper mine in the world. When the price of copper \nfell below a certain level--and I will be happy to supply that for the \nRecord later on if Senators are interested--Kennecott continued to \nproduce even though they were producing at a loss. They did this \nbecause they wanted to maintain their position in the world and \nmaintain their market share.\n  After awhile, however, they could not continue to do that, and \nultimately they shut down. The impact on the economy of the State of \nUtah, and particularly of the Salt Lake area, was devastating. \nKennecott was employing about 5,000 people. Kennecott was buying \nequipment from suppliers all over the valley that were employing \nthousands more. Kennecott no longer paid any State income taxes. \nCertainly, they were not paying any Federal income taxes. And their \nemployees who were out of work were not paying State or Federal income \ntaxes, but many of them were drawing unemployment compensation.\n  Kennecott was idle for several years until the price of copper went \nback up. And when the price of copper went back up, Kennecott said we \nare going to reopen the Kennecott mine. It was a great day for the \nState of Utah and for the city of Salt Lake when Kennecott reopened. \nThey started rehiring again. They did not hire all 5,000 back; they had \nmodern mining techniques, and they only hired 2,500. Even so, 2,500 \ngood-paying jobs in Utah were most welcome. As long as the price of \ncopper stays up, those jobs will be there and Kennecott will continue \nto supply that which we need in the economy there.\n  A gross royalty, as I said, Mr. President, is exactly the same thing \nas a price cut. If you put a gross royalty of 6 percent on the price of \ncopper, that is exactly the same thing as cutting the price of copper 6 \npercent. If you say, no, we will do a 3-percent royalty, that is \nexactly the same thing as cutting the price of copper 3 percent. Can \nthe company afford to pay it? If the price of copper is sufficiently \nhigh on the world market, absolutely, no problem. But what happens if \nthe price of copper starts to fall and that margin is the difference, \nthat gross royalty is the difference between a price the company \n[[Page S3536]] can survive at and a price the company has to close down \nat? The end result you know, Mr. President; the company shuts down.\n  So I am willing to endorse the idea of changing the 1872 mining law. \nI am willing to join with my friend from Arkansas in writing a change \nto that law and putting in a royalty for the Federal Government on \nthese minerals. But I want it to be a net royalty rather than a gross \nroyalty so that it does not produce the result of lowering the world \nprice of the commodity for that particular producer.\n  Let us take two mines, both of them mythical, but they will \nillustrate the point. In mine A, they are mining gold with a bulldozer. \nThat is how we mine copper, by the way, at the Kennecott copper mine. \nWe mine it with a bulldozer. It is an open pit copper mine, and they \njust bulldoze the material into the crushers and ultimately into the \nseparators, and ultimately they get the copper.\n  In mine B, they have to build shafts. They are mining with all kinds \nof challenges and difficulties finding the vein of gold. In mine A, the \ncost of mining the gold --again, picking a number out of the air, but \nthese are theoretical mines--in mine A, the gold is selling for $380 an \nounce. Their cost of producing it is about $100 an ounce. They have a \ngross margin of $280 an ounce on that gold. Mine B gold is selling for \n$380 an ounce. Their cost of producing it is $350 an ounce. They have a \nmargin of $30.\n  If you come along and put a gross royalty on gold, mine A is not \ngoing to pay any attention to that cost at all. Good Heavens, they are \nearning $230 an ounce. An extra $30 off of that, they are still going \nto earn $200 an ounce. No problem. They can pay the royalty, not be \nconcerned about it, go on their way, produce gold. But in mine B, $30 \nan ounce gross royalty means they have to shut down. And when you go \ninto a mining situation, you have to look at not only the price that is \nbeing earned on the world market, but you have to look at your cost of \nproduction. So if you had a net royalty, the kind that I am willing to \nsupport, you would say, in mine A, if the royalty, to pick a number to \nkeep it easy for those of us who cannot calculate too fast, is 10 \npercent, mine A is going to pay you on that $230 gross margin $23 an \nounce. Mine B is going to pay you $3 an ounce. But both mine A and mine \nB are going to be in business, and both of them are going to be hiring \npeople, and both of them are going to be maintaining payrolls, and both \nof them are going to be generating income to the Federal Government.\n  This brings me to the second point where I have a disagreement with \nmy friend from Arkansas when he says these fabulous finds that he \ndescribes produce not one penny to the Federal taxpayer. That is simply \nnot so. If the mine is as productive as the Senator indicates that it \nwill be, it produces income taxes from the profits of the company that \ngets the gold. It produces income taxes from the employees who are \nworking there. It produces income taxes from the profits of the \nsuppliers who produce the machinery and the power, the utilities, the \nrest of the things that go into making the mine work, and it produces \nincome taxes from the wages of the employees of the suppliers. Indeed, \nthe Federal Government gets an enormous amount of money out of a \nprofitable business operation like a profitable gold mine, a profitable \ncopper mine, a profitable palladium mine, whatever it is.\n  He wants to add to the amount of money the Federal Government is \ngetting from that operation some more money in the form of a royalty. \nAnd as I say, I am willing to support that. The place where I part \ncompany with him is on whether the royalty should be on the gross or on \nthe net.\n  As I have said, if it is on the gross, it represents a unilateral \nprice cut for American operators that foreign operators do not have to \nabsorb. If it is on the net, it represents an additional income tax, if \nyou will, but I am perfectly willing to grant that additional income \ntax on the grounds that the land they are using is Federal land and \nthere perhaps should be that additional tax.\n  As I talk to the miners in my State, they are willing to do that, \ntoo. There is no opposition now in the mining industry that I am aware \nof to a Federal royalty on Federal lands as long as it is a net royalty \nrather than a gross royalty.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I had not intended to speak about that when \nI came to the floor, but I always enjoy my friend from Arkansas. It \ncomes as no surprise to him to know that I have heard this speech \nbefore, so I have thought some of these things through from previous \nrecitations, and I am sure we will have the debate again as the \nCongress goes on. I commend him for his diligence. I commend him for \nhis determination to see this thing through, and I hope that in the \ncourse of things maybe we can come to an agreement and ultimately \nresolve this because I am not one who insists we cannot ever, ever \nchange the 1872 mining act.\n  I see the Senator is on his feet.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to comment \nwithout my losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. First of all, I wish to say that it is not just me \nsaying it, and perhaps the Senator from Utah would not wish to have \ncommendations from this side of the aisle, but I do want to say that my \nopinion of him is shared by my colleagues. It developed almost \nimmediately when he came here. He is really one of the fine additions \nto the Senate. He came here in 1992, was elected in the same year I was \nreelected. I found him to be an extremely thoughtful, compassionate, \ntruly dedicated public servant. We have worked together on two or three \nissues, most notably concessions contracts in the national parks. We \nhave gotten along beautifully. He does not vote the way I tell him to \nall the time, that is my only objection. But I can tell you, he is a \nman of integrity and a man of intellect, and it pains me that we are on \nopposite sides of this issue.\n  I do want to make two or three points in partial rebuttal to what my \ngood friend from Utah has just said.\n  First, upon the completion of exploration, mining companies generally \nhave a good idea about the amount and type of minerals located at a \nparticular site.\n  They make big investments to mine, nobody denies that. And they \nprovide a lot of jobs. But let me tell you, looking for oil can be a \nlot riskier than looking for minerals. Oftentimes, oil companies will \nspend, in deep sea water, almost $1 billion to drill a well and \nsometimes hit a duster. Yet, we charge them, if they do happen to hit \noil, 12.5 percent of the gross value of the oil they produce. And we \ncharge nothing to the mining industry.\n  Second, the Senator said that he objected to gross royalties, which I \nam strongly supportive of. But the Senator's own home State of Utah \ncharges a 4-percent gross royalty on any nonfissionable minerals taken \nfrom lands that belong to the State of Utah. And virtually every mining \ncontractor in this country on private lands provides for either a gross \nroyalty or a net smelter return, which is close to a gross royalty. So \nthere is nothing new or unique about that. I would rather take a \npercentage point or two less in royalties then to go through all those \nconvoluted methods that I have heard discussed in the Energy Committee.\n  Finally, while I am reluctant to use a personal analogy, my son and a \npartner went into the baking business approximately 12 years ago. They \nworked, I would say, 2 or 3 nights a week trying to perfect different \nrecipes, different cooking times, different temperatures, everything--\nto make what they thought was a perfect product. Then they rented a \nrestaurant that closed at 9 o'clock, and they baked until 1 o'clock in \nthe morning and would go out the next day and sell the product on the \nstreets.\n  Then they leased a little spot, and then they leased a bigger spot, \nand they leased a bigger spot, and 2 years ago they bought a big \nbuilding. It has been growing by leaps and bounds. I guess they would \nnormally have about 20 employees--during the Christmas season, maybe 30 \nto 35.\n  I guess that is just about the most graphic case I can think of, \nbecause it happens to be in the family, of somebody who went out and \nstarted a business, just as the Senator from Utah has \n[[Page S3537]] done. Nobody gave him a nickel to do anything. He took a \nbig risk. And it looks as though it is going to be a very successful \nbusiness.\n  My point is, nobody gets up on the floor of the Senate to defend the \nthousands and thousands of people like my son who never asked for \nanything and built a business. Do you know something else? He pays \ntaxes. Do you know something else? His employees pay taxes. And nobody \ngets up on the floor of the Senate and says, ``Ain't this wonderful?'' \nIt is only the mining industry, only the mining industry that you hear \nthat argument made for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend. I remind him--remind is the wrong \nterm--I tell him that I did stand on the floor and defend exactly the \nkind of businesses he just described during the debate last year over \nthe President's economic package, and told stories similar to the one \nhe has told, and demonstrated, I thought, how the devastation of the \n``S'' corporation procedure that was contained in the President's plan \nwould damage businesses like that.\n  I did not prevail on that occasion but I assure my colleague those \nkinds of presentations in defense of those businesses have been made. I \nhave great admiration for his son. I also happen to like his son's \ncookies, which the Senator is kind enough to share with me from time to \ntime. They are, indeed, a good product.\n  We can have this debate, and we will. My point is that there is more \nto this than simply the question of whether or not the taxpayers are \nbeing ripped off by giving away land. It is not that there are bars of \ngold sitting on the ground, waiting to be picked up and taken to Fort \nKnox and turned into cash. There are all kinds of processes that must \nbe performed before the gold can be refined, before it can be sold. I \nsay to the Senator, as he talks about the oil industry that faces \nexactly the same thing, I think his analogy is well taken. The oil \nindustry faces the risk of exploration, the costs of refining, and all \nof the rest of that.\n  We have in the State of Utah enough oil, according to the geologists, \nto dwarf and eclipse the oil in Saudi Arabia. We have trillions and \ntrillions and trillions of barrels of oil in the State of Utah. Why, \ntherefore, are we not producing oil? For the simple reason that in Utah \nthe oil is trapped in what is called oil shale. It is not down beneath \nthe sand, to be pumped out simply by, in the language of the oil \nindustry, sticking a straw in and sipping it up. And the oil shale does \nnot become commercially viable until the world price of oil goes \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $50 to $60 a barrel.\n  If we were going to get $60 a barrel for oil, you would see Utah take \nover for Saudi Arabia, and Utah be the oil center of the universe. But \nthe world price is not at $60 a barrel; the world price is nowhere near \n$60 a barrel.\n  Let us say that the world price was close to making shale oil \ncommercially viable but the 12.5-percent increase in the world price \nrepresented by the U.S. royalty was the knife edge between its being \nprofitable and not profitable. If that were to be the case and we were \nfacing a serious energy crisis, I would come to the floor and say let \nus repeal the 12.5-percent royalty. Let us go to a net royalty on oil \ncompanies. Indeed, I am willing to talk about that as a possibility \nhere.\n  You know the gold is there. Yes. When you buy the land, when you \npatent the land, you know the gold is there. The thing you do not know \nand cannot predict, cannot be sure of, is the world price of the gold. \nThat is where you are taking a gamble. If the world price of the metal \nfalls below a certain level, you have just lost your money, which is \nwhat happened, as I said, in the State of Utah where we lost 5,000 \njobs, not because people did not know the copper was there. The copper \nwas still there. The difference is that the world price fell, and when \nthe world price fell below that level, we shut down and we lost all the \njobs. And we lost all the employment. When the world price came back \nup, the jobs came back up.\n  My concern is not to bail out the rich mining companies. My concern \nis to hang onto those jobs if I can and say let us put the royalties in \nsuch a fashion that we do not cut the price for U.S. producers by an \namount that their foreign competitors do not have.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 505. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency not to act under section 6 of the Toxic Substances \nControl Act to prohibit the manufacturing, processing, or distribution \nof certain fishing sinkers or lures; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n                common sense in fishing regulations act\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Common \nSense In Fishing Regulations Act. This bill limits government \nregulation run amok, its approval would put a little common sense into \nan area of extreme overregulation.\n  In March of last year the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] \nproposed a rule that would ban the manufacture and sale of lead fishing \nsinkers--the weights most anglers use to get their baits and lures down \nto where the fish are. As an angler myself, I see this as a clear \nexample of overzealous regulators acting far outside the realm of the \nreasonable and into the ridiculous.\n  In 1992 the Environmental Defense Fund, a fine organization with \nhighly laudable goals, and several other organizations petitioned EPA \nunder the Toxic Substances Control Act to issue a regulation that would \nrequire labels on lead fishing sinkers stating that lead is toxic to \nwildlife. In a few rare cases it has been shown that waterfowl will \ningest sinkers improperly discarded at the water's edge, using them in \ntheir digestive tract to help grind their food. Because the sinkers can \nstay in the birds for an extended time, lead poisoning can develop. The \npetitioners felt that if anglers were made more aware of the possible \ndangers of improperly discarding used sinkers they would be even more \nconscientious with their use. However, EPA went far beyond the scope of \nthe petition and I believe in fact the law and proposed a total ban on \nthe sale and manufacture of lead sinkers.\n  In their research EPA could document fewer than 50 cases, nationwide, \nover a period of 16 years in which waterfowl had died of lead poisoning \nlikely due to the ingestion of lead sinkers. Across this entire Nation \nover a period of 16 years, they could only document a few possible \ncases and yet they want to stop millions of American anglers from using \ndevices that have been in use on this continent for centuries! If this \nis not a case of extreme overregulation and micromanagement by a \nFederal bureaucracy, I don't know what is. EPA has based their actions \non speculation and anecdotal information, not on hard scientific \nresearch. It is incomprehensible that EPA would base such a far \nreaching regulation on such a statistically insignificant number of \nincidents out of a bird population that numbers in the hundreds of \nmillions. No one would dispute that lead in the bloodstream is toxic \nand that waterfowl could die from using lead in their digestive system. \nBut EPA has clearly not established that lead sinkers ``present or will \npresent an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the \nenvironment'' as is clearly required for such action under the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act. In fact, they clearly state that they cannot \nestablish any threat to human health through the home manufacture of \nlead sinkers.\n  And that is where a great many lead sinkers are made. In the \nbasements and garages across this country, many anglers have a side \nhobby, making sinkers, jigs, and other lead based fishing tackle. They \nmake different types, test their effectiveness, and make modifications \non their designs as needed. This adds greatly to the fishing experience \nand angling challenge through more complete involvement in all aspects \nof the sport. Yet EPA wants to prohibit this type of activity without \nany scientific basis whatsoever. The proposed rule even states that the \npossible risk to human health through home manufacture is impossible to \nevaluate.\n  When lead shot for waterfowl hunting was banned several years ago, \nhundreds of thousands of waterfowl gizzards were examined. There was \nclear evidence that lead shotgun shell pellets did pose a very real \nthreat to ducks and geese. That is just not the case in this instance. \nAs I stated, there is not enough evidence to warrant such a sweeping \nregulation.\n  [[Page S3538]] This ban would also force many small manufacturers out \nof business. While it can be feasible for a large company to retool and \ndevelop alternatives to lead, the costs to a small business in terms of \nthe research and equipment needed to convert their operation is \nprohibitive and would force many small businesses to close their doors, \nleaving many individuals without livelihoods. While the larger \ncompanies reap the benefits of deeper pockets, the small business is \nsqueezed out.\n  One of the true ironies in EPA's proposed rule is that it does not \nban the use of lead sinkers, or ban the sale of current stocks. It \nseems strange to me that if these sinkers are so bad for the \nenvironment that they must be banned that EPA would allow their \ncontinued use in any instance. Anglers can continue to use the sinkers \nthey have on hand after the ban becomes effective, and stores are given \ntime in the proposed rule to sell out whatever stock they have on hand. \nThis proposal thus would create an enforcement nightmare. It might take \nyears, sinkers are pretty durable and often a small number will last an \nangler for quite some time, to use all the lead sinkers in existence \nshould the ban become effective. In the meantime, will EPA enforcement \nofficers be checking people's garages and basements to ensure that new \nsinkers are not being made? Will a black market in lead sinkers \ndevelop? And what would this regulation require of State fish and game \nenforcement officers?\n  Mr. President, a regulation such as this could greatly add to the \nburden on a State's game wardens. These individuals are some of the \nhardest working and most efficient law enforcement officials in the \ncountry and in an increasingly hostile environment we want to require \nthem to determine the age of every sinker used. This regulation could \nforce law abiding anglers--and most are extremely careful when it comes \nto game laws--to prove where and when they got any sinkers they are \nusing or face criminal charges. Will anglers be required to keep the \nreceipts for all of their tackle in their tackle boxes to prove \npurchase dates? All this because EPA has gone wild with regulations.\n  No group is more widely supportive of environmentally sound \nregulation than America's anglers. They see the very direct correlation \nbetween sound, sane environmental regulations and the benefits gained \nfrom them. Without environmental protections, the hobby and industry \nthat is fishing in America would not be viable. Anglers understand all \ntoo well that without appropriate protections and regulations one of \nAmerica's most widely enjoyed outdoor sports would cease to exist. \nWithout sound policies America's water would soon be devoid of fish and \nmost anglers are extremely cognizant of that and act accordingly when \nin the pursuit of their hobby. But this regulation is far beyond any \nreasonable and sound environmental policy. It is based on guesswork and \nsupposition, not sound science. It oversteps the bounds of common \nsense.\n  Mr. President, before EPA proposes such a rule that will create \nuntold headaches for State enforcement officials, anglers and many \nsmall business, it should be ready to provide much more complete proof \nthat it is necessary and would be effective.\n  Finally, this amendment does not preclude future EPA action on this \nissue. EPA should take appropriate steps to protect waterfowl, no one \nis arguing that point. The bill I am introducing today specifies that \nshould more substantial evidence or risk to either human health or \nwildlife become available then the Administrator is directed to report \nthat information to Congress and make suggestions regarding possible \nlegislative action.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that there are many critically \nimportant rules and regulations in place and being drafted on things \nfrom protecting worker rights and worker safety to making sure our air \nis clean. Some are proposing to freeze all regulations and gut many \nothers. That is clearly not the right approach. We need reforms, but we \nneed common sense reforms. We need to be very selective to assure that \ncritical protections are not discarded as we act to block the \nridiculous.\n  Having said that, it is important that this bill be passed as soon as \npossible as EPA is actively pursuing its course of action on this \nproposed rule. They have held hearings and the comment period has \nclosed. EPA will soon be coming out with the final rule on this subject \nand millions of anglers will be seriously affected by the finalization \nof this ridiculous rule.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this measure and to help bring a \nlittle more common sense to our Government. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Common Sense in Fishing \n     Regulations Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) millions of Americans of all ages enjoy recreational \n     fishing; fishing is one of the most popular sports;\n       (2) lead and other types of metal sinkers and fishing lures \n     have been used by Americans fishing for hundreds of years;\n       (3) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has proposed to issue a rule under section 6 of the \n     Toxic Substances Control Act, to prohibit the manufacturing, \n     processing, and distribution in commerce in the United \n     States, of certain smaller size fishing sinkers containing \n     lead and zinc, and mixed with other substances, including \n     those made of brass;\n       (4) the Environmental Protection Agency has based its \n     conclusions that lead fishing sinkers of a certain size \n     present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the \n     environment on less than definitive scientific data, \n     conjecture and anecdotal information;\n       (5) alternative forms of sinkers and fishing lures are \n     considerably more expensive than those made of lead; \n     consequently, a ban on lead sinkers would impose additional \n     costs on millions of Americans who fish;\n       (6) in the absence of more definitive evidence of harm to \n     the environment, the Federal Government should not take steps \n     to restrict the use of lead sinkers; and\n       (7) alternative measures to protect waterfowl from lead \n     exposure should be carefully reviewed.\n\n     SEC. 3. FISHING SINKERS AND LURES.\n\n       (a) Directive.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall not, under purported authority of \n     section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2605), take action to prohibit or otherwise restrict the \n     manufacturing, processing, distributing, or use of any \n     fishing sinkers or lures containing lead, zinc, or brass.\n       (b) Further Action.--If the Administrator obtains a \n     substantially greater amount of evidence of risk of injury to \n     health or the environment than that which was adduced in the \n     rulemaking proceedings described in the proposed rule dated \n     February 28, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 11122 (March 9, 1994)), the \n     Administrator shall report those findings to Congress, with \n     any recommendation that the Administrator may have for \n     legislative action.\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 34\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 34, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat geological, \ngeophysical, and surface casing costs like intangible drilling and \ndevelopment costs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 200\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 200, a bill \nto amend title 18, United States Code, to regulate the manufacture, \nimportation, and sale of any projectile that may be used in a handgun \nand is capable of penetrating police body armor.\n\n\n                                 S. 240\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Coats] was added as a cosponsor of S. 240, a bill to amend the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to establish a filing deadline and to \nprovide certain safeguards to ensure that the interests of investors \nare well protected under the implied private action provisions of the \nact.\n\n\n                                 S. 244\n\n  At the request of Mr. Harkin, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n244, a bill to further the goals of the Paperwork Reduction Act to have \nFederal agencies become more responsible and publicly accountable for \nreducing the burden of Federal paperwork on the public, and for other \npurposes.\n  At the request of Mr. Nunn, the names of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Lott], the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], the Senator from \nHawaii [Mr. Akaka], the Senator from \n[[Page S3539]] Iowa [Mr. Grassley], the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nThomas], the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Thompson], the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], and \nthe Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] were added as cosponsors of S. \n244, supra.\n\n\n                                 S. 476\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 476, a bill to \namend title 23, United States Code, to eliminate the national maximum \nspeed limit, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 3\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the names of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns], the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], the Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Craig], the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth], the \nSenator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], the Senator from North Carolina \n[Mr. Helms], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. Kyl], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], the Senator \nfrom Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], and the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nThurmond] were added as cosponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 3, a \nconcurrent resolution relative to Taiwan and the United Nations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3521-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3539-S3540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 9--RELATING TO A VISIT BY PRESIDENT LEE \n    TENG-HUI OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Brown, Mr. Robb, \nMr. D'Amato, Mr. Simon, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Helms, Mr. Coats, Mr. Pell, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Grams, Mr. Dole, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Roth, Mr. Thurmond, \nMr. Hatch, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Mack, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nAshcroft, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Craig) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 9\n\n       Whereas United States diplomatic and economic security \n     interests in East Asia have caused the United States to \n     maintain a policy of recognizing the People's Republic of \n     China while maintaining solidarity with the democratic \n     aspirations of the people of Taiwan;\n       Whereas the Republic of China on Taiwan (known as Taiwan) \n     is the United States' sixth largest trading partner and an \n     economic powerhouse buying more than twice as much annually \n     from the United States as do the 1,200,000,000 Chinese of the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas the American people are eager for expanded trade \n     opportunities with Taiwan, the sixth largest trading partner \n     of the United States and the possessor of the world's second \n     largest foreign exchange reserves;\n       Whereas the United States interests are served by \n     supporting democracy and human rights abroad;\n       Whereas Taiwan is a model emerging democracy, with a free \n     press, free elections, stable democratic institutions, and \n     human rights protections;\n       Whereas vigorously contested elections conducted on Taiwan \n     in December 1994 were extraordinarily free and fair;\n       Whereas United States interests are best served by policies \n     that treat Taiwan's leaders with respect and dignity;\n       Whereas President Lee, a Ph.D. graduate of Cornell \n     University, has been invited to pay a private visit to his \n     alma mater and to attend the annual USA-ROC Economic Council \n     Conference in Anchorage, Alaska;\n       Whereas there is no legitimate policy grounds for excluding \n     the democratic leader of Asia's oldest republic from paying \n     private visits;\n       Whereas the Senate of the United States voted several times \n     in 1994 to welcome President Lee to visit the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas Public Law 103-416 provides that the President of \n     Taiwan shall be welcome in the United States at any time to \n     discuss a host of important bilateral issues: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     President should promptly indicate that the United States \n     will welcome a private visit by President Lee Teng-hui to his \n     alma mater, Cornell University, and will welcome a transit \n     stop by President Lee in Anchorage, Alaska, to attend the \n     USA-ROC Economic Council Conference.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am introducing today, on behalf of \nmyself and 35 colleagues, a resolution calling on President Clinton to \nallow his excellency Lee Teng-hui, President of the Republic of China \non Taiwan, to come to the United States for a private visit. A nearly \nidentical resolution is also being introduced today by my colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives, Congressmen Lantos, Solomon, and \nTorricelli.\n  This is not the first time this issue has come before this body. The \nlast Congress spoke very clearly on the question of a visit by \nPresident Lee. The Senate approved unanimously a resolution offered by \nmyself and Senator Robb calling on the administration to make several \nchanges to United States-Taiwan policy, including allowing President \nLee to visit the United States. Then, under Senator Brown's leadership, \nthe Senate agreed by a vote of 94-0 to amend United States immigration \nlaws to add a provision specifically welcoming the leader of the \nTaiwanese people to enter the United States at any time to discuss \nissues of mutual concern. This amendment was eventually adopted by the \nCongress and signed into law.\n  Unfortunately, up to now, the Clinton Administration has chosen to \nignore Congress and yield to the People's Republic of China on this \nissue. In the last several months, various State Department officials \nhave indicated in public forums that they do not intend to allow \nPresident Lee to make a private visit. Mr. President, this State \nDepartment policy allows the People's Republic of China to dictate who \ncan and cannot enter the United States--and that offends this Senator \nand many others.\n  For many years, Congress and the executive branch have prodded the \npeople of Taiwan to make greater strides toward democracy. Taiwan has \nresponded: Over the last decade, Taiwan has ended martial law, allowed \nthe development of a free and vigorous press, and legalized opposition \npolitical parties. Last December, people throughout Taiwan went to the \npolls in a free and fair election, which was vigorously contested by \nall parties.\n  I remind my colleagues that Taiwan is the world's 13th largest \ntrading partner and the United States' 5th largest trading partner. \nWith $17 billion in United States exports to Taiwan in 1994, it \npurchased twice as many United States products as the People's Republic \nof China. It holds the world's largest foreign reserves. Taiwan is also \nfriendly, democratic, stable, and prosperous. Its human rights record \nhas steadily improved.\n  Yet, rather than rewarding Taiwan for these great strides, it remains \nthe policy of the Clinton administration to deny entry into the United \nStates to the democratic leader of Asia's oldest republic; in effect, \ntreating Taiwan like an international pariah. Many of us were outraged \nlast May when the administration refused to allow President Lee to \novernight in Hawaii en route to a presidential inauguration in Central \nAmerica. While we are aware of the need to maintain a productive \nrelationship with the People's Republic of China, there is no \ndefensible argument for allowing Communist bureaucrats in Beijing to \nblock a private visit to the United States by the elected leader of the \nTaiwanese people.\n  President Lee, a Ph.D. graduate of Cornell University in New York, \nhas expressed a desire to visit his alma mater. In addition, President \nLee has been invited to attend the annual USA-ROC Economic Council \nConference in Anchorage, AK. Other Senators and Representatives have \ninvited him to visit their respective States. It would be entirely \nappropriate to allow one or more of these private visits.\n  The attached resolution demonstrates the support of the new Congress \nfor democracy movements around the world and our commitment to \nincreased economic ties and people-to-people contacts between the \nAmerican people and the people of Taiwan. If the administration \ncontinues to ignore the voice of Congress, it may be necessary to move \nfurther legislation amending United States immigration laws or \nreopening the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act in order to facilitate these \nchanges.\n  I urge the administration to reconsider its current position on a \nvisit by President Lee. Certainly, there is ample precedent for \nallowing a private visit. After all, the administration has \n[[Page S3540]] seen the benefit of having Yasser Arafat, leader of the \nPLO, attend a White House ceremony. Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the \npolitical wing of the Irish Republican Army, has been granted travel \nvisas. Tibet's exile leader, the Dalai Lama, called on Vice President \nGore over the strong objections of the People's Republic of China. Each \nof these men represent unofficial entities with which the United States \ndoes not have official ties. Similarly, in each case, other countries \nwith whom we maintain diplomatic relations objected. yet, the \nadministration rightly chose to allow visits to advance other policy \ngoals. A similar rationale should be applied to President Lee.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3539-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3540-S3541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   ROTH (AND NUNN) AMENDMENT NO. 317\n\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Nunn) proposed an amendment to the bill \n(S. 244) to further the goals of the Paperwork Reduction Act to have \nFederal agencies become more responsible and publicly accountable for \nreducing the burden of Federal paperwork on the public, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 8, lines 19 and 20, strike out ``and processes, \n     automated or manual,''.\n       On page 8, line 25, beginning with ``section'' strike out \n     all through line 2 on page 9 and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``section 111(a)(2) and (3)(C)(i) through (v) of the Federal \n     Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. \n     759(a)(2) and (3)(C)(i) through (v));''.\n       On page 22, line 24, strike out ``a senior official'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``senior officials''.\n       On page 23, line 2, strike out ``for the military \n     departments''.\n       On page 46, lines 8 and 9, strike out ``collection of \n     information prior to expiration of time periods established \n     under this chapter'' and insert in lieu thereof ``a \n     collection of information''.\n       On page 46, line 13, strike out ``such time periods'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``time periods established under this \n     chapter''.\n       On page 46, lines 17 and 18, strike out ``within such time \n     periods because'' and insert in lieu thereof ``because''.\n       On page 46, line 21, strike out ``or''.\n       On page 46, beginning with line 22, strike out all through \n     line 2 on page 47 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(ii) an unanticipated event has occurred; or\n       ``(iii) the use of normal clearance procedures is \n     reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of \n     information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or \n     court ordered deadline to be missed.''\n       On page 49, line 14, insert ``(a)'' before ``In order''.\n       On page 50, insert between lines 22 and 23 the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(b) This section shall not apply to operational files as \n     defined by the Central Intelligence Agency Information Act \n     (50 U.S.C. 431 et seq.).''\n       On page 56, lines 4 and 5, strike out ``section 4-206 of \n     Executive Order No. 12036, issued January 24, 1978,'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``section 3.4(e) of Executive Order \n     No. 12333, issued December 4, 1981,''.\n       On page 58, insert between lines 2 and 3 the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 3.

OREGON OPTION PROPOSAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal, State and local governments are dealing with \n     increasingly complex problems which require the delivery of \n     many kinds of social services at all levels of government;\n       (2) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n     Nation's problems by providing categorical assistance with \n     detailed requirements relating to the use of funds which are \n     often delivered by State and local governments;\n       (3) although the current approach is one method of service \n     delivery, a number of problems exist in the current \n     intergovernmental structure that impede effective delivery of \n     vital services by State and local governments;\n       (4) it is more important than ever to provide programs that \n     respond flexibly to the needs of the Nation's States and \n     communities, reduce the barriers between programs that impede \n     Federal, State and local governments' ability to effectively \n     deliver services, encourage the Nation's Federal, State and \n     local governments to be innovative in creating programs that \n     meet the unique needs of the people in their communities \n     while continuing to address national goals, and improve the \n     accountability of all levels of government by better \n     measuring government performance and better meeting the needs \n     of service recipients;\n       (5) the State and local governments of Oregon have begun a \n     pilot project, called the Oregon Option, that will utilize \n     strategic planning and performance-based management that may \n     provide new models for intergovernmental social service \n     delivery;\n       (6) the Oregon Option is a prototype of a new \n     intergovernmental relations system, and it has the potential \n     to completely transform the relationships among Federal, \n     State and local governments by creating a system of \n     intergovernmental service delivery and funding that is based \n     on measurable performance, customer satisfaction, prevention, \n     flexibility, and service integration; and\n       (7) the Oregon Option has the potential to dramatically \n     improve the quality of Federal, State and local services to \n     Oregonians.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Oregon Option project has the potential to improve \n     intergovernmental service delivery by shifting accountability \n     from compliance to performance results and that the Federal \n     Government should continue in its partnership with the State \n     and local governments of Oregon to fully implement the Oregon \n     Option.\n       On page 58, line 3, strike out ``SEC. 3.'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``SEC. 5.''.\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        McCAIN AMENDMENT NO. 318\n\n  Mr. McCAIN proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 244, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of the pending measure, add the following new \n     section:\n     [[Page S3541]] SEC.   .

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize two \noutstanding groups of young leaders in the State of Rhode Island. These \nindividuals of the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts have exhibited great \nqualities such as leadership and hard work.\n  Since the beginning of the century, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts have \ndeveloped leadership skills in their members through determination, \nself-reliance, and teamwork.\n  The Silver and Gold Awards are the two highest honors that can be \nreceived by any Girl Scout. Those who have received these awards have \ndemonstrated excellence, hard work, and the desire to help in their \ncommunity. Likewise, the Eagle Scout is the highest award given to a \nBoy Scout. Candidates must display leadership in outdoor skills and \nservice projects helpful to their communities and religious and school \ninstitutions.\n  I am proud to congratulate these recipients of these distinguished \nawards. The young leaders pose as role models to their fellow peers. \nTheir skills learned through Girl and Boy Scouts will serve them well.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the recipient's parents, their Scout \nleaders, and Scouting organizations. These selfless people have \ncontributed their time and energy to the Girl and Boy Scouts.\n  Therefore, with great honor I submit the list of young women and men \nwho have earned these awards.\n  The list follows:\n\nClass of 1994 Eagle Scouts, Narragansett Council, Boy Scouts of America\n\n\n                              ASHAWAY, RI\n\n       Robert J.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the Anti-\nDefamation League [ADL] for their continuing work to expose and combat \nhate crimes, and to bring your attention to their most recent ``Audit \nof Anti-Semitic Incidents.'' For the past 16 years, the ADL has \ncompiled data about anti-Jewish attacks. Their efforts in the \ncollection of data and the development of programs regarding anti-\nSemitic acts increase public awareness of this problem, and help \ngenerate constructive solutions. I commend ADL for continuing this \nimportant endeavor, and would like to share with you some of their \nrecent findings.\n  Unfortunately, the ADL's 1994 survey indicates that the number and \nseverity of anti-Semitic hate crimes has worsened nationwide. There \nwere 2,066 incidents reported to ADL from 46 States, the District of \nColumbia, and Puerto Rico in 1994 alone. This represents an overall \nincrease of more than 10 percent from 1993, and constitutes the first \ntime the audit total has gone over 2,000. I was particularly troubled \nby the dramatic rise in the number of violent, destructive, and, in one \ncase, deadly assaults against Jews. For the fourth year, the number of \nanti-Semitic acts against individuals outnumber the incidents of \nvandalism against institutions and other property. The number of \nreported incidents of assault, threat, and harassment totaled 1,197. \nThis represents almost an 11-percent increase from 1993. In fact, acts \nof harassment and personal assault have risen 291 percent in a 10-year \nspan. Shootings, arsons, and firebombings were also far more prevalent \nthan in previous years. In 1994, there were 25 arsons and 10 arson \nattempts, compared with the total of 41 arsons in the 5 previous years \ncombined.\n  While these numbers make a dramatic statement about the magnitude of \nanti-Semitic hate crime, some specific examples more graphically \nillustrate the sad story of hatred present in our society today. The \nmost violent incident occurred in New York City, where, on March 1, a \nlone gunman opened fire on a van filled with Hasidic students crossing \nthe Brooklyn Bridge. One student died in the attack and three other \nstudents were seriously wounded. The ADL reports that in Memphis, two \nolder teenagers attacked two 13-year-old Jewish boys with a sword while \nyelling anti-Semitic epithets.\n  In February, in Eureka, CA, a bedroom of a Jewish family's home was \nset afire and a message was left: ``I got a Jew.'' In Michigan, in \nNovember, a Jewish couple received a package in the mail containing a \nsevered dog's head wrapped in a plastic bag, on which was written \n``Dirty Jew'' and swastikas.\n  Tragically, anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses continued to \nrise and increased by 17 percent from 1993. At South Alabama \nUniversity, a Jewish faculty member found a note in his campus mailbox \nreading, ``Death to Jews--That means you* * *'' At Northwestern \nUniversity, ``Kill all the Jews'' was written on a residence hall \nadviser's memo board in response to the question, ``What do you think \nof race relations at NU?'' At Temple Law School, a student was harassed \nby a member of the Western Heritage Society who said, ``I heard you \ndiscussing cross burnings and I'd like to arrange one for you.'' From \nFebruary through April, nearly 300 books in the library of Cleveland \nState University in Ohio were defaced with hate stickers incorporating \nNazi themes.\n  The ADL's report did contain some positive information, however. The \nnumber of arrests made in connection with anti-Semitic crimes more than \ndoubled from the 1993 total. This may be attributable in part to the \ngrowing impact of State and Federal hate crime legislation and improved \nhate crime training programs for law enforcement officials. For \nexample, Colorado law enforcement agencies recently brought charges, \nresulting from an 8-month investigation into Denver-area hate groups, \nagainst 21 young adults, ages ranging from 19 to 26, who were members \nof white supremist and skinhead organizations.\n  [[Page S3543]] In closing, I again want to commend the ADL for its \noutstanding and important work.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3542-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       ABOLISH METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON AIRPORTS AUTHORITY--S. 496\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Warner \nin introducing legislation removing congressional oversight from the \noperations at Washington National and Dulles Airports.\n  Quick passage of legislation removing congressional oversight is \nimperative. The Supreme Court recently upheld a lower court's ruling \nthat the congressional review board violates the constitutional \nseparation of executive and legislative powers. Under the lower court's \norder, Congress must reach a solution to the separation of powers issue \nby March 31 or the Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority will be \nunable to complete actions which require the approval of the review \nboard.\n  Although there are proposals under consideration in the House and \nSenate relating to the congressional review board, most of the other \nproposed legislation also addresses matters such as the perimeter rule \nwhich limits flights to and from Washington National Airport to 1,250 \nmiles, reconstituting the review board under another name, and the slot \nrule which limits the number of flights and hours of operation at \nNational Airport. These contentious issues are unrelated to the problem \nat hand and will delay passage of legislation needed to keep the \nairports operating.\n  With a court-imposed deadline fast approaching, it is imperative that \nwe enact this clean bill in an expeditious matter, and I urge quick \nconsideration and passage of this measure.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3543-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3543-S3545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                CARDINAL JOSEPH BERNARDIN ON HEALTH CARE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, when I think of individuals who \nspeak for our societal conscience from a spiritual perspective, I know \nof no other more qualified or appropriate than my good friend Cardinal \nJoseph Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago. He recently addressed the \nHarvard Business School Club of Chicago regarding his concerns with the \nrapid commercialization of our health care delivery system. I ask that \nhis speech be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  Whether we agree with it or not, there is a wave of fundamental \nchange underway in our health delivery system. It is the transformation \nor assimilation of nonprofit hospitals and health providers into for-\nprofit health delivery systems. Almost every day, you will read in the \nbusiness section about how many hospitals are being purchased by large \ninvestor-owned companies.\n  Let me be clear, I am not opposed to the idea of encouraging private \nenterprise and industry innovation in our health care system. Indeed, \nour health care system, which is the best in the world for those who \nhave access to it, was largely built on the foundation of cutting-edge \nmedical technology and research conducted by for-profit pharmaceutical \nand medial equipment companies.\n  What I would like for us to reflect upon, however, is whether the \nrapid unrestrained commercialization of the health care delivery system \nis in the best long-term interests of our country. Cardinal Bernardin \nwisely states in his speech that, ``* * * there is a fundamental \ndifference between the provision of medical care and the production and \ndistribution of commodities * * *'' and that ``* * * the primary * * * \npurpose of medical care delivery should be a cured patient * * * and a \nhealthier community, not to earn a profit * * *.''\n  As we work together toward reforming portions of our health care \nsystem this year, I hope all of us will take some time out to reflect \nupon the fundamental changes that are taking place in the health care \nsystem today and ask whether they are in the best interests of our \nsociety tomorrow. As you do so, I hope that you will have Cardinal \nBernardin's advice in mind.\n  The speech follows:\n             Making the Case for Not-for-Profit Healthcare\n\n       Good afternoon. It is a privilege to address the Harvard \n     Business School Club of Chicago on the critical, but often \n     conflicted issue of healthcare. Because of its central \n     importance to human dignity, to the quality of our community \n     life, and to the Church's mission in the world, I have felt a \n     special responsibility to devote a considerable amount of \n     attention to healthcare at both the local and national \n     levels.\n       In the last year, I have spoken at the National Press Club \n     on the need to ensure access to adequate healthcare for all; \n     I have issued a Protocol to help ensure the future presence \n     of a strong, institutional healthcare ministry in the \n     Archdiocese of Chicago; and in order to be more in touch with \n     ongoing developments in the field, I have joined the Board of \n     Trustees of the Catholic Health Association of the United \n     States--the national organization that represents more than \n     900 Catholic acute and long-term care facilities.\n       In the interest of full disclosure, I must warn you that \n     this considerable activity does not qualify me as a \n     healthcare expert. Healthcare policy is challenging and \n     extraordinarily complicated, and in this area I am every bit \n     the layman. But because of its central importance in our \n     lives--socially, economically, ethically, and personally--we \n     ``non-experts'' avoid the healthcare challenge at our peril.\n       I come before you today in several capacities. First, as \n     the Catholic Archbishop of Chicago who has pastoral \n     responsibility for numerous Catholic healthcare institutions \n     in the archdiocese--though each is legally and financially \n     independent. Second, as a community leader who cares\n      deeply about the quality and availability of healthcare \n     services throughout metropolitan Chicago and the United \n     States. And third, as an individual who, like you, will \n     undoubtedly one day become sick and vulnerable and require \n     the services of competent and caring medical professionals \n     and hospitals.\n\n\n            the growing threat to not-for-profit healthcare\n\n       In each role I am becoming increasingly concerned that our \n     healthcare delivery system is rapidly commercializing itself, \n     and in the process is abandoning core values that should \n     always be at the heart of healthcare. These developments have \n     potentially deleterious consequences for patients and society \n     as a whole. This afternoon, I will focus on one important \n     aspect of this problem: the future vitality and integrity of \n     not-for-profit hospitals.\n       Not-for-profit hospitals constitute the overwhelming \n     majority of Chicagoland hospitals. They represent more than \n     three quarters of the nonpublic acute-care general hospitals \n     in the country. Not-for-profit hospitals are the core of this \n     nation's private, voluntary healthcare delivery system, but \n     are in jeopardy of becoming for-profit enterprises.\n       Not-for-profit hospitals began as philanthropic social \n     institutions, with the primary purpose of serving the \n     healthcare needs of their communities. In recent decades, \n     they have become important non-governmental ``safety net'' \n     institutions, taking care of the growing numbers of uninsured \n     and underinsured persons. Indeed, most not-for-profit \n     hospitals regard the provisions of community benefit as their \n     principal mission. Unfortunately, this historic and still \n     necessary role is being compromised by changing economic \n     circumstances in healthcare, and by an ideological challenge \n     to the very notion of not-for-profit healthcare.\n       Both an excess supply of hospital beds and cost-conscious \n     choices by employers, insurers, and government have forced \n     not-for-profits into new levels of competition for paying \n     patients. They are competing with one another, with investor-\n     owned hospitals, and with for-profit ambulatory facilities. \n     In their struggle for economic survival, a growing number of \n     not-for-profits are sacrificing altruistic concerns for the \n     bottom line.\n       The not-for-profit presence in healthcare delivery is also \n     threatened by a body of opinion that contends there is no \n     fundamental distinction between medical care and a commodity \n     exchanged for profit. It is argued that healthcare delivery \n     is like other necessary economic goods such as food, \n     clothing, and shelter and should be subject to unbridled \n     market competition.\n       According to this view, economic competition in healthcare \n     delivery is proposed as a welcome development with claims \n     that it is the surest way to eliminate excess hospital and \n     physician capacity, reduce healthcare prices, and assure the \n     ``industry's'' long-term efficiency. Many proponents of this \n     view question the need for not-for-profit hospitals since \n     they believe investor-owned institutions operate more \n     efficiently than their not-for-profit counterparts and can \n     better attract needed capital. Thus, they attack the not-for-\n     profit hospital tax exemption as an archaic and unwarranted \n     subsidy that distorts the healthcare market by providing \n     exempt institutions an unfair competitive advantage.\n       This afternoon, I will make three arguments: First, that \n     there is a fundamental difference between the provision of \n     medical care and the\n      production and distribution of commodities; second, that the \n     not-for-profit structure is better aligned with the \n     essential mission of healthcare delivery than is the \n     investor-owned model; and third, that leaders in both the \n     private and public sector have a responsibility to find \n     ways to preserve and strengthen the not-for-profit \n     hospital and healthcare delivery system in the United \n     [[Page S3544]] States. Before making these arguments I need \n     to clarify an important point.\n\n\n            the advantages of capitalism and free enterprise\n\n       In drawing the distinction between medical care and other \n     commodities on the one hand, and not-for-profit and investor-\n     owned institutions on the other, I am not expressing any \n     general bias against capitalism or the American free \n     enterprise system. We are all beneficiaries of the genius of \n     that system. To paraphrase Pope John Paul II: If by \n     capitalism is meant an economic system that recognizes the \n     fundamental and positive role of business, the market, \n     private property, and the resulting responsibility for the \n     means for production--as well as free human creativity in the \n     economic sector--then its contribution to American society \n     has been most beneficial.\n       As a key element of the free enterprise system, the \n     American business corporation has proved itself to be an \n     efficient mechanism for encouraging and minimizing commercial \n     risk. It has enabled individuals to engage in commercial \n     activities that none of them could manage alone. In this \n     regard, the purpose of the business corporation is specific: \n     to earn a growing profit and a reasonable rate of return for \n     the individuals who\n      have created it. The essential element here is a reasonable \n     rate of return, for without it the commercial corporation \n     cannot exist.\n\n\n                      society's non-economic goods\n\n       That being said, it is important to recognize that not all \n     of society's institutions have as their essential purpose \n     earning a reasonable rate of return on capital. For example, \n     the purpose of the family is to provide a protective and \n     nurturing environment in which to raise children. The purpose \n     of education at all levels is to produce knowledgeable and \n     productive citizens. And the primary purpose of social \n     services is to produce shelter, counseling, food, and other \n     programs for people and communities in need. Generally \n     speaking, each of these organizations has as its essential \n     purpose a non-economic goal: the advancement of human \n     dignity.\n       And this is as it should be. While economics is indeed \n     important, most of us would agree that the value of human \n     life and the quality of the human condition are seriously \n     diminished when reduced to purely economic considerations. \n     Again, to quote Pope John Paul II, the idea that the entirety \n     of social life is to be determined by market exchanges is to \n     run ``the risk of an `idolatry' of the market, an idolatry \n     which ignores the existence of goods which by their nature \n     are not and cannot be mere commodities.'' (Emphasis added.)\n       This understanding is consistent with the American \n     experience. In the belief that the non-economic ends of the \n     family, social services, and education are essential to the \n     advancement of human dignity and to the quality of our social \n     and economic life, we have treated them quite differently \n     from most other goods and services. Specifically, we have not \n     made their allocation dependent solely on a person's ability \n     to afford them. For example, we recognize that individual \n     human dignity is enhanced through a good education,\n      and that we all benefit by having an educated society; so we \n     make an elementary and secondary education available to \n     everyone, and heavily subsidize it thereafter. By \n     contrast, we think it quite appropriate that hair spray, \n     compact disks, and automobiles be allocated entirely by \n     their affordability.\n\n\n                   healthcare: not simply a commodity\n\n       Now it is my contention that healthcare delivery is one of \n     those ``goods which by their nature are not and cannot be \n     mere commodities.'' I say this because healthcare involves \n     one of the most intimate aspects of our lives--our bodies \n     and, in many ways, our minds and spirits as well. The quality \n     of our life, our capacity to participate in social and \n     economic activities, and very often life itself are at stake \n     in each serious encounter with the medical care system. This \n     is why we expect healthcare delivery to be a competent and a \n     caring response to the broken human condition--to human \n     vulnerability.\n       To be sure, we expect our physician to earn a good living \n     and our hospital to be economically viable, but when it comes \n     to our case we do not expect them to be motivated mainly by \n     economic self-interest. When it comes to our coronary bypass \n     or our hip replacement or our child's cancer treatment, we \n     expect them to be professional in the original sense of that \n     term--motivated primarily by patient need, not economic self-\n     interest. We have no comparable expectation--nor should we--\n     of General Motors of Wal-Mart. When we are sick, vulnerable, \n     and preoccupied with worry we depend on our physician to be \n     our confidant, our advocate, our guide and agent in an \n     environment that is bewildering for most of us, and where \n     matters of great importance are at stake.\n       The availability of good healthcare is also vital to the \n     character of community life. We would not think well of \n     ourselves if we permitted healthcare\n      institutions to let the uninsured sick and injured go \n     untreated. We endeavor to take care of the poor and the \n     sick as much for our benefit as for theirs. Accordingly, \n     most Americans believe society should provide everyone \n     access to adequate healthcare services just as it ensures \n     everyone an education through grade twelve. There is a \n     practical aspect to this aspiration as well because, like \n     education, healthcare entails community-wide needs which \n     it impacts in various ways: We all benefit from a healthy \n     community; and we all suffer from a lack of health, \n     especially with respect to communicable disease.\n       Finally, healthcare is particularly subject to what \n     economists call market failure. Most healthcare ``purchases'' \n     are not predictable, nor do medical services come in \n     standardized packages and different grades, suitable to \n     comparison shopping and selection--most are specific to \n     individual need. Moreover, it would be wrong to suggest that \n     seriously ill patients defer their healthcare purchases while \n     they shop around for the best price. Nor do we expect people \n     to pay the full cost of catastrophic, financially devastating \n     illnesses. This is why most developed nations spread the risk \n     of these high-cost episodes through public and/or private \n     health insurance. And due to the prevalence of health \n     insurance, or third-party payment, most of us do not pay for \n     our healthcare at the time it is delivered. Thus, we are \n     inclined to demand an infinite amount of the very best care \n     available. In short, healthcare does not lend itself to \n     market discipline in the same way as most other goods and \n     services.\n       So healthcare--like the family, education, and social \n     services--is special. It is fundamentally different\n      from most other goods because it is essential to human \n     dignity and the character of our communities. It is, to \n     repeat, one of those ``goods which by their nature are not \n     and cannot be mere commodities.'' Given this special \n     status, the primary end or essential purpose of medical \n     care delivery should be a cured patient, a comforted \n     patient, and a healthier community, not to earn a profit \n     or a return on capital for shareholders. This \n     understanding has long been a central ethical tenet of \n     medicine. The International Code of the World Health \n     Organization, for example, states that doctors must \n     practice their profession ``uninfluenced by motives of \n     profit.''\n\n\n             The advantages of not-for-profit institutions\n\n       This leads me to my second point, that the primary non-\n     economic ends of healthcare delivery are best advanced in a \n     predominantly not-for-profit delivery system.\n       Before making this argument, however, I need to be very \n     clear about what I am not saying: I am not saying that not-\n     for-profit healthcare organizations and systems should be \n     shielded from all competition. I believe properly structured \n     competition is good for most not-for-profits. For example, I \n     have long contended that the quality of elementary and \n     secondary education would benefit greatly from the use of \n     vouchers and expanded parental choice in the selection of \n     schools; similarly, the Catholic Health Association's \n     proposal for\n      healthcare reform envisions organized, economically \n     disciplined healthcare systems competing with one another \n     for enrollees.\n       Second, I am not saying that all not-for-profit hospitals \n     and healthcare systems act appropriately, some do not. But \n     the answer to this problem is greater accountability in their \n     governance and operation, not the extreme measure of \n     abandoning the not-for-profit structure in healthcare.\n       What I am saying is that the not-for-profit structure is \n     the preferred model for delivering healthcare services. This \n     is so because the not-for-profit institution is uniquely \n     designed to provide essential human services. Management \n     expert Peter Drucker reminds us that the distinguishing \n     feature of not-for-profit organizations is not that they are \n     non-profit, but that they do something very different from \n     either business or government. He notes that a business has \n     ``discharged its task when the customer buys the product, \n     pays for it, and is satisfied with it,'' and that government \n     has done so when its ``policies are effective.'' On the other \n     hand, he writes:\n       ``The `non-profit' institution neither supplies goods or \n     services nor controls (through regulation). Its `product' is \n     neither a pair of shoes nor an effective regulation. Its \n     product is a changed human being. The non-profit institutions \n     are human change agents. Their `product' is a cured patient, \n     a child that learns, a young man or woman grown into a self-\n     respecting adult; a changed human life altogether.''\n       In other words, the purpose of not-for-profit organizations \n     is to improve the human condition, that is, to advance \n     important non-economic,\n      non-regulatory functions that cannot be as well served by \n     either the business corporation or government. Business \n     corporations describe success as consistently providing \n     shareholders with a reasonable return on equity. Not-for-\n     profit organizations never properly define their success \n     in terms of profit; those that do have lost their sense of \n     purpose.\n       This difference between not-for-profits and businesses is \n     most clearly seen in the organizations' different approaches \n     to decision making. The primary question in an investor-owned \n     organization is: ``How do we ensure a reasonable return to \n     our shareholders?'' Other questions may be asked about \n     quality and the impact on the community, but always in the \n     context of their effect on profit. A properly focused not-\n     for-profit always begins with a different set of questions:\n       What is best for the person who is served?\n       What is best for the community?\n       How can the organization ensure a prudent use of resources \n     for the whole community, as well as for its immediate \n     customers?\n\n\n                 HEALTHCARE'S ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\n       I believe there are four essential characteristics of \n     healthcare delivery that are especially compatible with the \n     non-for-profit structure, but much less likely to occur \n     [[Page S3545]] when healthcare decision making is driven \n     predominantly by the need to provide a return on equity. \n     These four essential characteristics are:\n       Access.\n       Medicine's patient-first ethic.\n       Attention to community-wide needs.\n       Volunteerism.\n       Let me discuss each.\n       First, there is the need for access. Given healthcare's \n     essential relationship to human dignity, society should \n     ensure everyone access to an adequate level of healthcare \n     services. This is why the United States Catholic Conference \n     and I argued strongly last year for universal insurance \n     coverage. This element of healthcare reform remains a moral \n     imperative.\n       But even if this nation had universal insurance, I would \n     maintain that a strong not-for-profit sector is still \n     critical to access. With primary accountability to \n     shareholders, investor-owned organizations have a powerful \n     incentive to avoid not only the uninsured and underinsured, \n     but also vulnerable and hard-to-serve populations, high-cost \n     populations, undesirable geographic areas, and many low-\n     density rural areas. To be sure, not-for-profits also face \n     pressure to avoid these groups, but not with the added \n     requirement of generating a return of equity.\n       Second, not-for-profit healthcare organizations are better \n     suited than their investor-owned counterparts to support the \n     patient-first ethic in medicine. This is all the more \n     important as society moves away from fee-for-service medicine \n     and cost-based reimbursement toward capitation. (By \n     ``capitation'' I mean paying providers in advance a fixed \n     amount per person regardless of the services required by any \n     specific individual.)\n       Whatever their economic disadvantages, fee-for-service \n     medicine and cost-based reimbursement shielded the physician \n     and the hospital from the economic consequences of patient-\n     first ethic in American medicine. Few insured patients were\n      ever undertreated, though some were inevitably overtreated. \n     Now we face a movement to a fully capitated healthcare \n     system that shifts the financial risk in healthcare from \n     the payers of care to the providers.\n       This development raises a critically important question: \n     ``When the providers is at financial risk for treatment \n     decisions who is the patient's advocate?'' How can we \n     continue to put the patient first in this new arrangement? \n     This challenge will become especially daunting as we move \n     into an intensely price competitive market where provider \n     economic survival is on the line every day. In such an \n     environment the temptation to undertreat could be \n     significant. Again, not-for-profits will face similar \n     economic pressure but not with the added requirement of \n     producing a reasonable return on shareholder equity. Part of \n     the answer here, I believe, is to ensure that the nation not \n     convert to a predominantly investor-owned delivery system.\n       Third, in healthcare there are a host of community-wide \n     needs that are generally unprofitable, and therefore unlikely \n     to be addressed by investor-owned organizations. In some \n     cases, this entails particular services needed by the \n     community but unlikely to earn a return on investment, such \n     as expensive burn units, neonatal intensive care, or \n     immunization programs for economically deprived populations. \n     Also important are the teaching and research functions needed \n     to renew and advance healthcare.\n       The community also has a need for continuity and stability \n     of health services. Because the primary purpose of not-for-\n     profits is to serve patients\n      and communities, they tend to be deeply rooted in the fabric \n     of the community and are more likely to remain--if they \n     are needed--during periods of economic stagnation and \n     loss. Investor-owned organizations must, on the other \n     hand, either leave the community or change their product \n     line when return-on-equity becomes inadequate.\n       Fourth, volunteerism and philanthropy are important \n     components of healthcare that thrives best in a non-for-\n     profit setting. As Peter Drucker has noted, volunteerism in \n     not-for-profit organizations is capable of generating a \n     powerful countercurrent to the contemporary dissolution of \n     families and loss of community values. At a time in our \n     history when it is absolutely necessary to strengthen our \n     sense of civic responsibility, volunteerism in healthcare is \n     more important than ever. From the boards of trustees of our \n     premier healthcare organizations to the hands-on delivery of \n     services, volunteers in healthcare can make a difference in \n     peoples' lives and ``forge new bonds to community, a new \n     commitment to active citizenship, to social responsibility, \n     to values.''\n\n\n                     role of mediating institutions\n\n       In addition to my belief that the not-for-profit structure \n     is especially well aligned with the central purpose of \n     healthcare, let me suggest one more reason why each of us \n     should be concerned that not-for-profits remain a vibrant \n     part of the nation's healthcare delivery system: They are \n     important mediating institutions.\n       The notion of mediating structures is deeply rooted in the \n     American experience: On the one hand, these institutions \n     stand between the individual and the state; on the other, \n     they mediate against the rougher edges of capitalism's \n     inclination toward excessive individualism. Mediating \n     structures such as family, church, education, and healthcare \n     are the institutions closest to the control and aspirations \n     of most Americans.\n       The need for mediating institutions in healthcare is great. \n     Private sector failure to provide adequately for essential \n     human services such as healthcare invites government \n     intervention. While government has an obligation to ensure \n     the availability of and access to essential services, it \n     generally does a poor job of delivering them. Wherever \n     possible we prefer that government work through and with \n     institutions that are closer and more responsive to the \n     people and communities being served. This role is best played \n     by not-for-profit hospitals. Neither public nor private, they \n     are the heart of the voluntary sector in healthcare.\n       Earlier, I identified several reasons why I believe \n     investor-owned organizations are not well suited to meeting \n     all of society's needs and expectations regarding healthcare. \n     Should the investor-owned entity ever become the predominant \n     form of healthcare delivery, I believe that our country will \n     inevitably experience a sizeable and substantial growth in \n     government intervention and control.\n       Until now, I have made two arguments: first, that \n     healthcare is more than a commodity--it is a service \n     essential to human dignity and to the quality of community \n     life; and second, that the not-for-\n      profit structure is best aligned with this understanding of \n     healthcare's primary mission. My concluding argument is \n     that private and public sector leaders have an urgent \n     civic responsibility to preserve and strengthen our \n     nation's predominantly not-for-profit healthcare delivery \n     system.\n       This is a pressing obligation because the not-for-profit \n     sector in healthcare may already be eroding as a result of \n     today's extremely turbulent competitive environment in \n     healthcare. The problem, let me be clear, is not competition \n     per se, but the kind of competition that undermines \n     healthcare's essential mission and violates the very \n     character of the not-for-profit organization by encouraging \n     it--even requiring it--to behave like a commercial \n     enterprise.\n       Contemporary healthcare markets are characterized by \n     hospital overcapacity and competition for scare primary care \n     physicians, but also, and more ominously, by shrinking health \n     insurance coverage and growing risk selection in private \n     health insurance markets. These latter two features encourage \n     healthcare providers to compete by becoming very efficient at \n     avoiding the uninsured and high risk populations, and by \n     reducing necessary but unprofitable community services--\n     behavior that strikes at the heart of the not-for-profit \n     mission in healthcare. Moreover, the environment leads some \n     healthcare leaders to conclude that the best way to survive \n     is to become for-profit or to create for-profit subsidiaries. \n     The existence of not-for-profits is further threatened by the \n     aggressive efforts of some investor-owned chains to expand \n     their market share by purchasing not-for-profit hospitals and \n     by publicly challenging the continuing need for not-for-\n     profit organizations in healthcare.\n\n\n            advancing the not-for-profit healthcare mission\n\n       Each of us and our communities have much to lose if we \n     allow unstructured market forces to\n      continue to erode the necessary and valuable presence of \n     not-for-profit healthcare organizations. It is imperative, \n     therefore, that we immediately begin to find ways to \n     protect and strengthen them.\n       How can we do this? Without going into specifics, I believe \n     it will require a combination of private sector and \n     governmental initiatives. Voluntary hospital board members \n     and executives must renew their institutions' commitment to \n     the essential mission of not-for-profit healthcare. \n     Simultaneously, government must reform health insurance \n     markets to prevent ``redlining'' and assure everyone \n     reasonable access to adequate healthcare services. Finally, \n     government should review its tax policies to ensure that \n     existing laws and regulations are not putting not-for-profits \n     at an inappropriate competitive disadvantage, but are holding \n     them strictly accountable for their tax exempt status.\n       Let me conclude by simply reiterating the thesis I made at \n     the beginning of this talk. Healthcare is fundamentally \n     different from most other goods and services. It is about the \n     most human and intimate needs of people, their families, and \n     communities. It is because of this critical difference that \n     each of us should work to preserve the predominantly not-for-\n     profit character of our healthcare delivery in Chicago and \n     throughout the country.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/06/senate-section/article/S3543-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3545-S3546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 1995\n\n  Mr. ROTH.
