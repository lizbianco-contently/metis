Mr. President, we will soon once again cast a historic \nvote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It will be a \nhistoric vote. It will be a defining vote. Given the experience of the \nlast 26 years, $5 trillion in debt, interest on debt that will soon \nexceed Defense Department spending, it is certainly an appropriate \nmatter for the Senate to consider.\n  I will not prolong my remarks right now, but, Mr. President, I will \nyield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, \nif I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for having \nthis time for us to discuss this very important issue.\n  For many years, I have supported the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget. The American people\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nhave overwhelmingly indicated repeatedly that they support a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I guess it would be \njust as well, maybe better, if we had in fact been balancing the budget \nevery year over all these many years going all the way back, I guess, \nto 1969 when we had a last annual balanced budget.\n  There have been some very serious, some very credible efforts to come \nup with a balanced budget over a period of a number of years. Last \nyear, the Congress passed a balanced budget resolution that would have \nbalanced the budget in a 7-year period of time, with the plan to get \nthat job done. Of course, that one was vetoed by the President. There \nhave been other instances where we started toward controlling Federal \nspending. We had that effort in the early 1980's when President Reagan \nwas in the White House. We had the Gramm-Latta bill that reduced \nspending by several billions of dollars and then after about 1982-83 \nthe numbers, the spending by Congress started going back the other way.\n  And, of course, we had the Gramm-Rudman procedure whereby if we did \nnot actually balance the budget each year, there would be an across-\nthe-board cut known as a sequester. This had an impact for a year or \ntwo, and then every time Congress would get up to the point where they \nwere going to have to make decisions or allow sequester or cuts to go \ninto effect, Congress backed away from it, just moved the dates until \nfinally it was rendered useless.\n  So there have been some good efforts, but the fact is it has not been \naccomplished. But yet almost every State in the Nation balances its \nbudget every year. Even a poor State like my home State of Mississippi \nevery year balances its budget.\n  Why is it? It is because the constitutions at the State level require \nit. You cannot have deficit spending in so many States. A few of them \nthat do not have it in their constitution do it anyway. Some of them I \nguess have it in their constitution and may violate what is required. \nBut for the most part I believe that is the fundamental difference.\n  It is time the Federal Government lived within its means. I think the \nsimple solution is if you do not have x amount of revenue coming in to \nget the job done, you just make changes. You change priorities. If you \ndo not have it, you do not spend it. It is real simple.\n  I believe that putting this balanced budget requirement in the \nConstitution is the responsible thing to do, and it is the mechanism \nthat will guarantee that Congress, working with the President, would \nhave to do the responsible thing, and that is balance the budget each \nyear.\n  A week ago, Mr. President, I joined Senator Domenici and others in \nwriting President Clinton one last plea that he support the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. That is what we need. Last time \nwe had this vote, we were one vote short in the Senate--just one vote. \nAnd there were at least six or seven Senators who had voted for a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget in the past but switched \nand voted against it last year. So there is a pool of Democrats that \ncould be convinced, and I thought that a plea from the President would \nmake the difference.\n\n  So far his reply has been silence, and that is disappointing, but it \nis not entirely surprising. But if he really agrees that we should have \na balanced budget, which he has said that he does, then we need his \nhelp. Both as a candidate and as Chief Executive, President Clinton has \ntalked a good fight about balancing the Federal budget. But when it \ncomes to the one legislative veto that can get the job done, he has not \nbeen very helpful.\n  It is often said that the Federal Government and the taxpayers, more \nimportant, are drowning in red ink. That is a good metaphor, but it \nneeds one addition. That addition is President Clinton standing at the \nedge of the red ink ocean, feeling the pain of those who are drowning \nwhile holding behind his back the only available life preserver. This \nis that available life preserver. That is the balanced budget \namendment. It is the only way that we have, that I have seen, to pull \nour children and our grandchildren out of the sea of Government debt. \nIt is the only means we have to force Government to live within its \nmeans.\n  An old song reminds us that ``It don't mean a thing if it ain't got \nthat swing.'' By the same token, no amount of Presidential rhetoric \nabout a balanced budget means a thing if we do not pass a balanced \nbudget amendment. Opponents of the amendment know that and have known \nit all along. That is why they have been willing over the years to give \nlipservice to the goal of budgetary balance and even to endorse the \nbalanced budget amendment itself as long as there was no immediate \nprospect of its passage.\n  Now, I think a lot of credit goes to the Senator from Illinois; he \nhas worked hard in actually trying to get this done. There are many who \nhave said they would vote for it, but when it got to the time actually \nto vote for it, decided they better change their mind, especially last \nyear when they saw it was about to pass.\n\n  Then came the elections of 1994. The old order sort of shattered and \nthe political landscape was transformed with the new majorities of both \nthe House and Senate.\n  Almost overnight, a balanced budget amendment was not just talk \nanymore. Clear majorities in both Chambers of Congress had pledged to \nvote for it. So the angry and aroused, energized electorate was finally \ngoing to get some action, action it had been seeking for a long time. \nThat is what the American public thought was happening.\n  But we were entering a period of second thoughts, a time when many \nMembers of Congress revised their official positions on the balanced \nbudget amendment. I already pointed out that six Senators who had voted \nfor it in the past switched last year and voted against it. That was \nthe key in its defeat.\n  That is why I, along with others, are now publicly calling on the \nPresident, appealing to the President, to step forward and help us with \nthis vote this week.\n  I hope that we will have another vote on the constitutional amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget this week, probably on Wednesday. If we \ncould pick up just another couple of votes, the job would be done. The \nPresident can help us by making those contacts.\n  I give the President his due. Whatever his problems with the American \npublic may be, it is clear he wields tremendous clout with \ncongressional Democrats, especially here in the Senate. Time and again \nhis allies in this Chamber have come to his rescue, blocking bills that \nthe White House did not want to have to deal with. Actually, it has \nbeen a remarkably synchronized operation--a real tribute.\n\n  But, if you look at what is happening right now in the Senate, bill \nafter bill after bill is being hung up by filibusters or failure to \nagree to procedures to allow those bills to be voted on. The White \nHouse Travel Office legislation is still, in effect, pending before the \nSenate. A taxpayers bill of rights No. 2 is pending and awaiting \naction. Repeal of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gas tax is waiting for action. \nMany bills that the American people support overwhelmingly and deserve \nto have passed are in limbo here, and that has been the case with the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The letter we sent to the President last week asked him to address \nthis issue in his Saturday radio address, to rally support for the \namendment. In candor, we felt obliged to warn that, ``[f]ailure to do \neverything in your power to win this vote would send a clear signal to \nthe American people * * * '' that he really did not want this balanced \nbudget amendment to pass, even though he has said nice things about it \nin the past. Thus far, we have not heard from the President. He did not \nendorse the amendment in his Saturday radio speech and he has not \nlifted a finger, the best I can tell, to help us pass the amendment \nthrough the Senate so the American people can decide.\n  Remember this, even if we passed it here in the Senate after it has \nalready passed in the House, it still would have to go to the American \npeople so the various State legislatures could vote on ratification in \nthat amendment process. Should we not at least let the American people, \nthrough their State legislatures, have a chance to express themselves, \nto vote on this issue? So that is all we have been asking, is to allow \nus an opportunity to take up this amendment, debate it, vote on it, and \nhopefully pass it on to the States for them to pass judgment.\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment tend to ignore that part \nof the constitutional process. Instead, throughout the Senate's year-\nlong debate on the amendment, they have come up with a number of red \nherrings. We have been told the amendment would imperil Social \nSecurity, it would devastate crucial domestic programs, that it would \nrequire tax hikes, and that it might hobble the Government in times of \nnational or international emergency.\n  Do opponents of the amendment seriously believe that three-quarters \nof the State legislatures would ratify a constitutional amendment that \nwas going to harm Social Security? Would the Senate? Would the U.S. \nSenate vote for that? I don't think so. I know I would not.\n  Do opponents of the amendment really think that 37 State legislatures \nwould adopt an amendment that in any way cripples Government in times \nof crisis? Of course not. I think the opponents of the balanced budget \namendment realize those arguments are, at best, irrelevant and, at \nworst, false. I guess we should be relieved they have not blamed the \namendment for Britain's ``mad cow'' disease or global warming, but \nthere is still time before the vote and we may hear that.\n  Since these are all false arguments blocking this amendment, I urge \nthat we take them up, debate them seriously here in the next 2 days, \nand have a vote on this constitutional amendment.\n  Since those are all false reasons for blocking the amendment, why are \nits opponents so determined to kill it here in the Senate, before the \nStates can even have a say in the process? I think the answer is \nobvious. The amendment is indeed a danger, a peril, and a threat.\n  It endangers the entrenched interests that have called the shots in \nofficial Washington for most of the last half-century. It imperils the \nnetwork of lobbies whose reason for existence is bigger and fatter \nGovernment budgets. It threatens to derail the Federal gravy train and \nmake its relaxed riders walk for a change.\n  They cannot survive under a balanced budget amendment, for it would \ntake away their subsidized pulpits and make them earn their keep in the \nopen marketplace of ideas. They cannot do that, and they know it. They \ndo not have the support of the American people, so they cling to the \nsupport of the American Government.\n  It is why the balanced budget amendment, almost overnight, changed \nfrom a bipartisan sure thing to an endangered species. And it is why, \nwhen we vote again on the amendment within the next few days, we will \nprobably be two or three votes short of passage. Unless, that is, \nunless President Clinton steps into the breach and convinces his Senate \nallies to vote the same way they campaigned: for the amendment and \nagainst business as usual in Washington.\n  The ball is in his court. If the amendment is defeated this time \naround, the whole country will know who bears the responsibility for \nits demise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my letter to \nPresident Clinton be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 1996.\n       Dear Mr. President: You have been telling the American \n     people that you believe we need a balanced budget.\n       With a decisive vote on a constitutional balanced budget \n     amendment scheduled for the Senate floor the week of June 3, \n     we now have a unique opportunity to exhibit leadership over \n     partisanship for the best interests of this nation and for \n     our children's future.\n       If you are sincere in wanting a balanced budget, then \n     please use the power of your office to persuade Democrat \n     senators that this is best for our children and our nation. \n     As you know, six Democrat senators campaigned on their \n     support for a balanced budget amendment, but then helped \n     defeat it last year.\n       Failure to do everything in your power to win this vote \n     would send a clear signal to the American people that you \n     place politics above country. Join us in passing this \n     necessary and historic amendment. We propose that you use \n     your Saturday radio address this week to rally support for \n     the balanced budget amendment, and Republicans will use our \n     response time to echo your message.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator Trent Lott\n     Senator Pete Domenici\n     Representative Dick Armey\n     Representative John Kasich\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to convey to \nhim something that was not in that letter.\n  I want to assure him that, even if he succeeds in blocking the \nbalanced budget amendment, he is not going to block Congress' efforts \nto curb his tax-and-spend approach to Government.\n  That is the meaning of the budget resolution the House and Senate \nhave already passed. And it will be the clear and frugal bottom line of \nthe appropriation bills we will send down to the White House over the \nnext 4 months.\n  One way or another, the taxpayers are going to win this fight. \nPresident Clinton and his Senate allies can delay that outcome, but \nthey cannot prevent it forever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi. I \nthink he has hit on key features relating to the passage of the \nbalanced budget amendment, the first being that this really is in the \nhands of the President of the United States. He was the reason that six \nmembers of his party changed their minds, and his rhetoric can now be \nthe reason to support a balanced budget by speaking out and calling on \nhis side to support it.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Dole is fulfilling his promise to the \nAmerican people and recalling it, even though the odds against getting \nover that hill are great.\n  Now, Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the principal sponsor \nof the balanced budget amendment, its long-time and ardent supporter, \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Senate to send \nthe Dole-Hatch-Simon balanced budget amendment to the States for \nratification. We will have the opportunity to vote for it again soon. I \nam hoping that the Senate will respond to the needs of the American \npeople.\n  President Clinton has fought the balanced budget amendment every step \nof the way, and I would just like to ask, ``Why?'' The President says \nhe is for a balanced budget. Yet, I suggest that the opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment are simply not ready to impose the kind of \nfiscal discipline on themselves that a constitutional amendment would \nrequire. It is tough to stop spending other peoples' money.\n  Last year he succeeded in blocking the balanced budget amendment. \nPresident Clinton won but the American people lost. The American people \nwill lose again if President Clinton has his way this year, if we \ncannot talk him into helping here. Unless he changes his mind and makes \nclear his support for the balanced budget amendment we will probably \nfail one more time.\n  It is important for our country and our children. The subject matter \ngoes to the heart of our Founding Fathers' hope for our constitutional \nsystem--a system that would protect individual freedom through limited \ngovernment. In the latter half of this century, however, the intention \nof the Framers of the Constitution has been betrayed by Congress' \ninability to control its own spending habits. The size of the Federal \nleviathan has grown to such an extent that the very liberties of the \nAmerican people are threatened.\n  The other body has already given its approval to the amendment, so it \nis up to the Senate to follow and meet the needs of the American \npeople, 85 percent of whom favor a balanced budget amendment. We need \nto relegate the spendthrift and tax-happy policies of the past to the \ndustbin of history. This amendment has broad support in the country and \namong Democrats and Republicans who believe that we need to get the \nNation's fiscal house in order so that we can leave a legacy of a \nstrong national economy and a responsible National Government to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is faced with a worsening problem of rising \nnational debt and deficits and the increased Government use of capital \nthat would otherwise be available to the private sector to create jobs \nto invest in our future. This problem presents risks to our long-term \neconomic growth and endangers the well-being of our elderly,\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nour working people, and especially our children and grandchildren. The \ndebt burden is a mortgage on their future.\n  The total national debt now stands at more than $5.1 trillion. That \nmeans that every man, woman, and child in Utah and all of our States \nhas an individual debt burden of $19,600. While it took us more than \n200 years to acquire our first trillion dollars of debt, we have \nrecently been adding another trillion dollars to our debt about every 5 \nyears, and that is shortening as we keep going.\n  Yet, Mr. President, opponents of the balanced budget amendment claim \nthat there is no problem. They point to the marginal slowdown in the \ngrowth of the debt in the last year or so as if it suggested that all \nour problems are solved. Only inside the Washington, DC, beltway can \npeople claim that we are on the right track while we add to a debt of \nmore than $5.1 trillion. The President's own 1997 budget predicts that \nin the year 2000, total Federal debt will be more than $6 \ntrillion. That means a Federal debt of about $23,700 per person. Every \none of us will owe that much when we get to that point. That is, if the \nPresident has his way. This would be nearly a tenfold increase in the \nper capita debt since 1975.\n\n  When we last debated the balanced budget amendment, I gave a daily \nupdate of the debt increase as we debated. By the end of the debate, my \n``debt tracker'' was becoming unwieldy, so I have brought down a sort \nof summary debt tracker to bring us up to date since we began debate on \nthis amendment in January of last year.\n  As my chart shows, when we began debate on the balanced budget \namendment, the debt was $4.8 trillion. As of this week, it stands at \nmore than $5.1 trillion. That is an increase of $320 billion in a \nlittle over a year. It is absolutely incredible. Translated into more \nunderstandable terms, that means that the cost of the delay in passing \nthis important amendment has been more than $1,200 for every man, woman \nand child in America.\n  Put another way, over the 15 months that have elapsed since President \nClinton helped defeat the balanced budget amendment, the debt has \nincreased on average over $650 million of debt, over $27 million an \nhour, over $450,000 a minute and over $7,500 every second. This is the \nprice of the delay caused by President Clinton and his allies.\n  That increasing debt is not just numbers on a chart. Over time, the \ndisproportionate burdens imposed on today's children and their children \nby a continuing pattern of deficits could include some combination of \nthe following: increased taxes; reduced public welfare benefits; \nreduced public pensions; reduced expenditures on infrastructure and \nother public investments; diminished capital formation; diminished job \ncreation; diminished productivity enhancement; diminished real wage \ngrowth in the private economy; higher interest rates; higher inflation; \nincreased indebtedness to and economic dependence on foreign creditors; \nand an increased risk of default on the Federal debt.\n  This is fiscal child abuse, and it simply must end.\n  Mr. President, if one thing became clear during our recent experience \nin trying to enact the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, it is that we need \na constitutional mandate. Some Senators argued during our debate last \nyear on Senate Joint Resolution 1 that we did not need a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. ``We know what needs to be done,'' \nthey said. ``We should just do it.''\n  The trouble is that Congress did it and the President did not. But \nunder a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, the words \n``just do it'' would have authority for both elected branches of the \nGovernment, both the executive and the legislative branches.\n  In the year that has gone by since President Clinton helped defeat \nthe balanced budget amendment, the country has witnessed one of the \nmost contentious budget battles in the history of our Nation. President \nClinton was willing to let the Government shut down twice before he \nfinally agreed to work seriously toward balancing the budget.\n  But what guarantee is there that the Federal Government will ever \nachieve a balanced budget? When the other side of the aisle controlled \nthe Congress, we never had serious consideration of a balanced budget \nplan. President Clinton never proposed a balanced budget until he was \nforced to. The budget he first submitted when we debated this amendment \nlast year had $200 billion deficits as far as the eye could see. Even \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognized this as an \nentirely inadequate approach and rejected it. In fact, the President \nsubmitted no fewer than 10 budgets in 1 year and a series of attempts \nto avoid the tough, but responsible, decision to balance the budget.\n\n  Nothing shows more clearly how difficult it is to move in the right \ndirection than the last 9 months. Mr. President, we need the balanced \nbudget amendment to lock in the balanced budget rule now, or the future \nof our children will be bleaker and bleaker.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment will help us end Congress' \ndangerous deficit habit in the way that past efforts have not. It will \ndo this by correcting a bias that exists in the system, in our present \nprocess, which favors ever-increasing levels of Federal Government \nspending. The balanced budget amendment reduces the spending bias in \nour present system by ensuring that, under normal circumstances, votes \nby Congress for increased spending will be accompanied by votes either \nto reduce other spending programs or to increase taxes to pay for such \nprograms.\n  For the first time since the abandonment of our historical norm of \nbalanced budgets, Congress would be required to cast politically \ndifficult votes--one politically difficult vote a year at least as a \nprecondition to casting a politically attractive vote to increasing \nspending.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should approve the balanced budget \namendment. It is the right thing to do for ourselves and our children \nand grandchildren, and it will give us back responsible and accountable \nconstitutional Government. If we continue to play around like we have \nover the last number of years during this administration, with all the \nmouthing in the world about balancing the budget and all the action in \nthe world not doing so, we are bartering away our future.\n  Look at this growth of a little over a year--$320 billion more in \ndeficits. Yet, they sit down there at the White House and act like \neverything is going just perfectly, like they are making real headway \non the budgetary deficit. When this gets up much over $5.13 trillion \ninto $6 trillion, the interest against the national debt is going to \neat us alive. Then the pressure will be to monetize the debt--that is, \nprint dollars like they did in Germany, where it took a wheelbarrow to \nbuy a loaf of bread, so we can pay off our debt with cheap dollars and \nbasically defraud all the people who rely on the valid well-being of \nthe United States.\n  We have to face this. This is the time to do it. I hope our \ncolleagues on the other side will get real on this. Everybody in \nWashington knows, and I think most people out in the country know, that \nthis argument over Social Security is a false, fallacious and \nridiculous argument. We have to do what is right now.\n  I thank my dear colleague from Georgia for leading this matter right \nnow and having people here to speak to this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, not only \nfor his remarks this afternoon, but for the extended effort over the \nyears to produce a sound fiscal policy in the United States in the \nmanagement of our financial affairs.\n  I now recognize the junior Senator from Utah for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for up to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. This problem, like the poor, \nseems to always be with us. I can remember debates about balancing the \nbudget and dealing with the budget deficit that go back 30 and 40 \nyears. In the 1992 election, when President Clinton ran, this was a \nmajor issue, primarily because of Ross Perot. Ross Perot raised it, \nRoss Perot made an issue out of it and Ross Perot, I think, got his \nfinest reaction on the television, when\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\nhe was being attacked for his lack of experience, when he responded by \nsaying, ``You're right; I don't have experience. I have never run up a \n$4 trillion deficit in any of the businesses I have run. I don't know \nhow to do that.''\n  I am not a supporter of Ross Perot. I voted for George Bush and \ncampaigned for George Bush and think the country would be better off if \nGeorge Bush had won. But I do give Mr. Perot his due for having focused \nour attention on this issue.\n  I ran in 1992 as well, so was heavily involved in it. At the time, \nthe deficit was around $300 billion a year. I remember saying to those \npeople who came to my town meetings and heard me as I was campaigning, \n``Let me make a prediction. I predict that no matter who wins the \nelection, the deficit will go down, and it will go down fairly \nsignificantly, and every politician in Washington will take credit for \nhaving made it go down, and none of them will have had anything to do \nwith it at all.''\n  I think I predicted correctly. The deficit has gone down. It is \nroughly half what it used to be.\n  Let me remind everybody, lest they fall into the trap of \nmisunderstanding what I am saying, the deficit is not the debt. To say \nthe deficit is half what it was in 1992 is like saying to your teenaged \nchild, ``You're overspending by $200 a month your allowance, but that's \nall right because you used to overspend by $400 a month, so your \ndeficit has been cut in half.'' No. The debt keeps going up with every \ndollar of the deficit. But the deficit has indeed been cut in half.\n\n  Why was I able to predict that the deficit would be cut in half in \n1992 with such accuracy? Two things. As I say, the politicians had \nnothing to do with either one of them.\n  No. 1, the cold war is over. President Clinton talks about the number \nof Government employees who have been severed from Government service \nsince he has been President. He says, ``We've eliminated some 270,000 \ncivilian jobs.'' He is right. Over 200,000 of those are in the Defense \nDepartment.\n  This is the so-called peace dividend that we heard about for so long. \nWe are now at peace. The cold war is over. We are not spending nearly \nas much on the Defense Department as we used to. We have eliminated \nsome 200,000 jobs of civilians in the Defense Department. As a result \nof that, the deficit has come down. Did any politician here have \nanything to do with it? No. In my opinion, the politician who should be \nmost credited with ending the cold war is named Ronald Reagan. And he \nleft town some time ago.\n  The second reason the deficit has come down is because the savings \nand loan bailout has been taken care of. I am a businessman. Anybody \nwho has been in business knows what an extraordinary expenditure is. An \nextraordinary expenditure is something you have to pay that is not part \nof your everyday activity.\n  We had to pay hundreds of billions of dollars to the depositors at \nsavings and loan institutions whose money was insured by the Federal \nGovernment. These S's went under, and while we can prosecute the \nowners and the managers of the S's if they have committed fraud, we \nhave an obligation to pay off the depositors. So the cost of paying \nthose depositors was going through the budget process like a pig in a \npython--a big bulge. Once it was digested, the python went back to its \nnormal size.\n  We paid off the last of the savings and loans obligations a year or \nso ago. Somewhat to our surprise, we found out the properties we were \nleft with, those S assets we seized in order to pay off the \nobligations, are worth more than was anticipated. So we got more in \nselling those properties than we expected, and we did not have to pay \nas much as we had expected in the obligations.\n  Put those two facts together and what do you get? You get a reduction \nin the deficit short term, one time. That is what I want to emphasize. \nThis reduction in the deficit that was so predictable is a short-term, \none-time phenomenon.\n  Look at the future and you see what June O'Neill, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, told us in the Appropriations Committee \nlast week; by the time some of the young folks who are here in the \ngalleries observing the Senate operate are into their careers, that is, \nin the year 2020, 2030, not that far away, if we do not do something \nabout the structural deficit--not this extraordinary expenditure kind \nof deficit that we had--if we do not do something about the structural \ndeficit, June O'Neill says, at that point the national debt will be 180 \npercent of gross domestic product.\n  In other words, we will owe 180 percent of everything we produce in a \nsingle year. That is the same as saying, ``OK, if you have a $100,000-\na-year salary, you have $180,000 in debt.''\n\n  The highest point in our history in terms of our debt was at the \nheight of the Second World War when our debt stood at 130 percent of \nour gross domestic product. That was when we were at war fighting for \nour survival. We were willing to risk the debt under those \ncircumstances.\n  The regular structural debt--that has nothing to do with war, nothing \nto do with emergencies, nothing to do with drought--in the working \ncareers of the young people who come on their spring breaks and \nvacations to see us in the gallery, in their working careers you will \nsee the debt higher than it was at the height of the Second World War \nif we do not do something about it.\n  We do not seem to be able to do anything about it. We passed balanced \nbudgets. The President has vetoed them. We have come up with ways of \ncontrolling the spending. The President has vetoed them. Again and \nagain we have had a legislative fix, and the answer has been, ``We'll \ndeal with that tomorrow.'' I have said on this floor before, I think \nthe theme song of this administration should be from the musical \n``Annie'' because Annie was always singing about ``tomorrow, \ntomorrow,'' we will balance the budget tomorrow. It is always a day \naway.\n  When we say, let us start today, it is always, well, if you start \ntoday, it will start to hurt a little bit, so we will promise to hurt \nyou tomorrow, but we will continue to spend today.\n  Apparently, the only way to get anybody's attention finally in this \ncircumstance is to put it into our basic law. I have resisted this all \nmy political career. I felt the Constitution should not be tampered \nwith. I am a very reluctant and late-coming convert to the idea of a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I am there because I \nhave come to the conclusion that there is, in fact, no other way.\n\n  So I join with my colleagues rising on the floor today to say, not \ntomorrow, today, and not through hopes and pledges and expressions of \ngood intentions, but through writing it into our basic law and putting \ninto our basic structure on which all other laws are built the \nrequirement that we get our financial affairs in order, so that the \nyoung people who come to see us can send their children to come to see \nour children and have the debates over substantive ways to spend the \ntaxpayers' money, instead of being in a circumstance where we have no \nchoices because everything has to go to service the enormous national \ndebt that we are looking at if we do not get this circumstance under \ncontrol.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in \nendorsing a balanced budget amendment and hope that we are successful \nthis week in seeing it pass. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for a \nvery forceful presentation.\n  I want to reiterate a point, before I yield to the Senator from \nIdaho, that was made by the Senator from Mississippi when he opened \nthis discussion. He pointed out that this vote is to allow the States \nto take up the issue of whether or not the Constitution should be \namended. The other side does not even want the States to carry on and \nconduct the debate of this great national issue. They do not want to \nlet it go to the States.\n  I find that uniquely Washingtonian. ``No. We have to keep it all \nhere. We don't dare let the States debate this great issue and make \ntheir voices heard.'' It takes three-fourths of them to ratify this \nbefore it would become an amendment to the Constitution.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Idaho who, I might add, has also been a\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\ndriving force behind the effort to secure a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Georgia and \nthe Senator from Utah who has just spoken on this fundamental American \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I had the privilege of beginning my service to the \nState of Idaho in 1981 in the U.S. House of Representatives. By 1982, \nit had become obvious to me that the collective bias, if you will, \ninside the Congress and elsewhere in the Federal Government, at that \ntime and still today, was largely to spend money, to tax when you had \nto, but clearly to spend money on those programs that you felt most \nbeneficial to your constituency. And when taxation was not popular, the \nbias was to go ahead and borrow the money because--that was certainly \npopular in the 1970's and 1980's and into the early 1990's--if you \ncould bring home one Government program after another and deliver it to \nyour constituency, especially if you did not have to pay for it in the \nform of taxes, you were just an extremely popular politician and you \ntended to get reelected year after year after year. Thank goodness the \nattitude has changed a bit in Congress.\n\n  It was in 1982 that I and a Democrat Congressman from Texas, Charlie \nStenholm, first introduced, and joined forces in a bipartisan effort to \npass, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution on the floor of \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. At that time, I and others traveled \nnationwide from State to State asking the State legislatures to \npetition the Congress for the very right that the Senator from Georgia \nhas just spoken to--the right to speak to the Constitution, the right \nto amend the very basic document of our country.\n  From 1982 to 1995, this Congress has been struggling with the fact \nthat they really did want to deny the American people the right to \nspeak their will on their Constitution, to reshape their Constitution, \nin a very important way, in what it would do to direct, to simply \nlimit, the Congress of the United States and its activities.\n  In 1982, if you looked at the polls, the public was somewhat \nconcerned about a balanced budget amendment. It was not until the late \n1980's when the deficits were soaring to nearly $300 billion a year \nthat this issue finally became an urgent issue with the American \npeople. Even in a poll today, after 2 long years of struggling with \nliberal Democrats and fighting to try to balance a budget, the American \npeople, now 83 percent strong, say, ``Give us a constitutional \namendment for us to speak on, to debate and ratify, that would force \nthe Congress of the United States to balance its budget.''\n  From 1982 to 1996, this issue has become, without question, the most \nimportant, single, driving issue in the minds of the average person out \nthere. That average American believes in a balanced budget, and \nrecognizes the tremendous difficulties that the Congress itself has had \nin attempting to balance the budget, and therefore believes it will \ntake the weight of the Constitution to balance the budget.\n  What does it mean in real terms? Mr. President, we talk about a \nconstitutional amendment requiring the Congress to function in certain \nways. All well and good. Everybody wants a balanced budget and wants \nour Government to keep their fiscal house in order. Even this \nPresident, who only pays simple lip service to a balanced budget and \ndoes not really mean it--we saw between 1992 to 1994 when he was big \nspender No. 1 and big taxer No. 1. Now, of course, because of 1994 and \nthe elections, he has changed his tune a lot. In fact, it is awfully \nhard to tell who he is these days, but we do know he at least says he \nis now for a balanced budget. Not for a constitutional amendment. Oh, \nno, do not force the Government to be fiscally responsible. Just trust \nBill. Just trust the President that he will be a responsible public \nservant, along with the Congress, that for now, 36 years, has been \nunable to balance its budget. As critical as I am of this President, \nhis own people said in his budget for 1995 that, because of the way \nGovernment spends, that future generations are going to look at paying \n82 percent of their income into taxation on an annual basis for all \nlevels of Government service and to pay interest on the debt. I cannot \nimagine any one young person, let alone any adult, who would believe \nthat to be acceptable. Yet the best minds from this Government \nsupposedly say that is a fact, unless we change things.\n  The National Taxpayers Union estimates a child born today, in his or \nher lifetime, is going to pay an extra $180,000 in taxes just to pay \ninterest on the current accruing Federal debt. Those are the people \nreasons that we ought to do something. Clearly, the ability to keep our \nfiscal house in order, Mr. President, is of paramount importance to any \none American's future and to the future and strength of this country.\n  The balanced budget bill that the President vetoed this last year \nwould have begun the very important process to lead us to the balanced \nbudget we speak of by the year 2002. What does it mean to the American \nfamily if we would have been able to accomplish what the President \nvetoed on one side and then said he was for on the other? About $2,400 \na year in mortgage payments for a $75,000, 30-year mortgage. That is \nsignificant money. How about $1,000 on the lifetime of a 4-year car \nloan? That is big money to an American family. How about $1,900 on the \nlife of a 10-year student loan? All we have heard from this \nadministration when we tried to adjust the student loan program is that \nwe were cutting the loan program, when we did not cut loans or \neligibility a dime. Yet, they will not balance their budget to give the \nstudent who has to pay the interest on the debt that he or she has \naccrued the benefit of a $1,900 savings on a 10-year student loan. That \nis big money to real families, spread across millions and millions of \nstudents who need student loans to put themselves through their \nundergraduate years.\n\n  How about 6 million new jobs by the year 2002--just from balancing \nthe budget. And there are other kinds of growth or multipliers in the \neconomy that will occur if we are able to do this. Those are the good \nreasons. That is why we ought to be balancing the budget.\n  Now, can we get there without a constitutional amendment? Well, I \nthink everyone watching today, and certainly the American people over \nthe last 2 years, have watched us play the game. Some of us were deadly \nserious about a balanced budget. I am afraid the other side of the \naisle was not at all that interested. We have heard one plan, two \nplans, four plans, six plans. Oh, there are all kinds of plans to \nbalance the budget. But when that side of the aisle disagrees with this \nside of the aisle, and ultimately, in the end, with the President's \nveto standing there over us, balanced budgets simply do not occur \nbecause the Constitution does not require them. We have only our \nability to work together to solve this, and that is not enough.\n  I have always been convinced from the very day that I fought for a \nbalanced budget amendment on the floor of the U.S. House in 1982 that \nwe needed the extraordinary power of the Constitution to force the \nCongress of the United States and those who serve it to be fiscally \nresponsible. We had learned--not this particular Senator, but a good \nmany before him--that there were all kinds of ways to game the system, \nand in the end you could ultimately tell the American people you were \ndoing one thing when, in fact, you were doing something different.\n  It does not work that way when the Constitution requires you to \nrespond in a certain manner. Oh, there are those who would say you can \njust ignore the Constitution. Mr. President, that is one thing that is \nnot ignored around here. In the privileged time I have had to serve the \nState of Idaho in Congress, I have seen the Constitution is not \nintentionally ignored. There are times when what we do gets judged by \nthe courts to be constitutionally lacking. When that occurs with a law \nwe pass, we make the necessary decisions and adjustments to change it \nand bring it back into shape.\n  Since 1969 we have had 27 unbalanced budgets in a row. From 1960 on, \n35 of 36 budgets have been unbalanced. A majority of the American \npeople have seen the Federal Government balance its books only once or \nnever. Yet, when our Founding Fathers created this great country, they \ndid not require this as a constitutional requirement because they \nsimply felt there would\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\nnever be a day when the budgets would not be balanced. If they did \nbecome unbalanced, certainly, the fiscally responsible Congress would \nmove quickly to bring them back into balance.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying we will have an opportunity \nonce again to vote on a constitutional amendment to require Congress \nand the President to balance the Federal budget. I know of no single, \nstronger way to allow the American people to debate the issue of a \nbalanced budget in every State capital of this Nation, than to allow \nthe legislatures of all of the States to move in the constitutionally \nprescribed way, and that is to ratify or deny a constitutional \namendment--the 28th--to our Constitution, which would require the \nGovernment of this country to balance its budget on an annual basis.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona would like to speak on this subject \nmatter. If he is willing, I would be pleased to replace him as \nPresiding Officer and yield up to 10 minutes from the Senator from \nArizona.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the chair).\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator conducting this \nspecial order, and I appreciate his yielding time for me to speak on \nthe matter of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I think the case for the balanced budget amendment is now stronger \nthan ever. Many of the critics of the balanced budget amendment in the \npast have argued that it was unnecessary, that if Congress only had the \ncourage and the will, it could balance the budget and do so without the \nexplicit mandate to do so in the Constitution.\n  Well, Mr. President, the majority of Congress did finally muster the \ncourage and the will on November 17 of last year when it passed the \nBalanced Budget Act. For the first time in 26 years, a majority in the \nSenate and the House approved a comprehensive plan to begin to limit \nFederal spending and to balance the Federal budget.\n  But courage and will--and the votes of the majority in the Congress--\nwere not enough to overcome President Clinton's dogged determination to \nspend beyond the Nation's means. A President committed to big \nGovernment can always be counted on to use every tool at his disposal \nto thwart progress toward a balanced budget, to wear down the courage \nand the will of even the most steadfast of the deficit hawks.\n  On April 25, for example, a majority in Congress concluded that it \nwas easier to yield to President Clinton's demand for more spending \nthan to fight for maximum deficit reduction. The omnibus appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1996--a bill that I opposed--spent about $5 \nbillion more than was originally intended. The Senate added another $5 \nbillion to the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution 2 weeks ago to \nappease the President. Granted, the additional spending is offset by \nsavings achieved in other areas. But if Congress had applied those \noffsets to deficit reduction instead of accommodating the President's \ndemands for more spending, it would be that much easier to achieve the \ngoal of balancing the budget. As it stands, it will be billions of \ndollars harder to achieve the goal of a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  The balanced budget amendment would correctly put the onus on the \nPresident in future situations like this. Instead of requiring Congress \nto muster a supermajority vote to limit Government spending--for \nexample, to override President Clinton's veto of more frugal \nappropriations legislation--the balanced budget amendment would require \nthe President to orchestrate a supermajority to vote for his proposals \nto add to the deficit.\n  Mr. President, this illustrates the problem. It is far easier to \nspend money than it is to save it. While it will take a supermajority \nto save taxpayer money and balance the budget over President Clinton's \nveto, it takes only a simple majority to spend hard-earned tax dollars. \nIn fact, because so much of the Federal budget is on autopilot, the \nGovernment can spend more every year without taking any vote at all.\n\n  President Clinton uses this fact to his advantage. He claims to \nsupport a balanced budget, but resists every effort to accomplish that \nobjective, knowing full well that inaction means that the Government \nwill continue to grow and that Federal spending will continue to \nescalate.\n  The fact is, despite claims to the contrary, President Clinton has \nnever proposed a budget that would actually achieve balance. Speaking \nabout the latest budget proposed by the administration, the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, June O'Neill, said in testimony on \nApril 17, ``Under CBO's more cautious economic and technical \nassumptions, the basic policies outlined in the President's budget \nwould bring down the deficit to about $80 billion by the year 2002 \ninstead of producing the budget surplus that the administration \nestimates.''\n  In other words, the President's most frugal budget would still result \nin an $80 billion budget deficit.\n  So for all of the President's proclamations that he is now a true \nbeliever in a balanced budget, the fact is that he has yet to offer an \nhonest plan to achieve balance by any date certain.\n  By contrast, the budget that the Congress passed last year and the \nbudget we just passed 2 weeks ago, do achieve balance and they do so \nwhile protecting the programs that are most important to the American \npeople. We promised not to cut Medicare. We do not. Medicare spending \nwould be allowed to grow at twice the rate of inflation. In fact, per \nbeneficiary spending would grow from $5,200 in 1996 to $7,000 in 2002--\na 35-percent increase. We allow it to grow, but at a sustainable level.\n  We provide a $500-per-child tax credit for every child under 18 years \nof age. We protect Social Security. We reform Medicaid and continue \nprogress toward more market-oriented farm policies.\n  Mr. President, there are good reasons to balance the budget. The \nCongressional Budget Office predicts that a balanced budget would \nfacilitate a reduction in long-term real interest rates of between 1 \nand 2 percent. That means that more Americans will have the chance to \nlive the American dream--to own their own homes. A 2-percent reduction \non a typical 30-year mortgage in my State of Arizona would save \nhomeowners over $230 a month. That is $2,655 each year. That same 2-\npercent reduction in interest rates on a typical $15,000 car loan would \nsave buyers $676. The savings would also accrue on student loans, \ncredit cards, and loans to businesses that want to expand and create \nnew jobs. Reducing interest rates is probably one of the most important \nthings we can do to help people across this country, and reductions in \ninterest rates are the first result of a balanced budget.\n  With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to vote for the balanced \nbudget amendment when it comes before the Senate later this week. It \nhas been a long time in coming, and it is urgently needed.\n  Before closing, I want to make one final point. Ideally, the balanced \nbudget amendment should include a tax or spending limitation, or both, \nbecause it matters how we balance the budget.\n  I have long advocated a spending limit as the best approach. The \nbalanced budget spending limitation amendment, Senate Joint Resolution \n3, which I introduced in January 1995, includes such a limitation. It \nwould require a balanced budget and limit spending to 19 percent of the \ngross national product, which is roughly the level of revenue that the \nFederal Government has collected over the last 40 years.\n\n  Limit spending and there is no need to consider tax increases. \nCongress would not be allowed to spend the additional revenue raised. \nLink Federal spending to economic growth, as measured by GNP, and an \nincentive is created for Congress to promote pro-growth economic \npolicies. The more the economy grows, the more the Congress is allowed \nto spend, but always proportionate to the size of the economy.\n  A tax limit is the next best approach, and that is why we have \nadvocated a supermajority to raise taxes.\n  The tax limitation amendment that I introduced earlier this year--an \ninitiative the House just voted on on April 15--would require a two-\nthirds vote of each House of Congress to approve tax increases. It \nwould make an important addition to the Constitution, whether or not \nthe balanced budget amendment\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\nis approved, but it is particularly important if the balanced budget \namendment does become part of our Constitution. I do not believe that \nthe balanced budget amendment should become an excuse to raise taxes. \nThat is why I believe it should be accompanied by either a spending \nlimitation or a tax limitation.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is no panacea. A \nconstitutional spending or tax limitation must follow to ensure that \nthe budget is balanced in the right way--by eliminating spending. But \nit is essential that we take this first important step and pass the \nbalanced budget amendment when it comes before us this week.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and hope that we can \nadopt it and change the Constitution, that the States will ratify it, \nand that we will in fact require a balanced budget amendment requiring \nthe Congress to maintain a balanced budget for our Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I compliment you on your remarks. I did \nnot have a chance to do so to the Senator from Idaho and all the others \nthat have risen in support of the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. If I could take just a minute to try to step back from \nthis day-to-day routine and debate that we find ourselves in in the \nU.S. Senate in Washington, DC, not long ago--getting on to running on \nthe second year--President Clinton's Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlements issued its report. Mr. President, in that report it showed \nus--holding it right here in front of me--that in the year 2006, five \nFederal programs will consume 100 percent virtually of the U.S. \nTreasury. Though there is a little bit left--enough to run about one-\nthird of the current Defense Department--that is it. That is within all \nof our watch. That is just within a decade. The five programs are \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and the \ninterest only on our debt--the interest only.\n  So we have in these Halls of Congress over the last 30 to 40 years \nput in place a potential catastrophe. We have talked about this for \nmany, many years. Mr. President, the responsibility for addressing \nthese problems can no longer be passed to someone in the future. We can \nno longer pass the baton. We are at the moment as we approach the new \ncentury of exercising prudent disciplines to bring into check the \nfinancial affairs of these United States of America of which the \nbalanced budget amendment is a critical component. We have been joined \nby the Senator from Illinois who has been a dogged advocate of a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I am going to yield to \nhim in just a moment.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, that when a generation of Americans \nconsciously engages in consuming the resources of a future generation \nit is engaged in abrogating their freedom. This country was birthed in \nthe pursuit of freedom, and thousands of its citizens lie under markers \nacross the world in unending and exhaustive efforts to protect our \nfreedom. What no country was ever able to do from the outside we are \nclose to doing to ourselves. We have been engaged in a domestic abuse \nthat could have the very effect that we fought for so long to protect.\n  We just heard a Senator on this floor say unchecked a child born \nyesterday will forfeit 84 percent of their living wages to pay for \nthis. That cannot happen. American citizens already work from January 1 \nto May 7 before they get to keep their first paycheck. If we do not \nbring this into check they would only get to keep their paycheck in the \nmonth of December.\n  This is just not a business about numbers, Mr. President. We are \ndiscussing freedom of the Americans who follow us. No generation of \nAmericans I can imagine would ever consciously be engaged in robbing \nthe future of the very freedom we fought to enjoy ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield up to 10 minutes to my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, and my colleague from Georgia, I thank you.\n  I am pleased to rise in support of this. Let me comment first of all \non the politics of this because there are those on my side who say this \nis political. And I do not think there is any question that its timing \nright now is in part political. That does not get to the merits of it, \nhowever.\n\n  I would have to say--and I say this as someone who is supporting Bill \nClinton for reelection--that Bob Dole has been consistent on this. This \nis not a phony position that he is taking in order to gain a few votes \nin an election.\n  Second, in terms of the politics, let me just add that if we should \npass it we give Bob Dole a small victory in terms of politics because \nwhatever has happened in the past people do not worry about that in an \nelection. They talk about what is going to happen in the future. If we \ndefeat it--and it is Democrat votes that defeat it--then you hand Bob \nDole a much bigger issue. That is the political reality.\n  A second political reality is the public image--I say to my friends \non the Republican side--of Republicans is they simply are too hard-\nhearted, are not considerate of those who struggle in our society, and \ntoo often candidly propose amendments and pass bills that confirm that \nimpression. On our side, the public image is they are good-hearted \npeople. But they are fiscally reckless. And too often we seem to go out \nof our way to confirm that. And if it is Democratic votes that defeat \nthis tomorrow, or whenever we vote on this, we will have played into \nwhat is the worst of our perceptions.\n  But aside from the politics--and the politics really should be \nextremely secondary--we are talking about something that is absolutely \nessential for the future of our country. This is not a new idea. Thomas \nJefferson was the first person to suggest that we needed this kind of a \nconstitutional amendment. He was not in the United States in 1787 when \nthe Constitution was written. He was negotiating for us in Paris. When \nhe got back, he said, ``If I could just add one amendment to the \nConstitution it would be to prohibit the Federal Government from \nborrowing money.'' He wanted an absolute prohibition which this \namendment does not do. It leaves room for emergencies to have deficits. \nBut he said one generation should no more be willing to pay for the \nprevious generation's debts than for the debts of another country. That \nwas a very interesting observation from him.\n\n  I was reading the other day and came across where John Kennedy in \n1963 complained about the huge amount of money that was being paid for \ninterest for which we got nothing. Do you know what the gross interest \nexpenditure was in 1963? Mr. President, $9 billion. That is a terrible \nwaste of money. But do you know what the latest Congressional Budget \nOffice figure is for this fiscal year? Gross interest expenditure--$344 \nbillion. What if we had such a constitutional amendment in place in \n1963, or what if we had it in place in 1980 when the total debt was \nless than $1 trillion? And if we do not pass it tomorrow, 5 years from \nnow or 10 years from now the situation will be much worse. And people \nwill say, ``Why didn't they act?'' Why, indeed? Mr. President, $344 \nbillion--we will spend 11 times more on interest than on education, 22 \ntimes more on interest than foreign aid, and twice as much on interest \nas all of our poverty programs. What do we get for it? Nothing other \nthan higher interest rates.\n  And I mentioned foreign aid. It is interesting. We now pay in \ninterest to other countries somewhere in excess of $45 billion a year--\nwhen I say other countries, I am including people who own the bonds; \nmaybe individuals in other countries. In other words, we are spending \nroughly three times as much on interest for those who are more \nfortunate than we are spending on foreign aid for those who are less \nfortunate. And it is getting worse. One of the publications I receive--\nand I am sure it has a very small circulation--is called Grant's \nInterest Rate Observers, published in New York City.\n\n  The last edition has this very interesting statistic: May 17, 1995, \nforeign\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\ncentral bank holdings of Treasuries, $444 billion; May 15, 1996, 1 year \nlater--it was $444 billion--it is $553 billion. And it is not going to \ngo on indefinitely.\n  The distinguished economist Lester Thurow said that at some point \nother countries and people in other countries are going to say, ``We \nare not going to buy those bonds anymore.'' The question is not if they \nare going to say that; the question is when they are going to say that. \nWe are headed for serious, serious trouble.\n  If you read an Adam Smith quotation--I should have brought it over \nhere--in his ``Wealth of Nations,'' 1776, he said this is the history \nof nations: They pile up more and more debt, and then they find out the \nonly politically satisfactory answer to solving the debt problem is to \ndebase the currency.\n  That is where we are headed. Let no one make any mistake about it. \nUnless we have the discipline of a constitutional amendment, we will \neventually do what the economists call monetize the debt. We are just \ngoing to start the printing presses rolling, because as you look at \nSocial Security and other projections of entitlements in the long run, \neventually some Congress--we may not be around at that point; I \ncertainly will not be around--is going to face one of three very \ndrastic choices. First, to dramatically increase taxes. And you know \nhow popular that would be. Or to dramatically cut back on Social \nSecurity and other expenditures, and you know how popular that would \nbe. And the third option, print more money, and that is where we are \nheaded.\n  Now, the opponents will say we can do it without it. Both sides have \nagreed we are going to have a 7-year balanced budget. My friends, the \nPresiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, will grow \ngreen hair before the budget is balanced in 7 years under this \nproposal. It just is not going to happen. Both parties put the really \ntough choices out to the end of 7 years. That is the politically easy \nthing to do. If it was politically easy, we would have balanced the \nbudget a longtime ago. What we like to do is tell people we are for \nbalancing the budget, but we are going to put off these really \ndifficult decisions.\n  We need the discipline of a constitutional amendment to force us to \ndo the right thing.\n  Now, some will argue, well, we ought to exclude Social Security. And \nwe have since 1969 had a unified budget that has included Social \nSecurity. I have always favored excluding Social Security. Some of us \nwho have been pushing this have tried to negotiate where we could over \na period of years move in that direction to protect Social Security \neven more. But real candidly, we have been unable to pick up any \nadditional votes by doing that. But let no one use the figleaf of \nSocial Security to cover opposition to this. Bob Myers, chief actuary \nfor Social Security for 21 years, said it is absolutely essential for \nthe future of Social Security that we have a balanced budget amendment, \nbecause if we do not have a balanced budget amendment, frankly, we are \ngoing to monetize the debt, and that means just printing the money and \nthe trust funds will just really move down.\n  I see I am being signaled on time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague.\n  Let me just add two or three more points. We are spending an \nincreasing percentage of our tax dollar on interest. I do not care \nwhether you are Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative. That \njust does not make sense. We ought to be spending our money on goods \nand services. And then let us differ on whether we have a national \nhealth program, which I strongly favor. Maybe my colleagues here differ \nwith me on that. But we ought to have pay-as-you-go Government, and if \nwe want to have a program, we have to pay for it. And if we do not have \nthe courage to vote the revenue, we cannot have the program--just that \nbasic. It is true for a family. It must be true for a nation.\n  This is also welfare in reverse. The biggest welfare program we have \nin the United States by far is interest, and it is welfare for the \nrich, and increasingly the rich beyond our borders. I know there are \nsome who argue this trickle-down economic theory: Give to the \nwealthiest and it will help everybody. I have never bought that theory. \nI believe if you give money so people can buy General Motors cars, if \nyou give to the people at the bottom, the president of General Motors \nis going to do all right, too. But it does not necessarily work in \nreverse. Even if you buy the trickle-down theory, who can argue that if \nyou give money to wealthy people in Japan and Saudi Arabia and Great \nBritain and The Netherlands, that is helping people here in the United \nStates of America?\n  We end up raising interest rates. We have seen Wharton and the other \nschools, the econometric studies that say if we pass this, when we \nachieve a balanced budget we will have interest rates--the largest \nprojection--the prime rate dropping 3.5 percent. You have had the \nConcord Coalition study that says the deficit in the last 20 years is \ncosting the average American family today $15,500 a year in income, and \nyet we continue dissipating our funds, violating the future of our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  It just does not make sense. We ought to do the right thing, and the \nright thing is to have a balanced budget requirement in the \nConstitution unless there is an emergency. Then you can get 60 percent \nof the vote.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for his leadership. And let me just \nadd my thanks to Senator Hatch and Senator Craig and Senator Thurmond \nand others. Senator DeConcini, when he was here, was very helpful on \nthis. Senator Heflin has been, and others. But this is one where I know \npolitics rears its head at this point in our Nation. This is one where \nwe have to say, what does the Nation need? And I think it is very clear \nwhat we need.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves \nthe Chamber, I wish to tell him that in his limited few minutes here I \nthought he made an absolutely eloquent presentation as to why our \nNation, this generation, and particularly those yet to come, are so \ndependent on the type of discipline as represented by the proposal the \nSenator from Illinois suggests. The Senator referred to Thomas \nJefferson and his desire to have had this in the original \nConstitution. The reason, if you read through his works, is over and \nover there was an abiding fear of government and its spending \nproliferation consuming the resources of the breadearner, himself or \nherself. You see it over and over and over.\n\n  If he were here today on this floor, he would be a very disappointed \ngentleman, when he would know that the wages of a working family, \ncurrently almost half of them--it depends on who you are--are consumed \nby a growing and growing government. We just mentioned the data that, \nunchecked or unchanged, a child born yesterday will forfeit 84 percent \nof his or her working lifetime wages. That is not possible. There will \nbe a revolution.\n  This is going to be solved. I will stop addressing this just to the \nSenator from Illinois so he can get on with his day--but this is going \nto be solved. We have two options. One, which is the proposal of the \nSenator from Illinois, that we as a people manage this problem, that we \ninstitute new disciplines, that we have a process that assures the \npeople that their financial affairs will be managed. When we do that we \nvery quickly, as everybody has alluded to, produce positive benefits. \nOr we can ignore it, wait until that last 2 years of a 7-year plan, \ntalk about it tomorrow, wait until someone else is in office, and we \nwill create an absolute destabilized, wounded America that will trip \ninto the new century instead of march into it.\n  I admire the Senator from Illinois. As I said, those were eloquent \nremarks.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague will yield, I thank him for his comments. \nThe reality is, we have already wounded America. But the wounds will \nbecome much more severe if we do not pay attention to this.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Georgia \nfor his leadership on this issue, and also for his statement earlier. \nIn addition, I compliment the Senator from Illinois for his leadership, \nfor his cosponsoring this resolution, not just today but last year, not \njust last year but the year before.\n  For several years Senator Simon has been a leader in saying we should \npass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He is right. He \nalso makes it bipartisan, which is awfully important. I would support \nthis amendment if it was offered by the Democrats. If you had a \nDemocrat in the White House or a Republican in the White House or an \nIndependent, this amendment should pass. It has passed in the Senate \nbefore. We actually passed this amendment in August 1982. It passed \nwhen Republicans gained control of the Senate for the first time. It \npassed with 69 votes, 69 to 31.\n  The House never passed it. The House tried that year but they failed. \nThey came up short. Then, after we had Republican control of both \nHouses, the House passed it. And I compliment the House. They passed it \non January 26, 1995. The Senate again considered it and, unfortunately, \nit failed by one vote. Actually the final vote was 65-35. Everyone \nknows it takes 67 votes, but Senator Dole moved to reconsider it, which \nhe has that right to do, so we can have another try at it. I compliment \nhim for doing so. I believe this week we will have another chance to \npass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I remember when we had this debate some of our colleagues said, ``I \nbelieve in a balanced budget, I just do not think we have to have a \nconstitutional amendment.'' But I remember reading some remarks that \nwere made by some people on the other side of the aisle that said we \nneed a constitutional amendment. They voted for it. Actually, on March \n1, 1994, I had a resolution that said we should pass a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. Several of our colleagues on the \nDemocrat side at that time supported it. But in 1995, when it was for \nreal, after it had already passed the House, they voted no. That is \nunfortunate.\n  You might say, why did they vote no? President Clinton was against \nit. I wish he was not against it. Everybody in America should know that \nPresident Clinton was against a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. If he were in favor of it, I am sure some of our colleagues who \ndid not vote for it would vote to pass it and we could pass it this \nweek. And we should pass it this week.\n  Maybe there will be an election conversion. I think we have noticed a \ngreat deal of flexibility on the part of President Clinton on a lot of \nissues. Maybe on this issue he would see the wisdom, supported by 80-\nsome-odd percent of the American people who say we should have a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Most all States have \nsomething like this in their constitutions. That happens to work. And \nwe need it in our Constitution.\n  I look at the words of one of our forefathers, Thomas Jefferson, who \nsaid, in 1798:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     reduction of the administration of our Government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional \n     article taking from the Federal Government the power of \n     borrowing.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson, 1798. He was exactly right.\n  I have seen Government spending grow a lot, even since I have been \nhere. If you look at the total amount of Government spending: In 1960 \nwe spent less than $100 billion, in 1970 we spent less than $200 \nbillion, by 1980 we spent almost triple that and went to about $600 \nbillion so you see it growing rather substantially. By 1990 it grew to \nover $1.2 trillion, and last year we spent over $1.5 trillion. So we \nhave seen spending grow, and grow dramatically.\n  The present occupant of the Chair, Senator Kyl from Arizona, said: \nWait a minute, we should have a limitation, a limitation on taxes. I \nfigure maybe a limitation on spending. But we both see the growth of \nGovernment growing substantially. For every dollar that Government \nspends, we have to take it away from the American people, either in the \nform of taxes today, and/or in borrowing, both of which are taking \nmoney from the private sector and putting it in the hands of the public \nsector.\n  I happen to think that is part of the problem, because I think that \nthe private sector can spend money a lot better. Families can spend the \nmoney a lot better than Government can, than bureaucrats can. I happen \nto think families care a lot more about education than the bureaucrats \nin the Department of Education. I think families are a lot more \ninterested in the health of their families than some bureaucrat in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. I think families are a lot \nmore concerned, families and local communities, about welfare than the \nmassive bureaucracy that we now have, that has 334 federally \ncontrolled, Federal defined, federally determined benefits of welfare. \nI think States and local groups can do a lot better job in job training \nthan when we have 156 different Federal job training programs. They are \nstacked on top of each other. That is the reason we see spending just \ngoing through the roof. So we need to reform it.\n\n  How can we do it? If we have the majority votes we do not need a \nconstitutional amendment. Maybe not a simple majority, maybe we need 60 \nvotes because in the Senate sometimes it takes 60 to pass legislation. \nThat is unfortunate. We passed a balanced budget resolution earlier, \nlast month. It was a good resolution. It does lead us. It shows how we \ncan get to a balanced budget in 6 years; not in 7 years, in 6 years. I \nsupport that. I think it is a giant step in the right direction.\n  Some people would say President Clinton offered a balanced budget, \nand is that not good? I would say it is a marked contrast to what he \noffered a year ago in January, which had $200 billion deficits forever. \nSo we are making progress. But if you look at the details you realize \nhis budget is not really balanced. The Senator from Arizona quoted the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, who says, ``No, it does \nnot come into balance. Actually his budget, by the year 2002, has an \n$81 billion deficit unless you have automatic tax increases.''\n  So, if the economy does not perform as well as President Clinton had \nanticipated, instead of having automatic spending reductions he has \nautomatic tax increases. I do not think that is a good idea. Then, if \nyou look at some of the other things he has in his budget, they are \npurely smoke and mirrors. He plays games with Medicare, taking home \nhealth care and moving that away from Medicare part A, moving it out, \n$55 billion.\n  That is surely a charade. He cannot be serious. But we do have a \nserious budget.\n  Some of our colleagues said, ``I support a balanced budget, not the \namendment, but I support a balanced budget.'' Well, we passed a \nbalanced budget and we did show, yes, we would cut actually some \ndiscretionary spending--it is almost a freeze--but little more than a \nfreeze in discretionary spending.\n  Take the total amount we spend on discretionary spending, about one-\nthird of the budget. We spend $1.5 trillion, a little over that, one-\nthird of that is discretionary spending. We basically freeze that for 6 \nyears. We cut a little bit more than that from a freeze. President \nClinton spends more than a freeze, and he cuts a lot more in defense. \nBut we make that.\n  Then we curb the growth of some entitlement programs. Some people are \nreally playing scare tactics, trying to scare senior citizens saying, \n``Wait a minute, those policies the Republicans have, they're not fair, \nthey're not realistic, they're cutting Medicare too much.''\n  It is totally false. For example, in Medicare in 1996, we are \nspending $186 billion. Under our budget in 2002, that figure increases \nto $279 billion. That is an increase of 42 percent. That is not a cut. \nThat is not a cut. If you look at per capita, last year it was $4,800 \nper senior. By the year 2002, it is going to be over $2,000 more. That \nis not a cut. If you go from less than $5,000 and you are spending \n$7,000, that is over a $2,000 increase per capita in Medicare alone \nunder our budget.\n  What do we do? We keep Medicare solvent for at least 10 years. \nPresident Clinton does not do that. Medicare is going to go broke. \nThose are just the\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\nfacts. He may want to put the facts off, but you cannot fool the \npeople. Actually, Medicare in the first 6 months of this year paid out \n$4.2 billion more than it took in. You cannot do that indefinitely. You \ncannot sit back and just let that happen. If that happens, then \nMedicare is going to be broke and the hospitals and doctors will not be \npaid.\n  To me, that is not responsible. Some people may want to play politics \nand they may think that is going to help them in elections, but I found \nseniors in my State of Oklahoma are very realistic. When you tell them \nthe facts, they are very mature and very willing to do what is \nnecessary to save the system. Certainly, when you tell them, ``Wait a \nminute, Medicare is going to grow from $4,800 to $7,000,'' they do not \nthink that is a cut.\n  What about welfare, Medicaid spending? Actually, in 1996, Medicaid \nspending was $95.7 billion. Under our proposal, in the year 2002, it \ngrows to $139.5 billion. That is a 46 percent increase. That is not a \ncut. Medicaid goes up 46 percent in the next 6 years. That is not a \ncut.\n  So I just make those two points, Mr. President, because a lot of \npeople say, ``They are slashing the budget.'' Actually, we do not slash \nthe budget. In 1996, we spent $1.57 trillion. In this one year what is \nestimated to be spent is $1.57 trillion. In the year 2002, we are going \nto be spending $1.846 trillion. That is an increase of $271 billion, or \n2.7 percent per year.\n  So spending grows every single year. Entitlement spending grows every \nsingle year, and we are able to save and keep Medicare solvent for 10 \nyears. And we are able to deliver a balanced budget. And we are able to \ngive some tax relief to American families. We are able to tell \nfamilies, almost all working families with incomes less than $100,000 \nin America, if they have children, they will get a $500 tax credit per \nchild. That is in our budget. That is our statement that we really and \ntruly believe American families can spend this money better than \nWashington, DC, and we can do that and balance the budget.\n\n  I have heard President Clinton say he supports a tax credit for \nchildren. He campaigned on it in 1992, but he did not deliver it in \n1993, 1994, or 1995. As a matter of fact, in 1993, instead of giving a \ntax reduction, as he campaigned for, he gave the largest tax increase \nin history, and he hit American families right between the eyes.\n  He gave an increase in gasoline taxes, an increase for families that \nare on Social Security income, and a big hit on other families. That is \nnot fair, that is not right, that is not what he campaigned on. \nActually, he campaigned, and in his book said, ``We're against \nincreasing gasoline excise taxes.'' Lo and behold, if you look at his \ntax increase in 1993, there was an increase in gasoline taxes.\n  Now he says he would be willing to support reducing them temporarily. \nTo me that is not good enough. It shows very much a strong \ninconsistency on the part of the President. Maybe he was not telling \nthe truth. Maybe he did not level with the American people, but he did \nexactly the opposite of what he said he was going to do. In his book, \nhe said he was opposed to gasoline tax increases, and in his tax \nincrease, it had a 4.3-cent gasoline tax increase.\n  The total net amount of tax reduction that we have under the budget \nproposal that has already passed is $122 billion. President Clinton's \nnet tax reduction in 6 years on his so-called budget is $6 billion. \nThere is no net tax cut for American families under President Clinton's \nproposal. I think that is unfortunate.\n  We do have a balanced budget proposal. We do have a road map on how \nwe can get there. We should do it. Thomas Jefferson was exactly right--\nexactly right. I just hope that my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will look at this and ask, ``What is in the best interest of the \nUnited States? Should we not pass a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget?\"\n  I think we should, and we should do it this week. Thomas Jefferson \nwas right, Mr. President. I hope that our colleagues will reconsider. I \nam proud of the Senators on this side of the aisle. We had 98 percent \nof the Republicans, all but one, voted for a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. I hope that we will have that strong support on \nthis side of the aisle, and I hope a few of our colleagues who \nsupported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in the past \nwill likewise vote for it this time and give the American people what \nthey really want. And that is a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). All time given to the Senator from \nGeorgia has expired.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 30 minutes for debate \nunder the control of the Democratic leader, or his designee.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5657-8", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5667-S5670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is Monday, and we have had an hour and \na half of morning business by the majority party. It is, ``He said, she \nsaid, they said.''\n  And it is, ``President Clinton this'' and ``President Clinton that.''\n  And it is, ``We have a balanced budget and the other folks don't.''\n  And it is, ``They are the big spenders and we're the folks who want \nto put America back on track.''\n  Let us review exactly where we are, because it is important for \npeople to understand what the business of the Senate is today.\n  The business of the Senate is to discuss a proposal by the majority \nparty to change the Constitution to balance the budget and require a \nbalanced budget in the Constitution, and the pending order of business \nin the Senate is a missile program, a national missile defense program, \ncalled the ``Defend America Act,'' which will cost, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, upward of $60 billion of new spending just \nto construct--not to operate.\n  So the same folks who have been treating us to an hour and a half of \ndiscussion about the need to change the Constitution to balance the \nbudget are also saying, ``By the way, we want to balance the budget, \nbut we want a new $60 billion spending program, and we want to work on \nthat immediately, and we demand that that money be spent right now.''\n  Following that, also pending before the Senate, is we also want to \ncut the gasoline tax, and we also want a very substantial tax cut \nduring the 7 years. All of this from the same folks. ``We want a \nbalanced budget, we want to increase spending,'' they say, ``we want to \ncut taxes, gas tax and other taxes.'' I do not understand what school \nthey went to. I do not understand what arithmetic book they have \nstudied.\n  It seems to me to be consistent if one says, ``Let's change the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget,'' and the very next act of \nbusiness would not be to bring to the floor an enormously expensive new \nspending program called the Defend America Act, which is a nice way, a \nretitling, of saying we want to build star wars again.\n  Everybody has a right to develop their priorities and to advertise \nthem, however inconsistent they may be. I am going to talk tomorrow \nabout the Defend America Act, or the star wars program. We have had \nsome experience with that. The only one that was ever built, the \nantiballistic missile program, was built in my State of North Dakota. \nThere is a very large concrete monument to it, a large concrete pyramid \nthat sits up in the hills of North Dakota. In today's dollars, $25 \nbillion was spent in order to construct it, and it was decommissioned \nthe same month it was declared operational--$25 billion. That is called \nshooting blanks.\n  But it is all right, I guess, according to some, because it was not \ntheir money, it was the taxpayers' money.\n  That is the attitude of some--anything that explodes, they want to \nbuild, any new weapons program they want to construct. Katie bar the \ndoor. The sky is the limit. The American taxpayers' credit card is at \nstake, so let's build it.\n  The same people who say let us change the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget, in the next order of business on the Senate floor will \nalso say, let us spend $60 billion on a program that will not really \ndefend America but that they can advertise will defend America.\n  At another time I will discuss that in greater detail. But first the \nissue of the constitutional amendment to balance\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\nthe budget. There is no balanced budget, contrary to the claims made in \nthe last 1\\1/2\\ hours.\n  This is from recent weeks on the floor of the Senate. It sat on every \ndesk here in the Senate. It is from the Budget Committee. It is the \nbudget passed by this Senate that advertised it was balancing the \nbudget. It says for the year 2002 that there will be a $108 billion \ndeficit. This is the resolution they said balanced the budget.\n  Why would that be the case? Why, if they advertise a product they say \nbalances the budget, would it in the text of the bill laying on every \ndesk of the Senate say that in the year 2002 the deficit will be $108 \nbillion? Because they take money from the Social Security trust funds, \n$108 billion, and use it over in the operating budget to say, ``Oh, by \nthe way, our budget is in balance.''\n  But technically the law prohibits them from doing that in this \nlegislation, so the only place where you have to tell the truth is \nright here. And it laid on every Senator's desk. Every one of the \nSenators who stood up stretched every inch of their height and \nproclaimed the budget was in balance. Even on their desks it \ndemonstrated they were $108 billion short in the year 2002. But there \nis nothing in the Senate that prohibits anybody from false advertising \nor false claims or deciding to boast about whatever they want to boast \nabout. So they boasted this was a balanced budget. Of course, it was \nnot.\n  But the point I want to make today is that exactly what they did in \nthe budget resolution for this year is what they insist on enshrining \nin the Constitution. The language in the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget enshrines in the Constitution the provision that \nthey shall use the Social Security trust fund surpluses to balance the \nFederal budget. There would not be one vote in favor of that \nproposition in the U.S. Senate today if you had to vote up or down on \nit.\n  I was here in 1983, serving in the House Ways and Means Committee, \nwhen we passed the Social Security reform bill. That bill provided that \nwe begin saving each year--that is, raising more money in the Social \nSecurity trust fund--than we spend out through payroll taxes in order \nto save for when the baby boomers retire.\n  What is that all about? If you read your history books, you will know \nthat just after the Second World War America had the largest crop of \nbabies in its history. I am told that there was an enormous outpouring \nof affection and warmth and love when people who had been separated for \nlong periods were reacquainted. And guess what? The war babies, the \nlargest group of babies ever born in this country's history, were born \njust after the Second World War, just after all those folks came back \nfrom fighting that war. They will retire after the turn of the century.\n  In 1983, the decision was made to begin saving in the Social Security \nsystem for when we will need those funds when the baby boomers retire. \nThis year, $69 billion more will be collected in the Social Security \ntrust funds than will be spent out; $69 billion will be accrued as a \nsurplus this year alone.\n  The proposition that the majority party brings to this Congress is to \nsay this: Let us balance the budget, and let us, in fact, enshrine in \nthe Constitution a provision that will balance the budget by allowing \nus to take the trust funds in the Social Security system every year and \nshow it over here in the operating budget and claim we have balanced \nthe operating budget.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, says if you were in \nbusiness and did that, they would put you in jail. If you were in \nbusiness and did that, and said, ``By the way, I am going to balance my \nbusiness budget this year by taking my employees' pension funds, that \nis how I am going to balance my budget, I will just take their pension \nrevenues and bring it over into the operating budget and claim I \nbalanced my budget or made a profit,'' you would have 2 years of hard \ntennis in a minimum-security prison, because you cannot do that. You \nought not be able to do it in the Congress either, and you especially \nought not to be able to do it in the U.S. Constitution.\n  If the majority party changed section 7 of their constitutional \namendment proposal to say that they will not misuse these Social \nSecurity trust funds to balance the budget, they would get 75 votes for \nthis proposition. But they will not do that. They will not do that \nbecause they understand that to lay their hands on the Social Security \ntrust funds gives them an opportunity to claim they have balanced the \nbudget even while they are pushing their own agenda of more tax cuts, \nbuilding a $60 billion star wars program. And the fact is, none of it \nadds up. None of it adds up.\n  It is interesting. I have seen and heard the three stages of denial \nabout the Social Security trust funds on the floor of the Senate. I \nwill not name the Senators. I could, but I will not. Three Senators.\n  One stands up and says, ``There are no Social Security trust funds. \nThere are no trust funds.'' That is the first denial. The second \nSenator stands up and says, ``There are trust funds, and we are not \nmisusing them.'' The second denial. The third denial is the Senator who \nstands up and says, ``There are trust funds, and we are misusing them, \nbut we promise to stop by the year 2008.'' All three assertions have \nbeen made by the majority side of the aisle.\n  What is it? There are no trust funds? That is interesting. Tell the \nmillions and millions of people who work, who pay into that trust fund \nevery year with payroll taxes, that there are no trust funds, or there \nare trust funds but we are not misusing them. Explain this. Explain the \nbottom of the budget document that was brought to the floor of the \nSenate. Or there are trust funds, we are misusing them, and we promise \nto stop by 2008. Translated, this means: Allow us to write in the \nConstitution at least for the next 12 years that we can misuse Social \nSecurity trust funds to claim we balanced the budget that is not in \nbalance.\n  I know people have said, well, there has been switching here and \nthere. Somebody voted for it before, then is against it. Look, when the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget was previously brought \nto the floor of the Senate, Senator Simon, who spoke not too long ago \ntoday, was an author. I raised the question with him about using the \nSocial Security trust funds. The fact is, he wanted a constitutional \namendment that would exclude the Social Security trust funds. He \nproposed that. He favored that. But in order to have a bipartisan \ncoalition, he did not get that. But he said to me on the floor, and he \nsaid to others: We pledge that we will not be using the Social Security \ntrust funds. And others did as well. We had a pledge that that would \nnot be the case.\n\n  The second time around we not only did not have a pledge they would \nnot use the Social Security trust funds, we had a vote on whether or \nnot they would, and they voted to say, ``We will use the Social \nSecurity trust funds.'' Then people say the vote was exactly the same \nvote under the same circumstances. No, I am sorry to disagree. The \nfirst was a promise they would not misuse the Social Security trust \nfunds, and the second was a legislative promise they would. Big \ndifference, a difference that amounts to well over half a trillion \ndollars.\n  I want us to balance the Federal budget. I will vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget if they will change \nsection 7 to say we are not going to misuse the Social Security trust \nfunds. If they want to do that, they will get 75 votes, in my judgment, \nfor this constitutional amendment. If they do not want to do that, it \nmeans they do not want a constitutional amendment and do not intend to \nbalance the budget.\n  I also say, the most consistent thing they could do, those who allege \nthey should balance the budget by enshrining in the Constitution a \nprovision that they should misuse the Social Security trust funds, the \nmost consistent thing they could do is bring to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate an agenda that could balance the budget.\n  I voted for a provision in 1993 that substantially changed \nexpenditures by decreasing Federal spending, increasing some Federal \ntaxes. And the deficit has been decreased substantially. All of us who \nvoted for that experienced some difficulty because of the vote, because \nit was a hard vote to cast. I am glad I cast the vote. I think we did \nthe right thing. Those of us who cast that vote cast an affirmative \nvote that says: We stand on the side of reducing the Federal deficit.\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\n  We will cast our votes to demonstrate that we will reduce the Federal \ndeficit. I am glad I voted that way. We did not get one accidental vote \non the other side of the aisle. Not one. You would think occasionally \nwith a mixup somebody would vote wrong. We did not get one vote on the \nother side either in the Senate or the House.\n  They wanted us to do it because it was not easy to do it. We did it. \nThe deficit is coming down. But the deficit will not continue to come \ndown with a menu coming to the floor of the Senate for people that say \nthe next thing we want to do is a $60 billion star wars program. I say \nto those people, how will you pay for it? Show me the money. Who will \nyou tax to build the star wars program? Will it be like the concrete \npyramid we have in the Dakotas, declared dysfunctional the same month \nit was declared operational, of which $25 billion of the taxpayer money \nwas spent? Is that a consistent kind of philosophy? Does that come from \npeople who really want to balance the budget? I do not think so.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, my colleague, is on \nthe floor. He also was involved in this discussion about the trust \nfund, Social Security, the right way to balance the budget, the right \nway to put something in the Constitution. There is a right and a wrong \nway to do it. I yield the floor so my colleague, Senator Conrad, could \noffer some comments of his on this subject.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \ntalking about the balanced budget amendment that will be offered this \nweek and opening the discussion about what are we really doing here. I \nthink this is one of the most misunderstood discussions in the United \nStates.\n  When we hear people talking about a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States, the first question we ought to ask \nis, what budget is being balanced? It is very easy to talk around this \ntown about balancing the budget. What one finds is there are not many \nfolks who are willing to actually sit down and put their name next to a \nbudget that does, in fact, balance.\n  What we have over the time I have been in Congress and for the time \nbefore I came to Congress, a series of folks who are willing to stand \nup and say, ``I am for Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. That is a formula that \nwill balance the budget.'' Or, ``I am for a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution,'' without a plan attached to it and without \ntalking very clearly about what budget they are balancing.\n  I hope people are paying attention because I will give them precisely \nwhat this balanced budget talks about. It says in section 7:\n\n       ``Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \n     States Government except those derived from borrowing. Total \n     outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt \n     principal.''\n\n  That is what is included in this amendment. Do you know what this \nmeans, colleagues and people who are listening around the country? This \nmeans you are including all of the receipts and all of the expenditures \nof the Social Security system. Social Security is not contributing to \nthe deficit. It is not contributing to the debt. Social Security is in \nsurplus. In 1997, for fiscal year 1997, the most recent estimate is \nthat Social Security will contribute $72 billion of surplus--of \nsurplus. Yet this definition would have us include in the determination \nof a balanced budget all of the Social Security surplus used between \nnow and the year 2002.\n\n  Mr. President, that is $525 billion being thrown into the pot to call \nit a balanced budget. What a fraud. That is not a balanced budget. \nThere is not a company in America that would take the retirement funds \nof its employees and throw those into the pot and call it balancing \ntheir company's budget. In fact, if anybody attempted to do that they \nwould be on their way to a Federal institution and it would not be the \nU.S. Congress. They would be on their way to a Federal penitentiary \nbecause that is a violation of Federal law. It is a violation of \nFederal law to loot the trust funds of employees who are going to \nretire in order to balance a company's budget. Mr. President, that is \nprecisely what is being proposed as a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me say it as clearly as I can. We are talking \nabout enshrining a principle and a policy in the Constitution of the \nUnited States that defines a balanced budget as one that uses Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses to achieve balance. What could be more \nwrong? What could be more fraudulent? What could be a greater violation \nof the trust of the people that sent us here than to put into the \nConstitution of the United States, the organic law of this country, a \ndefinition of a balanced budget that assumes you raid and loot trust \nfunds in order to achieve balance? Mr. President, I would not vote for \nthat proposition under any circumstances, under any circumstances. I \nwould not vote for that if my life were threatened because that is a \nfundamental violation of any precept of honesty.\n  Mr. President, some will say ``Senator, we are engaged in that \nprocess now. We loot the Social Security trust funds every year and \ncall it part of the unified budget.'' Mr. President, that is exactly \nright. That is what we are doing. That does not make it right. We are \ntaking Social Security surpluses and counting them when we report on \nthe deficit of the United States because even though the law says that \nis not to be done, people put all the funds into one pot. As this chart \nshows--which I call the budget teakettle of America--it shows the \nrevenues that go into that teakettle. The individual income taxes make \nup 45 percent of the revenue, Social Security taxes make up 37 percent, \ncorporate income taxes, 10 percent, other taxes 8 percent. That is the \nmoney that goes in. The spending that comes out, Social Security is 22 \npercent, interest on the debt is 16 percent, defense is 16 percent, \nMedicare is 14 percent, Medicaid is 7 percent, and all other spending \nis 25 percent.\n\n  This shows precisely that is happening. All the money goes into one \npot comes out of that same pot. That is the budget they are talking \nabout balancing under this balanced budget amendment. The problem with \nthat is Social Security is in surplus by $70 billion. What they are \nsaying is they will take every single penny of Social Security surplus, \nthrow that into the pot, and call it a balanced budget. That is not a \nbalanced budget. That is an absolute fraud. That is not a balanced \nbudget.\n  I have a financial background. Before I came here I was the tax \ncommissioner of the State of North Dakota. I have a master's in \nbusiness administration. Any class for anybody in business school, if \nyou would have said you will take the retirement funds of your \nemployees and throw those into the pot to call it a balanced budget, \nyou would be laughed out of the class if you proposed such a thing. \nThat is the balanced budget proposal that will be before this body. It \nis not, by any serious definition, a balanced budget.\n  The only way one could claim a balanced budget would be to take out \nthe trust funds from the calculation. In fact, that is what the law \nrequires. The law says specifically you are not to count Social \nSecurity surpluses in making a determination, whether or not you have \nbalanced the budget. We passed that law right here. The Senators \noverwhelmingly said it is not honest, it is not correct, to use Social \nSecurity surpluses to determine whether or not you have balanced the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, all of us have been part of budget plans this year. We \nhave had a Republican balanced budget plan. We have had the President's \nbalanced budget plan. I have been part of a group called the centrist \ncoalition, 22 Senators--11 Democrats and 11 Republicans--who have put \ntogether a plan. As I said in the Budget Committee, if we are going to \nbe honest with each other and honest with the American people, none of \nthose is a balanced budget plan. Each of them assumes the use of Social \nSecurity trust funds to balance by the year 2002. That is not a \nbalanced budget.\n  In fact, last year I offered the Fair Share Balanced Budget Plan, the \nonly plan that has been offered here that balances without using Social \nSecurity surpluses. Mr. President, I recognize that makes it more \ndifficult to achieve balance, but it is the only honest way to get the \njob done. Mr. President, I am going to oppose, with every fiber in my \nbeing, putting into the Constitution of the United States--let us think \na minute about what we are talking about here. Let us think about what \nwe\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nare talking about. We are not talking about passing a budget plan. We \nare not talking about passing a statute. We are talking about changing \nthe organic law of this country. We are talking about changing the \ndocument that has made this country the greatest one in human history. \nWe are talking about changing the document that has provided a \nprotection and a series of guarantees to the American people, unrivaled \nin world history. We are talking about putting the definition of a \nbalanced budget in that document that says, yes, it is OK to go loot \nand raid trust funds to call it a balanced budget.\n\n  I will tell you, I really have to think, what would Benjamin Franklin \nthink of that? What would Thomas Jefferson think of that? What would \nGeorge Washington think of that? I do not think that would be a very \nproud moment in America's history--to enshrine in the Constitution of \nthe United States the definition of a balanced budget that includes \nraiding every trust fund in sight in order to achieve balance.\n  Mr. President, that cannot be the outcome here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator if he has heard this. I have heard \npeople stand on the Senate floor and say this issue you are raising \nabout the Social Security trust funds is a bogus issue. There is a \nfellow, whose name I will not give, who wrote a piece in the Washington \nPost that said this is a bogus issue, that the Social Security trust \nfunds are just part of the regular revenues of the Federal Government. \nDo they just profoundly misunderstand the circumstances here? How would \nthe Senator respond to the folks who try to create kind of a \nsmokescreen and say this is all bogus and none of this means anything?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I always hesitate to characterize the statements or \nmotivations of others. But I will simply say this. It matters a lot \nwhat we do here. You know, sometimes the actions in this Chamber do not \nmatter and the actions in the other Chamber do not matter much. This \naction matters a lot. Here is why it matters. For those who say, \n``Well, we have been doing that; we have been taking Social Security \nsurpluses, so what does it matter that we keep on doing it?'' The \nreason it matters is because, back in 1983, we saw we were headed for a \ncliff, for a circumstance in which the Social Security system would be \nbroke. So Congress took action. Congress put into place a system that \nwould assure Social Security surpluses so we would be prepared for when \nthe baby boom generation started to retire. We know now that we have a \nshort period of time to prepare for when those baby boomers start to \nretire.\n  The idea is to run surpluses to get ready for when those baby boomers \nhave retired and have 48 million people on the system instead of 24 \nmillion, because if we do not have surpluses, we will have to have \neither an 82-percent tax rate in this country, or a one-third cut in \nall benefits. Does anybody believe we are going to have an 82-percent \ntax rate? I do not. That means we are going to have some dramatic cuts \nin benefits which people have paid into to secure for themselves. So \nthe money is not available.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have one additional question. There is virtue in \nbalancing the budget. We ought to care about that and not spending our \nchildren's money or charging to our children and grandchildren. There \nis also virtue in keeping your promise. If you promise you are going to \nsave by taking money out of people's paychecks, and if you say we are \ngoing to put that aside in a trust fund, there is virtue in keeping \nthat promise as well; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think there is not only virtue in it, but it is \nrequired that we do it because the hard reality in this town is that \nwhile it is true we have been talking Social Security surpluses--about \n$500 billion so far--this is the tip of the iceberg. We are about to \nrun, over the next 15 years, $2 trillion in Social Security surpluses, \nand we need every dime of it to be ready for when the baby boomers \nretire. If we spent it all, squandered every penny, if we deluded \nourselves by passing a phony balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, and the baby boomers retire and they go to the cupboard \nand the cupboard is bare, we are going to have some mighty angry folks \nin this country, and they are going to ask some pretty tough questions. \nThey are going to ask, ``Where did the money go? I thought you balanced \nthe budget and secured the solvency of the Social Security System.''\n  Mr. President, the hard reality is that we have been doing something \nwrong and we have to stop it to prepare for the future. We have to get \nready for when the baby boom generation retires. The only way we can do \nthat is to balance the budget and do it honestly, without counting \nSocial Security surpluses. To put it into the Constitution of the \nUnited States, to put a definition in the Constitution of the United \nStates that a balanced budget includes raiding and looting the Social \nSecurity trust funds is just profoundly wrong. There is no principle in \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired under the previous order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5667-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5670-S5671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A BROKEN PROMISE TO THE FARMERS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on a different matter, on Friday last, I \nlearned that the Republicans on the House side have now broken the \npromise to farmers contained in the most recent farm bill.\n  Mr. President, I think everyone in this Chamber remembers that \nAmerica's farmers were told that if you accept this new farm bill that \nhas sharply declining payments in it and has no safety net for when \nprices plunge, you will at least be assured that for the 7 years of \nthis farm bill the payments contained in that will be guaranteed. In \nfact, the proponents of the so-called Freedom to Farm Act told the \nAmerican farm producers that this is like a contract. In fact, they \nrelated it to the Conservation Reserve Program contracts. They said, \n``Farmers, at least you will be assured you are going to get payments \nof these amounts.''\n  Mr. President, last week, the House Appropriations subcommittee broke \nthe promise, violated the pledge, and said to the American farmers that \nthat was all a trick. We promised you a contract, but we are breaking \nthe contract before the ink is even dry. The farm bill has just been \nsigned into law, and already you might as well throw it out the window \nbecause the fundamental pledge and promise has turned out to be a hoax. \nNot a word of truth is in it because they have cut the transition \npayments before farmers have even received one--the payments that were \nsupposed to be inviolate, the payments that were supposed to be \nguaranteed, the payments that were supposed to be a contract. It turns \nout that they have no guarantee attached to them at all. There is no \ncontract. Farmers are being asked right now to sign up, put their name \non the line. But they do not know what they are signing up to because \nit is very clear from the action taken in the House Appropriations \nCommittee that they can cut the funding for those transition payments \nany time, in any amount, in any way they want. It does not have to be 7 \nyears of payments; it could be 3. In the first 3 years, they could cut \nthem 50 percent, or they could cut them 80 percent.\n  There is no contract here. There is no commitment here. There is no \nguarantee here. All there is is a betrayal, a betrayal of the farmers \nwho trusted those who promoted this approach, who were told, and told \nrepeatedly, that these are sharply declining payments, but at least you \ncan be assured you will be getting what the formula provides over the \nnext 7 years. Now we know none of it is true.\n  Mr. President, I think those who promoted the Freedom to Farm Act on \nthe basis that it was a guarantee ought to apologize to America's \nproducers. I think they ought to stand up and admit that there are not \ncontract payments here. There is nothing here that is assured. They \nhave sold farmers a pig in a poke. That, I think, was one of the most \ndisappointing betrayals that I have seen in the 10 years I have been in \nthe U.S. Senate; if there ever was a circumstance in which it was \nabsolutely clear what the promise was--with respect to the so-called \nFreedom to Farm Program.\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\n  During debate on the farm bill, Republican Senator after Republican \nSenator stood on this floor in this Chamber and promoted the bill based \non these payment guarantees. Farmers will have certainty. Payments will \nbe guaranteed. Farmers will know how much money they will have to work \nwith each year, they said. Now the truth is out. Freedom to Farm is a \nfraud. There is no contract. There is no guarantee.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, they did not stop. They did not stop in \nthe House Agriculture Committee with breaking the promise on transition \npayments. They then, after promising a market-based farm program, \nannounced an unprecedented move to put a cap on sugarcane prices at \n21.2 cents a pound--unprecedented. This is a market-oriented bill, and \nfarmers are told you will get the benefits of the market. Well, it is a \none-way benefit. You get the benefit when prices are going down. When \nthe prices start going up, we are going to put a cap on them. That is \nan interesting idea of market orientation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5670-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, this year National Small Business Week \nwill be held from June 2 to June 8. This week is a fitting opportunity \nfor us to recognize the contributions of the many entrepreneurs in our \ncountry and reassess policies affecting small businesses.\n  It has been said many times over, but small businesses really are the \nheart of our small towns and cities. A full 99.9 percent of businesses \nin South Dakota are small businesses. In fact, we have only 25 \nbusinesses in the State that employ more than 500 people. Entrepreneurs \nin the local cafe, gas station, hardware store, and pharmacy provide \nessential services and cohesion for our communities. Farmers and small \nbusiness people too, contribute to the community. Together, these \nleaders are the key to our economic strength.\n  Small businesses operate against overwhelming odds. Burdensome \nregulations and paperwork, onerous taxes, inadequate access to capital, \nand excessive litigation all are barriers to success. Congress made \ngood progress earlier this year by passing the Small Business \nRegulatory Relief Enforcement Fairness Act, which instituted judicial \nreview of regulations. This is a step in the right direction. We should \ncontinue on this track and enact workplace safety and Fair Labor \nStandards Act reforms. I recently spoke with Clark Sinclair, who owns a \nfurniture store in Madison, SD, about the need for flexibility in \nawarding either earn comp time or overtime. This flexibility would be \nbeneficial for both employees and business owners.\n  Business men and women should be free to operate without fear that \ntheir livelihood is in jeopardy due to unreasonable Government \nregulation and enforcement. Karla and Richard Hauk are prime examples \nof the obstacles small business owners face today. The Hauks recently \nconstructed a Days Inn in Wall, SD, believing they complied with the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. The Department of Justice filed suit \nagainst them even as the Hauks made goodfaith efforts to negotiate and \ncomply with the law. Government should work constructively with law-\nabiding business owners like the Hauks and help them meet legal \nrequirements.\n  Our tax policy also consistently works against small firms. The \ncurrent estate tax system is a good example. I am proud to have worked \nwith Senator Dole on a reform proposal that would alleviate the heavy \nburden of estate taxes on small family-owned businesses. Currently, \nestate taxes are so onerous that the inheritors are frequently forced \nto sell all or part of a family business simply to pay off the taxes. \nThis tax can reach as high as an overwhelming 55 percent of the total \nvalue of the business. Many families must sell off all or part of their \nbusiness or farm just to pay the estate tax. That is wrong.\n\n  Congress also should increase the deductibility of health care \ninsurance for the self-employed, increase expensing, and reduce the \noverall tax burden on small businesses. Many small business owners file \npersonal tax returns for their businesses. Thus, thanks to the Clinton \nbudget plan, many sole proprietorships pay a higher tax rate than the \nlargest corporations in the Nation. Take a business like Malloy \nElectric in Sioux Falls. Gary Jacobsen employs 65 people but cannot \nhire more employees because of the high tax burden. This is a business \nthat has been a cornerstone of the community for 25 years, and yet the \nGovernment continues to tie their hands.\n  Despite these obstacles, entrepreneurs strike out on their own--and \nsucceed. I would like to recognize the 1996 South Dakota Small Business \nPersons of the Year, DeLon and Janice Buttolph, of Labelcrafters Inc. \nin Sioux Falls. The Buttolph's custom label printing business started \nin 1987 with just one employee and one small contract. Now, \nLabelcrafters runs two shifts with 24 employees and continues to grow. \nThe company has received national recognition for producing \nenvironmentally friendly labels. As partners in life, as well as \npartners in business, DeLon and Janice have shown that good small \nbusinesses come from families.\n  I also would like to recognize several other South Dakota small \nbusiness persons who have made a difference in our State: Shelly A. \nKnuths, Roscoe Manufacturing Co., Madison--South Dakota Women in \nBusiness Advocate; Kenneth E. Yager, K.O. Lee Co., Aberdeen--South \nDakota Small Business Exporter; Terry L. Fredericks, attorney for \nWhiting, Hagg & Hagg, Rapid City--South Dakota Veteran Small Business \nAdvocate; Richard B. Vallie, Native American Herbal Tea, Aberdeen--\nSouth Dakota Minority Small Business Advocate; and Mark W. Benson, \nFirst Bank of South Dakota, Rapid City--South Dakota Financial Services \nAdvocate. In addition, Doug O'Bryan Contracting, Inc. of Martin, and \nC Enterprises of Sioux Falls, have received the Administrator's Award \nfor Excellence for their outstanding performance as prime contractors \nunder Federal contract.\n  These individuals are today's real heroes. They are creating jobs and \nprosperity in South Dakota small cities and towns. They are overlooked \ntoo often. This week we should take time to recognize their leadership \nand accomplishments. My congratulations to these and all other South \nDakota entrepreneurs who daily make a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5671-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5671-S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING KENTUCKY SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR, BOB PATTERSON\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Bob \nPatterson of Louisville, KY, who has been selected as the Kentucky \nSmall Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration.\n  Bob Patterson is the President, CEO, and partner of Consumers Choice \nCoffee, Inc., a coffee distributor in Louisville, KY. Under Bob \nPatterson, who has been involved with the coffee industry for 18 years, \nConsumers Choice Coffee has grown to become Kentucky's premier coffee \ncompany. Consumers Choice Coffee maintains an exclusive contract to \nsupply more than 200 McDonald's restaurants in addition to supplying \nmany upscale restaurants.\n  In 1990, when Bob became president and chief executive officer, \nConsumers Choice Coffee was entering into the worst period in its \nhistory. With losses in both profits and sales, Bob had his hands full. \nHe concentrated on expansion, developing new product lines and \nreeducating his employees to improve customer service. Consumers Choice \nbegan to gain new customers. The company began to supply not only \ncoffee, but equipment and service agreements.\n  As the company was beginning to improve, coffee prices were driven up \ndo to a frost in Brazil. Bob advised his customers on this long-term \ncrisis, and helped them to prepare. Again, more vendors came to rely on \nConsumers Choice Coffee because of its strong commitment to meet the \nneeds of its customers.\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\n  Today, Consumers Choice Coffee, Inc. is a well known name in \nKentucky's restaurant industry. It has an ever growing clientele of \nrestaurants and other vendors. The company has Bob Patterson to thank. \nBob has displayed great determination in the face of adversity. He sets \nan example of dedication of business and commitment to his customers \nthat should be followed by small business persons across my State and \nthe Nation. I am happy that Bob is being recognized for all of the good \nwork he has done. I congratulate him on this significant accomplishment \nand wish him many future years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5671-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nthe motion to proceed to S. 1635, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 1635, a bill \n     to establish a United States policy for the deployment of a \n     national missile defense system, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last Thursday the majority leader sought \nto proceed to the Defend America Act of 1996, but was blocked from \ndoing so by those on the other side of the aisle who do not want the \nPresident to sign or be forced to veto this important legislation. \nThese Senators may be able to block passage of the Defend America Act, \nbut they will not be able to cover up the fact they and President \nClinton have concluded that the American people should not be defended \nagainst ballistic missile attack.\n  Of course, the President has said that he favors ballistic missile \ndefense. But his actions contradict this words. Since elected, \nPresident Clinton has cut funding for ballistic missile defense every \nyear. No program has been cut more drastically than the National \nMissile Defense Program. The Defend America Act seeks to reverse this \ndisturbing trend and to set a measured course toward the deployment of \nan affordable national missile defense system to protect all Americans.\n  In his recent speech to the Coast Guard Academy, President Clinton \nasserted that his fiscal year 1997 budget request includes $3 billion \nfor national missile defense. In fact, it includes $2.8 billion for all \nballistic missile defense technologies and programs and only $500 \nmillion for national missile defense. This amount is insufficient to \nfulfill even the goals of the President's own 3-plus-3 development \nprogram. Ironically, if it were not for continued Republican pressure \non the administration, the President would not have developed even this \nfigleaf of a plan.\n  The President and his allies in Congress have spent more time \ndeveloping excuses for why we should not commit to a national missile \ndefense deployment effort than they have in looking at the dire \nconsequences of not going ahead with such a program. But like all such \nexcuses, these ring hollow.\n  The President and other opponents of national missile defense have \nasserted that there is no threat to justify a commitment at this time, \nthat we should wait 3 years before we even begin to think about a \ndeployment decision. But in 3 years, North Korea could be on the verge \nof deploying an intercontinental ballistic missile and other rogue \ncountries could be well along this path.\n  The opponents of national missile defense have also asserted that a \ncommitment at this time could lead to technological obsolescence at the \ntime the system becomes operational. If this argument were extended to \nother defense programs, we would never build another bomber, fighter, \nship, or tank. Versions of this argument have been made time and again, \neach time opponents of a major defense program spin up the excuse \nmaking machine.\n  A national missile defense system developed pursuant to the Defend \nAmerica Act will be no more outdated than one developed under the \nClinton administration's 3-plus-3 plan. In fact, it would likely be \nmore modern and technologically sophisticated, given the robust testing \nand focused development called for in this legislation. Under the \nClinton plan, technology development will languish and many companies \nwill soon pull out of the business altogether. Ironically, the \ntechnologies that would be pursued under the Defend America Act are the \nsame ones that the administration is also developing. The main \ndifference is that the Defend America Act would require us to get \nserious rather than sitting on our hands as we have been doing for the \nlast 3 years.\n\n  The best way to ensure that we deploy a modern and operationally \neffective national missile defense system is to get an initial system \nfielded quickly, then upgrade and build upon this first piece as \nnecessary. Contrary to what the President and his nay-saying supporters \nassert, readiness to respond to a threat does not come by keeping \ntechnology bottled up in a laboratory. Anyone familiar with \nmanufacturing and technology development will confirm that the way to \nimprove the state-of-the-art is to get started, gain operational \nknowledge, and then build on this experience in an incremental manner. \nThis is the cost-effective, low-risk approach advocated in the Defend \nAmerica Act.\n  Perhaps the most telling argument made by the opponents of the Defend \nAmerica Act is the assertion that it would threaten arms control. In \nfact, the only thing it threatens is the status quo with respect to the \nABM Treaty. The Defend America Act does call on the President to seek \namendments to the ABM Treaty, which most opponents do not want to see \nhappen. But, since it is awkward for them to be seen as more interested \nin defending an outdated treaty than the American people, other excuses \nhave to be found. Hence the argument that START II might be \njeopardized.\n  But there is no reason why the Defend America Act should in any way \njeopardize START II or United States-Russian relations. Russia already \nhas an operational national missile defense system, so obviously they \ncannot believe that such a deployment is destabilizing. More important, \nduring past negotiations, Russia has demonstrated a clear willingness \nto amend the ABM Treaty. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration is \nonly interested in making the ABM Treaty more restrictive rather than \nfinding a way to loosen its grip on our missile defense programs. The \nfact that the United States and Russia were on the verge of agreeing to \namend the ABM Treaty at the same time as START I was being concluded \nclearly illustrates that keeping the ABM Treaty is its current form is \nnot a prerequisite for concluding strategic arms control agreements. We \nshould remember that it was the Clinton administration and not the \nRussian Federation that ended the negotiations to expand our rights to \ndeploy national missile defense.\n  Mr. President, as I have said many times before, the Defend America \nAct is a balanced and responsible piece of legislation. I am very \ndisappointed that the President is seeking to prevent the Senate from \nvoting on this important bill. If he is opposed to it, it is his right \nto veto it. But the American people deserve to know the President's \nposition. In my view, procedural maneuvers and misleading arguments \nwill not cloak those who seek to keep America defenseless.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the able Senator \nfrom Arizona [Mr. Kyl] at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, for yielding but also for his \nleadership in this area.\n  I think two of the people who we have most to thank for bringing this \nmatter to the attention of the Senate are our majority leader, Bob \nDole, and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator \nThurmond. It is Senator Dole who wanted to ensure that before he left \nthis body we had an opportunity to vote on and pass the Defend America \nAct. I agree with Senator Thurmond that our Senate colleagues ought to \nensure that we\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nhave an opportunity to vote on this important measure by ensuring that \nwe vote for cloture tomorrow when we have that vote. So I appreciate \nSenator Thurmond's leadership on this matter.\n  Mr. President, before I proceed, I ask unanimous consent that Dan \nCiechnowski, who is a fellow in my office, be allowed floor privileges \nduring the pendency of this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me begin by discussing some of the \ndetails of this legislation because I think when our colleagues focus \non precisely what it says, it is awfully hard to disagree with any of \nit. And in fact I cannot imagine that anyone would vote against the \nDefend America Act of 1996 except for purely political reasons. That \nwould be most unfortunate because there is nothing more important that \nthe Senate and the House and the President have as our responsibility \nthan defending America. That is the first obligation of the U.S. \nGovernment. And to continue to allow the situation which currently \nexists, which is that the United States is totally vulnerable to a \nmissile attack by any enemy in the future, is intolerable. We need to \nget about the business of ensuring that we can solve this problem, that \nwe can deploy an effective system for defending against ballistic \nmissiles, and the way to do that is to pass the Defend America Act. It \nis the necessary first step in this effort.\n  Let me begin by noting the provisions of the act itself. And if \nanyone wants to disagree with any of these provisions, I invite them \nhere to the floor to engage in that debate. I do not think anyone can \nlogically disagree with the provisions of this act.\n  Mr. President, people will disagree with other things. They will make \nup an argument about what we are really intending to achieve here, and \nthey will argue against that. It is called red herrings. Or they will \nset up straw men which they will attempt to knock over. They will \nassert that we are trying to reestablish the Reagan administration's \nspace shield to prevent a nuclear attack by the then Soviet Union. That \nis not what this is all about. They will argue about star wars. They \nwill argue about $60 billion expenditures. None of that is what we are \ntalking about here.\n  So I am going to focus specifically on what this act says, and I \nwould ask those who come to argue against it to confine their remarks \nto this act, not some perceived or imaginary piece of legislation that \nthey may wish to defeat but rather that which is before us right now.\n\n  It is called, as I said, the Defend America Act of 1996. Majority \nleader Bob Dole is the sponsor. I can think of no more fitting tribute \nto Bob Dole than for his Senate colleagues to allow us to vote on this \nimportant matter. They can then vote their consciences on whether they \nwant to defend America or not but give the majority leader the right to \nvote on this important proposition.\n  I guarantee you that if we do not have that right, Republican \ncandidate Bob Dole is going to be talking to the American people \nthroughout the length and the breadth of this country to remind them \nthat today the United States has no ability to defend against a \nballistic missile attack by another country.\n  Mr. President, that does not have to come to China and Russia, the \ntwo countries that today have the capability of launching \nintercontinental ballistic missiles against the United States. It can \ncome in the form of an accidental launch from one of those countries or \nanother country. It can come in the form of a limited attack either \nagainst our troops stationed abroad, against our allies, or against \nparts of the United States that are within reach today or soon will be \nwithin the reach of ballistic missiles of other nations like North \nKorea, for example.\n  It is interesting just parenthetically that one of the studies which \nsaid there was no threat to the United States in the near term, that \nis, before the end of the century, relied upon the notion that the \ndefinition of United States was the lower 48 States. Well, as I recall, \nAlaska and Hawaii have been States for some time now and the citizens \nof those States would be a bit surprised to learn that colleagues in \nthe Senate do not think it important to defend that because they are \nnot part of the lower 48.\n  Mr. President, every veteran of World War II knows how the war in the \nPacific started. It was an attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, not even \nthen a State but obviously part of the United States in terms of our \ndefense at risk, and we went to war over that. To suggest that because \nthere is not a threat to the lower 48 States today, we should not begin \nto prepare against the contingency when that threat will exist or to \nprepare to defend other Americans who do not live in the lower 48 \nStates is irresponsible, and therefore I would urge my colleagues, as I \nsaid, to allow us to at least vote on this Defend America Act.\n  Here are the findings in the act. First, that the United States has \nthe technical capability to develop and deploy a national missile \ndefense system.\n  There is no disagreement about this. There is disagreement about \nexactly which system to deploy. The administration has its favorites. \nOthers have their favorites. But there is no disagreement about the \nfact that the technology is here.\n  Second, the threat posed to the United States by the proliferation of \nballistic missiles is growing. The trend is toward longer-range \nmissiles including those with intercontinental reach.\n  Again, intelligence estimates make this point clear, and the \nPresident himself has declared an emergency based upon this threat of \nproliferation.\n  Third, there are ways for determined countries to acquire \nintercontinental ballistic missiles by means other than indigenous \ndevelopment.\n\n  Of course, that is true, and it is an important point to make because \nit is not the threat that a country beginning today will after a period \nof years figure out how to build one of these weapons, but it is also \nthe case that countries around the world are trying very hard to buy \ncomponents and even completed systems from other countries. This is why \nthe sale by either Russia or China of part or whole of a missile system \nor a weapon of mass destruction is so disconcerting because countries \ndo not have to develop them indigenously; they can buy them or buy the \nkey components from other countries, and that is why the threat will \noccur sooner rather than later.\n  Fourth, the deployment by the United States of an NMDS, National \nMissile Defense System, will help to deter countries from seeking long-\nrange missiles.\n  That, too, should be obvious. It is clear that to the extent we have \na defense against such weapons, it does not make sense for another \ncountry to expend a lot of resources to develop those kinds of systems. \nIt is very much one of the reasons why the Soviet Union collapsed and \nwhy the Soviet Union decided at a certain point that it would not be \nable to defeat the United States militarily, notwithstanding its very \nstrong intercontinental ballistic missile system, because Ronald Reagan \nwas preparing to develop and eventually deploy the Strategic Defense \nInitiative, a system which would have been able to thwart such attack--\nnot defeat it completely but to preclude it from succeeding completely \nand therefore allowing the United States the opportunity to respond \nwith our own offensive deterrent capability. And that potential for \ndevelopment of SDI, as it was then called, was enough to cause the \nRussians to throw in the towel with respect to that matter. And it was \none of the reasons why the Soviet Union eventually collapsed.\n  And that is not just me talking. There are several Russians who were \nin power at the time who confirmed the fact. The same thing is true of \nmuch less powerful and less wealthy nations than the Soviet Union of \nold, talking about countries like Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, \ncountries that may well desire to develop these weapons today knowing \nthat we have no defense against them but if we had such a defense would \nperhaps turn their attentions elsewhere.\n  The next point of the bill is that the danger of an accidental \nmissile launch has not disappeared and deployment of an NMD system will \nreduce concerns about this threat. That should be obvious and require \nno further explanation.\n  Next. Deployment of an NMD system can enhance stability in the post-\ncold-war era. The United States and Russia\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\nshould welcome the opportunity to reduce reliance on threats of nuclear \nretaliation as the sole basis of stability.\n  This should be obvious, Mr. President, but it is interesting, and \neven paradoxical, I would say, that there are still some people in the \nGovernment and perhaps even here in the Congress who believe we are \nmore stable in an unstable environment than we are in a stable \nenvironment.\n  That may sound counterintuitive, but there used to be an argument \nthat if we were very vulnerable to an attack and if our opponent at \nthat time, the Soviet Union, was also very vulnerable to an attack, \nthat neither one of us would dare to attack each other. It was called \n``mutual assured destruction.'' If they would attack us, then we would \nattack them, and we would both destroy each other. Some people believe \nthat was one of the factors that precluded either country from \nattacking the other during the cold war, and it may have had some \nimpact.\n  But that is no longer the situation we face today, Mr. President. \nThere is no longer a Soviet Union threatening to destroy the United \nStates, and certainly we have no pretensions in that regard. There is a \nRussia with a lot of nuclear weapons, some of which could, by mistake, \nbe launched against the United States; some of which could, by mistake, \nfind their way to the hands of people who are not very friendly to us. \nCertainly the Chinese are developing weapons that they do not have a \nneed to develop.\n  But the real threat today is from countries arrayed around the world \nthat would do us harm, that have foreign policy interests inimical to \nours, and that would use these weapons as threats. They are weaker \ncountries than ours. We do not have to worry about them attacking us \nwith these missiles in order to defeat us militarily. That is not the \npoint. The concern is they would use these missiles in order to thwart \nus from achieving our foreign policy goals.\n  For example, we know 5 years ago during the time of the gulf war, the \nvote in Congress to try to kick Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait was a very \nclose vote in both the House and the Senate. Among the concerns people \nhad was the threat of loss of life to the U.S. military in trying to \nrepel Saddam Hussein. If we had known at that time that Saddam had a \nnuclear weapon capability and the missiles to deliver those weapons--\nnot just to the United States but, let us say, to Israel, to London, to \nRome, to Paris, to Cairo, wherever--would the United States Congress, \nknowing that, have then decided to vote to use military force to repel \nSaddam Hussein? I think it is a very close question, and I am not \ncertain what the answer would have been.\n  Put it another way. Would the European allies who joined what was \nthen called the ``grand coalition of nations'' to defeat Saddam \nHussein, knowing he had weapons that could reach their capital cities, \nwould they have been as willing to come to the aid of Kuwait in that \ninstance? I think the answer is obvious.\n  The point is that countries who would use these weapons today would \nuse them, not in an all-out attack on the United States--nobody is \nsuggesting that--but as a means, in effect, of blackmailing the United \nStates. The most recent expression of this was a Chinese leader who \nsaid, with respect to the desire of the United States to come to the \naid of Taiwan, ``You better think twice about this, because we really \ndo not think that Taiwan is as important to you as the lives of the \npeople in Los Angeles.'' Would the United States be willing to go to \nwar to protect Taiwan if it knew that China would launch a missile \nagainst the people of Los Angeles?\n  Well, it causes you to think. Any President of the United States \nwould have to think very, very carefully about asking the Congress for \nauthority to use force in a situation that did not directly involve the \nUnited States if the force that we were attempting to take action \nagainst, or might take action against, if that country had a nuclear \nweapon or a chemical or biological weapon that could be delivered to a \nUnited States city or to the city of an ally in Europe or some other \nplace in the world. That is the threat that currently exists and that \nwill exist in the near term before those missiles have the capability \nof hitting the United States.\n\n  And, yes, Alaska and Hawaii are a part of the United States. The \nNorth Korean missile will be able to hit those States before it will be \nable to hit, I suppose, California or Arizona or Idaho. But that is \nstill part of the United States, and therefore the threat is sooner and \ncloser, not farther away.\n  In any event, I think it is fairly clear that both the United States \nand Russia should welcome the opportunity to reduce the reliance on \nthreats of nuclear retaliation as the sole basis of stability, because \nit is not realistic to expect that the United States would obliterate \nthe people of Iraq, for example, with nuclear weapons if Saddam were to \nengage in some other act of aggression in the Middle East today. It is \njust not realistic to expect that the United States would do that.\n  Finally, the authors of the ABM Treaty envisioned the need to change \nthe treaty as circumstances changed, and they provide the mechanisms to \ndo so in the treaty. We note that in the findings of the Defend America \nAct. Then we say the United States and Russia previously considered \nsuch changes and should do so again.\n  As we note later on in the act, it may be necessary for us to \napproach the Russians to discuss questions of amending the ABM Treaty \nso that both of our nations will be free of the constraints currently \nimposed by that treaty that do not permit us to defend ourselves \nagainst missile attack, or at least adequately defend ourselves.\n  Next we come to the National Missile Defense Policy. There are two \nspecific policy goals stated in the act. The first is the deployment by \nthe end of the year 2003--that is 8 years from now--of an NMD system--\n\n       . . . capable of providing a highly-effective defense of \n     the territory of the United States against limited, \n     unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks; and\n       (2) [which] will be augmented over time to provide a \n     layered defense against larger and more sophisticated \n     ballistic missile threats as they emerge.\n\n  The second goal or policy is:\n\n       . . . cooperative transition to a regime that does not \n     feature an offensive-only form of deterrence as the basis for \n     strategic stability.\n\n  Let me take them in reverse order. The second is one I already \ndiscussed, cooperatively transitioning to a situation in which the \npowers of the world are not engaged in threats against each other as \nthe method by which to deter an attack against them; the idea that if \nyou attack us, we will attack you. There ought to be a more humane and \nlogical way of keeping peace in the world, and that is to have the \ncapability of defending ourselves as the best way of deterring an \nattack.\n  That is so for an additional reason that should be obvious, but I \nwill simply note it quickly. There are a lot of regimes in the world \ntoday that do not have the stability and the interest in peace that the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union had during the cold war. As \nbelligerent as we believed the Soviet Union was, we recognized that it \nwas led by rational people who understood the enormous power of nuclear \nweapons and the devastation and the tragedy that could be loosed on \nthe world if they were ever to pull the trigger of those weapons. That \nis why they were not used.\n\n  That same cannot be said for some of the leaders today. There are \npeople in the world today, leaders who have already said that, if they \nhad the ballistic missile capability, they would use it against the \nUnited States. Mu'ammar Qadhafi of Libya is one such person who has \nsaid precisely that. I think there is no doubt that countries led by \nthe current leaders of Iraq, Iran, and perhaps other nations--North \nKorea is certainly not a stable nation today either and other countries \ncould evolve in the future--do not have the same degree of stability \nthat the United States and the Soviet Union had in the past. To rely \nupon the idea of deterrence without defense, given these kinds of \nregimes loose in the world today, is clearly not in the best interests \nof the people of the United States.\n  Let me get to the first of the policy goals, because there is some \ndisagreement about this goal. It has really three components to it. \nFirst of all, deployment by the end of the year 2003 of an NMD system. \nOpponents say 2003 is too specific, it is too soon, we really need more \ntime. If we had more time we could develop an even better system.\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am guilty of that same kind of logic when it comes \nto buying computers. There is going to be a better computer 6 months \nfrom now and a year from now. If we maintain that point of view, of \ncourse, we would never buy a computer. I know the same thing is true \nabout cars. It is true about virtually everything in our technology \narea today. But when it comes to defending ourselves against ballistic \nmissile attack, when the threat is here and now and certainly will be \nbefore us by the year 2003, I do not think it makes sense to say let us \nwait a little longer because better technology will come along in the \nfuture.\n  Sure it will. That is why we say in the act that we should deploy a \nsystem by the year 2003 with the capability of adding additional layers \nand technology as time goes on and as threats evolve. That is precisely \nwhy we say let us start now with something that is relatively simple \nand have the capability of making it more robust as the threats further \nclarify and emerge and as we have the capability of doing so.\n  What is the capability that people argue about? We say deployment by \nthe end of 2003 of an NMD system capable of providing a highly \neffective defense of U.S. territory. Any argument about that, providing \na highly effective defense of U.S. territory?\n\n       . . . against limited, unauthorized or accidental ballistic \n     missile attacks;\n\n  Is there any reason why we should not provide defense against those \nthree things? Are they all three legitimate threats? Yes, any \nintelligence source will identify ``limited, unauthorized or accidental \nballistic missile attacks'' threats in the near term.\n  The third principle is:\n\n       . . . and will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense as larger and more sophisticated threats emerge.\n\n  Precisely as I said before: The goal is to employ what we can at the \ntime a limited threat is before us, to be able to meet that threat and \nthen build on that system as our capabilities increase and as threats \nmight later emerge. Those are the two policy goals in the bill.\n  What do we call for in terms of architecture? There has been a lot of \ncriticism of the bill on the ground it is going to cost too much. That \nis literally untrue, because the bill does not identify a particular \nsystem. It is like going to a broker, as Majority Leader Bob Dole has \nsaid. I go to a real estate broker and say, ``I would like to buy a \nhouse.'' The broker says, ``I can get you one for $40,000 or I can get \nyou one for $4 million. Which do you want?''\n  Obviously, there is a big range between $40,000 and $4 million in \nhouses, just as there is a big range in the kind of thing we could buy \nhere to defend ourselves, and it certainly depends on the kind of \nthreat we see emerging, the degree of our technology we want to put in \nplace at any given time and a variety of other factors.\n  What we said is the President should decide. So if the President and \nhis supporters claim it is going to cost too much, it is because they \nchoose a system that is going to cost too much, because the bill allows \nthe President to decide which system to buy and which system to deploy.\n  You cannot have it both ways, Mr. President. You cannot say you want \nthe ability to decide which system and then also say that it is going \nto cost too much. If it costs too much, it is only because you bought \none that costs too much.\n  But the reality is, we are all pretty much agreed on what we need, \nand it is not too expensive. My guess is it will be less than $2 \nbillion a year for the next 10 years out of a defense budget of $265 \nbillion each year. That is not too much to pay to protect the American \npeople from attack.\n  In any event, what we call for here is components which would be \ndeveloped for deployment and would include the following things:\n\n       (1) An interceptor system that optimizes defensive coverage \n     of the United States . . .\n\n  Obviously, you want to optimize coverage. A single ground site would \nnot optimize coverage. That is all that is allowed by the ABM Treaty, \nand that is why we have to deal with the ABM Treaty later on. We say it \ncan be either ground based, sea based or space based, or any \ncombination of these basing modes.\n  Typically, the criticism of the Missile Defense Act is we are talking \nabout star wars, a massive shield of space-based satellites that would \nprotect the United States from any conceivable attack. That is what was \ncontemplated back during the cold war when the threat from the Soviet \nUnion required us to develop that degree of protection. That is no \nlonger necessary. Nobody is talking about that, and that is why we \nsay either ground based, sea based or space based, or any combination \nof these.\n\n  Probably what would be developed first is a sea-based system or a \nground-based system, and then later they would be integrated. The only \ncomponents in space, at least to begin with, is the satellite that \ndetects the launch. We already have that, and everyone agrees that we \nneed to have a satellite in space that can detect a launch, wherever it \nmight occur, and communicate the information about that launch to the \nsystem, whichever it is, sea-based or ground-based.\n  Obviously, we need fixed-based ground radars. If we have a sea-based \nsystem, we also need radars on our Aegis cruisers. We already have \nthem, so that is a zero-cost investment. We have 40-plus Aegis cruisers \nand destroyers out there with this radar already on there, and fixed \nground-based radars already exist.\n  We need space based, including a space and missile tracking system. \nThis is a satellite that would be able to detect a launch and \ncommunicate that information as it tracks the adversary's missile \nthrough space.\n  Finally, battle management, command, control, and communications. \nEverybody understands the need for that.\n  Those are the components. Nothing new there, nothing wild, nothing \nexorbitant, no space shield, as some people have suggested.\n  Section 5 of the bill talks about implementation of the National \nMissile Defense System and specifies certain actions that the Secretary \nof Defense must take in implementing the NMD policy. This is an area \nwhere there is some disagreement, because we say specifically the \nPresident should initiate actions necessary to meet the deployment \ngoal. That includes conducting by the end of 1998 an integrated systems \ntest. This is one of the milestones, one of the mileposts, along with \nactually deploying a system that would need to be achieved in order to \nachieve the deployment by the year 2003.\n  We talk about using streamlined acquisition procedures. I do not know \nwho can disagree with that. That will certainly save money and time.\n  Finally, we talk about developing a follow-on NMD program. Some \nopponents find this, and say, ``Aha, we finally discovered the problem \nwith your Defend America Act, because you require a follow-on NMD \nprogram.''\n  All that means is we are not going to freeze everything in place and \nforget about the development of future threats. We are going to provide \nfor the technology to meet those threats as they evolve. That is all \nthat means.\n  Section 6 of the bill requires a report on the plan for NMD \ndevelopment and deployment. It requires the Secretary of Defense to \nsubmit a report to Congress by March 15, 1997, which addresses the \nfollowing matters:\n  First, the Secretary's plan for implementing the NMD policy, \nincluding a description and discussion of the NMD architecture \nselected. That should not be any problem.\n  Second, the Secretary's estimate of the cost associated with the NMD. \nTell us how much the system you choose is going to cost.\n  Third, an analysis of follow-on options. We need that to evaluate \nproperly what we are going to have to spend and develop in the future.\n  Finally, a point at which NMD development would conflict with the ABM \nTreaty. This is very important, because some people rightly say there \nis a point beyond which the United States could be in violation of the \nABM Treaty if we deploy a system that is capable of defending us.\n\n  That is true. Unfortunately, the irony is the only kind of system \nthat is permitted under the treaty today probably would not defend the \nentire United States, at least very effectively, at least against much \nof a threat. That is why most everyone agrees we need more than a \nsingle site, land-based system. To do that, we have to reopen the ABM \nTreaty, and that gets us into section 7, policy regarding the ABM \nTreaty.\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\n  Let me back up. The bill itself notes there is already in the ABM \nTreaty a policy established for amending and otherwise dealing with \nchanges to the treaty. They include the following:\n  We would urge the President to pursue high-level discussions with \nRussia to amend the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty allows for its \namendment.\n  Second, any amendment must be submitted for advice and consent to the \nSenate. Everyone knows that.\n  Third, the bill calls for the President and the Congress to withdraw \nfrom the treaty if amendments are not produced within 1 year. That, \ntoo, is called for in the ABM Treaty. If it is in the interest of the \nUnited States to withdraw from the treaty because we have not been able \nto amend it to our satisfaction, then we have that right under the \ntreaty.\n  What the bill calls for is a longer period of time, 1 year, than the \ntreaty itself calls for, 6 months. So, Mr. President, I do not see how \nanyone could object to the language in the Defend America Act that says \nwe tried to amend the treaty, if we need to, and if we cannot, then \nafter a year withdraw from it. Frankly, I would be in favor withdrawing \nearlier than a year, but we provide that much leeway to the President \nof the United States.\n  I have now described the act, Mr. President. What is there to \ndisagree with here? The only thing, as I said, I think a reasonable \nperson could disagree with is the specifying of the year 2003 for the \nactual deployment of a system, and on that reasonable people could \ndiffer.\n  Should it be 2003? Should it be the year 2000? Should it be the year \n2005? Or should it be a flexible date? Reasonable people can differ \nabout that.\n  As to everything else in here, I fail to see how any reasonable \nperson interested in the defense of the United States could find \ndisagreement with the words of this act. I really challenge my \ncolleagues to come down here and point out what they would disagree \nwith except for this date of 2003.\n\n  Let me address that again just a little bit. As I said before, one of \nthe arguments is if we lock that date in we will be locking in \ntechnology. That is true with any system that we ever have purchased on \ndefense. But sometimes threats are upon us and we have to go with what \nwe have.\n  We have been working on missile defense for a long time. In fact, one \nof the criticisms of the missile defense program is we have been \nspending $30 billion on this for well over a decade. That is true. And \ncritics say we do not have anything to show for it. That is not true. \nWe have a lot to show for it.\n  We have a lot of technology that is just ready to be developed and \ndeployed if somebody will just let us do it. That is what this act \nfinally says: You have been critical of us for spending the money and \nnot developing or deploying it. All right. Agree with us that we are \ngoing to get on with the job.\n  The only way to do that is to specify a date, because if we do not, \nMr. President, we will continue to go on and on and on and on without \never deploying, always saying, ``Well, there's something just right \naround the corner that is even better.'' It is a Catch-22 for those of \nus who support missile defense. We say, ``OK, we'll wait for something \nbetter.'' And our critics say, ``You haven't deployed any, and you've \ngone at it for 15 years and spent $30 billion.''\n  Mr. President, my point is, let us set a date, take the technology we \nhave in hand, which is very good, and plenty good to defeat the kind of \nmissile technology that would be used against us in the foreseeable \nfuture, and deploy a system that we know we can deploy. We have done \nthis with weapons systems that we have acquired throughout the last \nseveral decades.\n  Many of the systems we have acquired have the built-in capability of \nbeing upgraded to more robust or sophisticated systems as time goes on. \nThat is precisely what we call for in the Missile Defense Act. Let us \nstart with what we can build by the year 2003, and, as we say, as \ntechnology improves and the threat evolves, we will have follow-on \nsystems.\n  Some opponents of the act have objected to the act because it allows \nus to do that or calls upon the Congress and the President to do that. \nBut it clearly is nothing more than good sense. And it is really the \nsame argument that opponents have used against us saying, well, there \nwill be better technology later on. That is right. So let us make sure \nthe system we deploy has the capability of taking advantage of that \ntechnology as we develop it.\n  Mr. President, there is another advantage to actually getting a \ndeadline in the statute. It focuses the planning efforts. It breeds \nefficiency because it gives the defense planners a specific time line \nfor developing and for doing the research, for doing the testing and \nthen for acquiring, actually bending the metal, as they say, for \nacquiring the systems and for getting them deployed.\n  If you do not have a specific deadline, you never have this kind of \nefficiency, you never have the certainty of the schedule that is \nrequired for the researchers and the contractors to get along with the \njob, let alone the procurement officers in the Department of Defense. \nSo you need a deadline. We have this with every other weapons system \nthat we procure. We have specific dates, specific time lines and we \nachieve our goal by developing those time lines with a certainty at the \nend. If you do not have a specific date, you are never going to get \nthere, at least not in any efficient way.\n\n  Finally, I argue that specifying a date for development, and \nselecting the date of 2003, is probably the best way for us to prevent \nthe development and deployment of ballistic missiles by these rogue \nnations that we fear, nations that cannot ever defeat us militarily, \nbut certainly nations who can thwart our conduct of foreign policy and \ncan do us great harm and do harm to our allies and forces deployed \nabroad.\n  If we actually make it clear that we are committed to deploying a \nsystem, let us say by the year 2003, then I think that nations that are \nnot very wealthy and that have a hard time acquiring the components or \nthe completed systems will perhaps turn their attention to other \nmethods for trying to throw their weight around. But as long as they \nknow that nobody in the world is committed to deploying a system by any \nparticular time, there is no reason for them not to proceed with their \nplans to buy the missiles or to develop the missiles and to develop the \nwarheads that go on them, whether they be nuclear, biological, or \nchemical. And that is why we want to specify this date of 2003.\n  There has been recently an argument about the cost. And it is too bad \nthat this argument had to come at the time that it did because it is a \ntotally bogus argument, yet I know some of our opponents will use it \nagainst us. It is the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the cost \nof such a system.\n  But if you read the analysis carefully, rather than just spouting the \nrhetoric of those who oppose a ballistic missile defense system, if you \nread the analysis carefully, you realize that CBO did not say that the \nsystem would cost somewhere between $40 and $60 billion or $14 and $40 \nbillion or whatever the figures people like to throw around. What the \nCBO said was, well, it all depends on what you buy. If you buy \neverything that has ever been talked about, something that nobody is \nproposing, you could even spend up to $60 billion. My guess is you \ncould spend more than that if you really wanted to buy everything that \nanybody had ever talked about.\n  But the cold war is over. We are not talking about that anymore. I \nread you the Missile Defense Act. We are not suggesting a space shield, \nso we are not talking about the system that could cost that kind of \nmoney.\n  Instead, what the CBO said with respect to what we are really talking \nabout is this. I want to quote from the CBO analysis. We are talking \nabout an initial defense. I will quote.\n\n       This initial defense would cost $14 billion, about $8.5 \n     billion for the ground-based system and $5 billion for the \n     SMTS space-based sensors. The ground-based system could cost \n     roughly $4 billion less if the Air Force's proposal for a \n     Minuteman-based system was adopted.\n\n  They should have said ``were adopted.'' Then they go on to discuss \nother kinds of options.\n  The point is, that it all depends which house you choose to buy, as \nthe majority leader analogized here. Do you want to buy the $40,000 \nhouse, the $80,000 house, the $150,000 house? Do you want to buy five \nhouses at $4 million each?\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\n  What the CBO said was, well, if you bought everybody's idea of a neat \nhouse, it would cost a lot of money, might cost $60 billion. We are not \ntalking about that. Let us not have any rhetoric from the opponents of \nthis bill that it could cost up to $60 billion. CBO itself says what we \nare talking about would cost $14 billion. Mr. President, actually the \nadministration has said that it would be less than that. The Secretary \nof Defense has said the system that they like would cost $5 billion.\n\n  I do not know whether it is $5 billion or $14 billion or something in \nbetween. In fact, they note it actually could be $4 billion less if the \nMinuteman-based system was adopted. That would be $10 billion. I do not \nknow which of these figures is correct. But we are talking about \ndeploying a system over the next 8 years or so.\n  If you divide $10 billion into 8 years, that is a little over $1 \nbillion a year. That is hardly something that we cannot afford in the \n$265 billion defense budget when we are talking about protecting the \nlives of Americans and conducting our foreign policy without being \nblackmailed by these tinhorn dictators around the world.\n  So I think with respect to cost we should understand that we are \ntalking about a system that is probably in the neighborhood of $5 to \n$10 billion, maybe $14 billion, maybe $20 billion at the most to do it \nthe right way, but $14 billion according to the CBO's suggestion of an \ninitial deployment.\n  I also note that CBO, in its estimates, apparently included O \ncosts, operations and maintenance costs for a period of 10 years in \nsome of their estimates. That is not ordinarily used to calculate the \ncost of acquiring any weapon systems. You understand both the \nacquisition cost and you understand the cost of acquiring it and \noperating it for 10 years; but ordinarily you do not describe as the \nacquisition cost the additional costs of O for another 10 years, \nwhich is what apparently CBO did. So one better be very careful about \nthrowing these numbers of the CBO estimate around, Mr. President. They \ndo not support the argument that this is too expensive.\n  Anybody that wants to make that argument is going to have to answer \nto the American people the first time that Americans are killed because \nsomebody has launched a missile against them, and answer the question \nwhat price their lives were worth.\n  As a matter of fact, let us just stop and think for a moment, Mr. \nPresident. It was only 5 years ago that 28 Americans were killed by a \nballistic missile launched by Saddam Hussein during the Persian Gulf \nwar. The largest number of Americans killed in a single attack, 28 \nAmericans died because we could not defend against a ballistic missile.\n  That was in a theater that was far away. That was in a war that we \nwere fighting. But let us move it just a little bit further out. We \ncould not protect our own military. We could not protect the people of \nIsrael who took scud hit after scud hit because the Patriots could not \nknock them down. In the future we are not going to protect the people \nin Rome or London or Paris or Moscow or Anchorage or Honolulu or in \nSouth Korea or Japan or any number of places around the world that we \nwill want to defend and will not have the capability of defending. Now, \nwhat price are those lives worth?\n\n  Let me proceed just a little bit more with respect to the cost item, \nsince I am informed Senator Nunn will be here in about 15 minutes and \nhe will have some comments to make on this act. I will proceed to \ndiscuss some of the arguments that have been raised against it that I \nwas going to refer to later.\n  One of the arguments is that the language in the bill that discusses \nthe ABM Treaty is really tantamount to an anticipatory breach of the \ntreaty. This concerns some people greatly because they also believe if \nwe proceed to defend ourselves, people in Russia will begin acting very \nirresponsibly with respect to START I and START II, and they may not \neven ratify START II. It has been predicted they will begin violating \nthe START I treaty that both countries are already bound by.\n  Mr. President, I have two basic things to say about this. First, this \nkind of argument is reminiscent of the cold war. It was the argument \nbetween those who wanted appeasement on the one hand and those who \nbelieved in peace through strength on the other hand. Appeasement was \nno stranger at the time of the cold war, but I thought everyone learned \nthe lesson of Munich. Neville Chamberlain, who believed in his heart he \nhad won peace in our time after he came back from Munich, we now know \nthat the concessions that were made by the allies at that time to Adolf \nHitler, the appeasement of Hitler was what created the appetite for him \nto take even more and finally go beyond the point that the allies could \nendure. That is how World War II began.\n  There were then those in the cold war era who felt if we just gave \nthe Soviets what they wanted, if we appeased them, everything would be \nright. What we found, every act of appeasement led to another act of \naggression, and it was only when we began to confront aggression with \nstrength, with resolve, with courage, with willpower, with defense, \nthat the aggressor said, ``OK, we did not really want that after all.''\n  Finally, through the development of our defense forces in the early \n1980's, the focus on developing a defense against ballistic missiles, \nthe resolve demonstrated through President Reagan's famous peace \nthrough strength, our adversary realized it could not defeat us \nmilitarily. President Gorbachev, to his credit, knew he could not \ndefeat us economically, that the political system they developed, \ncombined with the economics of that system, were insufficient to \nsustain the kind of effort that would be needed to bury us, as \nKhrushchev said.\n  That is why the Soviet Union fell. Appeasement never worked. Strength \ndid. The argument that if we do not do what the Russians want, \neverything will be bad, goes back to that old idea, that old philosophy \nof appeasement. It has been said if we even talk about amending the ABM \nTreaty, the Russians will violate START I, they will not destroy all \nthe missiles they promised to destroy, that the Russian Duma will not \nratify START II.\n  We will take each of those things. First of all, the United States \nhas already suggested the possibility of amending the ABM Treaty to the \nRussians, and we had conversations with them about it. They did not \nwalk away and say, ``This is absolutely nuts. We will never do that.'' \nThis was done during the Bush administration.\n  Second, there are ongoing discussions today about changes to the \nmeaning of the ABM Treaty as circumstances have changed. In fact, there \nare ongoing discussions in Geneva and elsewhere about the exact \ndefinition of strategic missiles that can be defended against under the \nABM Treaty. It is not as if this thing was written in stone, never to \nbe changed or even considered for modification. The cold war is over. \nCircumstances have changed. It is going to have to be changed, if not \nscrapped altogether, as threats and circumstances change. That is only \nright. Only those who do not understand the cold war is over would \nargue the ABM Treaty should never be changed.\n\n  The next point, that the Russians actually will violate the START I \nTreaty if we talk about changing the ABM Treaty, Mr. President, the \nRussians have, in fact, already violated several treaties. They do not \nneed us to talk about amending the ABM Treaty to do that. I think we \nneed to separate the two. There is no direct linkage, and there should \nnot be.\n  The point is, the Russians will do what they think is in their best \ninterest. If the United States makes it clear to the Russians it is in \ntheir best interest to continue to comply with START I and to talk to \nus about making changes in the ABM Treaty, they will do that. As a \nresponsible country, I believe that Russia will be responsible in \npursuing that course of action with us. If the Russians decide not to \nratify the START II Treaty because they do not think it is in their \nnational interest, there is nothing we can do to stop them from that.\n  I do not think by stopping any discussion of defending ourselves \nagainst ballistic missile attack it will make one bit of difference. I \ncould quote numerous Russians who made the statement the reason that \nthe Duma would not proceed to ratify START II does not have anything to \ndo with the START II Treaty but has to do with what they perceive the \ncosts to be and what they perceive their national interests to be. \nTherefore, I think it is\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\nfoolish for us to believe we have that much control over what the \nRussian Duma does, that if we begin talking about changing the ABM \nTreaty, it will cause them to change their plans. I do not think that \nis correct. In any event, if it were, what that would argue for is the \nUnited States could never do anything in our national interest to \nprotect our citizens because it might cause some irresponsible Russians \nto act in a way inimical both to their interests and ours. I do not \nthink that is logical.\n  In addition to this, Mr. President, it is not as if we are breaching \nthe ABM Treaty. As I noted, the ABM Treaty allows for amendment. It is \nlike the Constitution. We all say we should be very careful about \namending the Constitution. It is a pretty sacred document, true. But we \nhave amended it because it has within it the means of amending it. Our \nFounding Fathers knew it was not a perfect document for all time, that \nwe might want to make changes to it. Who were the first group to make \nchanges? Our Founding Fathers. They adopted the Bill of Rights.\n  The ABM Treaty, which has existed now for over 20 years, I daresay is \nnot as sacrosanct as the U.S. Constitution. It could be amended, and \ntherefore it provides within its terms for amendment as time goes on.\n  Many would argue that actually the treaty no longer exists because \nthe country with whom it was negotiated no longer exists; namely, the \nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, the U.S.S.R., no longer is. Some \nsay Russia acceded to interests. That may or may not be under \ninternational law. But it is a change, an amendment, to reflect changed \ncircumstances. You cannot deny that.\n  In addition to that, in addition to allowing for amendment, the \ntreaty allows for withdrawal if it is in the United States' interest. \nAll we have to do under the treaty is give notice that 6 months later \nwe will withdraw, and we can walk away from the treaty. That is what \nthe treaty itself provides for.\n\n  Why would people be critical of the Defend America Act, which \nspecifically says, in order not to cause a violation of the ABM Treaty, \nwe should begin discussion with the Russians now, telling them of our \ndesire to develop a ballistic missile defense, of the fact that there \nmay be circumstances under which it would run counter to the terms of \nthe ABM Treaty, and therefore suggesting we sit down and talk with the \nRussians about ways to modify the treaty to accommodate the kind of \ndefenses both of our countries are going to need in the future. What is \nwrong with that? That is not an anticipatory breach. That is not saying \nwe will violate the law sometime in the future and have a cause of \naction against us today. That is a real, genuine effort on our part to \nbe totally upfront and say we will have to make some changes sooner or \nlater, probably, so will you not sit down with us and talk about what \nthe changes might be.\n  If, for some reason, the Russians absolutely will not talk to us, the \nact says that the President still has a year--not 6 months, as the \ntreaty provides, but an entire year--within which to seek these \nnegotiations and withdraw at the end of that year if the Russians have \nnot been willing to talk to us, that withdrawal being based upon the \nprovisions of the treaty itself, allowing withdrawal in the national \ninterests of the United States.\n  The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, has already \ndeclared a national emergency based upon the ballistic missile threat. \nIf there is a national emergency, then certainly the conditions exist \nunder which we could withdraw from the treaty if we desire to. No one \nis suggesting that at this point. My point is, simply, that it is not \nan anticipatory breach for us to pass this law. Anyone who argues to \nthe contrary, really seriously, Mr. President, has not read the \nlanguage of the Defend America Act. It does not call for anticipatory \nbreach.\n  I have already dealt with the argument that this is just a straw \nhorse from the Reagan era of the star wars system. That is not what we \nare talking about. I had to read the language of the act to make the \npoint. I do not doubt there will be some who have not bothered to read \nit and who will come here and talk of star wars and space shield and \nthe rest. Remember what I said, Mr. President, they are simply setting \nup a straw man to knock down. It is not what we are talking about here.\n  There has been some question about the threat and when the threat \nwill actually evolve. There is much that could be said about this, some \nof which I will reserve for a little bit later on. I do not think that \nanyone would credibly deny that by the year 2003, there is a \nsignificant probability that threats will exist beyond the acknowledged \nthreat that exists today from either Russia or China.\n  Now, there is a question about when the North Koreans will actually \nbe able to reach the continental United States and whether \n``continental'' means the lower 48, or Alaska, or Hawaii. I really do \nnot think it matters much. Clearly, by about the year 2003, the North \nKoreans will have a missile that is able to reach South Korea, Japan, \nthe Philippines and, possibly, Alaska and Hawaii. That ought to be \nenough, Mr. President. For those who say, ``Well, let us wait until the \nthreat is there to develop the system,'' I say, at that point it will \nbe a little too late. Until you can develop and deploy a system, you \nare susceptible to the blackmail that a regime like that could visit \nupon you.\n  I do not doubt that if the same leaders who control North Korea today \nare in power at that point, it could create great mischief if we did \nnot have a means of defending ourselves.\n  With respect to that threat, many things can be said. I have to begin \nby saying that the year 2003 being 7 years down the road is certainly a \npoint at which we ought to be prepared to defend against a threat from \ncountries like North Korea, even if we are not concerned about a threat \nfrom Russia or China today--particularly an accidental launch from one \nof those countries. The national intelligence estimate, which is touted \nby some, suggesting that the threat will not occur for 10 or 15 years \ndoes not support that proposition. It only supports the proposition \nthat if a country started today and began to indigenously develop a \nweapon, that it might take that long before they could do it. As we \nknow, that is not the way most nations acquire the weapons. They buy \nthem, for instance, from Russia, China, or North Korea. If they cannot \nbuy a complete system, they buy components from whomever, and they put \nthem together. The Iraqi scuds were done like that. So if you calculate \nthe time it takes a country to buy a space-launch capability, which is \njust as effective as a ballistic missile war fighting capability, or \ncomponents of a system to put it together, it is clear that numerous \nnations do not mean us any good in the world, and they could develop \nthe systems before the year 2003.\n  I also make the point that the United States has a history--an \nunfortunate history--of turning a blind eye to reality and the facts \nbecause we are a peace-loving Nation. We do not like to assume others \nwould do us harm, at least in a sneaky fashion. But Pearl Harbor is the \nbest example of where intelligence pointed the way directly and \nspecifically to a threat. If we had been more suspicious or cynical of \nthe Japanese at that time, we would have probably understood that that \nwas a very real threat and would have been better prepared to deal with \nit. But we were not. It was our own fault, in many respects.\n  That same thing could be said about the situation today. It will be \nour own fault if some nation decides to be very sneaky about the way it \ndevelops a weapon and deploys that weapon against us. Iraq, we know, \nwas much more capable than we ever had any reason to expect 5 years \nago. We now know that. We know that other countries are seeking to \nacquire this technology, such as North Korea, the Iranians, and so on. \nYet, somehow we just try to delude ourselves into thinking that maybe \neverything will be all right, that we really will not have to worry \nabout it, so let us not bother to worry about it until we are sure the \nthreat is there.\n  Well, Mr. President, at that point it is too late; the horse is out \nof the barn. The unfortunate thing about that analogy is that it does \nnot begin to describe the horrors that could be visited upon people if \nwe wait until it is literally too late. I would rather be a year too \nearly and maybe spend a little bit more money than we had to, and maybe \nlock in technology a little bit earlier, than\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nI would be to be a year too late because, frankly, at that point, no \none knows what the harm would be, whether it would be an actual attack, \nor whether it would be simply thwarting important foreign policy goals \nof the Western alliance because we did not have the weapons to stop a \nballistic missile attack.\n\n  As I said, Mr. President, I will defer discussion of this threat \nbecause I really do not think that reasonable opponents to the Defend \nAmerica Act will argue that there is no potential threat there. They \nmay argue that it may not be as serious by the year 2003 as I think it \nmight be, but I do not think anybody could credibly argue that the \nthreat is not there. We can quote the former CIA Directors. Jim Woolsey \nmade the point very clear. I will note, Mr. President, that as recently \nas May 31, the Washington Times carried two stories that I thought \nwere, frankly, very distressing. The lower story said, ``Woolsey \nDisputes Clinton Missile Threat Assessment.'' He was President \nClinton's first Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. This \narticle from the Associated Press points out in numerous ways the areas \nin which former CIA Director Jim Woolsey believes that the Clinton \nadministration is underestimating this missile threat in an effort not \nto go forward with the Ballistic Missile Defense Act.\n  The other headline is, ``White House Misled Joint Chiefs on ABM \nTreaty Talks.'' I understand there was a letter written around May 1 by \none or more of the Joint Chiefs that says, ``We really do not need this \nDefend America Act.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \nnewspaper article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this makes the point that the Joint Chiefs \nwere misled. They were basically told that the administration was not \ngoing to go forward with certain plans, that there were not changes \nbeing contemplated to the ABM Treaty that, in fact, were being \ncontemplated, that there were not limitations being placed upon certain \nof our systems. And as a result, they could clearly have been lulled \ninto the belief that we did not need the kind of Missile Defense Act we \nare talking about now. I suggest that if all of the information is \nknown to all of the people concerned, we will be much more serious \nabout going forward with a missile defense plan.\n  Finally with respect to this point, I note that the President himself \nhas recently begun to talk about the need for missile defense. Some say \nthat this is a political reaction to Bob Dole's leadership on the \nissue. It may be. But I will acknowledge that the President, as well as \nthe rest of us, is interested in defending the American people. \nWhichever is the case, the President has acknowledged the threat. So we \nare only arguing about exactly when the threat will materialize. The \nPresident's position is that we might be able to wait a little longer \nand deploy a system a little after 2003 and still get by. He may be \nright. But my point is, is it worth the risk?\n  When we have the technology, we have spent the money and--as a matter \nof fact, if we talk about a sea-based system, we have the aegis \ncruisers, and they have the radars, and they already have the \nsatellites in space which can detect a launch, and we have basically \nhalf of the standard missile on these ships. We simply have to put the \nsecond part of the missile on with the components on the tip of it to \nenable us to hone in and guide the missile to be intercepted. That is \nall we are talking about developing with respect to that system. We \nhave proceeded significantly along with the development of the THAAD \nprogram.\n\n  No, Mr. President, the problem is that if there is a problem with \ndeploying these systems, it is, as Senator Thurmond said earlier, that \nthe administration, year after year after year--all 4 years--has \nsubmitted budgets where the administration has sought to reduce the \namount of expenditure for missile defense, and specifically for the \nnational missile defense. They have been willing to go forward with the \ntactical missile defense, to a degree, but not to the degree called for \nin the legislation we have passed and the President has signed. He does \nnot want to go forward with a national missile defense.\n  That is perplexing. I do not understand how it is all right to help \nour friends, like the Israelis, defend themselves--and there has been \nmoney there in the last several years to help the Israelis build the \nArrow Missile Defense System to protect their homeland and people. So I \ndo not understand why U.S. tax dollars should be spent on that system \nand not on a similar system to protect the United States. I am all for \nthe development of the Arrow. I have been to Israel and have seen the \nthreat they live under from their neighbors that would do them harm. \nThey understand the need for a missile defense, and we have been \nwilling to support their national missile defense system.\n  Why is the President of the United States willing to spend money so \nthat the people of Israel will not be killed in a missile attack, and \nhe is not willing to spend money so that the people of the United \nStates are free from missile attack? I do not understand that.\n  Mr. President, as I said, reasonable people can differ about whether \nthe threat will occur in the year 2003, 2007, or in the year 2000. But \nyou cannot argue about the fact that the threat will be there, and, in \nsome respects, it already is.\n  So if we are willing to spend that money and to make that commitment \nto defend the people of other countries, why are we not willing to make \nthat commitment to defend the people of the United States?\n  Let me make this point. When pollsters ask Americans around the \ncountry how we would defend ourselves against a missile attack, \nAmericans answer with a variety of very innovative responses. ``Well, \nwe will shoot them down.'' How? ``Well, we have airplanes with missiles \nthat will shoot them down. Well, we will shoot them down with our own \nmissiles. Well, we have lasers in space. I am not sure how, but we will \nshoot them down.''\n  The fact is that we do not have any way of shooting them down. We are \ntotally vulnerable to an attack.\n  Do you know what about 80 percent of the Americans who respond to \nthese surveys say? They say that is absolutely irresponsible and we \nhave to do something about it today to turn this situation around--\ntoday. They are shocked to know that we are vulnerable to missile \nattack.\n  I guess it is our own fault for not making the point to people that \nwe do not have a defense. It is particularly shocking, I guess, for not \ncorrecting this deficiency given the fact that the Persian Gulf war was \n5 years ago and we have let 5 years go by without making very much \nprogress toward the development and deployment of these defenses. I \nwould have thought that after 28 Americans were killed in one Scud \nattack and after Israel was attacked by Iraq that the United States \nwould finally have committed itself to building missile defenses to \nprotect the United States and the people of the United States. We kind \nof frittered away our money and time. Now we have other nations in \naddition to Iraq that are very aggressively and very actively \ndeveloping these weapons. Yet, we do not seem to be any further down \nthe road toward making a commitment to develop and deploy the system.\n  As I said, if you look at every other weapons system that we bought, \nlet us say the F-15, or the F-16, or the carrier, the Trident \nsubmarine, you name it, the only way we have of being able to get it \ndone is say we want to buy this weapon, we want to have it done by x \ndate, therefore, we are going to appropriate the money necessary to \nachieve deployment by that date, and we ask the administration to come \nforward with a plan which lays out the specific deadlines for a \nspecific timetable by which the tests are going to be conducted, and \neventually we will get to the point of deployment. Usually it takes a \nlittle longer than we predicted, but we try to set those dates up so \nthat we actually achieve the objective.\n  That is what we are asking for in this legislation by setting a \nspecific date. We are saying, we know we will never get there if we \nkeep moving the goalposts and if we never set an actual date for \ndeployment, so let us set the day and let us get on with it. If we do \nnot do that, we will never get there. That is why I say it really is a \nbogus argument to talk about the threat, because everyone acknowledges \nthere is a threat. They simply argue about when\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nit will really surface. I submit that it is not worth playing around \nwith that question, particularly since we know that 5 years have \nelapsed since Americans have been killed by a ballistic missile.\n  There is another subargument here that I really want to deal with \nvery briefly, and since Senator Nunn is not here I am going to go \nforward. This is the argument that deterrence is sufficient and we \nalready have the ability to retaliate against someone who launches a \nmissile, and that ought to be enough to deter them from ever doing so.\n\n  I ask the question again. Given the fact that the United States \npulled out of Iraq and did not use any kind of weapon of mass \ndestruction against Saddam Hussein, did not even destroy his palace \nguard at the conclusion of that war, and given the fact that President \nBush himself made the point on several occasions that we mean no harm \nto the Iraqi people, we only wish that the regime of Saddam Hussein \nwould not act irresponsibly and that we would try to defeat it--given \nthose facts, is it credible to assume that the United States in the \nfuture will use a nuclear weapon or a chemical or biological weapon on \nthe people of a country whose leaders attack us, or who threaten to \nattack us, or who threaten to attack, say, the French, the British, the \nIsraelis, or the Russians? Is that a credible deterrent? Are we going \nto deter Mu'ammar Qadhafi, or the leaders of Korea, or some other \ncountry? I do not think so.\n  I think that deterrence argument, if it did work in the cold war--\nthere is some dispute about it--is not the kind of argument that is \ngoing to work today against countries that frankly do not think we will \nuse the deterrent and do not care, in any event. The risk of failure on \nrelying on deterrence is simply too great to rely on that doctrine \ntoday. It will not work against the kind of nations that mean us harm \ntoday. It is not credible.\n  I note the fact that Secretary Perry himself, in the Nuclear Posture \nReview on September 20, 1994, made the following comment, with which I \ntotally agree.\n\n       We now have an opportunity to create a new relationship, \n     based not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but \n     rather on another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.\n\n  What he was talking about was the ability to deter aggressor nations \nbased upon the fact that we can defend ourselves, and, therefore, there \nwas no point in their developing the means to attack us, or initiating \nsuch an attack; that because we had the ability to defend ourselves, it \nwould make it impossible for them to succeed, and, therefore, there \nwould be no point in their expending the funds to do so. That is the \ntheory of defensive deterrence, and it really is the only kind of \ndefense that will exist against the kind of threat that we face today. \nWhen we were arrayed against the Soviet Union, it might have been a \ndifferent matter, though that is questionable. But it is certainly not \nthe case today.\n  I had indicated when we talked about the START II Treaty that there \nwere some people I would quote. Let me do that since I have the time, \nbecause this is the final argument, and that is, we are kind of playing \nwith fire. We do not want to do anything that would disturb the \nRussians, and it could be that they would take actions that we would be \nsorry for if we did anything to anger them.\n  Clearly, at this point in time, only 3 weeks or so away from the \nRussian elections, our eyes are turned toward Russia because we \nunderstand that some very irresponsible people could be elected and \nlead the Russian State. That would be a real shame. None of us want to \ndo that. All of us are hoping for the election of very responsible \npeople to lead the Russian nation, people with whom we can work in the \nfuture and continue to work on defense matters together, because we \nmean no harm to them. They should know that. We wish them well, and we \nhope they share that feeling and, therefore, engage with us in those \nkind of agreements that demonstrate the desire for peaceful nations to \nproceed along the path of peace and eliminate the kind of weapons of \nmass destruction that populate the world today.\n\n  That is why we hope very much that they continue to abide by treaties \nlike the START I Treaty and that they would ratify the START II Treaty \nto further bring down the number of dangerous weapons in the world. But \nhere is what some of the Russians themselves have said with respect to \nthe probability of their actions with respect to the ABM Treaty.\n  Alexi Arbatov, Deputy Chair of the Russian State Duma Defense \nCommittee, complained that the loss of MIRV'd missile capability \nresulting from START II was a critical reason for them to be concerned \nwith the START II Treaty. He stated that the Russians ``cannot \neconomically fill the gap with single warheads; it's too costly.'' He \nproposed developing a protocol that lowered START II warhead ceilings \nto relieve their economic difficulties with the treaty.\n  In other words, what he was saying was that ``it is going to be \nawfully expensive for us to bring down our warheads to the level called \nfor in the START II Treaty. You all may be able to afford it in the \nUnited States. We can't. So let us not bring them down quite so far.''\n  Well, it may be that they will have a hard time doing that, but if \nthey do not adopt the START II Treaty, it will be for reasons of \neconomics, as he pointed out, not because the United States has \nsuggested the need to look at an outmoded ABM Treaty which previous \nRussian Governments have been willing to look at themselves.\n  U.S. Ambassador Brooks predicted the Russians will be forced to go \nwell below START I levels with or without START II for economic \nreasons. He was actually proposing a slightly different argument \nrelated to economics. He was saying the Russians are going to have to \nproceed with START I and maybe even START II limits in the long run \nbecause it is so expensive to maintain them, and while in the short run \nour thought may have been correct, Ambassador Brooks is probably \ncorrect with respect to the long run.\n  It is in both of our interests in the long run to save money by not \nhaving to maintain these expensive stockpiles. It costs money to \ndismantle them initially. That is why people like Senator Nunn and \nothers have been responsible for proposing U.S. assistance to enable \nthe Russians to bring down their stockpiles. It is for economic reasons \nthat the Russians will find it impossible to continue to maintain this \nhigh level of stockpile. It does not have anything to do with the ABM \nTreaty.\n  Neither the United States nor Russia will have the capacity to enter \ninto another arms race, I suspect, whether or not we made modifications \nto the ABM Treaty.\n  Clearly, with respect to other nations like China, the START I and \nSTART II Treaties do not even apply here. So though some say we should \nnot even begin to change the ABM Treaty because of the Russian \nresponse, I would counter by saying: What about the Chinese? What about \nother countries that are not even involved in the START I or START II \nTreaty?\n  Clearly, deploying this, or beginning to talk about amending the ABM \nTreaty so we deploy an effective defense system is in the national \ndefense interest of the United States and we should not be deterred \nfrom proceeding with that step simply because there may be some who \ncontend that the Russians will be unhappy and therefore there would be \na reaction against us.\n  Mr. President, since I have other time, let me proceed with one final \npoint, and then I would be happy to yield to anybody else who would \nlike to speak.\n  What we are talking about here, for those who might not have been \nwith us at the very beginning, is a very modest--very modest--first \nstep. It is called the Defend America Act. It was brought to the Senate \nfloor by Majority Leader Bob Dole. It is true that he has made a \npolitical issue of this but only because the American people have been \nshocked to find out that the United States is undefended against a \nballistic missile attack.\n  That is why Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the Republican \nPresidential nominee, has said it is important for us to get on with \nthe job of ultimately developing and deploying a system that could \ndefend the United States, at least in a modest way, against certain \nkinds of limited attack. So the Defend America Act that we have before \nus is a very modest first step toward that end.\n  It is not the space shield that some people would like to talk about. \nIt is\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nnot a hugely expensive kind of project that CBO has said we could \ndevelop. Yes, we could, but that is not what this is. It is really a \nvery modest attempt, and it is important for the Senate, I think, to \nbegin this debate and, hopefully, to have a vote on this act in the \nrelatively near future.\n  The House of Representatives was scheduled to take this up just \nbefore the Memorial Day recess and did not do so at that time, passing \nthe budget instead. But I am hopeful, too, that the House of \nRepresentatives will take up the Defend America Act very soon. The \nimportant thing for the American people to know is that the Senate will \nnot be able to vote on this act unless 60 Members of the Senate agree, \nbecause of a procedure that we have here which says that anybody can \nobject to bringing up a bill and, if they do, it takes 60 Senators then \nto have a vote on it--60 Senators have to agree. That is called \ninvoking cloture. Tomorrow afternoon at 2:15, we are going to have a \nvote to invoke cloture, that is to say, to stop this debate that has \nbeen going on and to have a vote on proceeding with a vote on the bill. \nThere will still be an opportunity to further debate the bill after \nthat, but then we would have a vote before the end of the week on the \nDefend America Act.\n  This will be the last chance that Majority Leader Bob Dole has to \nbring this act up during his time in the Senate. I think it is \nimportant even for those people who do not necessarily agree with the \nDefend America Act, who for some reason want to support the President \nof the United States in his opposition to it. Maybe for political \nreasons they want to vote against it because it would hurt Bob Dole and \nhelp Bill Clinton. I can understand all of those things even though I \nthink it would be irrational to vote against it for purely political \nreasons. But whatever reasons my colleagues might have for ultimately \nvoting against it, I find it hard to understand why any of them would \noppose having a vote on it.\n  What are they afraid of? Mr. President, what are they afraid of? Why \nwould Members of this body--and specifically now I am talking about \nDemocrats, since I believe all the Republicans will support the cloture \nvote, will support taking a vote on the Defend America Act. Not all \nRepublicans probably will vote for it in the end, although most will. \nBut why would Democrats almost to a person oppose even taking a vote on \nthis bill? Why? I can think of only one reason, and it is not a \npleasant thought. That one reason is politics.\n\n  I read the Defend America Act. There is nothing in there that every \none of us does not believe, with the possible exception of the actual \ndeployment by the year 2003. I have discussed the reasons why I think \n2003 is a good date. Now, others may disagree. They have the right to \nexpress that disagreement by voting against the bill. Even though they \nmay agree with everything else in it, they might not like that, so they \nwant to vote against it. They have the right to vote against it. We \nwould still be debating for another day or day and a half after we \ninvoke cloture, so by the end of this week we could have a vote on this \nbill.\n  Now, why would colleagues not even let us vote on the bill? Why would \nthey say: No; Bob Dole, you cannot have a vote? Is it because they do \nnot want Americans to be free from ballistic missile attack? I do not \nthink so. I do not think there is a person here who believes that.\n  I can only think of one reason, Mr. President, and that is to deny \nBob Dole the right to have a vote on his bill. Now, I urge my \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, who have stood in this \nChamber and who have stood in receptions and dinners and other fora to \nlaud Bob Dole and pay tribute to him for the long service that he has \ngiven to our country, most recently in the Senate, but before that in \nthe House and, of course, serving in our military, I appeal to all of \nmy colleagues who have genuinely expressed their appreciation for Bob \nDole's service, Democrats and Republicans alike, recognizing that \nwhether he is to be the President of the United States or not, he is to \nbe respected as a strong national leader who for years has done a lot \nof good things for this country--and nobody believes more strongly in \nthe defense of the United States than Bob Dole--I would urge those \ncolleagues of mine, Democrats and Republicans alike, to just stop and \nthink and see if it is not within their heart to at least give him a \nvote on his bill. They can then vote against it, and he will understand \nthose who have legitimate reasons for voting against it. But I think \nwhat he would find very hard to believe is that his colleagues would \nnot even let him have a vote on this important matter that, after all, \nis not that important to him personally or politically but is very \nimportant to the American people. Bob Dole knows how important it is \nthat we provide for our national defense.\n  I will just conclude with this point. I have mentioned the Persian \nGulf war many times, Mr. President. But after that Persian Gulf war was \nover and Dick Cheney and President Bush and Colin Powell and Norm \nSchwarzkopf were all given great kudos for winning the Persian Gulf \nwar, what did they say? Well, most of them said it was not us that did \nit, obviously; it was the men and women we had trained so well that did \nthe job. Of course, they were right. But Dick Cheney said one \nadditional thing, and I will never forget it because he is a very \nreflective person. He said that it was not me, it was not us that won \nthis war. It was the people 10 and 15 years ago who made the decision \nthen to invest in the kind of weaponry and training that enabled our \npeople to win today. They could not have foreseen the uses to which \nthese weapons would be put. They had to fight those who said that they \nwere a waste of money at the time, that they cost too much, that they \nmight not work, that they were not necessary, that there was no threat. \nThey had to stand up in the face of all of those arguments and have the \ncourage of their conviction that someday, somewhere the United States \nmight need that kind of weaponry to defend itself and its interests and \nit would be important for the men and women that we ask to go in harm's \nway that we give them the very best to protect themselves. Dick Cheney \nsaid we really owe this victory of the Persian Gulf war to the people \nwho were in the Congress and who were in the administrations at that \ntime, who made the tough decisions to make the investment to build \nthese things so that when we needed them they would be there, even \nthough no one could predict when or where or under what circumstances \nthat would be.\n\n  Mr. President, I am saying the same thing today. We will hear all of \nthe arguments: Well, it may not work. Well, we do not know even who it \nis going to be used against. Well, we are not sure that the threat is \nhere yet or even when there is going to be a threat. Well, we know \nthere will be a threat, but it probably will not be for a while yet. We \ncan take a chance.\n  We have to stand up today just like those people did 10 and 15 years \nbefore Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense and be courageous enough to \nmake the investment to protect not only the American people but also \nour forces deployed abroad and our allies, but most specifically the \nAmerican people. That is what the Defend America Act is all about, so \nthat 10 or 15 years from now, or 7 or 8 or 9 years from now when we \nhave been able to thwart some kind of attack by an aggressor and people \nare patting everyone on the back saying job well done, those people \nwill look back on the Congress of today and say, well, actually, they \nwere the ones, those people back in 1996 who had the courage to go \nforward with the system, they were the ones to whom we owe our \nappreciation and perhaps our lives.\n  Do we have the courage to make that kind of commitment today, at a \nvery small, relative, expense, $1 or $2 billion a year out of a $265 \nbillion defense budget, for maybe 10 years? That is not too high a \nprice to pay for the lives of American people.\n  So I ask my colleagues when we have this cloture vote tomorrow at \n2:15, think about your children or grandchildren and your lives and the \nlives of those we will put in harm's way 10 or 15 years from now. Think \nabout the legacy we want to leave. Think about the people we want to \nprotect, about the interests that we want to project in the world. \nThink about what that takes.\n  Also, think about the unfairness of not even allowing this bill to \ncome to a vote, and think about the final tribute that you can pay to a \ngreat man, whether you agree with him politically or not, Bob Dole, \nwho, after all, has\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\nasked nothing more than to be allowed to have a vote on this piece of \nlegislation.\n  For those reasons, I hope my colleagues will join us in voting for \ncloture so we can have a vote on the Missile Defense Act sometime this \nweek.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 31, 1996]\n\n          White House Misled Joint Chiefs on ABM Treaty Talks\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       Clinton administration officials misled the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff about efforts to reach an agreement with Russia at last \n     month's summit on the complex issue of clarifying the Anti-\n     Ballastic Missile (ABM) Treaty, Pentagon officials said.\n       To prevent details from being disclosed to the press, the \n     military service chiefs were not told in advance of the \n     Moscow summit about a White House plan to hold detailed talks \n     between the two presidents aimed at reaching a partial \n     agreement on what short-range anti-missile defense systems \n     are legal under the 1972 ABM Treaty, according to officials \n     who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n       Several days before the April 22 summit in Moscow, a \n     Pentagon briefer, explaining the White House summit agenda \n     for defense issues, told a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff that the issue of ABM theater missile defense (TMD) \n     demarcation would not be brought up at meetings between \n     President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, or \n     other defense officials, they said.\n       ``At the [Joint Chiefs] meeting, the chiefs were told ABM-\n     TMD demarcation will not be discussed at the summit,'' one \n     official said. ``In fact that briefing was part of a \n     deliberate deception plan on the part of the White House.''\n       The postsummit realization that some officials acted \n     dishonestly with the military chiefs upset many in the \n     Pentagon, particularly officials charged with developing \n     missile defenses.\n       ``Everybody was outraged,'' one official said. ``The only \n     conclusion we could come to was that the White House \n     negotiated with the Russians against its own military.''\n       A second official said a senior general who took part in \n     the briefing, held in the secure Pentagon room known as ``the \n     tank,'' specifically asked the briefer to clarify whether the \n     issue would be raised. The general, concerned over Russian \n     backtracking at earlier arms talks, was told missile defense \n     would not be discussed at all, the official said.\n       ``That conversation did occur, and that answer was \n     received,'' a spokesman for the general said, asking that his \n     name and service not be identified.\n       The briefer, an aide to Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman \n     of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained that the only defense \n     topics to be discussed at the summit would be the \n     Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, efforts to reach a \n     nuclear test ban treaty, and chemical and biological weapons.\n       Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin said during a postsummit \n     news conference on April 22 that they had discussed the ABM \n     issue extensively.\n       Mr. Clinton told reporters ``real progress'' was made on \n     the ABM-TMD issue during five hours of talks. ``I'm convinced \n     that if we do this in an open way that has a lot of \n     integrity, I think we'll all be just fine on this and I think \n     it will work out very well,'' Mr. Clinton said.\n       A new round of ABM talks with Moscow on missile demarcation \n     began May 20 at the Standing Consultative Commission (SCC) in \n     Geneva. The White House official said the Russians presented \n     proposals at the session with ``wrinkles''--positions--\n     opposed by U.S. negotiators.\n       An earlier round of SCC talks broke off after they were \n     deadlocked over Russian insistence on reversing agreements \n     reached earlier by U.S. and Russian officials outside the \n     formal talks.\n       Russia announced in the earlier meeting that any Pentagon \n     work on higher-speed regional missile defenses would be \n     regarded by Moscow as illegal under the ABM Treaty until a \n     second agreement is reached, a classified State Department \n     cable said.\n       Pentagon officials said a political agreement reached by \n     U.S. and Russian officials at the summit will limit U.S. use \n     of space-based sensors with advanced missile defenses, such \n     as the Navy's wide-area system known as Upper Tier. It also \n     would bar work on the Air Force's airborne laser gun, which \n     will be capable of knocking down missiles shortly after \n     takeoff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          Woolsey Disputes Clinton, Missile-Threat Assessment\n\n       President Clinton's former CIA director yesterday accused \n     the administration of playing down the threat of missile \n     attack from Russia, China or elsewhere.\n       R. James Woolsey, who headed the nation's spy apparatus \n     during the first two years of the Clinton administration, \n     told a House committee that the administration has \n     understated the missile threat on multiple fronts.\n       In particular, Mr. Woolsey criticized a frequently quoted \n     National Intelligence Estimate that found little threat of a \n     missile attack on the contiguous 48 states until well into \n     the next century.\n       ``I believe that the `contiguous 48' reference . . . can \n     lead to a badly distorted and minimized perception of the \n     serious threats we face from ballistic missiles now and in \n     the very near future--threats to our friends, our allies, our \n     overseas bases and military forces, our overseas territories \n     and some of the 50 states,'' Mr. Woolsey told the House \n     Government Reform and Oversight Committee.\n       A White House official, who spoke on the condition of \n     anonymity, said the United States has theater missile \n     defenses that could be rushed into place to protect Alaska \n     and Hawaii should a threat arise.\n       He said the administration was ``absolutely in agreement'' \n     that the threat of terrorism must be met, but said Mr. \n     Clinton opposes rushing a system into place when a slower \n     pace might result in a better defense.\n       In his testimony, Mr. Woolsey said the chances of missile \n     terrorism increase as potentially hostile states improve \n     their technology.\n       ``It is quite reasonable to believe that within a few years \n     [Iraqi leader] Saddam Hussein or the Chinese rulers will be \n     able to threaten something far more troubling than firings of \n     relatively inaccurate ballistic missiles,'' Mr. Woolsey said. \n     ``They may quite plausibly be able to threaten to destroy, \n     say, the Knesset [Israel's parliament], or threaten to \n     create, in effect, an international Chernobyl incident at a \n     Taiwanese nuclear power plant.''\n       Mr. Woolsey, now practicing law in Washington, has been \n     embraced by Republicans seeking funding to deploy a national \n     missile-defense system by 2003: Mr. Woolsey said after the \n     hearing that he supports legislation sponsored by Senate \n     Majority Leader Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican \n     presidential nominee, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to \n     deploy the missile-defense system.\n       In an apparent endorsement of current administration \n     priorities, Mr. Woolsey said the Pentagon should place \n     ``primary importance'' on developing theater missile defenses \n     while pursuing ``a sound program to move toward some type of \n     national defense.'' But Mr. Woolsey criticized several \n     aspects of administration policy. Specifically, Mr. Woolsey:\n       Criticized the administration for trimming funding for some \n     theater-defense systems.\n       Questioned the administration decision to make highly \n     accurate global-positioning-system technology available \n     commercially, a move that enemies could use to make their \n     missiles even more accurate.\n       Disputed Mr. Clinton's assertion that U.S. intelligence \n     does not foresee an emerging ballistic-missile threat in the \n     coming decade.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support \nof the Defend America Act of 1996 currently before the Senate which \nestablishes, by the year 2003, a national missile-defense [NMD] system \nto protect the United States against limited, unauthorized or \naccidental missile attacks. The deployment of an NMD system as \narticulated by the author of the bill--Senator Dole--will not only \ndefend, it will deter--by reducing the incentive of rogue regimes to \nacquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction.\n  I am deeply concerned, as are other Members of Congress, about \nincreased interest by several countries hostile to this great Nation to \nacquire ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. As \nrecently as last month, Clinton administration officials, to include \nthe former Director of Central Intelligence [DCI]--R. James Woolsey--\ntestified before Congress that the National Intelligence Estimate [NIE] \nused by the President to veto earlier proposals to deploy a NMD system \nwas flawed. Mr. Woolsey challenged the conclusion made by the NIE \nreport that no long-range missiles will threaten the 48 contiguous \nStates for at least 15 years. Former DCI Woolsey further stated that \nlimiting the estimate's focus on the missile threat to the 48 States \n``can lead to a badly distorted and minimized perception of very \nserious threats we face from ballistic missiles now and in the very \nnear future.''\n  The Intelligence Community [IC] of the United States has confirmed \nthat North Korea is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile \nthat will be capable of reaching Alaska or beyond once deployed. In \nApril, Kim Myong Chol--a North Korean reported by the Washington Post \nto have close contacts to the government in Pyongyang--stated that \nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-il has ordered the development and \ndeployment of strategic long-range ballistic missiles tipped with a \nsuper-powerful warhead. The purpose of this missile, according to Chol, \nis to provide North Korea with the capability to destroy major \nmetropolitan centers. This system is likely to be deployed in less than \n10 years and be part operational intercontinental ballistic missile \nforce capable of hitting the American mainland.\n  Additionally, the threat posed to the United States by the \nproliferation of\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\nballistic missiles is growing at an ever faster pace. Other rogue \nnations such as Iran, Iraq and Libya are also pursuing the development \nof longer range missiles to include those with an intercontinental \ncapability. According to the CIA, Iran is seeking to supplement its \nexisting ballistic missile inventories with the purchase from North \nKorea of the 1,000-1,300 kilometer (No Dong) ballistic missile. Iran--\nwith help from China and North Korea--is seeking to develop and produce \nits own ballistic missiles with the objective of producing a medium-\nrange ballistic missile to threaten targets to a distance of 3,000 \nkilometers. Foreshadowing future successes, Iranian President \nRafsanjani said as recently as August 1995 that: ``An incredible thing \nhas happened in defense so that we [Iranians] are making everything \nfrom rockets to the smallest military equipment. We are also exporters \nand could export to countries which we wish. You should know that we \nare one of the main centers for construction of defense equipment. Of \ncourse we cannot advertise much in this sector and we do not wish to \nadvertise because it is a defense sphere, but we are getting on with \nthe job.''\n  It should be mentioned that Iran is also aggressively pursuing a \nnuclear weapons capability and, if significant foreign assistance were \nprovided (e.g., from China or Russia), could produce a nuclear device \nas early as the end of the decade. Moreover, Iranian leaders have in \nthe past and continue to make numerous statements before cheering \ncrowds along the lines of ``The United States still remains the Great \nSatan'' and ``Mankind should not think the White House will remain \nforever. No, it will be destroyed.''\n  I would like to stress that the Defend America Act emphasizes that \nthe goal of defending Americans against ballistic missile attack must \nbe accomplished in an affordable manner. Senator Dole's bill focuses on \na $14 billion limited national missile defense [NMD] system. The Defend \nAmerica Act calls for the use of programs currently in development to \nserve as the building blocks for a system that will meet the missile \nthreat as it emerges and has the flexibility to adapt to new \ndevelopment in ballistic missile technology by rogue states. In \ncontrast, the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] highly inflated \nestimate of $31-$60 billion reflects the cost of a more robust defense \nthat includes every option that might be done and could be done in the \nnext 20 years in order to protect the United States from an unrealistic \nattack of up to 200 warheads accompanied by sophisticated \ncountermeasures.\n  It must be made clear and in very specific terms that the United \nStates is firmly committed to a National Missile Defense system. And, \ntherefore I urge Senators to support the Defend America Act of 1996. \nThis measure will ensure that future generations of Americans remain \nsecure from long-range ballistic missile attack.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, last year the subject of national missile \ndefense proved to be one of the most difficult issues we faced during \nthe consideration of the defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n1996. This year, we may face similar challenges as a result of \nprovisions in S. 1635, the proposed Defend America Act, which was \nintroduced by Senator Dole and others on March 21, 1996, as well as \ncertain provisions in S. 1745, the Defense Authorization Act reported \nby the Armed Services Committee.\n  In my judgment, it would be relatively easy to develop a consensus in \nthe Congress as to what measures we should authorize in fiscal year \n1997 to address the requirements of a sound national missile defense \nprogram. Difficulties arise, however, when we focus on decisions which \ndo not need to be resolved at this time, but which assume a great \nsymbolic importance to a number of Senators and a number of \ncommentators.\n  Today, I would like to review last year's actions on missile defense, \ndiscuss the proposals that have been introduced to date, and set forth \nat least my own views as to how the Nation should proceed in both the \nshort term and long term on the subject of missile defenses.\n  Last year's bill, as reported by the Armed Services Committee, \nproposed to legislate a requirement that the United States deploy by \nthe year 1999 a prototype national missile defense system which, \nbecause of the compressed time, would have necessarily had a very \nlimited capability. The bill further required the United States to \ndeploy a multiple-site ABM system with an initial operational \ncapability by the year 2003.\n\n  The bill also proposed the system would be augmented to provide a \nlayered defense against a larger and more sophisticated type attack. In \naddition, the proposed language would have established in permanent law \na specific demarcation between what we call theater missile defense and \nstrategic missile defense or national missile defense, as the term is \nused in this debate. It also prohibited negotiations, or other \nexecutive branch actions concerning clarification or interpretation of \nthe ABM Treaty and the line between theater and strategic defenses.\n  In my judgment, and that of many other Senators and of the \nadministration, the language in last year's bill was unacceptable. The \nrequirement for a multiple-site system was clearly inconsistent with \nthe ABM Treaty which limits parties to a single site. The mandate for a \nlayered system, which would require deployment of space-based systems, \nalso was inconsistent with the treaty. The statutory demarcation \nbetween theater and national missile defense systems, and the \nprohibition on negotiations by the administration, also raised \ndifficult constitutional questions about the authority of the Congress \nto impinge on the President's negotiating authority, as well as his \nrole as Commander in Chief.\n  When it became clear during the debate that there was insufficient \nsupport for the bill as passed by the committee to also pass the \nSenate, the majority leader, Senator Dole, and the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, designated Senators Warner, Cohen, Levin, and myself--\ntwo Democrats, two Republicans--to attempt to develop a bipartisan \nsubstitute, and that we did. The result was a bipartisan amendment \nwhich provided extensive guidance to ensure that the United States \nwould develop a more focused Missile Defense Program than the \nadministration's then-current National Missile Defense Program.\n  Mr. President, if any of our colleagues would like to look at a sound \nproposal that was negotiated--every word of it was negotiated--they \nwill do well to review that in reviewing this debate before we vote on \nthese matters.\n  The bipartisan amendment stated that it, ``is the policy of the \nUnited States to develop for deployment a multiple-site national \nmissile defense system that: First, is affordable and operationally \neffective against limited, accidental, and unauthorized ballistic \nmissile attacks on the territory of the United States, and second, can \nbe augmented over time as the threat changes to provide a layered \ndefense against limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \nthreats.''\n  The bipartisan amendment required the Secretary of Defense to: \n``develop an affordable and operationally effective national missile \ndefense system to counter a limited, accidental, or unauthorized \nballistic missile attack, and which is capable of attaining initial \noperational capability [IOC] by the end of 2003.''\n  The bipartisan amendment also set forth the understanding of the \nSenate as to the demarcation between theater and ballistic missile \ndefense systems, and established a prohibition against the use of \nfunds: ``to implement an agreement with any of the independent states \nof the former Soviet Union entered into after January 1, 1995. that \nwould establish a demarcation between theater missile defense systems \nand antiballistic missile systems for purposes of the ABM Treaty or \nthat would restrict the performance, operation, or deployment of United \nStates theater missile defense systems except: First, to the extent \nprovided in an act enacted subsequent to this act; second, to implement \nthat portion of any such agreement that implements the criteria in \nsubsection (b)(1); or third, to\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nimplement any such agreement that is entered into pursuant to the \ntreaty making power of the President under the Constitution.''\n  That amendment, developed by two Democrats and two Republicans, was \napproved overwhelmingly in the Senate by a vote of 85 to 13 and, \ninterestingly enough, only one Republican voted against the amendment. \nMost of the votes against the amendment were on the Democratic side by \npeople who felt the amendment went too far toward a national missile \ndefense. Only one Republican, as I recall, voted against it.\n  Despite this overwhelming approval, the bipartisan amendment was \nabandoned in conference, which was puzzling to me at the time and \nremains puzzling, to say the least, since it would clearly define our \nnational missile defense goals and give renewed bipartisan emphasis to \nthe importance of national missile defenses.\n  The bipartisan amendment also had the added advantage that it would \nhave been signed into law by President Clinton, not an insignificant \nstep if your motive is to get something done. Instead, the majority \nconferees decided to mandate a specific requirement to deploy a \nnational missile defense system by the year 2003. There is a difference \nhere between ``develop for development'' and ``deploy.''\n  ``Develop for deployment,'' which was in the bipartisan agreement \nthat passed the Senate, is a different term than ``deploy,'' because \n``develop for deployment'' indicates a further decision has to be made \nafter the development has taken place before you decide to deploy, \nwhereas ``deploy,'' as used then and as used in the act before us--that \nwill perhaps be before us that is now the subject of debate--``deploy'' \nmeans deploy. It means you are making a decision now to deploy a system \nthat will be developed over a period of time and be, hopefully, ready \nin 2003.\n  The Clinton administration expressed strong opposition to the \nconference report, particularly in terms of its impact on Russian \nconsideration of the START II Treaty, which has not been ratified in \nRussia, which is designed to produce a second major reduction in United \nStates and Russian nuclear weapons, including, I might state, Mr. \nPresident, getting rid of MIRV'd weapons which has been the goal, to \nget rid of multiple warhead missiles aimed at the United States which \nhas been the goal of Democratic and Republican Presidents for many \nyears.\n  The administration also expressed concern that the language could \nlead the Russians to abandon other arms control agreements if they \nconclude that it is United States policy to take unilateral action to \nabandon the ABM Treaty. And reading the act as it was proposed last \nyear, I find it inescapable that that is what the Russians would \nconclude.\n  In a letter to Senator Daschle dated December 15, Secretary of \nDefense Bill Perry stated, and I quote from that letter:\n\n       [B]y directing the NMD [National Missile Defense] be \n     ``operationally effective'' in defending all 50 States \n     (including Hawaii and Alaska), the bill would likely require \n     a multiple-site NMD architecture that cannot be accommodated \n     within the terms of the ABM Treaty as now written. By setting \n     U.S. policy on a collision course with the ABM Treaty, the \n     bill puts at risk continued implementation of the START I \n     Treaty and ratification of the START II, two treaties which \n     together will reduce the number of U.S. and Russian strategic \n     warheads by two-thirds from Cold War levels, significantly \n     lowering the threat to U.S. national security.\n\n  Ending the quote from Secretary Perry.\n  As a result of those concerns, and other considerations, the \nPresident vetoed the bill. That was the main defense authorization bill \nthat was vetoed.\n\n  When the conferees reconvened, the majority decided to drop all \nlanguage dealing with missile defense. Again, from my perspective, a \nvery curious position, because we had already shown overwhelming \nbipartisan support, including every Republican, but one, in the U.S. \nSenate for what I would call the Nunn-Levin-Cohen-Warner amendment \nwhich passed the Senate. So why we did not go back to that as a \nsubstitute after the vetoed bill is still puzzling to me.\n  If the motive was to accelerate national missile defense, why would \nthe majority not choose to insert the bipartisan amendment passed \noverwhelmingly in the Senate and agreed to by the President? I still \nhave that question today. We could have passed that. We would be 1 year \nfurther along with a national consensus on where we go with national \nmissile defense. But here we are, again, fighting over this issue. It \nseems to me some would rather fight over the issue than resolve it. \nNevertheless, that is from my perspective.\n  The Dole-Gingrich bill let me just address briefly.\n  On March 21, 1996, Senator Dole introduced S. 1635, entitled Defend \nAmerica Act of 1996, on behalf of himself and 19 other Senators. I \nmight stipulate at the beginning that I agree in defending America and \nI think my record indicates that over the years. So the title of the \nbill is not my problem.\n  Speaker Gingrich and others introduced an identical version in the \nHouse. The Dole-Gingrich bill would mandate deployment of a national \nmissile defense system by 2003 and selection of a particular \narchitecture for that system a few months from now. I believe the date \nis March of next year. It gives the President 1 year from its enactment \nin which to negotiate modifications to the ABM Treaty to permit the \nchosen architecture to be developed and deployed.\n  So this is a very compressed timeframe, based on all technical \nassessments from the program managers, as to where we are now, \nparticularly the items of selecting the architecture and in terms of \nnegotiating an ABM Treaty amendment, which is not going to be a quick, \neasy matter, as everyone who has ever negotiated with the Russians \nknows.\n  A critique of the Dole-Gingrich bill is set forth in a recent speech \nby Robert Bell, the Senior Director of Defense Policy and Arms Control \non the National Security Council. Mr. Bell takes the Dole-Gingrich \nproposal to task on several particular points.\n  First, he notes that the Dole-Gingrich bill requires a deployment \ndecision today well before we have a system to deploy.\n  Second, he suggests that the Dole-Gingrich bill appears to be a \n``stalking-horse'' for the resurrection of the old SDI program intended \nto defend against much larger scale attacks than a limited national \ndefense could cope with.\n  Incidentally, the threat has changed immensely since those days \nbecause of START I and START II, at least the prospect of START II, in \nreducing the number of warheads, if these amendments go through, \nreducing them very substantially from what existed in the 1980's when \nPresident Reagan proposed the original so-called star wars program, \nwhich was an accelerated program of larger scope than we had in \nexistence in terms of research and development.\n  Third, Mr. Bell indicates that the Dole-Gingrich bill would \nconstitute an ``anticipatory breach'' of the ABM Treaty.\n  Finally, Mr. Bell suggests strong Russian opposition to the 1-year \ndeadline in the Dole-Gingrich bill for negotiating changes in the ABM \nTreaty acceptable to the United States.\n  Mr. President, I agree with many of Mr. Bell's criticisms of the \nDole-Gingrich bill. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that speech \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nwas asked to estimate the acquisition cost for the NMD system required \nby the Dole-Gingrich bill. On May 17, 1996, the Congressional Budget \nOffice provided the Armed Services Committee with that cost estimate. \nCBO estimates that the total acquisition cost for the Dole-Gingrich \nbill through the year 2010 would range from $31 billion to as much as \n$60 billion.\n  As the CBO report notes:\n\n       The wide range in the estimate reflects uncertainty about \n     two factors--the type and capability of a defensive system \n     that would satisfy the terms of the bill, and the cost of \n     each component of that system.\n\n  Mr. President, CBO is right. There is a huge range because no one \nknows the system that we in this bill, if we pass this bill, would be \nby law saying had to be deployed. So if we pass this bill as is, we \nwould be making a deployment\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\ndecision on a system that is not developed, that will cost, according \nto CBO, anywhere from $30 to $60 billion. In a period of time where we \nare trying to get our budget under control, to pass into law something \nthat mandates the deployment of a system that could range in cost from \n$30 to $60 billion is, to say the least, puzzling for a Senate that has \ntalked about fiscal prudence. Just a little $30 billion swing there in \nterms of what we are talking about.\n\n  In its present form, Mr. President, I believe there is no question \nthat the Dole-Gingrich bill, if and when passed by the Congress and \nsent to the President, will be vetoed just under the speed of light on \nboth cost and arms control grounds.\n  I emphasize, however--and I think certainly this is important, from \nmy perspective--that I support a number of the concepts underlying the \nDole-Gingrich bill, concepts that I believe are imperfectly presented \nin its text, in other words, flawed.\n  Like the sponsors of that bill, I do not believe we can assume that \nno ballistic missile threat for the United States will emerge over the \nnext 15 years.\n  Like the sponsors, I believe there is some preemptive and deterrent \nvalue to deploying a national missile defense system to defend against \nlimited--I emphasize ``limited''--missile attacks even before the \nthreat, certainly the rogue nation threat, has fully emerged.\n  To understand the unwarranted cost of delay in deploying a limited \nnational missile defense system, I think we need only look at the \ndifficult situation today in the theater missile defense area. Our \ntheater missile defense systems arrived well after the short-range \nmissile threat in the Middle East had emerged. When the Persian Gulf \nwar began, Iraq had hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles at its \ndisposal, while we had a very limited antimissile capability \nessentially grafted onto the Patriot air defense system. We were \ngrateful for what we had. The results from Patriot defenses are still \nin some dispute--and certainly psychologically there was a big plus in \nhaving that system, and also militarily--but it is clear that the \nPatriot's performance did not resemble the ``astrodome'' defense that \nmany missile defense enthusiasts envision. We are still playing catchup \nball in the theater missile defense area, and we continue to do so \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, there are three parts to the threat that encourage us, \nfrom my perspective, to move forward on a prudent basis on a national \nmissile defense system.\n  First, there is a potential at some future time for deliberate, long-\nrange missile attacks from rogue nations. You can debate whether that \nis going to be in 5 years, 10 years, 2 years, 4 years. We all know that \nif certain powers in the world decided they wanted a rogue nation to \nhave a missile and a nuclear warhead, it could happen overnight. I do \nnot think that is likely because I do not think it is to Russia's \nbenefit or China's benefit, or anyone else that is a nuclear power, to \ndeliver a missile delivery system or a nuclear warhead to a rogue \nnation.\n  The second threat is the threat of accidental launch from existing \nnuclear powers. That accidental is exactly what we are talking about \nhere. We are not talking about deliberate in the second threat, but \naccidental.\n  There is a threat of unauthorized launch from existing nuclear \npowers.\n  Since the threat of accidental and unauthorized launches of long-\nrange missiles from both China and Russia exist today, I have no qualms \nabout advocating the development and deployment of an accelerated but \nsensible--and I underscore both words, ``accelerated but sensible''--\nbasis of a limited national defense capability.\n  The cost of that deployment can be viewed as a very reasonable \ninsurance premium, if it is a prudent program against the catastrophic \ndamage, the unimaginable loss of life that would result from even a \nsingle accidental or unauthorized nuclear missile aimed at an American \ncity. I must add, however, the caution that everyone contemplating an \ninsurance policy has to weigh the cost of the insurance premium against \nthe risk of loss. Then you have to decide whether the risk warrants the \npremium. That is the way you have to decide a number of things, both in \neveryday life as well as in the defense arena.\n\n  Today, as the CBO report makes plain, the cost of the Dole-Gingrich \nbill's insurance premium for national missile defense is quite high. \nTherefore, these have to be weighed carefully, each, in my view, \nseparately but also collectively.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I have some sympathy for \nsome of the underlying concepts of the Dole-Gingrich bill. \nUnfortunately, as drafted, the demerits of the Dole-Gingrich bill far \noutweigh its good features.\n  Once again, as with last year's abortive national missile defense \nprovisions, the Dole-Gingrich bill contains a series of egregious \nprovisions that have nothing to do with getting on with the deployment \nof this national defense system to defend America from limited attacks \nand much to do with the implied hopes of a few in this body that the \nentire thrust of arms control and cooperation with the Russian \nfederation can be reversed.\n  I certainly do not attribute that to everyone who supports this bill. \nBut I think there are some who believe we would be better off--and they \nbelieve this sincerely--if we tossed out START I, tossed out START II \nand simply went all out to provide defenses that would certainly have \nto be much more comprehensive, because the threat would grow greatly in \ncomparison to what would happen if we do carry out these arms control \nagreements that are underway.\n  Mr. President, I do not understand the logic that finds any advantage \naccrued to the United States from our acting to destroy the START II \nTreaty well before it enters into force and take down with it the ABM \nTreaty and probably the START I Treaty as well. I do not understand \nthat logic.\n  Before START, the former Soviet Union had over 13,000 strategic \nnuclear warheads aimed at us; once START II enters into force, that \ntotal will be reduced to only 3,000 to 3,500 warheads.\n  Mr. President, as I have already mentioned, the threat that we are \ntalking about has three prongs. One is, rogue nation. That is the \ndebating point about where that will develop. The other two prongs are \nalready here--accidental and unauthorized launch.\n  Does it not stand to reason there is much less chance of having an \naccidental or unauthorized launch if the Russians have moved down from \n13,000 warheads to 3,000 or to 3,500, even with a military that is \ndemoralized to some extent? Managing 3,000 to 3,500 warheads, if START \nII goes into effect and is implemented, is certainly a much more \nmanageable situation than managing 13,000 and greatly reduces the \nthreat that this national missile defense is aimed to prevent.\n  There is a direct connection between the START agreements being \nimplemented and the reduction of threat that the National Missile \nDefense Act is aimed at. If we can get a major reduction in threat by \ncarrying out arms control agreements, why would we want to disrupt that \npattern? These agreements were negotiated and signed not by President \nClinton or by President Carter but by President Reagan and by President \nBush.\n  Mr. President, does the Senate believe our defense budget will be \nsmaller if START II fails? Does the Senate believe a U.S. national \nmissile defense system sized to defend against START I force levels--\nwhich will be the levels if we disrupt the reduction; that will be what \nwe will be left with--do we believe missile defense systems sized to \ndefend against the force levels will be paid for by the Congress and \nthe American people? If so, it will be far bigger than any $30 to $60 \nbillion. That is for a limited system. That is for a limited system.\n  If we go back to START I levels or START II levels you can take that \nfigure and you can put a multiple on it. Does the Senate think the way \nto deploy limited missile defense capability is to pass, on a party-\nline vote, a bill that is certain to be vetoed? Is that somebody's idea \nof how you sustain a long-term program that will cost $30 to $60 \nbillion? In my opinion, that is not the way you proceed. Primarily, \nwhat we will do if we pass this bill and it is vetoed, we will be in a \nposture where a number of people can issue press releases, while yet \nanother legislative year passes. How many ballistic missiles can press \nreleases defend against? Not many.\n  Even if all the egregious language were removed from the Dole-\nGingrich\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\nbill, we would still be left with another fundamental problem. The \nDole-Gingrich bill violates most precepts of sound acquisition policy. \nThe Dole-Gingrich bill says we are going to decide today to deploy \n``something'' that can perhaps shoot down enemy long-range ballistic \nmissiles that might be launched at U.S. territory by the year 2003. The \npreferred NMD system is not even defined in the Dole-Gingrich bill. No \nprototype hardware exists. There is no test data to support a cost and \neffectiveness analysis. We have, at best, back-of-the-envelope cost and \n``schedule'' estimates provided by NMD developers to the ballistic \nmissile defense organization. These developers' cost estimates are much \nlower than those provided by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice. I have seen a lot of weapons procured, and I have never seen a \nweapons developer overestimate the cost of the weapon. Just the \nreverse. I have seen almost every developer underestimate what it will \ncost. Of course that is their incentive.\n  Let me ask my colleagues, would we rely on defense contractors to \ntell us the cost of a new aircraft program, a new submarine program, or \na new armored vehicle program? Would we rely on contractors, unchecked, \nsolely, to tell us how soon the system would be operational? Would we \nlegislate procurement of aircraft, ships, or armored vehicles, without \nknowing the outcome of research, development, testing, and evaluation? \nWould we commit to deployment without independent review of the testing \ndone by the developer? Of course not. Of course we use the information \na developer gives us, but we do enough testing and evaluation so we get \nan independent analysis.\n  That is the only sound, prudent way to buy any system, let alone a \nsystem that has this kind of revolutionary technology. Yet many of our \ncolleagues appear ready to buy the Dole-Gingrich bill's proverbial pig \nin a poke, based on the back-of-the-envelope calculations, with no test \ndata on any aspect of the system in hand today.\n\n  Mr. President, it would be a sad day for this body if we abandon our \ncommitment to fly before we buy. Why would the Senate abandon its \nrequirement that it will commit major funding to deploy complex major \nweapon systems only after adequate test and evaluation has been \nconducted? I do not understand how anyone can argue that the deployment \nmandate in the Dole--Gingrich bill constitutes responsible oversight \nand stewardship of the taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to address the administration's NMD \nProgram which may be offered as a substitute to the Dole-Gingrich bill. \nDespite all the sound and fury that will accompany the debate over the \nDole-Gingrich bill, the fact is that the end points of it and the \nadministration's ``3-plus-3'' --3 years of development followed by 3 \nyears of deployment--these programs are really quite similar. Both \nsupport extensive R on national missile defenses. Both provide the \nprospect of a deployed national missile defense system by the end of \nthe year 2003. The main differences are that the administration plans \nto carry out the development and testing of the components of an NMD \nsystem for 3 more years while complying with the ABM Treaty and then \nconsider whether or not to deploy that system, while the Dole-Gingrich \nbill commits us by law to a deployment decision on a noncompliant \nsystem today. By ``noncompliant'' I mean with existing treaty \nobligations of the countries.\n  While I am in agreement with much of the administration's program, I \nfind that there are several omissions that, were they included, would \nmaterially strengthen the proposal. My major concern with the \nadministration's proposal is the absence of any real criteria for \nevaluating 3 years hence whether or not the time has come to end \ndevelopment and start deployment. Significant among the considerations \nof that point should be, it seems to me, whether the threat--and by \nthis, I mean one-third of the threat, the rogue nation threat--has \nmatured as rapidly as we expected it would. Certainly we will know more \nas the years unfold. We recognize additional time spent in development \nusually leads to improved system performance, but it can also lead in \nmany cases to much cheaper ways of achieving the desired objectives. \nFor example, the administration's program also does not portray how \nmuch more effective or how much cheaper an NMD system might be if we \nwere to defer deployment for an additional finite period, say 3 more \nyears, if they were to conclude that the severity of the threat--in my \nview, the rogue nation threat, although the administration, which is \nwhere I differ significantly, they define the threat as only the rogue \nnation threat; I define that as one of the threats, the other two being \naccidental and unauthorized, and that threat is already here--if they \nwere to conclude the severity of the rogue nation threat does not \nrequire an immediate deployment.\n  Mr. President, we have to consider all of these threats in assessing \nwhether the risk is worth the premium or whether there are other ways \nwe could spend the premium money to enhance our security more than will \nenhance it with this type system. That is the balance that is missing \nin this bill.\n  Mr. President, earlier I used the analogy of buying insurance in \ndiscussing the threat to the United States from attack by nuclear \nweapons delivered by long-range missiles. I noted that one must \nconsider the cost of the insurance premium and the risk of loss. Many \nview the creation of nuclear weapons a half-century ago as the event \nthat cracked open Pandora's box, allowing evils to escape, namely \nnuclear weapons. Increasingly, however, we are recognizing that the end \nof the cold war has ripped the lid off the box.\n\n  We have seen an attempt to use chemical weapons during the World \nTrade Center bombing, we have seen actual use of sarin gas in the Tokyo \nsubway. In our subcommittee, Senator Roth and I had a substantial \nnumber of hearings on that subject. We have seen the ugly face of \ndomestic terrorism in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City and the tragedy that ensued from that, the \nChechen rebels in Russia conceal deadly radiological sources in a \nMoscow park, in effect, making a very clear and visible threat of using \nradiological weapons. That is, nuclear weapon materials being dispersed \nwithout an explosion. We have seen a sharply growing number of arrests \nof shady characters bringing fissionable materials out of Russia and \nother member States of the former Soviet Union.\n  In summary, Mr. President, America's citizens today face an array of \npotential and actual threats from many kinds of weapons of mass \ndestruction, not simply being delivered by ballistic missile. Some of \nthese threats can emerge at home, others can come from abroad, by a \nvariety of means and in many guises. This Nation, today, is singularly \nunprepared for any sort of terrorist threat employing chemical, \nbiological or radiological weapons of mass destruction. We have all \nsorts of vulnerabilities that we are just beginning to pay some \nattention to.\n  Mr. President, this raises, again, the question of what risks America \ncan afford to pay to insure against, and how much America can afford to \npay for insurance of all kinds. What are the priorities we should \nattach to improving our capabilities to defend against each of these \nthreats, including but not limited to the threat of long-range missiles \narmed with nuclear weapons? Are we providing funding to deal with each \nof these different threats in accordance with our level of preparedness \nand the imminence of the threats, or are we overfunding some of the \nthreats while starving and completely ignoring others? Does the Dole \nbill represent the equivalent of an expensive life insurance policy \nthat only ensures against death from shark attacks and lightning \nstrikes, but does not provide coverage against more fundamental \nproblems, such as heart attack and cancer?\n\n  Since we are spending so little and are so unprepared for terrorist \nattacks on our cities, using chemical, biological, or radiological \nweapons, should we not be checking out the costs of a more \ncomprehensive and less expensive insurance policy than the Dole-\nGingrich bill?\n  In fact, Mr. President, Senator Lugar, Senator Domenici, and I have \nspent a great deal of time in recent months and years, and we plan to \nintroduce an amendment on the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization \nbill when it is brought up on the floor later this month to address \nmany of these areas of America's unpreparedness in a\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\ncomprehensive way, dealing particularly with the domestic threat of \nchemical and biological weapons being used against our cities and \nagainst our citizens.\n  Mr. President, also--and this is a separate matter that Senator Lugar \nand Senator Domenici are not involved in, and I want to make that \nclear--I intend to offer a substitute during this debate if the Dole-\nGingrich bill is considered by the Senate. My substitute will include a \nnumber of modifications and omissions I have previously noted in this \npresentation today, including--and this is just the highlights or the \nfundamental parts of this substitute--No. 1, the specification of a \ntreaty-compliant national missile defense system to be developed for \ndeployment at Grand Forks, consistent with an additional operation \ncapacity in 2003.\n  Again, the words ``developed for deployment'' is different from \ndeployment, and that is a fundamental difference. It means develop so \nwe can be prepared, with logical reasoning, to decide whether and when \nto deploy--after we know whether it will work, after we know how much \nit is going to cost.\n  By the way, that would be, as I said, a treaty-compliant system \nbecause, under the ABM Treaty, we are allowed to have a missile defense \nsystem at Grand Forks, and, of course, the Russians have had one around \nMoscow for some time.\n  No. 2, a statement of the criteria to be considered in any future \ndeployment decision, including the threat, the cost and effectiveness \nof the deployed system against that threat based on demonstrated test \nresults, the cost differential and gain and effectiveness of the \ndeployed system, if it were to continue to be developed an additional \nperiod of 1 to 3 years. In other words, can we make quantum leaps in \neffectiveness and in reducing costs if we take another year or two to \ndevelop it? That has to be measured against a threat at the appropriate \ntime. We cannot make that judgment now.\n  Also, the effect on deployment of reducing the threat against the \nUnited States through arms control measures: Should we not consider the \neffect on START I and START II? Should we think about that? And also \nincluding our relative preparedness for other contingencies involving \nthe threat and use of weapons of mass destruction, including, as I \nmentioned, chemical and biological attacks against American cities.\n  The third part of this substitute will be an inclusion of a provision \nestablishing a procedure to permit a vote by both Houses of the 106th \nCongress on the deployment of the treaty-compliant national missile \ndefense system described in my proposal, with that vote constructed as \na privileged motion under expedited procedures. Mr. President, this \nwould say that at a time certain we will vote, we will decide, but we \nwill do it on a time scale where we have the information before we make \nthe decision, not after we make the decision.\n\n  No. 4, a provision urging that the President seek, cooperatively with \nRussia, to rescind the 1974 protocol to the ABM Treaty and make modest \nconforming changes to allow both sides 2 national defense sites and up \nto 200 interceptors. Mr. President, that was the original ABM Treaty, \nand the protocol cut 2 sites and 200 interceptors to 1 site and 100 \ninterceptors. This would be saying to those who believe that the ABM \nTreaty and everything about it is sacred--and I do not--we will go back \nto the original ABM Treaty, which permitted 2 sites and 200 \ninterceptors. This would greatly improve the effectiveness of the \nUnited States and Russia against limited attacks by long-range \nballistic missiles, without threatening either side's deterrent \ncapabilities or either side's perception of having deterrence to a \nfirst-strike by the other side.\n  Mr. President, the fifth provision is a provision urging continued \ncooperation with Russia and other States on the full spectrum of \nthreats involving weapons of mass destruction. Mr. President, we have \njust received word that the last nuclear warhead has been taken out of \nthe Ukraine and moved to Russia. This is the best example of reducing \nthe threat against the United States by means other than military \nhardware. We are using the so-called unn-Lugar money to reduce the \nthreat. If anybody thinks it is easier to deal with four nuclear \nStates, four different hands on the nuclear trigger, four different \ncommand and controls, four different sets of officers, all aiming \nmissiles at the United States or at other allies in the world, then I \nthink they need to rethink their position.\n  What we have been able to do in the last 2 or 3 years, with stalwart \nwork by Secretary Perry and others in the Department of Defense, we \nhave been able to get three of the former parts of the Soviet Union \nthat ended up with nuclear weapons--Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine--\nto give up all their nuclear weapons. The Ukraine's last warhead has \njust moved out. I think that demonstrates the comprehensive kind of \napproach that we have to have in dealing with this problem.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a sixth component, and a very important part \nof this overall substitute, would be calling for greater United States-\nRussian cooperation in such areas as sharing improved missile detection \nand warning data. If successful, this cooperation, particularly joined \nwith the amendments to the ABM Treaty, which should be mutually agreed \non--we always have the right to basically serve notice that we are \ngetting out from under the treaties if Russia will not negotiate in \ngood faith--but, if successful, the combination of having the ability \nto go back to the original ABM Treaty and have two sites, and also \njoint development programs for advanced theater missile defense \nsystems, since we and Russia face similar theater missile defense \nthreats--Russia probably greater than we face that kind of threat--that \nkind of combination could put us on the road to a different kind of \nrelationship with Russia. Obviously, the extent of such cooperation may \nwell be dependent upon the outcome of the Russian elections and the \nfuture direction of the Russian Government. At this point, that is \nunknown.\n  Mr. President, in summary, I believe my amendment, when it is \nintroduced, can provide the basis for a strong, bipartisan bill, \nallowing us to move forward with the national missile defense \ncapability against limited attack. I have no doubt that some in this \nbody will not support this approach because it does not have enough of \na flavor of immediate deployment before we know cost affordability, \ntechnical systems, and how they work. So some people will not favor it \nbecause of that and also because it does not lead to necessarily \nabandoning the ABM Treaty. Others will dismiss, from the other point of \nview, all threats of missile attack on the United States, and they will \noppose it because this substitute is too forward leaning. We could end \nup, on this substitute, with only one vote, and that might be mine. It \nmay be one of those classic squeezes where everybody is opposed to it \nfor different reasons.\n\n  I hope that is not accurate. I hope that many in the coalition that \nsupported last year's bipartisan amendment, by a vote of 85 to 13, will \nbe able to support this amendment, which I think can provide us the \nright road to reduce the overall threat against the United States, to \nprovide for an orderly and logical sequence of decisionmaking in the \nnational missile defense area, and also provide for a method of \nretaining the constructive parts of the ABM Treaty, by having modest \namendments to that treaty in a cooperative way, and also providing for \nincreased cooperation between the United States and Russia, in \nrecognizing that we both, to some extent, face the same kind of threat. \nIt would behoove both of us to work together in protecting our people \nand our citizens.\n  Mr. President, for a long time to come, the Russians, even if we get \nSTART I and START II, are still going to have enough capacity, in 30 \nminutes to an hour's time, to destroy most of the United States.\n  I think in considering that equation--and that is even if we pass the \nDole-Gingrich bill, and even if everything works out and it is \naffordable, even if it is technically feasible and even if we begin \ndeploying it in 2003, we are going to have a period of many years while \nwe remain vulnerable to an attack by the Russians against the United \nStates.\n  For that reason I think everybody better pay careful attention to the \nway we go about reducing this overall threat of rogue nations and \naccidental\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\nunauthorized launch. The way we go about it can produce a much safer \nAmerica. But it can also, if we go about it in the wrong way, cause a \ngreat deal of increased risk to our citizens because of the continuing \nthreat of existing nuclear powers, and, even if we have arms control \nand if it works perfectly, that threat is going to remain for a long \ntime to come.\n  Mr. President, many people do not realize it. But, if we were to \nagree right now with the Russians, the Chinese, the French, the \nBritish, and everybody else in the world to abolish all nuclear weapons \nfrom the face of the Earth, it would take years and years and years to \nbe able to negotiate something that would be verifiable. And then it \nwould take years and years to reduce the number of warheads and \nmissiles. It would take a long, long time.\n  So we are going to be living with this nuclear equation for a long \nnumber of years to come, even under the best of circumstances. And I \nthink it is in our interest to proceed in a very logical and a very \nprudent fashion as to how we go about protecting America's national \nsecurity and protecting the land that we love.\n\n                              [Exhibit 1]\n\n                     Defending America Against WMD\n\n               (By Robert G. Bell, Senior Director, NSC)\n\n       It is always a pleasure for me to come back to the Hill, \n     and a special pleasure to be here only a week or so before \n     ``Defend America Week'' in the House and Senate. The \n     Administration is delighted that both Houses are going to \n     take time out of their busy schedules to focus on the state \n     of our Nation's defenses. But I want to make it clear that \n     for the Administration, defending America is not something we \n     concentrate on one week out of the year. Defending America is \n     what we're about day in and day out.\n       This morning I would like to address one important aspect \n     of our strategy for defending America, and that is defense \n     against the growing danger of weapons of mass destruction \n     (WMD). On April 25th the Secretary of Defense addressed this \n     topic in a comprehensive fashion in a speech at George \n     Washington University, and I recommend that speech to you. As \n     he noted, the Administration has erected three lines of \n     defense against weapons of mass destruction. I agree with the \n     point Senator Cochran makes in his Post op-ed today that \n     there should not be an ``either/or'' choice between these \n     three lines of defense: we need all three.\n       The first line of defense is prevention--or what Secretary \n     Perry has called ``defense by other means.'' This line of \n     defense includes ratifying and entering into force START I \n     and START II, which together will remove from active \n     inventories two-thirds of the strategic nuclear weapons that \n     threatened us at the height of the Cold War.\n       It includes ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention, \n     which we look forward to seeing on the Senate floor in the \n     near future now that it has been overwhelmingly approved by \n     the Foreign Relations Committee.\n       It includes achieving the indefinite and unconditional \n     extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, strengthening the \n     IAEA and MTCR, negotiating the nuclear framework accord with \n     North Korea, and signing two nuclear-free zone treaties \n     which, together with the Antarctica and South American \n     agreements, now mean that over half the land area of the \n     earth is denuclearized.\n       These agreements, in tandem with the ``true-zero'' \n     Comprehensive Test Ban treaty we intend to have ready for \n     signature by September, establish strict restrictions on the \n     further proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n       It includes the US/Russian detargeting agreement the \n     President reached with President Yeltsin, which ensures that \n     if--God forbid--a nuclear missile should ever be launched \n     accidentally, it would cause no harm. And it includes the \n     invaluable Nunn-Lugar program for directly removing nuclear \n     capabilities.\n       As Michael Krepon has underscored in testimony and in his \n     published writings, it is unfortunate that while Congress is \n     increasing budget accounts for missile defense by hundreds of \n     millions, many on the Hill have restricted or even cut \n     funding for these preventive programs, and some have \n     staunchly opposed the arms control treaties I mentioned.\n       The second line of defense against weapons of mass \n     destruction is deterrence, both at the conventional and \n     nuclear level. Any rogue nation foolish enough to contemplate \n     using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against the \n     United States, its Armed Forces or our allies must not be \n     confused about how we would respond. As Secretary Perry \n     stated, it would be ``devastating'' and ``absolutely \n     overwhelming.''\n       The President has made clear in three successive annual \n     National Security Strategy Reports the plain fact that this \n     Administration believes, fundamentally, in maintaining a \n     robust and credible nuclear deterrent. Not because we believe \n     Russia is going to attack us today, tomorrow, next week, next \n     month, next year. But because we face an uncertain future and \n     an uncertain world, and keeping our nuclear forces strong is \n     a prudent hedge. That is why we decided to maintain the \n     triad. That is why we decided to backfit the D-5 SLBM into \n     our Trident submarines. And that is why the President \n     recently decided that we are not going to go below START I \n     levels until Russia ratifies the START II treaty.\n       The third line of defense is compromised by our theater and \n     national missile defense programs, on which the Defense \n     Department is spending $3 billion a year. As Secretary \n     Perry stated, our ballistic missile defense program starts \n     with a sober and clear-eyed look at the missile threat. \n     What is that threat?\n       First, there is the short-range missile threat, which is \n     here and now. That threat includes SCUDs and other missiles \n     with ranges below 1000 kilometers. To defend against such \n     attacks we have deployed upgraded Patriots in various \n     theaters around the world and are poised to deploy in the \n     next few years more advanced PAC-3 and Navy Lower Tier TMDs.\n       Second is the emerging threat of more advanced, longer-\n     range theater ballistic missiles. To counter these expected \n     threats we are developing the Army THAAD and the Navy Upper \n     Tier TMDs, with deployment planned after the end of the \n     decade and, in the case of THAAD, a contingency deployment of \n     40 prototype interceptors available as soon as two years from \n     now.\n       As this audience well knows, Congress and the \n     Administration have disagreed over the pace of these two \n     programs and our approach to the arms control dimension of \n     both systems. Congress wants to go faster; we say we have the \n     time to get it right. We say we should not build so much \n     concurrency into the programs that we increase technical risk \n     inordinately. On the arms control front, we are trying, in a \n     cooperative fashion with Russia, to make clear that the ABM \n     Treaty does not restrict TMD systems that have a hypothetical \n     capability under certain scenarios to intercept certain \n     strategic ballistic missiles. In this regard, we were \n     encouraged by the understandings on ABM/TMD demarcation \n     reached at last month's summit in Moscow. But as Secretary \n     Perry emphasized, ``our bottom line is that we will not give \n     up the right to defend our troops from attack by theater \n     ballistic missiles.''\n       The third threat is the prospect that a rogue state will \n     obtain a strategic ballistic missile that could threaten our \n     homeland. When do we expect that could occur? This brings us \n     to the recent National Intelligence Estimate--the now-famous \n     NIE. That NIE says, as has been stated in open testimony, \n     that the intelligence community does not believe it is likely \n     that we will face an ICBM or SLBM threat from a rogue nation \n     to the continental United States (CONUS) within the next 15 \n     years. In the special case of Alaska and Hawaii--which we \n     obviously recognize as full partners in this union of fifty \n     states--the CIA has said, in a public letter to Senators \n     Levin and Bumpers, that the intelligence community does not \n     think that the North Korean Taepo Dong II, which might have \n     the range to reach western Hawaii or parts of Alaska, will be \n     operational within the next 5 years. Let me take each of \n     those cases in turn.\n       First, why ``15 years'' in terms of a threat to CONUS? It \n     is important to understand that this was not a case of \n     building the threat from the bottom up, of starting now and \n     going out in time year by year to see how far you could go \n     before everyone agreed a threat was likely to emerge. Rather, \n     the analysts decided that the 15 year mark was the most \n     relevant point in time in terms of being useful to the policy \n     and acquisition communities. They could have picked the 10 \n     year mark, but since weapons systems have a 12-15 year \n     acquisition period, that would have been too soon. And they \n     could have picked 20 or 25 years, but that would have been \n     too speculative. So they decided to ask themselves what they \n     thought the situation would look like in 15 years.\n       Did the NIE ignore possible short-cuts that a country might \n     pursue as an alternative to an indigenous, bottom-up ICBM or \n     SLBM development, test and acquisition process? No. It looked \n     at such alternatives as a rogue state buying, stealing or \n     otherwise getting possession of a complete missile. They did \n     not say it could not happen; that it was impossible. But they \n     did judge that possibility to be remote or very low.\n       Did the Administration take comfort from the 15 year \n     estimate and conclude we did not need to do anything before \n     then? No. We are developing an NMD deployment option that \n     could be fielded by 2003, eight years--I repeat, eight years, \n     in advance of the estimate. I will have more to say about our \n     program in a minute.\n       Did the NIE ignore the Alaska/Hawaii threats? No. That \n     analysis is in there. In this case, the picture is less \n     clear. But both the Air Force and the Army have on their own \n     initiative put together quick response, treaty-complaint, \n     relatively low cost deployment options that could defend \n     Alaska and Hawaii against an attack involving just a few \n     warheads. These options would be uniquely effective, and I \n     would say exclusively effective, against just this kind of \n     scenario: a North Korea that acquires a handful of missiles \n     sooner than expected.\n       Finally, was the NIE ``politicized'', as has been charged? \n     I will tell you categorically that the answer to that is \n     ``no.'' I say that for two reasons. First, the first I knew \n     that there was an NIE coming out on this issue was when I \n     came to work one morning and found it in my in-box. Anyone \n     who thinks that someone at the White House could call up the \n     CIA and order them to produce a\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\n     ``helpful'' NIE without the NSC knowing about it knows \n     nothing about how the Executive Branch works. The second \n     reason is that the 15 year estimate was a unanimous judgment \n     among the various elements of the intelligence community. \n     This was not a case of a ``footnoted'' estimate, where some \n     organizations said one thing and others said another and the \n     Administration decided to pick the most favorable view. \n     Rather, all organizations that participated in the NIE \n     were in agreement, and it was not a close call.\n       So, that it is our plan and our program. But our critics \n     are supporting another approach, embodied now in the bill \n     introduced by the Majority Leader and the Speaker, and we are \n     about to engage in a great debate on this issue.\n       I want to be clear about the critical differences between \n     the Dole-Gingrich bill and the substitute that Mr. Spratt \n     offered that lost narrowly in committee and will be voted on \n     again on the floor, and the substitute bill that I understand \n     Senator Nunn is preparing for introduction in the Senate.\n       The first critical difference, as Secretary Perry \n     emphasized in his speech at GW, is a question of timing. The \n     Dole-Gingrich bill says choose the NMD architecture now and \n     deploy it independent of what happens with the threat. Our \n     plan is to develop a deployment option, assess the threat in \n     three years, and examine the deployment requirement on a \n     year-by-year basis starting in 2000. Either approach would \n     allow a system to be fielded by 2003. But ours offers the \n     prospect, if the threat does not materialize sooner than we \n     expect, of saving the large sums now and across the Future \n     Years Defense Plan (FYDP) that would be required to build and \n     deploy a national missile defense.\n       How much would we save? Frankly, it is hard to say. Senator \n     Dole said he did not know how much his plan would cost. That \n     is because the Dole-Gingrich bill embraces such a wide range \n     of possible architectures that it is impossible to estimate \n     what the bill would cost. But if you take the most \n     conservative option--that is, a two-site land-based ABM \n     defense--that would cost on the order of $20 billion in \n     acquisition and operating and support costs. That is $20 \n     billion that is not in the FYDP or the Military Services' \n     outyear budgets. That is $20 billion that would compete with \n     Service procurement requirements that we and the Chiefs agree \n     have a higher priority. That is why the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff and the Chiefs oppose any significant \n     increase in spending on ballistic missile defenses and have \n     recommended that current levels be maintained.\n       I think it is interesting that some Members have held up \n     copies of leaked memos from General Shali and read from those \n     portions in which he and the Chiefs made recommendations with \n     regard to procurement levels, but then have not gone on to \n     read those portions in which the Chairman and the Chiefs \n     recommend against spending more on missile defenses.\n       The second critical difference, quite frankly, is that, at \n     least for some of its backers the Dole-Gingrich bill is a \n     stalking horse for a return to a Reagan-era SDI, and our \n     program is not. Let me illustrate that with five points.\n       Point One: The bill specifically embraces much of the \n     Reagan-era ``Star Wars'' scheme.\n       The bill would direct the Secretary of Defense to deploy a \n     national missile defense (NMD) by 2003 that includes one or \n     more of four ABM interceptor options, three of which involve \n     putting ABM weapons or sensors in space in violation of the \n     ABM Treaty:\n       The bill recommends that the Secretary consider an NMD \n     based on space-based laser (SBLs). To ``defend America'' with \n     SBLs would require, at a minimum, a constellation of 17 \n     orbiting weapons platforms, at a cost of tens of billions of \n     dollars that is not in the FYDP. In addition, there is at \n     present no launcher in the U.S. inventory capable of placing \n     a platform of this size and weight in orbit, thus billions \n     more would be required to develop and produce such rockets. \n     Although the SASC plussed up the SBL line in its version of \n     the FY 1997 defense authorization act by $101 million, BMDO \n     believes that even if money were unlimited, the SBL \n     technology is currently so immature that we could not expect \n     to be ready to carry out the first test of a full-scale \n     prototype for a decade. Yet the Dole-Gingrich bill suggests \n     we would conduct a first ``integrated systems test'' of the \n     entire system in two years and complete the deployment of the \n     whole constellation in seven.\n       A second option the bill recommends to the Secretary is \n     space-based kinetic-kill interceptors. To ``defend America'' \n     with such orbiting rocket launchers would require \n     resurrection of the SDI-era ``Brilliant Pebbles'' program, \n     which was terminated several years ago. As with SBLs, an NMD \n     that provided nationwide coverage from Hawaii to Maine would \n     require deployment of a large constellation of orbiting \n     weapons platforms that would cost tens of billions of \n     dollars. If the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' program was reactivated \n     today, BMDO believes the first interceptors would not be \n     tested for three years and deployment would take much longer, \n     yet the bill suggests there is a viable option to have a \n     complete space-based kinetic kill NMD defense in place by \n     2003.\n       Sea-based ABMs: This third option would also violate the \n     ABM Treaty. The bill recommends the Secretary deploy such a \n     defense by 2003, yet we do not even have such an NMD program \n     in R Navy Upper Tier is a TMD, and upgrading it is an ABM \n     would require development and deployment of space-based \n     ABM battle management satellites that could replace the \n     radars on the Aegis-clear ships. Such ABM ``components''--\n     which were a central element of Reagan-era SDI \n     architectures--would violate the ABM Treaty.\n       Point Two: Ignoring the space-based options in the bill \n     requires a willing suspension of disbelief.\n       The only one of the four options recommended to the \n     Secretary for deployment by 2003 that is allowed under the \n     ABM Treaty and coincides with current DoD NMD development \n     programs is ground-based interceptors. Deployment of 100 such \n     interceptors at a single site is permitted. But if a ground-\n     based ABM is what the sponsors of the bill want the Secretary \n     to develop, why doesn't the bill just say so? Why does it \n     also endorse the other three options? The answer is that \n     there are influential defense experts backing this bill who \n     fervently believe that land-based ABMs would be a mistake and \n     that putting weapons in space is the only way to go. For \n     these experts, the original Reagan plan was right, and \n     everything that has happened since, including President \n     Bush's downgrading of SDI to a limited-defense oriented \n     ``GPALS'' has been a mistake.\n       Point Three: The bill requires that the initial NMD \n     deployment ``will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense against larger and more sophisticated ballistic \n     missile threats''.\n       The reference to a ``layered'' defense against ``larger'' \n     threats is code for a return to the original Reagan-era \n     ``astrodome'' SDI concept for stopping even an all-out \n     Russian nuclear strike.\n       Point Four: The bill would state that ``it is the policy of \n     the United States to seek a cooperative transition to a \n     regime that does not feature an offense-only form of \n     deterrence as the basis for strategic stability.''\n       This text restates vintage Reagan-era SDI ideology: the \n     idea, often articulated by the former President, that Mutual \n     Assured Destruction (MAD) is ``immoral'' and that we should \n     replace it with an impenetrable missile shield that would \n     allow us to dramatically reduce strategic offensive arms. In \n     its most extreme form, we would ``give'' SDI to the Russians \n     so we could both erect such shields in space and eliminate \n     all our nuclear weapons.\n       Point Five: The bill concedes that the NMD that it requires \n     be deployed by 2003 requires amendment of the ABM Treaty, but \n     it mandates that if Russia does not agree to such amendments \n     ``within one year'' we consider withdrawing from the Treaty:\n       The bill requires a ``highly effective'' defense that \n     ``optimizes'' protection of CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii against \n     limited missile attacks, including accidental or unauthorized \n     launches. Acknowledging that these criteria cannot be \n     satisfied within the Treaty as now constituted, the bill \n     directs the President to obtain amendments that would allow \n     an NMD of this level of effectiveness to be deployed.\n       The one-year deadline in the bill to achieve these \n     amendments is not arbitrary, since, as noted, the bill \n     requires a full-up systems integration test in two years of \n     the NMD system that is to be deployed by 2003, and such tests \n     could only take place after we had entered the development \n     phase of the acquisition process. Any development or test of \n     a space-based laser, space-based kinetic kill interceptor, \n     sea-based ABM or multiple-site ground-based ABM system would \n     violate the Treaty. Thus the time-lines established in the \n     bill could, in the case of at least three of the NMD options \n     it recommends the Secretary consider, only be met if the U.S. \n     obtained the necessary treaty relief within a year.\n       In light of clear Russia opposition to any such amendments, \n     the bill would be seen by Russia as tantamount to an \n     ``anticipatory breach'' of the Treaty, thereby putting at \n     immediate risk Russia reductions of strategic offensive arms \n     under START I and START II. By holding a gun to the Russians' \n     heads and demanding amendments within a year, the bill \n     reflects an antipathy to the ABM Treaty reminiscent of \n     Reagan-era ``Star Wars'' thinking. But in so doing, we stand \n     to forfeit what otherwise would be a two-thirds reduction in \n     Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal.\n       In conclusion, let me say that I spent eighteen years on \n     the Hill: six at CRS working for both parties, four on the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee working for a Republican \n     majority, and eight on the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     working first for a Democratic minority and then a Democratic \n     majority. And the hallmark of those years was a spirit of \n     bipartisanship and compromise when it came to important \n     issues affecting our national security. I know that that \n     spirit was still alive on the Hill as recently as last \n     August, when Senator Nunn and Senator Warner, joined by \n     Senator Levin and Senator Cohen, worked out a bipartisan \n     compromise on missile defense policy that was supported by \n     the Administration. That compromise passed the Senate with 86 \n     Senator voting ``aye.''\n       As we begin Defend America week, I hope we will not be \n     debating a bumper sticker slogan. Rather I hope we will have \n     an honest and objective debate on missile defense policy and \n     that a spirit of bipartisanship and compromise will again be \n     evident.\n       Thank you.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by the Senator from \nGeorgia, and will not attempt to discuss them this evening since the \nhour is late except to note one thing; that is, that while reasonable \npeople can differ about some of the elements of the bill, as I noted in \nmy remarks and the Senator from Georgia noted to the point that maybe \nsome people are more interested in a press release or the issue than \nactually getting it passed, I just ask our colleagues tomorrow when the \ncloture vote comes to put us to the test and allow us to at least have \na vote on the bill. We would like to get it passed. I would much rather \nmove forward with the bill, get it to the President so he can sign it, \nor veto it as the case may be, but at least to try to move forward with \nthe issue. If the cloture vote is supported, and if the bill is \ndefeated, then at least the body will have worked its way. But at least \nI would like to have people take yes for an answer, and yes in this \ncase meaning that we are serious about moving forward and we would like \nto try to get something passed.\n  So again I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion tomorrow.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will my friend yield briefly?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely. I am happy to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I hope the Senator from Arizona will not exclude the \npossibility of continuing to have a dialog in this area to see if we \ncan reach something that can be signed by the President this year. That \nis my goal. I think that is possible. But it is not likely the way we \nare going at this point in time.\n  I also add that, as the Senator may know, there has been an offer at \nleast from some of us on this side. I will be careful how I word this. \nI am not sure who has signed off on it. That is at the leadership level \nnow--an offer to have a vote on this bill so we do as the Senator \nindicated and come to some conclusion even if it goes to the White \nHouse and is later vetoed; but also to get a similar agreement on the \nchemical weapons treaty which has come out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee by a bipartisan vote. I think there are substantial numbers \nof Republican Senators who support that treaty. It is of enormous \nimportance to a number of people in this body.\n\n  I think myself it will enhance our ability to deal with the growing \nthreat of chemical weapons. And there is certainly a willingness by \nmany people on this side of the aisle--certainly I speak for myself--to \nmake sure that we get a vote on both of these bills this year; that is, \nthe missile defense and the chemical weapons treaties.\n  I might add though that if there is no movement on the chemical \nweapons treaty and getting some time certain to deal with that, I think \nit is unlikely that there is going to be much movement by a number of \nour colleagues to have a vote on the National Missile Defense Act and \nsubstitutes thereto. I would like to get it up myself because I would \nlike to debate the substitute as I have outlined here today. There may \nbe another substitute that is pretty much identical to the \nadministration's proposal. My substitute will differ in certain \nrespects from the administration's preposition.\n  So it is my hope that we can get both of these matters--both the \nNational Missile Defense Act, as well as the chemical weapons treaty, \nup. I hope the Senator will work toward that end also.\n  Mr. KYL. In response, I hope the Senator from Georgia is not \nsuggesting that the National Missile Defense Act is being held hostage \nto bringing up the chemical weapons treaty because the two are not \nlinked, and there are a lot of us who believe that whether or not we \ncould pass the chemical weapons treaty this year--and there is still \nmore work to be done to that in the Judiciary Committee on which I sit \nwhich has not held hearings yet, given the fact we do not have a lot of \nlegislative time in this session, that there is more to be done on that \nbill--I hope the Senator from Georgia is not suggesting that until we \nact on that we cannot act on this important matter of national missile \ndefense.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator from Georgia is suggesting that there are a \nnumber of people in this body--and I am sure, whether it is 36, or 40, \nor 25, or 15--who want to make sure that we pass the chemical weapons \ntreaty, or at least vote on it. It requires a two-thirds vote. If there \nis a one-third part against it, it will not pass anyway. And I say \nthere are a number of people who would indeed tie those two together \nsince both are deemed by a number of people with different reasons and \ndifferent perspectives as important to national security.\n  Mr. KYL. It would be unfortunate if the two were required to be tied \ntogether and we could not act on the National Missile Defense Act, in \nmy view anyway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5672-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5690-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5690-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3322.

further \ndevelopment of lands associated with that spectacular national wonder. \nThe language of this bill should be noncontroversial and little--if \nany--expense would be entailed.\n  I also wish

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of a group of young men from my home State of Idaho. \nLewis-Clark State College's baseball team won a record ninth National \nAssociation of Intercollegiate Athletics World Series title last \nFriday, beating St. Ambrose University of Iowa in the championship \ngame, 9-0.\n  The ninth title in the past 13 years continues a tradition at Lewis-\nClark State under head coach Ed Cheff. Under Coach Cheff, the Warriors \nhave won more NAIA World Series games and played in more national \nchampionships than any other school. They won six straight titles \nbetween 1987 and 1992.\n  Cheff's latest team finished the 1996 season with an outstanding \nrecord of 53 wins and only 11 losses, and they were a perfect 5-0 in \nthe double-elimination tournament. In the title game, played \nappropriately enough at Lewis and Clark Park in Sioux City, IO, \nFreshman Matt Randel pitched a 4-hitter while striking out 10 and not \nwalking a batter. Such a performance fit his season, as he finished the \nyear with an 8-0 pitching mark. Pitching was the key to the Warriors' \ntitle, as the staff set a record for the lowest earned run average in \ntournament history, allowing less than a run a game.\n  The Warrior bats came alive in the title game, as LCSC banged out 18 \nhits, including 3 each by Jose Rijo-Berger, Art Baeza, and Troy Silva. \nTrent Lies hit a solo home run.\n  The Warriors started the season ranked No. 1 in the NAIA, and \nfinished with a season-high 15-game winning streak, including the 5 \ngames in the tournament. In its 17 appearances in the national \nchampionships, Lewis-Clark State has won an incredible 72 games, while \nlosing only 20.\n  This season, Coach Cheff posted his 1,000th win at LCSC, making him \nonly the third NAIA coach to ever reach that milestone. He has been \nnamed national coach of the year four times and was honored as NAIA \nCoach of the Decade for the 1980's. The record on the field speaks \nvolumes about Ed Cheff. But off the field his accomplishments are just \nas remarkable.\n  LCSC has produced 8 NAIA Academic All-Americans and has placed 34 \nplayers on All-American teams. And Ed Cheff and his Warriors have, over \nthe years, become a rallying point for the community of Lewiston. \nThousands of fans have attended games at Harris Field, and they have \nestablished a network of community support unrivaled at any level.\n  Mr. President, I know the U.S. Senate joins me and all of Idaho in \ncongratulating Ed Cheff and the baseball players at Lewis-Clark State \nCollege for continuing their outstanding winning tradition with this \nyear's NAIA World Series title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5693-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM BRUCE JOHNSON\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfellow Arkansan, William Bruce Johnson. Bruce is the president of White \nRiver Hardwoods and Woodworks, Inc., in Fayetteville, AR. Because of \nhis outstanding contribution to the business community, Bruce has been \nselected by the U.S. Small Business Administration as the 1996 Arkansas \nSmall Business Person of the Year. I am convinced that this is an honor \nrichly deserved.\n  Bruce Johnson and his wife Joan have pioneered new and innovative \napproaches to their business, and in the process, propelled White River \nHardwoods into a nationally known company. In 1979, Bruce's company \nmainly sold premium hardwood lumber, but with an entrepreneurial \nspirit, Bruce entered the finishing market with a full line of \narchitectural moldings and interior hardwood products. He and his wife \nproudly built a business that has become synonymous with superior \nquality and customer satisfaction. Incidentally, their children play a \nvery active role as well, making White River Hardwoods truly a family-\nowned small business.\n  Mr. President, I have said many times that small business is the \nbackbone of this country, and White River is the perfect example of \nthat statement. As many of you here know, owning your own business \ngives new meaning to full-time employment. That kind of dedication is \nprecisely the reason why I think SBA is such a vital program to this \ncountry. Bruce got his first SBA loan in 1983 and then his second in \n1992. Because of the availability of those SBA loans, White River \nHardwoods expanded warehouse space, purchased equipment, hired new \nemployees, and bettered the small business community--not only for \nArkansas, but for the whole country. Outside of their Fayetteville \nbase, White River operates a combination showroom and warehouse in \nSpringfield, MO. They are partnered with 28 independent manufacturing \nrepresentatives across the United States, and each day they effect a \nnetwork of 32 stocking distributors and 314 dealers. The company's \nsales in 1995 reached nearly $5.5 million, which is no insignificant \ncontribution to our economy.\n  We need more people like Bruce and Joan Johnson in this country. \nTogether they work hard every day along side their children to ensure \nthe futures of their employees and the community around them. Mr. \nPresident, I hope you will join me in congratulating William Bruce \nJohnson as the 1996 Arkansas Small Business Person of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/03/senate-section/article/S5693-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 1996\n\n  Mr. KYL.
