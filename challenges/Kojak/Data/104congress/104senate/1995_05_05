Mr. President, I indicated the other day that I intended \nto come to the floor of the Senate over a period of some weeks and \noffer some comments and observations and discuss a series of issues \nrelating to trade, economic strategy, jobs, and income in our country. \nI would like to introduce that topic today. I will finish it in other \npresentations in the coming couple of weeks.\n  I was a speaker at a college commencement exercise last Sunday at \nConcordia College in Moorhead, MN, where nearly 600 young men and women \nwere getting their 4-year baccalaureate degrees and were getting ready \nto go out and find a job and make their way in the world. Yet, about \nhalf of the students that I had an opportunity to visit with indicated \nto me that they really did not yet have a job lined up. They were \nlooking and had prospects here and there, but did not yet have a job \nlined up and did not yet know what they would do. That is not an \nunusual situation. It is a chronic problem in our country, even for \ncollege graduates, to find a good job, to find the right job that has a \ngood income. [[Page S6194]] \n  No matter where you are on the economic ladder in this country, it is \nbecoming more and more difficult to get a good job that pays good wages \nand has benefits. It certainly is true for those on the lowest rungs of \nthe economic ladder, but it is also true increasingly for those who are \namong the most educated in our country.\n  I want to give a series of addresses in the Senate exploring the \nreasons that in the United States we see fewer and fewer good jobs and \nwe see less opportunity. I want to talk a little about what we can do \nabout that. I want to explore the relationship of the global economy, \ninternational trade, and the role of international finance in pushing \nour country into an economic corner with slower growth, fewer jobs, and \nlower wages.\n  I think, frankly, the root of much of the disaffection in this \ncountry relates to these issues. There is a great deal of anxiety, a \ngreat deal of political disaffection, a great deal of concern among the \nAmerican people. And, I think it is because they see an economy that \nprovides less opportunity than they are accustomed to seeing. Most \npeople know that despite all of the rosy talk about news jobs and \neconomic growth that they are now working harder for less money. Their \nchildren who graduate from college have a tough time to find a good \njob.\n  Those are the realities that face families in America. It causes them \nto be anxious about the future. It causes them to be angry about lost \nopportunity. I think it causes the kind of political, social, and \neconomic turmoil we have in our country today.\n  I indicated on Sunday at the graduation speech just one symptom of \nthis. Of course, there are a lot of reasons for what is happening in \nour economy. But I described in our country the inclination for us to \nbuy and wear Chinese shirts, Mexican shorts, Malaysian shoes, watch \ntelevision sets made in Taiwan, buy cars made in Japan, and then wonder \nwhere all the jobs went. Well, it is not hard to figure out where the \ngood jobs went and where the good income is.\n  I am going to begin by citing some data that was released about an \nhour ago by U.S. Department of Labor on wages and jobs. Today the \nBureau of Labor Statistics reported that 28,000 more manufacturing jobs \nwere lost in April in the United States. That means that generally good \njobs, higher wage jobs--because the manufacturing jobs are normally the \nbetter jobs--have been lost. They have been replaced by jobs with lower \nproductivity and generally lower wages often in the service industries. \nIt is not that those jobs are not worthwhile in the service industry. \nThey are. But the problem is that we are losing so many good jobs and \nreplacing them with lower paying jobs, largely in the service sector.\n  In fact, this morning's report is not surprising. I figured \nyesterday, when I knew the report was coming out this morning, that \nthat is what the report would show. We would see that we would lose \nmore manufacturing jobs in our country again last month because it has \nbeen going on and on and on for many, many years.\n  We are now in the 50th month of an economic recovery cycle. Everyone \nwho knows about the business cycle knows there is contraction and \nexpansion, an expansion phase and an economic recovery phase. We are \nnow in the 50th month of a recovery that began in March 1991. \nUnfortunately, after 50 months of economic recovery we have lost more \ngood jobs than we have gained. What's more, wages are not rising but \nthey are falling.\n  I want to show this chart to compare what has happened in periods of \nAmerican economic recovery following recessions. In nearly every \ncircumstance in the last 35 years, we have seen a net increase in \nmanufacturing jobs during the first 4 years of a recovery. There is \njust one exception, and that is now. In this, the 50th month, of this \neconomic recovery, contrary to what happened to every other period in \nthe last 35 years, we see over 400,000 lost manufacturing jobs. In \nother words, during an economic recovery, a period when you ought to \nhave economic expansion, we are seeing a contraction in the good jobs \nin this country. We lose. And that is a symptom of the root of what is \nwrong in this country.\n  In fact, since 1985, just in the past 10 years, we have lost a \nmillion jobs in traded industries, which is manufacturing and \nagriculture and mining and all the sectors in which we produce things \nfor sale.\n  People say, well, you may have lost those, but there were a lot of \nother jobs created. That is true. There were a lot of other jobs \ncreated in nontraded industries, that is, industries that are not \nsubject to the competitive cycles of international trade.\n  It is interesting to me; if you take a look at what has happened with \nmanufacturing employment in this country and the decrease in \nmanufacturing employment and the generally diminished wage opportunity, \nyou understand the consequences for the American people.\n  A chart was presented using Department of Labor information--\npresented, incidentally, by MBG Information Services--that shows what \nhappened to growth in workers' compensation in this country from 1948 \nto 1973, a 25-year period, and then the growth in compensation during \nthe next 22 years, up to the present, and that is the red line.\n  You will see that in the first 25 years of this 50-year post-Second \nWorld War period we had generally robust increased wages in this \ncountry. And then you will see that after the first 25 years, we have \nseen generally stagnant wages since the early 1970's.\n  It is not a myth. It is reality. This is what the American families \nhave faced, and this is why they are so concerned about what is \nhappening to their economic fortunes and opportunities for their \nfamilies.\n  We have accumulated since 1980 a $1.4 trillion trade deficit, which I \nam going to relate to these issues at some point later--over a $1 \ntrillion trade deficit in manufactured goods alone. Last year, this \ncountry suffered the single largest trade deficit in the history of the \nworld.\n  This chart shows you the merchandise trade deficits of our country. \nThis shows that last year we had the single largest merchandise trade \ndeficit in the history of the world. Now, this must be repaid with a \nlower standard of living in the United States in the future. This is \nserious. This is a crisis. And no one but no one talks about it.\n  I am going to bring charts to the floor and describe how we have \ngotten to this point and why we have gotten to this point and what we \ncan do about it. But it is safe to say that anyone who understands \neconomics and understands what drives the American economy and what \nproduces good jobs with good income understands this is a crisis. This \nis not President Clinton's fault. I am not suggesting this \nadministration is at fault for these red bars or these red lines. In \nfact, this administration has been more aggressive than past \nadministrations in dealing with some of these international economic \nproblems, especially trade.\n  Unfortunately, this administration and every other past \nadministration for 30 years has embraced the exact same trade policy. \nOur economic policy, and especially our trade policy, is rooted in a \npost-Second World War notion that much of what we do internationally \nrelates to foreign policy, but not sound economic policy for this \ncountry's interests.\n  The chart on American worker compensation suggests that this Nation's \neconomic policies were, fortunately, serving its citizens' interests \nduring the first 25 years after World War II. But we now see evidence \nacross America that our policies are contrary to America's economic \ninterests, and yet we embrace the same failed international economic \nand trade strategy in which our country loses and others win.\n  We must find a way to put together a much better strategy. In order \nto do that we need to begin discussing a range of issues that deal with \njobs, with income, with international trade and international finance. \nAnd we must especially strip away the myths and deal with the \nrealities.\n  If we talk to people in this town today about trade, about economics, \nabout our country's economy, you would find those whose job it is to \nsell a positive story say, ``Gee, I don't know what you are talking \nabout. We are in the 50th month of an economic expansion. Our economic \ngrowth is robust and good. In fact, the Federal Reserve Board is \nworried about economic [[Page S6195]] growth being so high that it has \nincreased interest rates seven times to bring economic growth rates \ndown.''\n  They would give a scenario that suggests to you: What are we thinking \nof? America is in great shape. But, of course, the real test of whether \nour country's economy is in good shape is whether our citizens are able \nto find work at decent wages. You can have a bull market on Wall \nStreet, you can have economic growth at 5 or 6 percent, and you can \nhave unemployment at 2 percent, but if you have falling wages and lost \nopportunity, people in this country are not going to be convinced this \neconomic strategy works for them or their families or for the future of \nthis country.\n  We have a great deal of which to be proud and to celebrate about our \neconomy in this country, about where we have been, about what we have \ndone over 50 years, all over this world. We have helped; we have \ninvested; we have nurtured; we have protected; we have been a part of \nwhat has built an enormously important private sector opportunity \ninternationally that has expanded opportunity for many years.\n  What has happened in the last 25 of these 50 years is that we have \nbecome victims of a system that helps others and hurts us. That is what \nis at the root of the political disaffection in our country, I am \nconvinced.\n  I noticed yesterday in the Wall Street Journal something that relates \nto what we are talking about today. Economic expansion, great \nopportunity, good times, bull market on Wall Street, and here is what \nthe Wall Street Journal of Thursday, May 4, says in its feature story:\n\n       Amid record profits companies continue to lay off \n     employees.\n\n  This is the reality for the American families.\n\n       Last week, Mobil Corporation posted soaring first quarter \n     earnings. This week it announced plans to eliminate 4,700 \n     jobs. While corporate profits were surging to record levels \n     last year, the number of job cuts approached those seen at \n     the height of the recession.\n\n  Corporate profits rose 11 percent in 1994, after a 13-percent rise in \n1993, according to DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, MA, economic \nconsultant. Meanwhile, corporate America cut 516,069 jobs in 1994, \naccording to an outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray & Christmas in \nChicago. That is far more than in the recession year of 1990 when \n316,047 jobs were cut.\n  Let me restate that because I think it is important. In 1990, when we \nwere in a recession, corporate America eliminated 316,000 jobs. Last \nyear, when corporate profits were at a record level, we saw 516,000 \njobs cut, eliminated, lost. Those are lost opportunities for America's \nworkers.\n  Again, quoting from the same story:\n\n       For employees, the latest layoffs, coming amid good times \n     and fat profits, seem mean and arbitrary. It's the seemingly \n     relentlessness of the job losses that aggravates most. \n     Workers see this as a long-term trend that has little \n     relationship to how their company is performing. Nobody feels \n     very secure.\n\n  The article is a long article, and I commend people to read it. But \nit describes at its roots what is happening in our country today--\nrecord profits, fat opportunities for corporations. But, of course, \ncorporations, the large corporations, are internationalists now. They \nare not American citizens who get up and say the Pledge of Allegiance \nand sing the ``Star Spangled Banner.'' It does not mean they are un-\nAmerican. It just means they are searching for international profits. \nThat is their interest; that is their responsibility to their \nstockholders. And if they can produce in Indonesia and sell in \nPittsburgh and move the jobs from Pittsburgh to Indonesia, that is \nprecisely what they will do, and it is precisely what they have done.\n  If their actions mean they will substantially increase America's \ntrade deficit, then that is what they will do, because their interest \nis not in our trade deficit. Their interest is in their profit for \ntheir stockholders.\n  We must, Mr. President, begin to discuss these issues, these economic \nissues, international and national economic issues, in the context of \nwhat works for our country, what is best for America, what produces \njobs and good income and opportunity for our country.\n  We must start thinking in those terms. We must change our thinking. \nVirtually every discussion you have about our economic policies in this \ntown is a debate filled with myths. I hope in the next couple of weeks, \nin further presentations on these issues, to strip away some of those \nmyths and try to talk about the economic realities. The economic \nreality is most American families sitting down to have their evening \nmeal understand they are working harder, longer hours, but making less \nmoney.\n  Why? Because of a whole range of reasons dealing with national and \ninternational economic strategy and issues that we largely do not \ndebate on the floor of the Senate. Without a new debate, one viewpoint \npersists: Our current economic strategy is good for America, and this \nglobalization of trade is just fine; works just great. We have economic \ngrowth and that is all that really matters.\n  Well, all of the positive Government reports and news stories mean \nnothing to American families if they do not mean opportunity and do not \nmean decent jobs and do not mean decent incomes. And that is the \ndilemma.\n  We are, and this year have been, talking about the budget deficit in \nour Federal budget. It is a real dilemma and we must deal with it \nbecause it, too, is dangerous for this country. It injures our economic \nfuture.\n  But it is no more dangerous than this--the largest trade deficit in \nhistory. Or than this--in the 50th month of an economic expansion, to \nfind that the numbers for last month show that we lost 28,000 \nadditional manufacturing jobs. That is serious. When you lose the kind \nof manufacturing jobs we have lost in this country, you lose real \nopportunity. You lose the kind of economic propellant that moves \nfamilies up the economic ladder, that moves families into the middle \nclass. It was manufacturing jobs that did that, not minimum-wage \nservice jobs. This is the dilemma we face today.\n  Now, I am going to bring some charts to the floor that talk about \nspecifics, talk about international finance, talk about trade policy, \ntalk about our trade with Japan, our trade policy with China, our trade \npolicy with Mexico, and how that relates to what I am discussing here.\n  But, most importantly, when I do that, I want to see if we cannot \nfinally begin, all of us, to strip away the myth and talk about what \nkind of strategy in the end will boost this country's fortune. Not \nnecessarily what will boost all the aggregate numbers about economic \ngrowth, but, in fact, boost this country's fortune in the number of \ngood jobs with good incomes that it creates for American families who \nwant to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6193-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6195-S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         A CLEAR VIOLATION OF BASIC PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DECENCY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Capital of Croatia, was \nsubjected to a vicious attack by militant Serb separatists. This was \nthe second day in a row that Zagreb was attacked by rockets armed with \ncluster bombs. The attack occurred at noon, when civilians were out \nhaving lunch. The principal targets were the children's hospital and \nthe national theater where a ballet company was rehearsing. Several \npeople were killed and dozens were wounded, bringing the total number \nof casualties to about 200 people.\n  There are those who say that the Croatian Government provoked the \nattack, by conducting a military operation that returned a 200-square-\nmile area back to Croatian control. That argument misses the point. \nNothing, I repeat, nothing, justifies an attack on innocent civilians--\non children in this case. The U.S. Ambassador was right when he \ncondemned these attacks at a clear violation of basic principles of \nhuman decency.\n  I am aware that it is U.N. practice to shift the blame and muddy the \nwaters in their pursuit of neutrality between aggressors and victims. \nBut, to do so--whether in this case, or in the case of attacks on \ncivilians in Bosnia--is reprehensible.\n  Furthermore, if the United Nations were doing its job in Croatia--if \nthe United Nations had implemented its mandate to demilitarize the \nsectors of Croatia under their control thereby clearing the way for \nreintegration of [[Page S6196]] these occupied territories--the \nCroatian Government may not have taken the action it did on Monday. Let \nus not forget, the occupied areas are part of the territory of Croatia. \nSo while the international community should urge the Croatian \nGovernment and its forces to fully respect the human and civil rights \nof the population in the areas they have retaken, it should not urge \nCroatia to give up control of reclaimed territory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6195-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK--1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize some very \nspecial businesses in my home State of South Dakota during National \nSmall Business Week. Through work on the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness for 17 of my 21 years in Congress, I know small businesses \nhave not always enjoyed the recognition and attention they deserve. For \ntoo long, America's entrepreneurs have been taken for granted. These \ndynamic men and women play a critical role in this Nation's economy. \nDuring the last major recession, small businesses created 4.1 million \njobs, while large firms reduced employment by 500,000 jobs. Without the \nspirit, drive, and determination of small businesses, our economy would \nnot have been able to break out of the economic stagnancy of the early \n1990's. Clearly, this sector of our economy is finally getting the \nrespect it is due.\n  Wile credit availability has improved significantly and now appears \nstable, we must continue to monitor this situation. Without adequate \nfinancing, entrepreneurs will not be able to get out of the gate. \nLikewise, I am encouraged by recent efforts in Congress to decrease the \nburdens of Federal regulations and paperwork. And while the Senate \nstill is deliberating S. 565, the Product Liability Fairness Act of \n1995, I hope we will be able to protect small manufacturers from \nfrivolous lawsuits by enacting sensible tort reforms.\n  Though we have worked to level the playing field for small \nbusinesses, small firms now face unique problems. America and the world \nare in the throws of an information technology revolution. The ability \nof an enterprise to use high-technology tools very well may dictate \nwhether the business survives. We must ensure established and fledgling \nsmall businesses are able to be players in the technological arena. We \nmust ensure small firms wishing to provide high-technology goods and \nservices have access to credit and capital. Because the very nature of \ncapital assets tends to be less tangible, small firms may have \ndifficulty securing the traditional forms of collateral lenders often \nseek. Is it possible to put a value on the time, effort, and knowledge \nof a software developer? I do not know. However, from my position as \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I hope to identify solutions to these potential \nroadblocks.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I also did not raise some of the \nunique challenges rural small businesses face. South Dakota's 1995 \nSmall Business Person of the Year has defied conventional wisdom that \nsays a successful manufacturing business must be located in an urban \narea. In 1982, Randy Boyd returned to his native Geddes, SD, where he \njoined his father in a gunsmith and gun repair business. By 1986, their \noperation hired three employees to assist in the manufacturing of gun-\nstocks for shotguns and big game rifles. Since then, their venture has \nexpanded to 25 full time, 10 part-time, and 10 contract employees. \nBoyd's Gunstock Industries, Inc., currently is one of the country's \nleading gunstock manufacturers.\n  I commend Randy Boyd for the well deserved honor of being named South \nDakota Small Business Person of the Year. He is an inspiration to other \nentrepreneurs with a dream and a willingness to work hard to see that \ndreams take shape.\n\n  During my visit with Randy this week, I learned he would like to \nexpand Boyds' Gunstock even further. Unfortunately, he has encountered \na limitation many burgeoning small businesses face in rural States like \nSouth Dakota. Randy wants very badly to keep his operation in the small \ncity of Geddes. In order to overcome the community's limited work \nforce, Randy has aggressively pursued workers from surrounding \ncommunities. Though such efforts have been successful for Randy in the \npast, he is discovering that the city of Geddes lacks affordable \nhousing for these new employees. Indeed, it would be a tremendous loss \nfor the community if this opportunity is lost.\n  I will be working with Randy and the community of Geddes to try to \nresolve a problem that has become all too common for communities across \nmy State. Private investments in real estate must be both appealing and \nlucrative. As I said during my visit with Randy, I will promote tax \nincentives that, in turn, will promote economic growth. It is important \nthat we continue to cultivate a climate that will stimulate small \nbusiness growth. We must reward and encourage entrepreneurs such as \nRandy Boyd to continue their efforts.\n  I again congratulate Randy for his success and the success of Boyds' \nGunstock. I also would like to recognize some of my State's other \nbusinesses leaders. I congratulate: Arlin W. Anderson of the South \nDakota American Legion, Veteran Small Business Advocate of the Year; \nWilliam F. Carlson of Tower Systems, Inc., Small Business Exporter; \nJohn E. Brewer of Rushmore State Bank, Financial Services Advocate; \nEileen Lunderman of the Sincangu Enterprise Center, Minority Small \nBusiness Advocate; Brenda Wade Schmidt of the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, \nMedia Advocate, and Jan Steensland of Eyes on You magazine, Women in \nBusiness Advocate.\n  Each of these individuals has played a very important role in making \nsmall businesses the driving force behind South Dakota's vibrant \neconomy.

Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern--and \neven some indignation--that several key pieces of reform legislation \ncontinue to be bottled up in the Congress, including the gift ban, the \nlobbying reform bill, and tough, sweeping campaign finance reforms. I \nam more convinced than ever that one of the key issues, maybe the root \nissue of American politics, is the way in which we now have to finance \ncampaigns. And the sooner we move toward a system where we are able to \nget a lot of the bigger money out of politics and have a level playing \nfield for incumbents and challengers and figure out how to do this in a \nsane way, the sooner we will have a much better political system.\n  The lobbying disclosure bill, a key piece of legislation that Senator \nLevin has taken important leadership on, is really simple and \nstraightforward. But just to summarize, what this legislation says is \nthat those who are actually [[Page S6197]] paid to lobby, hired to \nlobby, ought to be officially registered. This is in the spirit of \naccountability. Nobody is pointing the finger at those who lobby, or \nsuggesting that somehow constitutional rights for citizens to petition \nour Government should be curtailed. We are simply saying that we ought \nto have openness and accountability in this political process by \nrequiring all those who engage in lobbying activities to register.\n  But in addition to lobbying registration and campaign finance reform, \nwhat I want to focus on more specifically, at least for a short time, \nis the gift ban. It is very simple and very straightforward. Americans \nare watching closely to see if the new majority in the Congress \ndelivers on its promise of reform. While some of the new Members ran \nfor office on reform platforms, so far they have not produced much of \nanything. This should not come as a surprise, because many of those \nsame people who talked about reform were the ones who blocked major \nreform last year in each of these areas. I think, toward the end of the \nlast Congress--and I will just editorialize on this question--toward \nthe end of the last Congress I think the effort to block the gift ban \nreform was more an effort to make sure that Democrats did not get any \ncredit for it. It really had nothing to do with the high ground of good \npublic policy. I believe the reform promises have rung hollow all along \nand they ring even more hollow today.\n  Mr. President, I have an editorial from the Washington Post, I \nbelieve it was yesterday. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 5, 1995]\n\n                           Would-Be Reformers\n\n       ``Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and \n     corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago,'' \n     President Clinton declared in his State of the Union address \n     last January. ``The American people look at their capital, \n     and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-\n     protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary \n     citizens are often left out.''\n       ``The first duty of our generation is to reestablish \n     integrity and a bond of honesty in the political process,'' \n     said Newt Gingrich in 1990. ``We must punish wrongdoers in \n     politics and government and pass reform laws to clean up the \n     election and lobbying systems. We must ensure that citizen \n     politics defeats money politics.''\n       Gosh--if they agree, why has so little happened in this \n     Congress on behalf of political reform? In the grand days of \n     January, Congress took a step forward with a bill requiring \n     the House and Senate to live under many of the same labor and \n     safety laws that are applied to the rest of the country. But \n     the major items that might change the system, such as \n     lobbying reform and new laws regulating campaign fund-raising \n     and spending, have been, well, less than top priorities for \n     either the new Congress or the president. Congress put on a \n     big show over that crowd-pleasing issue, term limits. But a \n     Congress intent on taking steps to restore public confidence \n     does not have to resort to changing the Constitution. Simpler \n     measures are available.\n       Simplest of all would be a ban on the various sorts of \n     gifts lobbyists and others can now give, perfectly legally, \n     to members of Congress. The rules covering members of \n     Congress, who write the laws, are much looser than those in \n     the executive branch, which enforces them. It would not take \n     great legislative creativity to write a good bill. A fine \n     proposal nearly passed Congress last year. It would ban all \n     personal gifts from lobbyists and most gifts from non-\n     lobbyists, including those famous ``charity'' golf and tennis \n     tournaments through which interest groups can essentially \n     give members of Congress and their families free vacations. A \n     variant of the bill was introduced as an amendment in the \n     Senate, but was voted down with the Republican leadership \n     saying the timing was inopportune. Senate Majority Leader \n     Robert Dole said he'd bring the issue back this month. We'll \n     see.\n       A gift ban would not change everything in Washington. It's \n     no substitute for reforming the campaign spending laws. But \n     the ban is right on the merits and would be a potent way for \n     members of Congress to back up their repeated professions \n     that they want to get rid of business as usual in Washington, \n     shake up the system etc. etc. etc.\n       In the last Congress, controlled by Democrats, Mr. Clinton \n     failed to speak out forcefully for political reform until it \n     was too late. He had pledged--beginning with that State of \n     the Union speech--to fight hard for reform this time around. \n     We're waiting. With the administration making such an issue \n     of how lobbyists are involved in writing legislation in the \n     new Congress, you'd think the reform issue would be a natural \n     for the president. As for Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Dole and all \n     those Republican freshmen who say they want to change things, \n     they have the majority. Will they make good on their words?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This editorial in the Washington Post yesterday \nchallenged the new congressional majority to enact a number of tough, \nsweeping political reform measures that have been proposed by a number \nof us in Congress but that have been bogged down for a number of years.\n  The Post observed in this editorial that the simplest and most \nstraightforward of these reforms is legislation to impose a tough, \nsweeping ban on gifts, meals, vacation travel, and other perks--the \nsame provisions that were killed at the end of the last Congress.\n  This is legislation that I have worked on with Senators Levin, \nFeingold, Lautenberg, and others. Again, the simplest and most \nstraightforward of the major items on the real reform agenda, if we are \nserious about not separating the lives we live from the words we speak, \nis legislation that would impose a tough sweeping ban on gifts, meals, \nvacation, travel, and other perks--the same provisions that were killed \nby a Republican-led filibuster in the waning days of the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, the President called for lobbying reform and a gift \nban in his State of the Union Message. But nothing has been put forward \nby my colleagues in the majority. Frozen like deer in the headlights, \nwith the exception of the Chair, they refused to move forward on the \ngift ban. Enthusiastic about slashing free or reduced-price school \nlunches, and the Chair is an exception, and I know there are some other \ncolleagues that are an exception, but I will hold true that statement I \nam about to make--enthusiastic about slashing free or reduced-price \nlunches for children, reform opponents wither when it comes to \neliminating free lunches for Members of the Congress. I mean some of \nthe same colleagues who do not hesitate to vote to scale back school \nlunch programs are also the ones who voted to continue to allow free \nlunches for themselves.\n  I do not think this bitter irony will be lost on the American people. \nI intend to make sure, along with other colleagues, that in a very \nshort period of time, as soon as appropriate, we will have this \namendment out on the floor and we will have full-scale debate and every \nSenator will again be asked to vote on the simple proposition that \nthere should be a ban on gifts, meals, vacation travel, and other perks \nfrom special interests to Members of Congress.\n  Mr. President, it is long past time for enactment of the gift ban. \nThis bill would significantly change the Washington culture. It is \nlarger than just the piece of legislation. People want to believe in \nthis political process, and when people read about or find out that \nSenators or Representatives have this interest or that interest pay for \nvacations trips to resorts for a weekend to play golf or tennis or do \nwhatever, people find that to be inappropriate. And they are right.\n  Mr. President, there is not a one of us that likes across-the-board \nindiscriminate bashing of public service. We would not be here if we \ndid not believe in public service. But if you want people to have more \nconfidence in the Congress, if you want people to have more confidence \nin this institution, and you want people to have more confidence in \neach individual Member, as a Senator representing our constituents back \nhome, then we need to enact this tough gift ban legislation. We have \ndelayed for far too long.\n  Mr. President, let me go back to this Congress. This legislation was \nkilled at the end of the last Congress in the very last days. We then \nbrought back the same provisions at the beginning of this session in \nJanuary when we had the Congressional Accountability Act before us and \nwe had a vote on the gift ban legislation. At that time, the majority \nleader essentially said that he intended to take up a gift ban bill in \nthe next few months, and to have it on the Senate floor in May.\n  Mr. President, I remember this because, first of all, Senator Levin, \nmyself, Senator Feingold, Senator Lautenberg, all came out to the floor \nand we argued that the congressional accountability bill provided a \ngreat opportunity for us to impose a comprehensive ban on these special \ninterest gifts. That was, we believed, in keeping with the general \ntheme of accountability to the citizenry, and not [[Page S6198]] to \nspecial interests. That was voted down, on a virtually party-line vote.\n  At that time, the majority leader indicated that he intended to take \nup this legislation by the end of May, or sometime in May.\n  Then I came back with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which would \nhave simply put the Senate on record saying that we will take this up \nby the end of May. That too was voted down. I said, wait a minute. The \nmajority leader just said that he intended to do this, so let's put the \nwhole Senate on record that by May we will have this legislation back \non the floor for full consideration. Let us have a vote to affirm what \nthe majority leader had just said was his intention, because I just had \nthis sort of feeling that people were going to continue to delay and \ndelay, as had been done in the past.\n  Mr. President, let me just be clear. Now it is May and nothing has \nhappened; zero, zippo, nada, nothing has happened. No hearings have \nbeen held. No bills have been introduced. Nothing to my knowledge on \nthe gift ban legislation is scheduled for floor consideration any time \nsoon.\n  So the question is: Where is the majority party on this issue, where \nare the Republicans with their version of gift reform? Since 37 \nRepublicans, including the majority leader, already cosponsored at the \nend of last year the same provisions that we offered in January and \nwill offer again, as I said, as soon as we have an appropriate vehicle \non the floor, what changes do they intend to make in this bill? Do they \nintend again, as some did last year--to try to gut the provisions of \nthe charitable vacation travel to golf and tennis hot spots like Vail, \nAspen, Florida, or the Bahamas where Members are wined and dined as \nguests of lobbyists and other special interests? Because, if they \nintend to try to gut those provisions, we intend for there to be a \nmajor debate. We cannot pass something saying we are not going to take \ngifts with these huge gaping holes and loopholes.\n  Do they intend again to try to hollow out gift ban reforms by just \nslightly lowering the thresholds for expensive meals, sports tickets, \nand other gifts paid for by special interests here in Washington so \nthat they can say they are for reform? That would be symbolic politics \nat its worst.\n  Let me just simply say to you, Mr. President, this is an idea whose \ntime has come, and come, and come again. I have been working on this \nfor just over 2 years now, and the real standard for gift ban reform is \na tightened-up bill that Senator Levin and I, Senator Feingold and \nSenator Lautenberg, put forth in January. We will come to the floor and \nwe will offer tough gift ban legislation. I believe the overwhelming \nmajority of Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, should support \nit. We really have had extensive bipartisan support in some \noverwhelming votes for this legislation. But each time along the way \nsomebody or some group of Senators figures out a way of sidetracking \nit.\n  The time is long past due for this reform. I think people in this \ncountry really are in a reform mood. And any Senator or Representative \nwho believes that campaign finance reform or lobby disclosure or gift \nban is just something that so-called good government groups are \ninterested in, they are wrong. People want us to represent them well. \nThey want this political process to be open and accountable. And many \npeople, too many people, believe, and unfortunately I think they are \nright, that too few people have too much access to Senators and \nRepresentatives, and too many people, the vast majority of people, are \nleft out of the decisionmaking loop, left out of the equation.\n  It is really time to get back to this reform agenda and finish up our \nwork in this area. There are three critical parts, all of which I \nintend to one way or another help bring to the floor of the Senate for \ndebate. One is campaign finance reform. That is fundamental. Another is \nthe lobby disclosure, on which Senator Levin has taken a key leadership \nrole. The other is the gift ban, where I will continue to work with \nSenators Levin, Lautenberg, Feingold, and others.\n  I look forward to that debate. We will have that amendment out here \non the floor soon and I think people in the country, whether they are \nDemocrats, Republicans, or Independents, will hold us accountable.\n  I look forward to this debate. I look forward to this vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our tough, sweeping gift ban legislation. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to say a few words about two \nU.S. Senators, one recently deceased and one recently embarked on a \nspirited new part of life, both of them dear friends of mine--Senator \nJohn Stennis of Mississippi and Senator David Pryor of Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6198-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6198-S6199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR JOHN C. STENNIS\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, Senator Stennis served with my father in \nthe U.S. Senate. My father, Milward L. Simpson of Wyoming, served here \nfrom 1962 until 1966. He was a former Governor of Wyoming from 1954 \nuntil 1958, then came to the U.S. Senate, elected to fulfill a 4-year \nterm, or remaining 4-year term, of a young man who had been elected to \nthe Senate and died before he was sworn in. John Stennis and Mrs. \nStennis immediately greeted my father when he came here in the most \ncordial way. They were very dear friends of my parents.\n  I must say that the philosophy of the western Senator, my father, and \nthe southern gentleman, the Senator from Mississippi, were much the \nsame with regard to national defense, fiscal matters, issues of \nsubstance in the social area, of the fabric of the country, and they \nbecame fast friends. I recall very distinctly my father called John \nStennis ``Mr. Integrity.''\n  My father invited John Stennis, Senator Willis Robertson, and two \nother persons to Wyoming. I recall very distinctly. I was a young man \npracticing law in Cody, WY, and they asked me to join them. Dad took \nhis two Senate friends fishing. You might imagine that John had not \never seen too much of Rocky Mountain trout fishing nor the attire that \naccompanies such activities. I will never forget him coming from his \ncabin, very nattily dressed, and he said, ``Milward, is this what we \n[[Page S6199]] wear when we fish for these trout?'' My father said, \n``No, I think we need something more than that, something a little \ndifferent.'' Off they went to enjoy a remarkable 2 days together.\n  My father loved John Stennis, and when my father was the recipient of \nthe Milward L. Simpson Chair of Political Science at the University of \nWyoming, John Stennis served as his honorary chairman, and said, ``If \nthere is anything I can do for my friend, Milward Simpson, I will do \nit.'' So it was a great affection and relationship, a true friendship. \nThen when I, of course, came to the Senate, John Stennis was the first \nto greet me. He said, ``If there is anything I can do to help you or \nsmooth your path here, let me do it.'' And he did.\n  He was more than charitable, kind, and attentive to me except, of \ncourse, when I tried to kill off the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway. Then \nthere was a definite strain in our relationship--momentary, fleeting. \nBut he said, ``Alan, I cannot believe that you would do that.'' And he \nwas right. I did not believe I could, and did not. That great waterway \nis a great tribute to personally the perseverance of John Stennis.\n  But what he told me--and I shall never forget--he said ``Alan, I have \nbeen watching you.'' I had been here maybe 4 years at the time. ``I \nhave seen you work. I know how hard you work.'' He really buoyed me up. \nHe said, ``You want to remember something in the Senate.'' He said, \n``People come here, and some grow and some swell.'' I shall never \nforget the phrase. ``Some grow and some swell.'' Indeed, we know both \ncategories. I think I have done a little of both. But when I did swell, \nI was put down a peg or two, to get back to growing instead of \nswelling.\n  So I want to just pay tribute to John Stennis, and I know my dear \nparents, both gone, too, would have wanted me to pay tribute to a very \ndear and lovely friend, and to his memory, which will certainly be \npresent in this Chamber for the remainder of time. He was deeply loved, \na man of great stature, and truly a wonderful gentleman, truly a \ngentleman.\n  So God bless his son and his daughter who survive him. They have a \nwonderful heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6198-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me just say a word about my friend, \nDavid Pryor.\n  David Pryor has determined that he will now retire from the Senate, \nand we came here together. We came here in the class of 1978. There was \na class of 20, the largest class ever to come into the U.S. Senate at \none time, 11 Republicans and 9 Democrats. We were very close. Those of \nus who are still here are still very close. In fact, in January of this \nyear, the remaining group of us met together and had dinner together \nwith our spouses, and shared the attitude of how can we make the place \nwork a little better instead of just chopping ourselves to pieces, as \nwe sometimes do. But that goes with the territory. That is politics. It \nwas always a little rough and tumble, and it still will be, and ever \nshall be, world without end.\n  But David Pryor and Barbara--and there is a remarkable woman. She has \nchosen to take a little of a secondary role in the life of this \nwonderful man. Let me tell you, she is in every sense as much a part of \nDavid's success in life and fiber as my own wife, Ann, is of mine.\n  So David and I came here, and I was placed in the basement of the \nRussell Building because it was thought that I was No. 100. Well, the \nsenior Senator from Wyoming had resigned an hour before the deadline of \nmidnight of the New Year. So I was not 100; I was No. 88, which was a \nsignificant leapfrog. We have since changed that. We do not do that \nanymore. But nevertheless, thinking I was No. 100, they placed me in \nthe basement of the Russell Building, with bars on the windows, which \nwere not unfamiliar to me from some of my activities in youth. But, \nnevertheless, it looked like the sewers of Paris down in there.\n  But I was glad to have any kind of opportunity to be here, thrilled \nas we all are, and hope always will be, or we shall get out. David \nPryor, who I had come to know in those early days, came to visit me in \nmy dungeon surroundings, the durance vile. He said, ``This is quite an \noffice you have here.'' I said, ``It is. But at least I am here.'' He \nsaid, ``You need something to brighten it up.'' I said, ``Well, that \nwould be lovely. I think you are right.'' So later in the afternoon he \nmailed to me, hand carried by courier, a dead plant with the leaves \ndangling in grotesque, yellowish brown fashion. He said he thought that \nthe plant matched the surroundings of what I had there. And then he \nlater showed up personally to assure himself that I had received this \nbeautiful plant to grace my new surroundings.\n\n  Well, that is part of David. He is a wonderful friend, and he is a \nvery serious man. He comes to this floor, and he defends his friend, \nhis principal friend, who is a man named Bill Clinton, President of the \nUnited States. I used to come to this floor and defend my friend, a man \nI had known for 35 years named George Bush, President of the United \nStates. And David and I have often laughed at how it is when you are a \nclose friend of a President, because when somebody is here tearing them \nup, your staff says, ``Get over there; they are doing something bad,'' \nand you end up dropping what you do and you come over to defend your \nfriend. I have done that with George Bush, and I have seen Dave do it \nwith great loyalty for his friend Bill Clinton.\n  I have always admired him. I have worked with him. There is not a \nfiner, more principled man, a man of remarkable honesty and directness, \nand a man to whom I once said, ``David, did you run for president of \nthe first grade? Because I don't think you have missed any part of \npolitics. I think you have been in this since your birth.'' When you \nlook at the public record that he leaves behind as a legislator, as a \nmember of the Arkansas Assembly, a Congressman, a Governor, a Senator, \nthe people of Arkansas love this man, and he could have been here as \nlong as he wished. He has decided, however, to do something many, many \nof us think about more and more often, and that is stepping away, not \nwith irritation or hostility or angst or anguish, just knowing that \nthere are other things to do in life, stepping away just as a person \nsuch as Jack Danforth of Missouri--no regret, no recrimination, just \nstepping away.\n  That is what David has chosen to do, and I just want to say that I \nwish him well. And he will do well. He looks spirited and relieved and \nreleased, had a snappy tan to his face, lilt to his step the other \nday--he had gone golfing, a shocking revelation.\n  And so to David and to Barbara, special people of special depth, \nspecial substance and sensitivity, and their children, David, Jr., \nMark, and Scott, who are great friends of our daughter Susan--they grew \nup together here in Washington--to David and Barbara Pryor, with whom \nwe have shared much, spent time together, talked of things much deeper \nthan legislation, I say Godspeed. I join in wishing them well in a new \nchapter of their lives which will be very, very fulfilling to them, I \nam sure, knowing the type of people they are.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

STENNIS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, recently I received a letter from a Dr. \nWayne M. Miller of Killeen, Texas. The letter was in reference to my \nrecent eulogy for the late and beloved Senator John Cornelius Stennis.\n  Dr. Miller wrote that he was deeply moved by the tribute, so much so \nthat he sat down and composed a poem after hearing it. I call attention \nto the letter and to the poem enclosed with it because it demonstrates \nnot only the sensitivity and talent of the writer, but also the power \nand the passion which words can evoke.\n  In these days of often destructive, rude, and even dangerous \nrhetoric, let us stop and reflect on the tremendous power of our words.\n  Such reflection may help those of us in public life and in the media \nto strive to use our voices to inspire rather than to enflame.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Wayne M. Miller's \nletter and poem be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Killeen, TX,\n\n                                                   April 27, 1995.\n     U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd, when I tuned in to a C-Span telecast \n     last night, I caught the latter part of your eloquent tribute \n     to the late Senator Stennis. It was truly one of the greatest \n     speeches I have ever heard. To be sure, it had the two basic \n     ingredients of a great speech: substantive thinking, and \n     rhetorical skills to effectively express it.\n       Although I am not a West Virginian, I have admired your \n     accomplishments and the stature of your leadership. I was \n     reared just eighty miles north of Wheeling, in a small town \n     of Harmony, Pennsylvania. After serving as chaplain in the \n     Air Force, I became a field director for American Red Cross--\n     and am now retired with that organization. For the past \n     sixteen years I have been teaching composition and rhetoric \n     at Central Texas College.\n       Would it be possible to have a copy of your outstanding \n     speech? I would be ever so grateful!\n       I am so happy that we still have statesmen of your caliber \n     in our nation's capital. I am enclosing a poem which I wrote \n     after listening to you on television. It reflects, in some \n     small measure, my responsiveness to your deeply, moving \n     words.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Wayne M. Miller.\n       Enclosure.\n\n     To the Honorable Mr. Byrd, Distinguished U.S. Senator from \n         the State of West Virginia, after hearing the stirring \n         tribute delivered on the floor of Congress for the late \n         Senator John Stennis of Mississippi (1901-1995):\n\n     Your well selected words, like highly polished marble\n     (Uniquely Mr. Byrd's!)\n     Were fitted in a pyramid of architectural marvel--\n     Arousing such a sentiment in the shaping of your thoughts\n     Keen emotions were unharnessed from what common birth allots\n     And, untouted, undergirds\n     The daily warp and woof of our fabric of existence.\n\n     You talked about our too brief pilgrimage,\n     And you pricked our unsuspecting Achilles Heel\n     When you sharpened our awareness of fragility\n     That stamps the mold of our mortality--\n     And your sobering reflection of the little bird\n     That fluttered through the crack from the raging storm\n     Into the blinding light of the banquet hall,\n     And then, so very soon, fluttered out again--\n     Demonstrated our fitful wandering,\n     Our groping sightlessness, our straining stammering,\n     Our hurried exit from the ever-blinding light\n     Of the babbling banquet hall and ``much ado about nothing.''\n\n     You addressed so poignantly the human predicament\n     In the never ending journey ``east of Eden''--\n     Never ending, that is,\n     Until that special day of reckoning\n     When all our shattered dreams, our broken vows . . .\n     Will have their consummation\n     In all-glorious transformation\n     From the ugly to the beautiful\n     And the painful to the joyful\n     Where there will be no night,\n     No parting and no sorrow.\n\n     You led us like thirsting sheep\n     To the oasis of our being--\n     The wells of spiritual refreshment\n     Where first we saw the mirroring of our impoverished selves\n     And then experienced the waters that revive us\n     And show us the way of day.\n\n     You showed us what we are--\n     And what we can become\n     In the ``long journey into night''\n     While we suffer in our little rooms,\n     Waiting for the fateful end--\n     To be transposed by the Great Composer\n     From our dischords into harmonies,\n     Rejoicing with the Children of the Light.\n                                            Wayne Meredith Miller,\n                                1995 Nominee for Poet of the Year.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, on April 22, the Washington journalism \ncommunity lost one of its most enduring figures. For decades, Naomi \nNover was a distinctive presence on Capitol Hill and at the White \nHouse, often claiming a front-row seat at Presidential news \nconferences. Known for her perseverance and her determination to \ncontinue her passion for journalism, Naomi fell ill last month while \nrenewing her Senate press credentials. It was the first day for gallery \nmembers to renew their press cards, and as usual, Naomi was one of the \nfirst in line.\n  A native of Buffalo, NY, she and her husband Barney moved to \nWashington in 1936. After receiving a masters degree from George \nWashington University, she worked with her husband for the Denver Post, \nwrote a column called ``Washington Dateline,'' produced a radio program \ncalled ``Views and Interviews,'' and when Barney Nover retired from the \nDenver Post in 1971, Naomi cofounded the Nover News Bureau. After her \nhusband passed away in 1973, Naomi established a journalism prize in \nhis memory, the Barnet Nover Memorial Award, given for journalistic \nexcellence at the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner.\n  Naomi's perseverance was legendary. Sam Donaldson tells an admiring \nstory about the time Naomi was hit by a truck while crossing \nPennsylvania Avenue. ``The vehicle was almost totalled,'' Donaldson \nsays. ``She walked away without a scratch.'' President Clinton called \nher ``years of dedication to her craft and her efforts to cover events \n* * * a lesson to us all in hard work and the persistence of the human \nspirit.''\n  Mr. President, I know all my colleagues join me in sending our \nwarmest condolences to Naomi's friends and family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6200-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I say for the benefit of my colleagues and \nothers who would probably like to get out of here, we are waiting for \nan amendment to be drafted. It is almost complete. Upon completion, it \nwill be sent to the desk. Then there will be a cloture petition filed, \nand we will be able to leave for the day.\n  It should not be long. I am told 15 or 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6200-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6200-S6201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE STAKES IN LEGAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as we continue the legal reform debate, I \nthink it is important to take a few minutes and focus on what is and is \nnot at stake here.\n  What is at stake is whether we are going to continue with a legal \nsystem that is too costly, too long, and too unfair. What is at stake \nis whether the [[Page S6201]] powerful trial lawyers lobby will \ncontinue to protect their privileges through irresponsible scare \ntactics.\n  Because, let Members be clear, the last week has demonstrated not \nonly that the American people--over 83 percent--want reform; a majority \nof the Senate wants reform too.\n  Only President Clinton and his trial lawyer allies defend the status \nquo.\n  What they will not do, however, is engage in a debate on the merits. \nI was disappointed to see President Clinton parrot the standard trial \nlawyer line that legal reform protected ``drunk drivers, murderers, \nrapists, and abusers of women and children.''\n  Mr. President, I have been here awhile, but I must say that I rarely \nhave seen such an offensive twisting of the truth. President Clinton \nknows better and he should be ashamed of engaging in such tactics.\n  The truth is that we have State and Federal criminal codes to deal \nwith these people. The real irony that is apparently lost on President \nClinton is that those same criminal codes generally contain--in \naddition to prison terms--fines and penalties that are typically $5,000 \nor $10,000 for serious felonies.\n  Those criminal fines are only a very small fraction of the \nmultimillion-dollar punitive damage award. So why is President Clinton \nnot attacking the criminal code for protecting criminals? Why have his \ncrime proposals not ever addressed this issue?\n  Because this is about politics, not policy. Our legal reforms focus \non the civil code, not the criminal code. President Clinton knows that.\n  But President Clinton also knows who raised millions of dollars for \nhim in 1992--the trial lawyers. And he knows who raised $25 million for \nDemocrat House and Senate candidates between 1989 and 1994--the trial \nlawyers.\n  Think about it. There is a lot talk of special interests in this \ntown, but no single-issue group comes anywhere close to bringing this \nmuch money to bear on Federal campaigns. And no other group is so \ngenerous and so exclusively for the party of President Clinton.\n  So, despite the evidence that there is bipartisan support for these \nreports--and expanding them so that every American can benefit--when \nthe chips were down, the trial lawyers and President Clinton started \ntrying to scare the American people.\n  And yesterday, that tactic worked. Only two Democrats voted for \nreform. But this tactic will fail in the end. I am proud that we are \ntrying to pass legal reform that benefits as many Americans as \npossible. I will continue to work for reforms that help small \nbusinesses, and volunteer and charitable organizations.\n  I believe the American people see past the irresponsible rhetoric. \nThey know we are continuing to fight for their interests.\n  But the reality, Mr. President, is that we cannot bring this debate \nto a close without bipartisan support. Forty-five Republicans did their \npart. Reform will not happen unless the Democrats put the interests of \nthe American people ahead of the interests of the trial lawyers and \ntheir huge financial stake in the Democrat Party.\n  I plan to bring this bill to a vote again on Monday or Tuesday. The \nAmerican people need and deserve these reforms, and I for one do not \nintend to allow scare tactics to deter us from our responsibility to \npass a legal reform package.\n  We hope to bring this bill to a vote. We think the American people \nwant Members to vote. We believe there is still a possibility because \nthere is some bipartisan support. We will have to have 60 votes. That \nis what happens in this place. We need 60 votes to shut off debate, so \nwe can pass even a narrowed product liability bill.\n  We believe it is a big step in the right direction and I hope we will \nhave the bipartisan support that Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia \nand Senator Gorton from Washington have been working for, for the past \n2 weeks.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6200-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

A bill to improve the ability of the United States to respond \nto the international terrorist threat; read the first time.\n\n\n                THE OMNIBUS COUNTERTERRORISM ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, since the terrible bombing in Oklahoma \nCity more than 2 weeks ago, we have been forced to consider what the \nsociety should do in self-defense against potentially deadly maniacs \nwho think that killing defenseless people is a way to send a political \nmessage or effect political change.\n  This is an enduring challenge for a democracy. We have faced it \nbefore. There is no easy answer.\n  We cannot afford to give the terrorists what they want to achieve--\nthe subversion of our free institutions--in the effort to prevent their \nterrorist acts. But we cannot remain complacent in the face of \ndetermined threats either.\n  The President has sent to Congress his proposal to give Federal law \nenforcement additional resources and tools to use in combating domestic \nand international terrorism on American soil. It includes commonsense \nexpansion of FBI investigative authorities in counterterrorism cases, \nsuch as access to credit reports and travel and hotel records, which \nare routinely available to State and local law enforcement authorities \nin criminal investigations.\n  It will speed the process of adding chemical taggants to explosives, \nas well as moving more aggressively into taggant and related explosives \nresearch.\n  It will expand the FBI's ability to use trace-and-track devices and \npen registers to capture the phone numbers dialed from or coming in to \na particular telephone. It does not abandon the requirement of American \nlaw that no phone may be tapped without an explicit warrant, issued \nonly when there is probable cause to suspect criminal activity.\n  The package of proposals includes added penalties and some broader \nFederal felony offenses, whose purpose is to conform the law with \nrespect to explosives to the existing law that covers firearms.\n  Coupled with the President's earlier antiterrorism bill directed at \ninternational terrorism, this is a sound step to respond to a national \nthreat without throwing overboard the civil rights of law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  The consensus of those who work in this field is that, although the \ncold war is over, the war against terrorism is just beginning. Experts \nmake some chilling--and compelling--arguments.\n  In the century preceding the Oklahoma City bombing, although \nterrorist groups were numerous, and although horrible murders, \nkidnapings, and other crimes by them were frequent, there were fewer \nthan a dozen terrorist attacks that cost more than 100 lives.\n  There is reason to fear, according to experts, that this trend is \nshifting. Where once terrorists would take hostages and threaten the \nlives of 1 or 2 or 20 people if their demands were not met, they no \nlonger issue specific demands. They take fewer and fewer hostages.\n  Instead, they attack more soft targets, where civilian casualties are \nbound to be higher. They are aiming less at a particular demand and \nmore at terrorizing the entire society.\n  They build more car bombs and undertake more suicide attacks; they \nattack civilians in crowds--airplanes, subways, and office buildings. \nThey make fewer explicit demands, but their broader demands are more \napocalyptic.\n  If this trend continues, instead of a cold war atmosphere of threat \nand counterthreat, of massive nuclear stockpiles poised to strike each \nother's targets, we face the prospect of random violence--impossible to \npredict, impossible to counter, impossible to explain.\n  A civilized society can live with many fears. We lived with the fear \nof nuclear holocaust for almost 50 years, yet our society became freer \nthroughout that time. The great advances in civil rights and \nprotections against Government were postwar.\n  But no civilized society will survive the threat of random terror. It \ncannot. We must be able to feel secure as we travel to our workplaces \neach day, as we sit at our desks or man our service counters--that we \nwill end the day predictably, by going home, making dinner, performing \nthe normal pattern of tasks and duties we face.\n  If we ever reach the point where randomized terror can paralyze us, \ncan make Americans distrust each other--distrust the safety of the next \nfew hours--the terrorists will have won, because we will be what they \nwant us to be: an atomized nation, without community, without security, \nwithout anything except fear for immediate individual survival.\n  That is where these people want to take us. We have to combat this, \nwithout becoming savages, without losing our perspective, without \nsuccumbing to paralyzing fear.\n  It is not going to be easy. If the experts are right, and apocalyptic \nterrorism is what the future holds, we will face challenges our system \nhas never before been forced to face. We will have to ask ourselves \nquestions that we have never before raised.\n  A growing number of terrorist groups believe they are fighting a holy \nwar. That change has changed the nature of what they are prepared to \ndo, the risks they themselves are prepared to run, and the damage they \nare prepared to inflict.\n  This change presents us, as a society, with a challenge as well. \nAmericans are of diverse faiths, but we are among the \n[[Page S6203]] most religious people in the industrialized world today. \nWe respect the faith of others, and we respect the demands of their \nreligion. Our respect for religious belief is not enshrined only in our \nfirst amendment. It is an instinctive American habit not to second-\nguess the faith of your neighbor.\n  And yet, if terrorism comes claiming religious sanction, we have to \nface it. And this bill will help us.\n  Since 1990, 40 percent of all terrorist acts worldwide have been \ncommitted explicitly against American targets. That is, in large part, \nbecause the success of our society is a standing refutation of the \nbeliefs of many of these groups. Unless our system can be destroyed, \ntheir vision cannot be vindicated.\n  This is believed by domestic groups as well as groups overseas.\n  Reports that some Americans think they have to shoot down military \nhelicopters on routine training missions are surfacing. A Member of \nCongress has even proposed requiring Federal law enforcement agents to \nbe formally deputized by local authorities before they can carry out \ntheir responsibilities. Reports of threats against local officials have \ndiscouraged involvement in local government meetings in some regions.\n  I do not believe that words alone cause terrorist acts. I do not \nthink anyone seriously believes so. But I do believe that a culture is \ncomprised of many factors, feeding into its hopes and fears, and I do \nbelieve that a culture changes as the factors feeding its hopes and \nplaying on its fears change.\n  When people in the mainstream become careless with words, they breach \nbarriers that create a new set of assumptions. Barriers, once breached, \nare permeable in both directions. The lunacy of the fringe enters the \nmainstream even as the careless or calculated words of the mainstream \ncreate a new defining normalcy. Senator Moynihan has spoken about a \nsociety that redefines deviancy. Those aggressively seeking to make \ntheir mark on our society should examine how they are defining \nnormalcy.\n  We are warned by the Tokyo subway bombing earlier this year that \nweapons of mass destruction need not be explosives. Easily manufactured \nchemical and biological weapons can be as deadly and effective when the \ngoal is to terrorize a community.\n  Before it collapsed, the Soviet Union operated the largest biological \nwarfare production facility in the world, employing 15,000 scientists. \nThese people had developed a form of bubonic plague that was resistant \nto 26 antibiotics, a form of fast-spreading meningitis, agents that \ncould be introduced into water systems or into the air in climate-\ncontrolled buildings.\n  Today, these people face the economic collapse of the system that \nsupported them as highly paid and privileged specialists. All they need \nto re-create their deadly work is carried in their own brains. The \ntemptation to sell that knowledge outside of Russian borders cannot be \nignored at a time when the value of their monthly wages has fallen to \nless than $70.\n  Again, this threat is not limited to international terrorists. In \nAugust 1994, our own FBI arrested two members of a group calling itself \nthe Patriots' Council in Minneapolis. This group was concocting ricin, \na neurotoxin that can be produced from the common castor bean plant.\n  An equally deadly potential is the contamination of a conventional \nbomb with radioactivity. Since May 1994, there have been 39 separate \nincidents of nuclear materials diversion in Eastern and Southern \nEurope. It is not necessary for radioactive material to be made into an \nexplosive device like a bomb. The contamination of a conventional bomb \nwith radioactive materials is simpler; its terrifying effect would be \nas great.\n  These threats are not speculative. Unfortunately, they are all too \nreal.\n  We cannot and must not succumb to the temptation of regarding \neveryone with oddball notions as a potential threat. But, \nunfortunately, neither can we write off all oddballs as harmless.\n  It is the goal of the President's counterterrorism approach that we \nbe able to make the distinctions between the harmless and the \npotentially dangerous before the dangerous are able to strike again, \nnot afterward.\n  I believe it is a balanced package of proposals that does not go too \nfar. We should pass this legislation promptly, without detouring into \nthe partisan political minefields some have suggested.\n  Curtailing the appellate rights of prisoners on death row is not \ngoing to change the murderous intentions of terrorist groups. The \nextraneous politically motivated inclusion of these kinds of provisions \ndoes a disservice to the cause of counterterrorism. It does not move us \nforward; it is intentionally and purposefully divisive.\n  I very much regret that this is on the agenda of some in the wake of \na national tragedy. I would hope that these issues could be abandoned \nfor the time being, out of respect for the families of the victims of \nthe Oklahoma bombing and so that we may enact the necessary \ncounterterrorism legislation expeditiously. We have plenty of time for \npolitics later. This is a time that demands unity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1.\n       Section 1 states that the short title for the Act is ``The \n     Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995.''\n       Section 2.\n       Section 2 provides a Table of Contents for the Act.\n       Section 3.\n       Section 3 sets forth the congressional findings and \n     purposes for the Act.\n       Section 101.\n       The purpose of section 101 is to provide a more certain and \n     comprehensive basis for the Federal Government to respond to \n     future acts of international terrorism carried out within the \n     United States. The section creates an overarching statute \n     (proposed 18 U.S.C. 2332b) which would allow the Government \n     to incorporate for purposes of a Federal prosecution any \n     applicable Federal or State criminal statute violated by the \n     terrorist act, so long as the Government can establish any \n     one of a variety of jurisdictional bases delineated in \n     proposed subsection 2332b(c).\n       Subsection 101(a) creates a new offense, 18 U.S.C. 2332b, \n     entitled ``Acts of Terrorism Transcending National \n     Boundaries.'' This statute is aimed at those terrorist acts \n     that take place within the United States but which are in \n     some fashion or degree instigated, commanded, or facilitated \n     from outside the United States. It does not encompass acts of \n     street crime or domestic terrorism which are in no way \n     connected to overseas sources.\n       Subsection 2332b(a) sets forth the particular findings and \n     purposes for the provision.\n       Subsection 2332b(b) sets forth the prohibited acts which \n     relate to the killing, kidnapping, maiming, assault causing \n     serious bodily injury, or assault with a dangerous weapon of \n     any individual (U.S. national or alien) within the United \n     States. It also covers destruction or damage to any \n     structure, conveyance or other real or personal property \n     within the United States. These are the types of violent \n     actions that terrorists most often undertake. The provision \n     encompasses any such activity which is in violation of the \n     laws of the United States or any State, provided a Federal \n     jurisdictional nexus is present.\n       Subsection 2332b(c) sets forth the jurisdictional bases. \n     Except for subsections (c) (6) and (7), these bases are a \n     compilation of jurisdictional elements which are presently \n     utilized in federal statutes and which have been approved by \n     the courts.\n       Paragraph (1) covers the situation where the offender \n     travels in commerce. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1952.\n       Paragraph (2) covers the situation where the mails or a \n     facility utilized in any manner in commerce is used to \n     further the commission of the offense or to effectuate an \n     escape therefrom. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1951.\n       Paragraph (3) covers the situation where the results of \n     illegal conduct affect commerce. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1365(c).\n       Paragraph (4) covers the situation where the victim is a \n     federal official. Cf. 18 U.S.C. 115, 1114, 351, 1751. The \n     language includes both civilians and military personnel. \n     Moreover, it also covers any ``agent'' of a federal agency. \n     Cf. 18 U.S.C. 1114 (i.e., assisting agent of customs or \n     internal revenue) and 1121. It covers all branches of \n     government, including members of the military services, as \n     well as all independent agencies of the United States.\n       Paragraph (5) covers property used in commerce (cf. 18 \n     U.S.C. 844(i)), owned by the United States (cf. 18 U.S.C. \n     1361), owned by an institution receiving federal financial \n     assistance (cf. 18 U.S.C. 844(f)) or insured by the federal \n     government (cf. 18 U.S.C. 2113).\n       Paragraph (6) provides a jurisdictional base which has not \n     been tested. It should, however, fall with the federal \n     government's commerce power. It is included to avoid the \n     construction, given to many federal interstate commerce \n     statutes, that a ``commercial'' aspect is required. Paragraph \n     (6) would cover both business and personal \n     travel. [[Page S6204]] \n       Paragraph (7) covers situations where the victim or \n     perpetrator is not a national of the United States. The \n     victimization of an alien in a terrorist attack has the \n     potential of affecting the relations of the United States \n     with the country of which the alien is a citizen. Moreover, \n     some other statutes base criminal jurisdiction on the \n     involvement of an alien as the perpetrator or victim. E.g., \n     see 18 U.S.C. 1203 and 1116. In addition, aliens are a \n     special responsibility of the federal government, as it is \n     involved in admitting aliens, establishing the conditions for \n     their presence, adjusting them to resident alien status, \n     deporting aliens for violating the immigration laws, and \n     eventually naturalizing aliens as citizens.\n       Paragraphs (8) and (9) cover the territorial seas of the \n     United States and other places within the special maritime \n     and territorial jurisdiction of the United States that are \n     located within the United States (cf. 18 U.S.C. 7).\n       Jurisdiction exists over the prohibited activity if at \n     least one of the jurisdictional elements is applicable to one \n     perpetrator. When jurisdiction exists for one perpetrator, it \n     exists over all perpetrators even those who were never within \n     the United States.\n       Subsection (d) sets forth stringent penalties. These \n     penalties are mandatorily consecutive to any other term of \n     imprisonment which the defendant might receive. Consecutive \n     sentences for ``identical'' offenses brought in the same \n     prosecution are constitutionally permissible. See Missouri v. \n     Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 367 (1983). However, there is no \n     statutory mandatory minimum. The court is given the \n     discretion to decide the penalty for this offense under the \n     sentencing guidelines.\n       Subsection (e) limits the prosecutorial discretion of the \n     Attorney General. Before an indictment is sought under \n     section 2332b, the Attorney General, or the highest ranking \n     subordinate of the Attorney General with responsibility for \n     criminal prosecutions, must certify that in his or her \n     judgment the violation of section 2332b, or the activity \n     preparatory to its commission, transcended national \n     boundaries. This means that the Attorney General must \n     conclude that some connection exists between the activities \n     and some person or entity outside the United States.\n       Moreover, the certification must find that the offense \n     appears to have been intended to coerce, intimidate, or \n     retaliate against a government or civilian population. This \n     is similar to the certification requirement for ``terrorism'' \n     found in 18 U.S.C. 2332(d). The term ``civilian population'' \n     includes any segment thereof and, accordingly, is consistent \n     with the Congressionally intended scope of section 2332(d). \n     The certification requirement ensures that the statute will \n     only be used against terrorists with overseas connections. \n     Section 2332b is not aimed at purely domestic terrorism or \n     against normal street crime as current law, both federal and \n     state, appears to adequately address these areas. The \n     certification of the Attorney General is not an element of \n     the offense and, except for verification that the \n     determination was made by an authorized official, is not \n     subject to judicial review.\n       Subsection (f) states that the Attorney General shall \n     investigate this offense and may request assistance from any \n     other federal, state, or local agency including the military \n     services. This latter provision, also found in several other \n     statutes, see e.g., 18 U.S.C. 351(g) and 1751(i), is intended \n     to overcome the restrictions of the posse comitatus statute, \n     18 U.S.C. 1385. It is not intended to give intelligence \n     agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, any \n     mission that is prohibited by their charters.\n       Pursuant to 28 C.F.R. 0.85(a), the Attorney General \n     automatically delegates investigative responsibility over \n     this offense to the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI). Moreover, under 28 C.F.R. 0.85(l) the \n     FBI has been designated as the lead federal law enforcement \n     agency responsible for criminal investigation of terrorism \n     within the United States. While local and state authorities \n     retain their investigative authority under their respective \n     laws, it is expected that in the authority under their \n     respective laws, it is expected that in the event of major \n     terrorist crimes such agencies will cooperate, consult, \n     coordinate and work closely with the FBI, as occurred in the \n     investigation of the World Trade Center bombing in New York \n     City.\n       Subsection (g) makes express two points which are normally \n     inferred by courts under similar statutes, namely, that no \n     defendant has to have knowledge of any jurisdictional base \n     and that only the elements of the state offense and not any \n     of its provisions pertaining to procedures or evidence are \n     adopted. Federal rules of evidence and procedure control any \n     case brought under section 2332b.\n       Subsection (h) makes it clear that there is \n     extraterritorial jurisdiction to reach defendants who were \n     involved in crimes but who never entered the United States.\n       Subsection (i) sets forth definitions, many of which \n     specifically incorporate definitions from elsewhere in the \n     federal code, e.g., the definition of ``territorial sea'' in \n     18 U.S.C. 2280(e).\n       Subsection 101(b) makes a technical amendment to the \n     chapter analysis for Chapter 113B of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       Subsection 101(c) amends 18 U.S.C. 3286, which was created \n     by section 120001 of Pub. Law 103-322. Section 3286 is \n     designed to extend the period of limitation for a series of \n     enumerated terrorism offenses from five to eight years. The \n     wording of the section, however, gives rise to a potential \n     interpretation that, with respect to violations of the \n     enumerated offenses that are capital crimes, the same eight-\n     year period applies rather than the unlimited period that \n     previously applied and continues to apply to capital offenses \n     under 18 U.S.C. 3281. Section 3286's introductory language is \n     as follows:\n       ``Notwithstanding section 3282, no person shall be \n     prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense involving a \n     violation of'' the enumerated provisions of law (emphasis \n     supplied).\n       It seems clear that Congress did not intend to reduce the \n     limitations period for offenses under the enumerated statutes \n     that are capital due to the killing of one or more victims. \n     Rather, the intent was (as the title of the section 120001 \n     provision indicates to enlarge the applicable limitation \n     period for non-capital violations of the listed offenses. \n     Accordingly, the proposed amendment would insert ``non-\n     capital'' after ``any'' in the above-quoted phrase. Notably, \n     the drafters were careful to include the word ``non-capital'' \n     when affecting a similar period of limitations extension \n     applicable to arson offenses under 18 U.S.C. 844(i) in \n     section 320917 of the Pub. L. 103-322.\n       Subsection 101(c) also corrects certain erroneous statutory \n     references in section 3286 (i.e., changes ``36'' to ``37'', \n     ``2331'' to ``2332'' and ``2339'' to ``2332a''). Finally, the \n     subsection adds to section 3286 the new 18 U.S.C. 2332b.\n       Subsection 101(d) amends section 3142(e) of title 18, \n     United States Code, to insure that a defendant arrested for a \n     violation of the new 18 U.S.C. 2332b is presumed to be \n     unreleasable pending trial. The factors, most likely to be \n     present, i.e., an alien perpetrator who is likely to flee and \n     who is working on behalf of or in concert with a foreign \n     organization, makes such an individual unsuitable for release \n     pending trial. This presumption, which is subject to \n     rebuttal, will limit the degree of sensitive evidence that \n     the Government must disclose to sustain its burden to deny \n     release.\n       Section 102.\n       Section 102 is designed to complement section 101 of this \n     bill concerning terrorist acts within the United States \n     transcending national boundaries. Just as a better basis for \n     addressing crimes carried out within the United States by \n     international terrorists is needed, it also is appropriate \n     that there should be an effective federal basis to reach \n     conspiracies undertaken in part within the United States for \n     the purpose of carrying out terrorist acts in foreign \n     countries.\n       Section 102 covers two areas of activity involving \n     international terrorists. The first is conspiracy in the \n     United States to murder, kidnap, or maim a person outside of \n     the United States. The second is conspiracy in the United \n     States to destroy certain critical types of property, such \n     as public buildings and conveyances, in foreign countries. \n     The term conveyance would include cars, buses, trucks, \n     airplanes, trains, and vessels.\n       Subsection 102(a) amends current 18 U.S.C. 956 in several \n     ways. It creates a new subsection 956(a) which proscribes a \n     conspiracy in the United States to murder, maim, or kidnap a \n     person outside of the United States. The new section fills a \n     void in the law that exists. Currently, subsection 956(a) \n     only prohibits a conspiracy in the United States to commit \n     certain types of property crimes in a foreign country with \n     which the United States is at peace. It does not cover \n     conspiracy to commit crimes against the person.\n       Subsection 102(a) thus expands on the current section 956 \n     so that new subsection 956(a) covers conspiracy to commit one \n     of the three listed serious crimes against any person in a \n     foreign country or in any place outside of the jurisdiction \n     of the United States, such as on the high seas. This type of \n     offense is committed by terrorists and the new subsection \n     956(a) is intended to ensure that the government is able to \n     punish those persons who use the United States as a base in \n     which to plot such a crime to be carried out outside the \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n       New subsection 956(a) would apply to conspiracies to commit \n     one of the enumerated offenses where at least one of the \n     conspirators is inside the United States. The other member or \n     members of the conspiracy would not have to be in the United \n     States but at least one overt act in furtherance of the \n     conspiracy would have to be committed in the United States. \n     The subsection would apply, for example, to two individuals \n     who consummated an agreement to kill a person in a foreign \n     country where only one of the conspirators was in the United \n     States and the agreement was reached by telephone \n     conversations or letters, provided at least one of the overt \n     acts was undertaken by one co-conspirator while in the United \n     States. In such a case, the agreement would be reached at \n     least in part in the United States. The overt act may be that \n     of only one of the conspirators and need not itself be a \n     crime.\n       Subsection 102(a) also re-enacts current section 956(a) of \n     title 18 (dealing with a conspiracy in the United States to \n     destroy property in a foreign country) as subsection 956(b), \n     and expands its coverage to other forms of property. The \n     revision adds the terms ``airport'' and ``airfield'' to the \n     list of ``public utilities'' presently set out in section \n     956(a), since they are particularly attractive targets for \n     terrorists. New subsection 956(b) also adds public \n     conveyances (e.g., buses), public structures, and any \n     religious, educational or cultural property to the list of \n     targets. This makes it clear that [[Page S6205]] the statute \n     covers a conspiracy to destroy any conveyance on which people \n     travel and any structure where people assemble, such as a \n     store, factory or office building. It also covers property \n     used for purposes of tourism, education, religion or \n     entertainment. Accordingly, the words ``public utility'' \n     do not limit the statute's application to a conspiracy to \n     destroy only such public utility property as \n     transportation lines or power generating facilities.\n       Consequently, as amended, 18 U.S.C. 956 reaches those \n     individuals who have conspired within the United States to \n     commit the violent offenses overseas and who solicit money in \n     the United States to facilitate their commission. Moreover, \n     monetary contributors who have knowledge of the conspiracy's \n     purpose are coconspirators subject to prosecution.\n       Subsection 102(a) also increases the penalties in current \n     18 U.S.C. 956(a). The new penalties are comparable to those \n     proposed in section 101 of the bill for the new 18 U.S.C. \n     2332b. Finally, subsection 102(a) eliminates the requirement \n     that is currently found in 18 U.S.C. 956(b) of naming in the \n     indictment the ``specific property'' which is being targeted, \n     as this requirement may be difficult to establish in the \n     context of a terrorism conspiracy which does not result in a \n     completed offense. Additionally, even in a completed \n     conspiracy, the parties may, after agreeing that a category \n     of property or person will be targeted, leave the actual \n     selection of the particular target of their conspirators on \n     the ground overseas. Hence, while an indictment must always \n     describe its purposes with specificity, it need not allege \n     all specific facts, especially those that were formulated at \n     a subsequent time or which may not be completely known to \n     some of the participants.\n       Section 956 is contained in chapter 45 of title 18, United \n     States Code, relating to interference with the foreign \n     relations of the United States. It is not intended to apply \n     to duly authorized actions undertaken on behalf of the United \n     States Government. Chapter 45 covers those individuals who, \n     without appropriate governmental authorization, engage in \n     prohibited conduct that is harmful to the foreign relations \n     of the United States.\n       Section 103.\n       This section would correct a failure to execute fully our \n     treaty obligations and would, in addition, clarify and expand \n     federal jurisdiction over certain overseas acts of terrorism \n     affecting United States interests.\n       Subsection 103(a) would amend 49 U.S.C. 46502(b) (former \n     section 902(n) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as \n     amended (49 U.S.C. App. 1472(n)). Section 46502(b) currently \n     covers those aircraft piracies that occur outside the \n     ``special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States,'' as \n     defined in 49 U.S.C. 46501(2). It, therefore, applies to \n     hijackings of foreign civil aircraft which never enter \n     United States airspace. As a State Party to the 1970 Hague \n     Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of \n     Aircraft, the United States has a treaty obligation to \n     prosecute or extradite such offenders when they are found \n     in the United States. This measure is based on the \n     universal jurisdiction theory. See United States v. Yunis, \n     924 F.2d 1086 (D.C. Cir. 1991). However, the present \n     statute fails to make clear when federal criminal \n     jurisdiction commences with respect to such air piracies, \n     absent the actual presence within the United States of one \n     of the perpetrators.\n       Paragraph (a)(1) would establish clear federal criminal \n     jurisdiction over those foreign aircraft hijackings where \n     United States nationals are victims or perpetrators. While \n     the Hague Convention does not mandate that State Parties \n     criminalize those situations involving their nationals as \n     victims or perpetrators, it does allow State Parties to \n     assert extraterritorial jurisdiction on the basis of the \n     passive personality principle. See Paragraph 3 of Article 4. \n     In addition, other recent international conventions dealing \n     with terrorism, such as the United Nations Convention Against \n     the Taking of Hostages and the International Maritime \n     Organization Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts \n     Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, mandate criminal \n     jurisdiction by a State Party when its national is a \n     perpetrator and permit the assertion of jurisdiction when its \n     national is a victim of an offense prohibited by those \n     conventions. Further, experience has shown that it is often \n     the country whose nationals were victims of the hijacking \n     which is willing to commit the necessary resources to locate, \n     prosecute, and incarcerate the perpetrators for a period of \n     time commensurate with their criminal acts. For those foreign \n     civil aircraft hijackings involving no United States \n     nationals as victims or perpetrators, section 46502 would \n     continue to carry out the U.S. obligation under the \n     Convention to prosecute or extradite an airline perpetrator \n     who was subsequently found in the United States.\n       Under the clarified statute, subject matter jurisdiction \n     over the offense would vest whenever a United States national \n     was on a hijacked flight or was the perpetrator of the \n     hijacking. Where a United States national is the perpetrator, \n     all perpetrators, including non-U.S. nationals, would be \n     subject to indictment for the offense, since these non-\n     national defendants would be either principals or aides and \n     abettors within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 2.\n       Paragraph (a)(2) amends 49 U.S.C. 46502(b)(2) to set forth \n     the three different subject matter jurisdictional bases. It \n     has the effect of repealing the current provision which \n     failed to fully execute our treaty obligation. Presently, \n     paragraph 46502(b)(2) reads: ``This subsection applies only \n     if the place of takeoff or landing of the aircraft on which \n     the individual commits the offense is located outside the \n     territory of the country of registration of the \n     aircraft.'' Paragraph (b)(2) was intended to reflect \n     paragraph 3 of Article 3 of the Hague Convention, which \n     states that the convention normally applies ``only if the \n     place of take-off or the place of actual landing of the \n     aircraft on which the offense is committed is situated \n     outside the territory of the State or registration of that \n     aircraft.'' However, the authors of the original \n     legislation apparently overlooked the obligation imposed \n     by paragraph 5 of Article 3 of the Convention which \n     applies when the alleged aircraft hijacker is found in the \n     territory of a State Party other than the State of \n     registration of the hijacked aircraft. Paragraph 5 states: \n     ``Notwithstanding paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, \n     Article 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall apply whatever the place of \n     take-off or the place of actual landing of the aircraft, \n     if the offender or the alleged offender is found in the \n     territory of a State other than the State of registration \n     of that aircraft.''\n       For example, under the Hague Convention, the hijacking of \n     an Air India flight that never left India is not initially \n     covered by the Convention. (Article 3, paragraph 3.) However, \n     the subsequent travel of the offender from India to the \n     jurisdiction of another State Party triggers treaty \n     obligations. Paragraph 5 makes the obligation of Article 7, \n     to either prosecute or extradite an alleged offender found in \n     a party's territory, applicable to a hijacker of a purely \n     domestic air flight who flees to another State.\n       Paragraph (a)(3) creates a new section 46502(b)(3) which \n     provides a definition of ``national of the United States'' \n     that has been used in other terrorism provisions, see, e.g., \n     18 U.S.C. 2331(2) and 3077(2)(A).\n       Subsection 103(b) amends section 32(b) of title 18, United \n     States Code. Presently, section 32(b) carries out the treaty \n     obligation of the United States, as a State Party to the \n     Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts \n     Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, to prosecute or \n     extradite offenders found in the United States who have \n     engaged in certain acts of violence directed against foreign \n     civil aircraft located outside the United States. The \n     proposed amendment would fully retain current jurisdiction \n     and would establish additional jurisdiction where a United \n     States national was the perpetrator or a United States \n     national was on board such aircraft when the offense was \n     committed. Because subsection 32(b)(3) of title 18, United \n     States Code, covers the placement of destructive devices upon \n     such aircraft and a ``victim'' does not necessarily have to \n     be on board the aircraft at the time of such placement, the \n     phrase ``or would have been on board'' has been used. In such \n     instances, the prosecution would have to establish that a \n     United States national would have been on board a flight that \n     such aircraft would have undertaken if the destructive device \n     had not been placed thereon.\n       Subsection 103(b) is drafted in the same manner as \n     paragraph (a)(2), above, so that once subject matter \n     jurisdiction over the offense vests, all the perpetrators of \n     the offense are subject to indictment for the offense.\n       Subsections 103 (c), (d), (e) and (f) would amend 18 U.S.C. \n     1116 (murder), 112 (assault), 878 (threats), and 1201 \n     (kidnapping), respectively. The primary purpose of these \n     proposed amendments is to extend federal jurisdiction to \n     reach United States nationals, or those acting in concert \n     with such a national, who commit one of the specified \n     offenses against an internationally protected person located \n     outside of the United States. The invocation of such \n     jurisdiction under U.S. law is required by the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against \n     Internationally Protected Persons, including diplomatic \n     agents. It was apparently omitted as an oversight when the \n     implementing federal legislation was enacted in 1976 (P.L. \n     94-467).\n       Additionally, the provisions would also clarify existing \n     jurisdiction. The language used in the first sentence of \n     sections 1116(e), 112(e), 878(d), and 1201(e) is ambiguous as \n     pertains to instances in which the victim is a United States \n     diplomat. The first sentence in each of these provisions now \n     reads: ``If the victim of an offense under subsection (a) is \n     an internationally protected person, the United States may \n     exercise jurisdiction over the offense if the alleged \n     offender is present within the United States, irrespective of \n     the place where the offense was committed or the nationality \n     of the victim or the alleged offender.''\n       This sentence could be read to require the presence of the \n     offender in the United States even when the internationally \n     protected person injured overseas was a United States \n     diplomat. This would be anomalous and was likely not \n     intended. Accordingly, subsections (c)-(f) rewrite the first \n     sentence to read as follows:\n       ``If the victim of an offense under subsection (a) is an \n     internationally protected person outside the United States, \n     the United States may exercise jurisdiction over the offense \n     if (1) the victim is a representative, officers, employee, or \n     agent of the United States, (2) an offender is a national of \n     the United States, or (3) an offender is afterwards found in \n     the United States.''\n       The provision is drafted, in the same manner as the \n     aircraft piracy and aircraft destruction measures, so that \n     once subject [[Page S6206]] matter jurisdiction over the \n     offense is vested, all the perpetrators of the offense would \n     be subject to indictment for the offense.\n       Subsections 103(c)-(f) also would incorporate in an \n     appropriate manner the definition of ``national of the United \n     States'' in sections 1116, 112, 878, and 1201 of title 18.\n       Subsection 103(g) contains an amendment similar in nature \n     to those in the preceding subsections. It expands federal \n     jurisdiction over extraterritorial offenses involving \n     violence at international airports under 18 U.S.C. 37. That \n     provision, enacted as section 60021 of Public Law 103-322, \n     presently reaches such crimes committed outside the United \n     States only when the offender is later found in the United \n     States. There is, however, good reason to provide for federal \n     jurisdiction over such terrorist crimes when an offender or a \n     victim is a United States national. In such circumstances the \n     interests of the United States are equal to, if not greater \n     than, the circumstance where neither the victim nor the \n     offender is necessarily a United States national but the \n     offender is subsequently found in this country.\n       Subsection 103(h) adds the standard definition of the term \n     ``national of the United States'' to 18 U.S.C. 178. This term \n     is used earlier in the chapter (in 18 U.S.C. 175(a), which \n     provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes \n     involving biological weapons ``committed by or against a \n     national of the United States'') but no definition is \n     provided.\n       Section 201\n       In recent years, the Department of Justice has obtained \n     considerable evidence of involvement in terrorism by aliens \n     in the United States. Both legal aliens, such as lawful \n     permanent residents and aliens here on student visas, and \n     illegal aliens are known to have aided and to have received \n     instructions regarding terrorist acts from various \n     international terrorist groups. While many of these aliens \n     would be subject to deportation proceedings under the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), these proceedings \n     present serious difficulties in cases involving classified \n     information. Specifically, these procedures do not prevent \n     disclosure of classified information where such disclosure \n     would pose a risk to national security. Consequently, section \n     201 sets out a new title in the INA devoted exclusively to \n     the removal of aliens involved in terrorist activity where \n     classified information is used to sustain the grounds for \n     deportation.\n       The new title would create a special court, patterned after \n     the special court created under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). When the \n     Department of Justice believes that it has identified an \n     alien in the United States who has engaged in terrorist \n     activity, and that to afford such an alien a deportation \n     hearing would reveal classified national security \n     information, it could seek an ex parte order from the court. \n     The order would authorize a formal hearing, called a special \n     removal hearing, before the same court, at which the \n     Department of Justice would seek to prove by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the alien had in fact engaged in \n     terrorist activity. At the hearing, classified evidence could \n     be presented in camera and not revealed to the alien or the \n     public, although its general nature would normally be \n     summarized.\n       Enactment of section 201 would provide a valuable new tool \n     with which to combat aliens who use the United States as a \n     base from which to launch or fund terrorist attacks either on \n     U.S. citizens or on persons in other countries. It is a \n     carefully measured response to the menace posed by alien \n     terrorists and fully comports with and exceeds all \n     constitutional requirements applicable to aliens.\n       Subsection 201(a) sets out findings that aliens are \n     committing terrorist acts in the United States and against \n     United States citizens and interests and that the existing \n     provisions of the INA providing for the deportation of \n     criminal aliens are inadequate to deal with this threat. \n     These findings are in addition to the general findings \n     contained in section 3 of the bill. The findings explain that \n     these inadequacies arise primarily because the INA, \n     particularly in its requirements pertaining to deportation \n     hearings, may require disclosure of classified information.\n       The findings are important in explaining Congressional \n     intent and purpose. As noted above, section 201 creates an \n     entirely new type of hearing to determine whether aliens \n     believed to be terrorists should be removed from the United \n     States. At such a ``special removal hearing.'' the government \n     would be permitted to introduce in camera and ex parte \n     classified evidence that the alien has engaged in terrorist \n     activity. Such hearings would be held before Article III \n     judges. The in camera and ex parte portion of the hearing \n     would relate to classified information which, if provided to \n     the alien or otherwise made public, would pose a risk to \n     national security. Such an extraordinary type of hearing \n     would be invoked only in a very small percentage of \n     deportation cases, and would be applicable only in those \n     cases in which an Article III judge has found probable cause \n     to believe that the aliens in question are involved in \n     terrorist activity. Although the bill provides the alien many \n     rights equal to--and in some respects greater than--those \n     enjoyed by aliens in ordinary deportation proceedings, the \n     rights specified for aliens subject to a special removal \n     hearing are deemed exclusive of any rights otherwise afforded \n     under the INA.\n       It is within the power of Congress to provide for a special \n     adjudicatory proceeding and to specify the procedural rights \n     of aliens involved in terrorist acts. The Supreme Court has \n     noted that ``control over matters of immigration is a \n     sovereign prerogative, largely within the control of the \n     Executive and the Legislature . . . . The role of the \n     judiciary is limited to determining whether the procedures \n     meet the essential standard of fairness under the Due Process \n     Clause and does not extend to imposing procedures that merely \n     displace congressional choices of policy.'' Landon v. \n     Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34-35 (1982). Moreover, Congress can \n     specify what type of process is due different classes of \n     aliens. ``[A] host of constitutional and statutory \n     provisions rest on the premise that a legitimate \n     distinction between citizens and aliens may justify \n     attributes and benefits for one class not accorded to the \n     other; and the class of aliens itself is a heterogeneous \n     multitude of persons with a wide-ranging variety of ties \n     to this country.'' Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 78-79 \n     (1976). Because the Due Process Clause does not require \n     ``that all aliens must be placed in a single homogeneous \n     legal classification,'' id., Congress can provide separate \n     processes and procedures for determining whether to remove \n     resident and nonresident alien terrorists.\n       Subsection 201(b) adds a new title V to the INA to provide \n     a special process for removing alien terrorists when \n     compliance with normal deportation procedures might adversely \n     affect national security interests of the United States. \n     However, the new title V is not the only way of expelling \n     alien terrorists from the United States. In addition to \n     proceedings under the new special removal provisions, aliens \n     falling within 8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B) alternatively could be \n     deported following a regular deportation hearing. Moreover, \n     like all other aliens, alien terrorists remain subject to \n     possible expulsion for any of the remaining deportation \n     grounds specified in section 241 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1251). \n     For example, alien terrorists who violate the criminal laws \n     of the United States remain subject to ``ordinary'' \n     deportation proceedings on charges under INA section \n     241(a)(2). The special removal provisions augment, without in \n     any way narrowing, the prosecutorial options in cases of \n     alien terrorists.\n       The new title V consists of four new sections of the INA, \n     sections 501-504 (8 U.S.C. 1601-1604). Briefly, the title \n     provides for creation of a special court comprised of Article \n     III judges, patterned after the special court created under \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1801 et \n     seq.). When the Department of Justice believes it has \n     identified an alien terrorist, that is, an alien who falls \n     within 8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B), and determines that to \n     disclose the evidence of that fact to the alien or the public \n     would compromise national security, the Department may seek \n     an order from the special court. The order would authorize \n     the Department to present the classified portion of its \n     evidence that the alien is a terrorist in camera and ex parte \n     at a special removal hearing. The classified portion of the \n     evidence would be received in chambers with only the court \n     reporter, the counsel for the government, and the witness or \n     document present. The general nature of such evidence, \n     without identifying classified or sensitive particulars, \n     would than normally be revealed to the alien, his counsel, \n     and the public in summarized form. The summary would have to \n     be found by the court to be sufficient to permit the alien to \n     prepare a defense.\n       Where an adequate summary, as determined by the court, \n     would pose a risk to national security, and, hence, \n     unavailable to the alien, the special hearing would be \n     terminated unless the court found that (1) the continued \n     presence of the alien in the United States or (2) the \n     preparation of the adequate summary would likely cause \n     serious and irreparable harm to the national security or \n     death or serious bodily injury to any person. If such a \n     situation exists, the special removal hearing would continue, \n     the alien would not receive a summary, and the relevant \n     classified information could be introduced against the alien \n     pursuant to subsection (j).\n       If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the judge finds that \n     the government has established by clear and convincing \n     evidence that the alien has engaged in terrorist activity, \n     the judge would order the alien removed from the United \n     States. The alien could appeal the decision to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \n     and ultimately could petition for a writ of certiorari to the \n     Supreme Court.\n       Use of information that is not made available to the alien \n     for reasons of national security is a well-established \n     concept in the existing provisions of the INA and immigration \n     regulations. For example, section 235(c) provides for an \n     expedited exclusion process for aliens excludable under 8 \n     U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) (providing for the exclusion, inter alia, \n     of alien spies, saboteurs, and terrorists), and states in \n     relevant part:\n       If the Attorney General is satisfied that the alien is \n     excludable under [paragraph 212(a)(3)] on the basis of \n     information of a confidential nature, the disclosure of which \n     the Attorney General, in his discretion, and after \n     consultation with the appropriate security agencies of the \n     Government, concludes would be prejudicial to the public \n     interest, safety, or security, he may in his discretion order \n     such alien to be excluded and deported without any inquiry or \n     further inquiry by [an immigration judge].''\n       Thus, where it is necessary to protect sensitive \n     information, existing law authorizes [[Page S6207]] the \n     Attorney General to conduct exclusion proceedings outside the \n     ordinary immigration court procedures and to rely on \n     classified information in ordering the exclusion of alien \n     terrorists.\n       In the deportation context, 8 C.F.R. 242.17 (1990) provides \n     that in determining whether to grant discretionary relief to \n     an otherwise deportable alien, the immigration judge ``may \n     consider and base his decision on information not contained \n     in the record and not made available for inspection by the \n     [alien], provided the Commissioner has determined that such \n     information is relevant and is classified under Executive \n     Order No. 12356 (47 FR 14874, April 6, 1982) as requiring \n     protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest of \n     national security.''\n       The constitutionality of this provision has been upheld. \n     Suciu v. INS, 755 F.2d 127 (8th Cir. 1985). The alien in that \n     case had been in the United States for 16 years and had \n     become deportable for overstaying his student visa, a \n     deportation ground ordinarily susceptible to discretionary \n     relief. Nevertheless, the court held that it was proper to \n     deny the alien discretionary relief without disclosing to him \n     the reasons for the denial. Sucia followed the Supreme \n     Court's holding sustaining the constitutionality of a similar \n     predecessor regulation in Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345 (1956).\n       Section 501 (Applicability).\n       Section 501 sets forth the applicability of the new title. \n     Section 501(a) states that the title may, but need not, be \n     employed by the Department of Justice whenever it has \n     information that an alien is subject to deportation because \n     he is an alien described in 8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B), that is, \n     because he has engaged in terrorist activity.\n       Section 501(b) provides that whenever an official of the \n     Department of Justice determines to seek the expulsion of an \n     alien terrorist under the special removal provisions, only \n     the provisions of the new title need be followed. This \n     ensures that such an alien will not be deemed to have any \n     additional rights under the other provisions of the INA. \n     Except when specifically referenced in the special removal \n     provisions, the remainder of the INA would be inapplicable. \n     For example, under the special removal provisions an alien \n     who has entered the United States (and thus is not \n     susceptible to exclusion proceedings) need not be given a \n     deportation hearing under section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \n     1252, and will not have available the rights generally \n     afforded aliens in deportation proceedings (e.g., the \n     opportunity for an alien out of status to correct his \n     status).\n       Section 501(c) states that Congress has enacted the title \n     upon finding that alien terrorists represent a unique threat \n     to the security interests of the United States. Consequently, \n     the subsection states Congress' specific intent that the \n     Attorney General be authorized to remove such aliens without \n     resort to a traditional deportation hearing, following an ex \n     parte judicial determination of probable cause to believe \n     they have engaged in terrorist activity and a further \n     judicial determination, following a modified adversarial \n     hearing, that the Department of Justice has established by \n     clear and convincing evidence that the aliens in fact have \n     engaged in terrorist activity.\n       Section 501(c) is designed to make clear that singling out \n     alien terrorists for a special type of hearing rather than \n     according them ordinary deportation hearings is a careful and \n     deliberate policy choice by a political branch of government. \n     This policy choice is grounded upon the legislative \n     determination that alien terrorists seriously threaten the \n     security interests of the United States and that the existing \n     process for adjudicating and effecting alien removal is \n     inadequate to meet this threat. In accordance with settled \n     Supreme Court precedent, such a choice is well within the \n     authority of the political branches of government to control \n     our relationship with and response to aliens.\n       For example, in Mathews v. Diaz, supra, the Court held that \n     Congress could constitutionally provide that only some aliens \n     were entitled to Medicare benefits. The Court held that it \n     was ``unquestionably reasonable for Congress to make an \n     alien's eligibility depend on both the character and duration \n     of his residence,'' and noted that the Court was ``especially \n     reluctant to question the exercise of congressional \n     judgment'' in matters of alien regulation. 426 U.S. at 83, \n     84; see Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (describing \n     the regulation of aliens as a political matter ``largely \n     immune from judicial control''). The specific findings and \n     reference to the intent in adopting the new provisions of \n     title V make clear the policy judgment that alien terrorists \n     should be treated as a separate class of aliens and that this \n     choice should not be disturbed by the courts.\n       Section 502 (Special Removal Hearing).\n       Section 502 sets out the procedure for the special removal \n     hearing. Section 502(a) provides that whenever the Department \n     of Justice determines to use the special removal process it \n     must submit a written application to the special court \n     (established pursuant to section 503) for an order \n     authorizing such procedure. Each application must indicate \n     that the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General has \n     approved its submission and must include the identity of the \n     Department attorney making the application, the identity of \n     the alien against whom removal proceedings are sought, and a \n     statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the \n     Department of Justice as justifying the belief that the \n     subject is an alien terrorist and that following normal \n     deportation procedures would pose a risk to the national \n     security of the United States.\n       Section 502(b) provides that applications for special \n     removal proceedings shall be filed under seal with the \n     special court established pursuant to section 503. At or \n     after the time the application is filed, the Attorney General \n     may take the subject alien into custody. The Attorney \n     General's authority to retain the alien in custody is \n     governed by the provisions of new title V which, as explained \n     below, provide in certain circumstances for the release of \n     the alien.\n       Although title V does not require the Attorney General to \n     take the alien subject to a special removal applications into \n     custody, it is expected that most such aliens will be \n     apprehended and confined. The Attorney General's decision \n     whether to take a non-resident alien into custody will not be \n     subject to judicial review. However, a resident alien is \n     entitled to a release hearing before the judge assigned by \n     the special court. The resident alien may be released upon \n     such terms and conditions prescribed by the court (including \n     the posting of any monetary amount), if the alien \n     demonstrates to the court that the alien, if released, is not \n     likely to flee and that the alien's release will not endanger \n     national security or the safety of any person or the \n     community. Subsequent provisions (section 504(a)) authorize \n     the Attorney General to retain custody of alien terrorists \n     who have been ordered removed until such aliens can be \n     physically delivered outside our borders.\n       Section 502(c) provides that special removal applications \n     shall be considered by a single Article III judge in \n     accordance with section 503. In each case, the judge shall \n     hold an ex parte hearing to receive and consider the written \n     information provided with the application and such other \n     evidence, whether documentary or testimonial in form, as the \n     Department of Justice may proffer. The judge shall grant an \n     ex parte order authorizing the special removal hearing as \n     provided under title V if the judge finds that, on the basis \n     of the information and evidence presented, there is probable \n     cause to believe that the subject of the application is an \n     alien who falls within the definition of alien terrorist and \n     that adherence to the ordinary deportation procedures would \n     pose a risk to national security.\n       Section 502(d)(1) provides that in any case in which a \n     special removal application is denied, the Department of \n     Justice within 20 days may appeal the denial to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     In the event of a timely appeal, a confined alien may be \n     retained in custody. When the Department of Justice appeals \n     from the denial of a special removal application, the record \n     of proceedings will be transmitted to the Court of Appeals \n     under seal and the court will hear the appeal ex parte. \n     Subsequent provisions (section 502(p)) authorize the \n     Department of Justice to petition the Supreme Court for a \n     writ of certiorari from an adverse appellate judgment.\n       Section 502(d)(2) provides that if the Department of \n     Justice does not seek appellate review of the denial of a \n     special removal application, the subject alien must be \n     released from custody unless, as a deportable alien, the \n     alien may be arrested and taken into custody pursuant to \n     title II of the INA. Thus, for example, when the judge finds \n     that the special procedures of title V are unwarranted but \n     the alien is subject to deportation as an overstay or for \n     violation of status, the alien might be retained in \n     custody but such detention would be pursuant to and \n     governed by the provisions of title II.\n       Subsection 502(d)(3) provides that if a special removal \n     application is denied because the judge finds no probable \n     cause that the alien has engaged in terrorist activities, the \n     alien must be released from custody during the pendency of an \n     appeal by the government. However, section 502(d)(3) is \n     similar to section 502(d)(2) in that it provides for the \n     possibility of continued detention in the case of aliens who \n     otherwise are subject to deportation under title II of the \n     Act.\n       Section 502(d)(4) applies to cases in which the judge finds \n     probable cause that the subject of a special removal \n     application has been correctly identified as an alien \n     terrorist, but fails to find probable cause that use of the \n     special procedures are necessary for reasons of national \n     security, and the Department of Justice determines to appeal. \n     A finding that the alien has engaged in terrorist activity--a \n     ground for deportation that would support confinement under \n     title II of the Act--justifies retaining the alien in \n     custody. Nevertheless, section 502(d)(4) provides that the \n     judge must determine the question of custody based upon an \n     assessment of the risk of flight and the danger to the \n     community or individuals should the alien be released. The \n     judge shall release the alien subject to the least \n     restrictive condition(s) that will reasonably assure the \n     alien's appearance at future proceedings, should the \n     government prevail on its appeal, and will not endanger the \n     community or individual members thereof. The possible release \n     conditions are those authorized under the Bail Reform Act of \n     1984, 18 U.S.C. 3142 (b) and (c), and range from release on \n     personal recognizance to release on execution of a bail bond \n     or release limited to certain places or periods of time. As \n     with the referenced provisions of the Bail Reform Act, the \n     judge may deny release altogether upon determining that no \n     condition(s) of release would assure the aliens future \n     appearance and community safety. [[Page S6208]] \n       Section 502(e)(1) provides that in cases in which the \n     special removal application is approved, the judge must then \n     consider each piece of classified evidence that the \n     Department of Justice proposes to introduce in camera and ex \n     parte at the special removal hearing. The judge shall \n     authorize the in camera and ex parte introduction of any item \n     of classified evidence if such evidence is relevant to the \n     deportation charge.\n       Section 502(e)(1) also provides that with respect to any \n     evidence authorized to be introduced in camera and ex parte, \n     the judge must consider how the alien subject to the \n     proceedings is to be advised regarding such evidence. The \n     Department of Justice must prepare a summary of the \n     classified information. The court must find the summary to be \n     sufficient to inform the alien of the general nature of the \n     evidence that he has engaged in terrorist activity, and to \n     permit the alien to prepare a defense. A summary, however, \n     ``shall not pose a risk to the national security.'' In \n     considering the summary to be provided to the alien of the \n     government's proffered evidence, it is intended that the \n     judge balance the alien's interest in having an \n     opportunity to hear and respond to the case against him \n     against the government's extraordinarily strong interest \n     in protecting the national security. The Department of \n     Justice shall provide the alien a copy of the court \n     approved summary.\n       In situations where the court does not approve the proposed \n     summary, the Department of Justice can amend the summary to \n     meet specific concerns raised by the court. Subsection (e)(2) \n     provides that if such submission is still found unacceptable, \n     the special removal proceeding is to be terminated unless the \n     court finds that the continued presence of the alien in the \n     United States or the preparation of an adequate summary would \n     likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national \n     security or death or serious bodily injury to any person. If \n     such a situation exists, the special removal hearing would \n     continue, the alien would be notified that no summary is \n     possible, and relevant classified information could be \n     introduced against the alien pursuant to subsection (j).\n       Section 502(e)(3) provides that, in certain situations, the \n     Department of Justice may take an interlocutory appeal to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit from the judge's rulings regarding the in camera and \n     ex parte admission and summarization of particular items of \n     evidence. Interlocutory appeal is authorized if the judge \n     rules that a piece of classified information may not be \n     introduced in camera and ex parte because it is not relevant; \n     or if the Department disagrees with the judge regarding the \n     wording of a summary (that is, if the Department believes \n     that the scope of summary required by the court will \n     compromise national security). Interlocutory appeal is also \n     authorized when the court refuses to make the finding \n     permitted by subsection (e)(2). Because the alien is to \n     remain in custody during such an appeal, the Court of Appeals \n     must hear the matter as expeditiously as possible. When the \n     Department appeals, the entire record must be transmitted to \n     the Court of Appeals under seal and the court shall hear the \n     matter ex parte.\n       Section 502(f) provides that in any case in which the \n     Department's application is approved, the court shall order a \n     special removal hearing for the purpose of determining \n     whether the alien in question has engaged in terrorist \n     activity. Subsection (f) provides that ``[i]n accordance with \n     subsection (e), the alien shall be given reasonable notice of \n     the nature of the charges against him and a general account \n     of the basis for the charges.'' This cross-reference is \n     intended to make clear that subsection (f) is not to be \n     construed as requiring that information be given to the alien \n     about the nature of the charges if such information \n     would reveal the matters that are to be introduced in \n     camera. The special removal hearing must be held as \n     expeditiously as possible.\n       Section 502(g) provides that the special removal hearing \n     shall be held before the same judge who approved the \n     Department of Justice's application unless the judge becomes \n     unavailable due to illness or disability.\n       Section 502(h) sets out the rights to be afforded to the \n     alien at the special removal hearing. The hearing shall be \n     open to the public, the alien shall have the right to be \n     represented by counsel (at government expense if he cannot \n     afford representation), and to introduce evidence in his own \n     behalf. Except as provided in section 502(j) regarding \n     presentation of evidence in camera and ex parte, the alien \n     also shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the \n     evidence against him and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. \n     As in the case of administrative proceedings under the INA \n     and civil proceedings generally, the alien may be called as a \n     witness by the Department of Justice. A verbatim record of \n     the proceedings and of all evidence and testimony shall be \n     kept.\n       Section 502(i) provides that either the alien or the \n     government may request the issuance of a subpoena for \n     witnesses and documents. A subpoena request may be made ex \n     parte, except that the judge must inform the Department of \n     Justice where the subpoena sought by the alien threatens \n     disclosure of evidence or the source of evidence which the \n     Department of Justice has introduced or proffered for \n     introduction in camera and ex parte. In such cases, the \n     Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to oppose the issuance of a subpoena and, if necessary to \n     protect the confidentiality of the evidence or its source, \n     the judge may, in his discretion, hear such opposition in \n     camera. A subpoena under section 502(i) may be served \n     anywhere in the United States. Where the alien shows an \n     inability to pay for the appearance of a necessary witness, \n     the court may order the costs of the subpoena and witness fee \n     to be paid by the government from funds appropriated for the \n     enforcement of title II of the INA. Section 502(i) states \n     that it is not intended to allow the alien access to \n     classified information.\n       Section 502(j) provides that any evidence which has been \n     summarized pursuant to section 502(e)(1) may be introduced \n     into the record, in documentary or testimonial form, in \n     camera and ex parte. The section also permits the \n     introduction of relevant classified information if the court \n     has made the finding permitted by subsection (e)(2). While \n     the alien and members of the public would be aware that \n     evidence was being submitted in camera and ex parte, neither \n     the alien nor the public would be informed of the nature of \n     the evidence except as set out in section 502(e)(1). For \n     example, if the Department of Justice sought to present in \n     camera and ex parte evidence through live testimony, the \n     courtroom could be cleared of the alien, his counsel, and the \n     public while the testimony is presented. Alternatively, the \n     court might hear the testimony in chambers attended by \n     only the reporter, the government's counsel, and the \n     witness. In the case of documentary evidence, sealed \n     documents could be presented to the court without \n     examination by the alien or his counsel (or access by the \n     public).\n       While the Department of Justice does not have to present \n     evidence in camera and ex parte, even if it previously has \n     received authorization to do so, it is contemplated that \n     ordinarily much of the government's evidence (or at least the \n     crucial portions thereof) will be presented in this fashion \n     rather than in open court. The right to present evidence in \n     camera and ex parte will have been determined in the ex parte \n     proceedings before the court pursuant to subsections (a) \n     through (c) of section 502.\n       Section 502(k) provides that evidence introduced in open \n     session or in camera and ex parte may include all or part of \n     the information that was presented at the earlier ex parte \n     proceedings. If the evidence is to be introduced in camera \n     and ex parte, the attorney for the Department of Justice \n     could refer the judge to such evidence in the transcript of \n     the ex parte hearing and ask that it be considered as \n     evidence at the removal hearing itself. The Department might \n     present evidence in open court rather than in camera and ex \n     parte as a result of changed circumstances, for example, \n     where the source whose life was at risk had died before the \n     hearing or if the Department believes that a public \n     presentation of the evidence might have a deterrent effect on \n     other terrorists. In any event, once the Department of \n     Justice has received authorization to present evidence in \n     camera and ex parte, its decision whether to do so is purely \n     discretionary and is not subject to review at the time of the \n     special removal hearing. Of course, the disclosure of any \n     classified information requires appropriate consultation with \n     the originating agency.\n       Section 502(l) provides that following the introduction of \n     evidence, the attorney for the Department of Justice and the \n     attorney for the alien shall be given fair opportunity to \n     present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to \n     justify the alien's removal. At the judge's discretion, in \n     camera and ex parte argument by the Department of Justice \n     attorney may be heard regarding evidence received in camera \n     and ex parte.\n       Section 502(m) provides that the Department of Justice has \n     the burden of showing that the evidence is sufficient. This \n     burden is not satisfied unless the Department establishes by \n     clear and convincing evidence--the standard of proof \n     applicable in a deportation hearing--that the alien has \n     engaged in terrorist activity. If the judge finds that the \n     Department has met that burden, the judge must order the \n     alien removed. In cases in which the alien has been shown to \n     have engaged in terrorist activity, the judge has no \n     authority to decide that removal would be unwarranted. If the \n     alien was a resident alien granted release, the court is \n     to order the Attorney General to take the alien into \n     custody.\n       Section 502(n)(1) provides that the judge must render his \n     decision as to the alien's removal in the form of a written \n     order. The order must state the facts found and the \n     conclusions of law reached, but shall not reveal the \n     substance of any evidence received in camera or ex parte.\n       Section 502(n)(2) provides that either the alien or the \n     Department of Justice may appeal the judge's decision to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     Circuit. Any such appeal must be filed within 20 days, and \n     during this period the order shall not be executed. \n     Information received in camera and ex parte at the special \n     removal hearing shall be transmitted to the Court of Appeals \n     under seal. The Court of Appeals must hear the appeal as \n     expeditiously as possible.\n       Section 502(n)(3) sets out the standard of review for \n     proceedings in the Court of Appeals. Questions of law are to \n     be reviewed de novo, but findings of fact may not be \n     overturned unless clearly erroneous. This is the usual \n     standard in civil cases.\n       Section 502(o) provides that in cases in which the judge \n     decides that the alien should not be removed, the alien must \n     be released [[Page S6209]] from custody. There is an \n     exception for aliens who may be arrested and taken into \n     custody pursuant to title II of the INA as aliens subject to \n     deportation. For such aliens, the issues of release and/or \n     circumstances of continued detention would be governed by the \n     pertinent provisions of the INA.\n       Section 502(p) provides that following a decision by the \n     Court of Appeals, either the alien or the government may seek \n     a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. In such cases, \n     information submitted to the Court of Appeals under seal \n     shall, if transmitted to the Supreme Court, remain under \n     seal.\n       Section 502(q) sets forth the normal right the Government \n     has to dismiss a removal action at any stage of the \n     proceeding.\n       Section 502(r) acknowledges that the United States retains \n     its common law privileges.\n       Section 503 (Designation of Judges)\n       Section 503 establishes the special court to consider \n     terrorist removal cases under section 502, patterned on the \n     special court created under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Section 503(a) \n     provides that the court will consist of five federal district \n     judges chosen by the Chief Justice of the United States from \n     five different judicial circuits. One of these judges shall \n     be designated as the chief or presiding judge. Should the \n     Chief Justice determine it appropriate, he could designate \n     as judges under this section some of those that he has \n     designated pursuant to section 1803(a) of title 50, United \n     States Code for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court. The presiding judge shall promulgate rules for the \n     functioning of the special court. The presiding judge also \n     shall be responsible for assigning cases to the various \n     judges. Section 503(c) provides that judges shall be \n     appointed to the special court for terms of five years, \n     except for the initial appointments the terms of which \n     shall vary from one to five years so that one new judge \n     will be appointed each year. Judges may be reappointed to \n     the special court.\n       Section 503(b) provides that all proceedings under section \n     502 are to be held as expeditiously as possible. Section \n     503(b) also provides that the Chief Justice, in consultation \n     with the Attorney General, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence and other appropriate officials, shall provide \n     for the maintenance of appropriate security measures to \n     protect the ex parte special removal applications, the orders \n     entered in response to such applications, and the evidence \n     received in camera and ex parte sufficient to prevent \n     disclosures which could compromise national security.\n       Section 504 (Miscellaneous Provisions)\n       Section 504 contains the title's miscellaneous provisions. \n     Section 504(a) provides that following a final determination \n     that the alien terrorist should be removed (that is, after \n     the special removal hearing and completion of any appellate \n     review), the Attorney General may retain the alien in custody \n     (or if the alien was released, apprehend and place the alien \n     in custody) until he can be removed from the United States. \n     The alien is provided the right to choose the country to \n     which he will be removed, subject to the Attorney General's \n     authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to \n     designate another country if the alien's choice would impair \n     a United States treaty obligation (such as an obligation \n     under an extradition treaty) or would adversely affect the \n     foreign policy of the United States. If the alien does not \n     choose a country or if he choose a country deemed \n     unacceptable, the Attorney General, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of State, must make efforts to find a country that \n     will take the alien. The alien may, at the Attorney General's \n     discretion, be kept in custody until an appropriate country \n     can be found, and the Attorney General shall provide the \n     alien with a written report regarding such efforts at least \n     once every six months. The Attorney General's determinations \n     and actions regarding execution of the removal order are not \n     subject to direct or collateral judicial review, except for a \n     claim that continued detention violates the alien's \n     constitutional rights. The alien terrorist shall be \n     photographed and fingerprinted and advised of the special \n     penalty provisions for unlawful return before he is \n     removed from the United States.\n       Section 504(b) provides that, notwithstanding section \n     504(a), the Attorney General may defer the actual removal of \n     the alien terrorist to allow the alien to face trial on any \n     State or federal criminal charge (whether or not related to \n     his terrorist activity) and, if convicted, to serve a \n     sentence of confinement. Section 504(b)(2) provides that \n     pending the service of a State or federal sentence of \n     confinement, the alien terrorist is to remain in the Attorney \n     General's custody unless the Attorney General determines that \n     the alien can be released to the custody of State authorities \n     for pretrial confinement in a State facility without \n     endangering national security or public safety. It is \n     intended that where the alien terrorist could possibly secure \n     pretrial release, the Attorney General shall not release the \n     alien to a State for pretrial confinement. Section 503(b)(3) \n     provides that if an alien terrorist released to State \n     authorities is subsequently to be released from state custody \n     because of an acquittal in the collateral trial, completion \n     of the alien's sentence of confinement, or otherwise, the \n     alien shall immediately be returned to the custody of the \n     Attorney General who shall then proceed to effect the alien's \n     removal from the United States.\n       Section 504(c) provides that for purposes of sections 751 \n     and 752 of title 18 (punishing escape from confinement and \n     aiding such an escape), an alien in the Attorney General's \n     custody pursuant to this new title--whether awaiting or after \n     completion of a special removal hearing--shall be treated as \n     if in custody by virture of a felony arrest. Accordingly, \n     escape by a or aiding the escape of an alien terrorist will \n     be punishable by imprisonment for up to five years.\n       Section 504(d) provides that an alien in the Attorney \n     General's custody pursuant to this new title--whether \n     awaiting or after completion of a special removal hearing--\n     shall be given reasonable opportunity to receive visits from \n     relatives and friends and to consult with his attorney. \n     Determination of what is ``reasonable'' usually will follow \n     the ordinary rules of the facility in which the alien is \n     confined.\n       Section 504(d) also provides that when an alien is confined \n     pursuant to this new title, he shall have the right to \n     contact appropriate dipomatic or consular officers of his \n     country of citizenship or nationality. Moreover, even if the \n     alien makes no such request, subsection (d) directs the \n     Attorney General to notify the appropriate embassy of the \n     alien's detention.\n       Subsection 201(c) sets out three conforming amendments to \n     the INA. First, section 106 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1105a, \n     is amended to provide that appeals from orders entered \n     pursuant to section 235(c) of the Act (pertaining to summary \n     exclusion proceedings for alien spies, saboteurs, and \n     terrorists) shall be to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thus, in cases \n     involving alien terrorists, the same court of appeals \n     shall hear both exclusion and deportation appeals and will \n     develop unique expertise concerning such cases.\n       Second, section 276 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, is \n     amended to add increased penalties for an alien entering or \n     attempting to enter the United States without permission \n     after removal under the new title or exclusion under section \n     235(c) for terrorist activity. For aliens unlawfully re-\n     entering or attempting to reenter the United States, the \n     section presently provides for a fine pursuant to title 18 \n     and/or imprisonment for up to two years (five years when the \n     alien has been convicted of a felony in the United States, or \n     15 years when convicted of an ``aggravated felony''); the \n     bill increases to a mandatory ten years the term of \n     imprisonment for re-entering alien terrorists.\n       Finally, section 106 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1105a, is \n     amended to strike subsection (a)(1) regarding habeas corpus \n     review of deportation orders. Originally enacted in 1961 to \n     make clear that the exclusive provision for review of final \n     deportation orders through petition to the courts of appeals \n     was not intended to extinguish traditional writs of habeas \n     corpus in cases of wrongful detention, the subsection has \n     been the source of confusion and duplicative litigation in \n     the courts. Congress never intended that habeas corpus \n     proceedings be an alternative to the process of petitioning \n     the courts of appeals for review of deportation orders. \n     Elimination of subsection (a)(10) will make clear that any \n     review of the merits of a deportation order or the denial of \n     relief from deportation is available only through petition \n     for review in the courts of appeals, while leaving unchanged \n     the traditional writ of habeas corpus to examine challenges \n     to detention arising from asserted errors of constitutional \n     proportions.\n       Subsection 201(d) provides that the new provisions are \n     effective upon enactment and ``apply to all aliens without \n     regard to the date of entry or attempted entry into the \n     United States.'' Aliens may not avoid the special removal \n     process on the grounds that either their involvement in \n     terrorist activity or their entry into the United States \n     occurred before enactment of the new title. Upon enactment, \n     the new title will be available to the Attorney General for \n     removal of any and all alien terrorists when classified \n     information is involved.\n       Section 202.\n       This section makes additional changes to the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Act (INA) besides those contained in \n     section 201. It improves the government's ability to deny \n     visas to alien terrorist leaders and to deport non-resident \n     alien terrorists under the INA.\n       Subsection 202(a) amends the excludability provisions of \n     the INA relating to terrorism activities (section \n     212(a)(3)(B) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)). Most of the \n     changes are clarifying in nature, but a few are substantive. \n     The changes are:\n       (1) ``Terrorist'' is changed to ``terrorism'' in most \n     instances in order to direct focus on the nature of the \n     activity itself and not the character of the particular \n     individual perpetrator.\n       (2) Definitions of ``terrorist organization'' and \n     ``terrorism'' are added. The definition of ``terrorist \n     organization'' includes subgroups. Although a terrorist \n     organization may perform certain charitable activities, e.g., \n     run a hospital, this does not remove its characterization or \n     being a terrorist organization if it, or any of its \n     subgroups, engages in terrorist organization if it, or any of \n     its subgroups, engages in terrorism activity. The definition \n     of ``terrorism'' describes terrorism as the ``premeditated \n     politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombat \n     targets.'' This is consistent with existing law found \n     elsewhere in the federal code. See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. 2656f(d).\n       (3) In order to make ``representatives'' of certain \n     specified terrorist organizations excludable, the term has \n     been expanded to [[Page S6210]] cover any person who directs, \n     counsels, commands or induces the organization or its members \n     to engage in terrorism activity. The terms ``counsels, \n     commands, or induces'' are used in 18 U.S.C. 2. Presently, \n     only the officers, officials, representatives and spokesman \n     are deemed to be excludable. This change expands coverage to \n     encompass those leaders of the group who may not hold formal \n     titles and those who are closely associated with the group \n     and exert leadership over the group but may not technically \n     be a member. This is not a mere membership provision.\n       (4) In order to make the ``leaders'' of more terrorist \n     organizations excludable without having to establish that \n     they personally have engaged in terrorist activity, the \n     revision gives the President authority to designate terrorist \n     organizations based on a finding that they are detrimental to \n     the interests of the United States. (Presently, only the PLO \n     is expressly cited in the existing statute.) Implicit with \n     the right to designate is the authority to remove an \n     organization that the President has previously designated. By \n     giving the President this authority, which is similar to \n     subsection (f) of section 212 (8 U.S.C. 212(f)), the \n     President can impose stricter travel limitations on the \n     leaders of terrorist organizations who desire to visit the \n     United States. For a leader of a designated terrorist \n     organization to obtain a visa, he would have to solicit a \n     waiver from the Attorney General under subsection \n     212(d)(3) (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)) to obtain temporary \n     admission. In deciding whether or not to grant the waiver, \n     the Attorney General could, should he/she decide to grant \n     a waiver, impose whatever restrictions are warranted on \n     the alien's presence in the United States.\n       (5) The words ``it had been'' are inserted in the first \n     sentence of the definition of ``terrorism activity'' in order \n     to make clear that it is United States law (federal or state) \n     which is used to determine whether overseas violent activity \n     is considered criminal.\n       (6) The term ``weapon'' is added to clause (V)(b) in the \n     definition of ``terrorist activity'' in order to cover those \n     murders carried out by deadly and dangerous devices other \n     than firearms or explosives (e.g., a knife).\n       (7) The knowledge requirement in clause (III) of the \n     definition of ``engage in terrorism activity'' was deleted as \n     unnecessary, as similar language has been added in the \n     beginning of the definition.\n       (8) The term ``documentation or'' has been add to ``false \n     identification'' in clause (III) of the definition of \n     ``engage in terrorism activity'' to encompass other forms of \n     false documentation that might be provided to facilitate \n     terrorism activity. The term ``false identification'' would \n     include stolen, counterfeit, forged and falsely made \n     identification documents.\n       Subsection 202(b) amends section 241(a)(4)(B) of the INA (8 \n     U.S.C. 1251(a)(4)(B)) to reflect the change in section \n     212(a)(3)(B) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)) from ``terrorist'' to \n     ``terrorism.''\n       Subsection 202(c) adds a sentence to section 291 of the INA \n     (8 U.S.C. 1361) to clarify that discovery by the alien in a \n     deportation proceeding is limited only to those documents in \n     the INS file relating to the alien's entry. Section 291 was \n     never intended to authorized discovery beyond this limited \n     category of documents.\n       Subsection 202(d) makes an important change to section \n     242(b)(3) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(3)). First, in the \n     case of non-resident aliens it precludes the alien's access \n     to any classified information that is being used to deport \n     them. Secondly, it denies non-resident aliens any rights \n     under 18 U.S.C. 3504 (relating to access concerning sources \n     of evidence) and 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. (relating to the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) during their \n     deportation.\n       Section 203.\n       Section 203 amends the confidentiality provisions contained \n     in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) for an alien's \n     application relating to legalization (section 245A(c)(5) of \n     the INA (8 U.S.C. 1255(a)(c)(5)) or special agricultural \n     worker status (section 210(b) (5) and (6) of the INA (8 \n     U.S.C. 1160(b) (5) and (6)). At present, it is very difficult \n     to obtain crucial information contained in these files, such \n     as fingerprints, photographs, addresses, etc., when the alien \n     becomes a subject of a criminal investigation. In both the \n     World Trade Center bombing and the killing of CIA personnel \n     on their way to work at CIA Headquarters, the existing \n     confidentiality provisions hindered law enforcement efforts.\n       Subsection 203(a) amends the confidential provisions for \n     legalization files. It permits access to the file if a \n     federal court finds that the file relates to an alien who has \n     been killed or severely incapacitated or is the suspect of an \n     aggravated felony. Subsection 203(b) makes comparable \n     amendments to the confidentiality requirements relating to \n     special agricultural worker status.\n       Section 301.\n       Section 301 authorizes the government to regulate of \n     prohibit any person or organization within the United States \n     and any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States anywhere from raising or providing funds for use by \n     any foreign organization which the President has designated \n     to be engaged in terrorism activities. Such designation would \n     be based on a Presidential finding that the organization (1) \n     engages in terrorism activity as defined in the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act and (2) its terrorism activities threaten \n     the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n     United States.\n       The fund-raising provision provides a licensing mechanism \n     under which funds may be provided to a designated \n     organization based on a showing that the money will be used \n     exclusively for religious, charitable, literary, or \n     educational purposes. It includes both administrative and \n     judicial enforcement procedures, as well as a special \n     classified information procedures applicable to certain types \n     of civil litigation. The term ``person'' is defined to \n     include individuals, partnerships, associations, groups, \n     corporations or other organizations.\n       Subsection 301(a) creates a new section 2339B in title 18, \n     United States Code, entitled ``Fund-raising for terrorist \n     organizations.''\n       Subsection 2339B(a) sets forth the congressional findings \n     and purposes for the fund-raising statute.\n       Subsection 2339B(b) gives the President the authority to \n     issue regulations to regulate or prohibit any person within \n     the United States or any person subject to the jurisdiction \n     of the United States anywhere from raising or providing funds \n     for use by, or from engaging in financial transactions with, \n     any foreign organization which the President, pursuant to \n     subsection 2339B(c), has designated to be engaged in \n     terrorism activities.\n       Subsection 2339B(c)(1) grants the President the authority \n     to designate any foreign organization, if he finds that (1) \n     the organization engages in terrorism activity (as defined in \n     section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)) and (2) the organization's terrorism \n     activities threaten the national security, foreign policy or \n     economy of the United States. Subsection 2339B(c)(2) grants \n     the President the authority to designate persons who are \n     raising funds for or are acting for or on behalf of a foreign \n     organization designated pursuant to subsection (c)(1).\n       Such designations must be published in the Federal \n     Register. The President is authorized to revoke any \n     designation. A designation under subsection (c)(1) is \n     conclusive and is not reviewable by a court in a criminal \n     prosecution.\n       Subsection 2339B(d) sets forth the prohibited activities. \n     Paragraph (1) makes it unlawful for any person within the \n     United States, or any person subject to the jurisdiction of \n     the United States anywhere in the world, to raise, receive, \n     or collect funds on behalf of or to furnish, give, transmit, \n     transfer, or provide funds to or for a organization \n     designated by the President unless such activity is done in \n     accordance with a license granted under subsection 2339B(e). \n     Paragraph (2) makes it unlawful for any person within the \n     United States or any person subject to the jurisdiction of \n     the United States anywhere in the world, acting for or on \n     behalf of a designated organization, (1) to transmit, \n     transfer, or receive any funds raised in violation of \n     subsection 2339B(d)(1); (2) to transmit, transfer or dispose \n     of any funds in which any designated organization has an \n     interest; or (3) to attempt to do any of the foregoing. The \n     latter provision serves to make it a crime for any person \n     within the United States, or any person subject to the \n     jurisdiction of the United States anywhere, to transmit, \n     transfer or dispose of on behalf of a designated organization \n     any funds in which such organization has an interest until \n     after a license has been issued.\n       Subsection 2339B(e) requires that any person who desires to \n     solicit funds or transfer funds to any designated \n     organization must obtain a license from the Secretary of the \n     Treasury. Any license issued by the Secretary shall be \n     granted only when the Secretary is satisfied that the funds \n     are intended exclusively for religious, charitable, \n     literacy, or educational purposes and that any recipient \n     in any fund-raising chain has effective procedures in \n     place to insure that the funds will be used exclusively \n     for religious, charitable, literacy, or educational \n     purposes and will not be used to affect a transfer of \n     funds to be used in terrorism activity. The burden is on \n     the license applicant to convince the Secetary that such \n     procedures do in fact exist. A licensee is required to \n     keep books and records and make such books available for \n     inspection upon the Secretary's request. A licensee is \n     also required to have an agreement with any recipient \n     which permits the Secretary to inspect the recipient's \n     records.\n       Subsection 2339B(f) requires that a financial institution \n     which becomes aware that it is in possession of or that it \n     has control over funds in which a designated organization has \n     an interest must ``freeze'' such funds and notify the \n     Secretary of the Treasury. A civil penalty is provided for \n     failure to freeze such funds or report the required \n     information to the Secretary. The term ``financial \n     institution'' has the meaning prescribed in 31 U.S.C. \n     5312(a)(2) and regulations promulgated thereunder. It is the \n     same definition as utilized in the money laundering statute, \n     see 18 U.S.C. 1956(c)(6).\n       Subsection 2339B(g) divides investigative responsibility \n     for the section between the Secretary of the Treasury and the \n     Attorney General. This provision thus permits the combination \n     of the administrative and financial expertise of Treasury's \n     Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the intelligence \n     capabilities and criminal investigative techniques of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be combined together \n     in a highly coordinated manner in order to effectively \n     enforce the requirements of this section while protecting the \n     equities of the nation's national security intelligence \n     gathering community. The provision reflects, as does \n     [[Page S6211]] section 407 of the bill, the FBI's role as the \n     lead federal agency for the investigation and prosecution of \n     terrorist activity as well as the prime federal intelligence \n     agency for gathering national security information within the \n     United States.\n       Section 2339B(h) gives authority to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and the Attorney General to require recordkeeping, \n     hold hearings, issue subpoenas, administer oaths and receive \n     evidence.\n       Subsection 2339B(i) sets forth the penalties for section \n     2339B. Any person who knowingly violates subsection 2339B(d) \n     can be fined under title 18, United States Code, or \n     imprisoned for up to ten years, or both. A person who fails \n     to keep records or make records available to the Secretary of \n     the Treasury upon his/her request is subject to a civil \n     penalty of the greater of $50,000 or twice the amount of \n     money which would have been documented had the books and \n     records been properly maintained. A financial institution \n     which fails to take the actions required pursuant \n     to subsection (f)(1) is subject to civil penalty of the \n     greater of $50,000 or twice the amount of money of which \n     the financial institution was required to retain \n     possession or control. Any person who violates any \n     license, order, direction, or regulation issued pursuant \n     to the section is subject to a civil penalty of the \n     greater of $50,000 per violation or twice the value of the \n     violation. A person who intentionally fails to maintain or \n     make available the required books or records also commits \n     a crime subject to a fine under title 18, United States \n     Code, or imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Any \n     organization convicted of an offense under subsections \n     2339B(i)(1) or (3) shall forfeit any charitable \n     designation it might have received under the Internal \n     Revenue Code.\n       Subsection 2339B(j)(1) gives the Attorney General the right \n     to seek an injunction to block any violation of section \n     2339B. An injunctive proceeding is normally governed by the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but if the respondent is \n     under indictment, discovery is to be governed by the Federal \n     Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n       Subsection 2339B(k) states that there is extraterritorial \n     jurisdiction over activity prohibited by section 2339B which \n     is conducted outside the United States. This insures that \n     foreign persons outside the United States are covered by this \n     statute if they aid, assist, counsel, command, induce or \n     procure, or conspire with, persons within the United States \n     or persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States \n     anywhere in the world to violate the fund-raising prohibition \n     (18 U.S.C. 2339B, 2, and 371).\n       Subsection 2339B(l) sets forth a special process to protect \n     classified information when the government is the plaintiff \n     in civil proceedings to enforce section 2339B.\n       Subsection 2339B(m) sets forth the definition of \n     ``classified information,'' ``financial institution,'' \n     ``funds,'' ``national security,'' ``person,'' and ``United \n     States.'' Funds are defined to include all currency, coin, \n     and any negotiable or registered security that can be used as \n     a method of transferring money.\n       Subsection 301(c) further amends section 212(a)(3)(B)(i) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1182(a)(3)(B)(i)) to include leaders of any terrorist \n     organization designated under the fund-raising statute (18 \n     U.S.C. 2339B) as an aliens deemed to be excludable under the \n     immigration laws.\n       Subsection 301(d) makes the special classified information \n     provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2339B(k) applicable to similar civil \n     proceedings under the International Emergency Economic Powers \n     Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).\n       Section 401.\n       This section states that title IV may be cited as the \n     ``Marking of Plastic Explosives for Detection Act.''\n       Section 402.\n       This section sets forth the congressional findings \n     concerning the criminal use of plastic explosives and the \n     prevention of such use through the marking of plastic \n     explosives for the purpose of detection. This section also \n     states that the purpose of the legislation is to implement \n     the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the \n     Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on 1 March 1991 (the \n     Convention).\n       Section 403.\n       This section sets forth three new definitions for 18 U.S.C. \n     841. It amends 18 U.S.C. 841 by adding a new subsection (o) \n     which defines the term ``Convention on the Marking of Plastic \n     Explosives.'' The definition provides the full title of the \n     Convention, ``Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives \n     for the Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on 1 March \n     1991.'' The definition eliminates the need to repeat the full \n     title of the Convention each time it is used in the bill.\n       Section 403 also amends section 841 by adding a new \n     subsection (p) which defines the term ``detection agent.'' \n     The term has been defined to include four specified chemical \n     substances and any other substance specified by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury by regulation. The four specified chemical \n     substances, ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), 2,3-dimethyl-2-\n     3-dinitrobutane (DMNB), paramononitrotoluene (p-\n     MNT), and ortho-mononitrotoluene (o-MNT), are in Part 2 of \n     the Technical Annex to the Convention. The required minimum \n     concentration of the four substances in the finished plastic \n     explosives was also taken from the Technical Annex. The \n     definition of ``detection agent'' has been drafted to require \n     that the particular substance be introduced into a plastic \n     explosive in such a manner as to achieve homogeneous \n     distribution in the finished explosive. The purpose of \n     homogeneous distribution is to assure that the detection \n     agent can be detected by vapor detection equipment.\n       New section 841(p)(5) would permit the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to add other substances to the list of approved \n     detection agents by regulation, in consultation with the \n     Secretaries of State and Defense. Permitting the Secretary to \n     designate detection agents other than the four listed in the \n     statute would facilitate the use of other substances without \n     the need for legislation. Only those substances which have \n     been added to the table in Part 2 of the Technical Annex, \n     pursuant to Articles VI and VII of the Convention, may be \n     designated as approved detection agents under section \n     841(p)(5). Since the Department of Defense (DOD) is the \n     largest domestic consumer of plastic explosives (over 95 \n     percent of domestic production), it is appropriate that \n     DOD provide guidance to the Treasury Department in \n     approving substances as detection agents.\n       Finally, section 403 adds a new subsection (q) to section \n     841 which defines the term ``plastic explosive.'' The \n     definition is based on the definition of ``explosives'' in \n     Article I of the Convention and Part I of the Technical \n     Annex.\n       Section 404.\n       This section adds subsections (l)-(o) to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 842 \n     proscribing certain conduct relating to unmarked plastic \n     explosives.\n       Section 842(l) would make it unlawful for any person to \n     manufacture within the United States any plastic explosive \n     which does not contain a detection agent.\n       Section 842(m) would make it unlawful for any person to \n     import into the United States or export from the United \n     States any plastic explosive which does not contain a \n     detection agent. However, importations and exportations of \n     plastic explosives imported into or manufactured in the \n     United States prior to the effective date of the Act by \n     Federal law enforcement agencies or the National Guard of any \n     State, or by any person acting on behalf of such entities, \n     would be exempted from this prohibition for a period of 15 \n     years after the Convention is entered into force with respect \n     to the United States. This provision implements Article IV, \n     paragraph 3, of the Convention. Section 842(m) is drafted to \n     specifically include the National Guard of any State and \n     military reserve units within the 15-year exemption.\n       The purpose of the 15-year exemption is to give the \n     military and Federal law enforcement agencies a period of 15 \n     years to use up the considerable stock of unmarked plastic \n     explosives they now have on hand. This exception would also \n     permit DOD to export its unmarked plastic explosives to \n     United States forces in other countries during the 15-year \n     period.\n       Section 842(n)(1) would make it unlawful for any person to \n     ship, transport, transfer, receive, or possess any plastic \n     explosive which does not contain a detection agent. Section \n     842(n)(2)(A) would provide an exception to the prohibition of \n     section 842(n)(1) for any plastic explosive which was \n     imported, brought into, or manufactured in the United States \n     prior to the effective date of the Act by any person during a \n     period not exceeding three years after the effective date of \n     the Act. This provision implements Article IV, paragraph \n     2, of the Convention, and provides an exemption from the \n     prohibitions of section 842(n)(1) for any person, \n     including State and local governmental entities and other \n     Federal agencies, for a period of three years after the \n     effective date of the Act.\n       Section 842(n)(2)(B) would provide an exception to the \n     prohibition of section 842(n)(1) for any plastic explosive \n     which was imported, brought into, or manufactured in the \n     United States prior to the effective date of the Act by any \n     Federal law enforcement agency or the United States military \n     or by any person acting on behalf of such entities for a \n     period of 15 years after the date of entry into force of the \n     Convention with respect to the United States. This provision \n     implements Article IV, paragraph 3, of the Convention. The \n     provision was drafted to specifically include the National \n     Guard of any State and military reserve units within the 15-\n     year exemption.\n       Section 842(o) would make it unlawful for any person, other \n     than a Federal agency possessing any plastic explosive on the \n     effective date of the Act, to fail to report to the Secretary \n     of the Treasury within 120 days from the effective date of \n     the Act the quantity of plastic explosive possessed, the \n     manufacturer or importer of the explosive, any identifying \n     markings on the explosive, and any other information as \n     required by regulation. This provision implements Article IV, \n     paragraph 1, of the Convention, which requires each State \n     Party to take all necessary measures to exercise control over \n     the possession and transfer of possession of unmarked \n     explosives which have been manufactured in or imported into \n     its territory prior to the entry into force of the Convention \n     with respect to that State. This provision was drafted to \n     specifically include the National Guard of any State and \n     military reserve units as agencies which are exempt from the \n     reporting requirement.\n       Section 405.\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 844(a), which provides \n     penalties for violating certain provisions of 18 U.S.C. 842. \n     The amended section would add sections 842(l)-(o) to the list \n     of offenses punishable by a fine under 18 U.S.C. 3571 of not \n     more than $250,000 in the case of [[Page S6212]] an \n     individual, and $500,000 in the case of an organization, or \n     by imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both.\n       Section 406.\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 845(a)(1), which excepts from \n     the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Chapter 40 any aspect of \n     the transportation of explosive materials regulated by the \n     United States Department of Transportation. The purpose of \n     the amendment is to make it clear that the exception in \n     section 845(a)(1) applies only to those aspects of such \n     transportation relating to safety. This amendment would \n     overcome the effect of the adverse decisions in United \n     States v. Petrykievicz, 809 F. Supp. 794 (W.D. Wash. \n     1992), and United States v. Illingworth, 489 F.2d 264 \n     (10th Cir. 1973). In those cases, the court held that the \n     language of section 845(a)(1) resulted in the defendant's \n     exemption from all the provisions of the chapter, \n     including the requirement of a license or permit to ship, \n     transport, or receive explosives in interstate or foreign \n     commerce.\n       The list of offenses which are not subject to the \n     exceptions of section 845(a) has also been amended to include \n     the new plastic explosives offenses in sections 842(l)-(m).\n       Section 406 also adds a new subsection (c) to 18 U.S.C. 845 \n     to provide certain affirmative defenses to the new plastic \n     explosives offenses in sections 842(l)-(o). This provision \n     implements Part 1, paragraph II, of the Technical Annex to \n     the Convention, which relates to exceptions for limited \n     quantities of explosives. The affirmative defenses of 18 \n     U.S.C. 845(c) could be asserted by defendants in criminal \n     prosecutions, persons having an interest in explosive \n     materials seized and forfeited pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 844(c), \n     and persons challenging the revocation or denial of their \n     explosives licenses or permits pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 845(c).\n       The three affirmative defenses specified in section \n     845(c)(1) all relate to research, training, and testing, and \n     require that the proponent provide evidence that there was a \n     ``small amount'' of plastic explosive intended for and \n     utilized solely in the specified activities. The \n     representatives to the Conference which resulted in the \n     Convention agreed that the amount of unmarked explosive \n     permitted to be used for these purposes should be \n     ``limited,'' but were unable to agree on a specific quantity. \n     The Secretary of the Treasury may issue regulations defining \n     what quantity of plastic explosives is a ``small amount'' or \n     may leave it up to the proponent of the affirmative defense \n     to prove that a ``small amount'' of explosives was imported, \n     manufactured, possessed, etc. The statute is drafted to \n     require that the proponent establish the affirmative defense \n     by a preponderance of the evidence.\n       Section 845(c)(2) would create another affirmative defense \n     to the plastic explosives offenses, which implements Article \n     IV of the Convention, and Part I, Paragraph II(d), of the \n     Technical Annex. This provision would require that proponent \n     to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \n     plastic explosive was, within three years after the date of \n     entry into force of the Convention with respect to the United \n     States, incorporated in a military device that is intended to \n     become or has become the property of any Federal military or \n     law enforcement agency. Furthermore, the proponent must \n     prove that the plastic explosive has remained an integral \n     part of the military device for the exemption to apply. \n     This requirement would discourage the removal of unmarked \n     plastic explosives from bombs, mines, and other military \n     devices manufactured for the United States military during \n     the three-year period. The provision was drafted to \n     specifically include the National Guard of any State and \n     military reserve units within the exemption. The term \n     ``military device'' has been defined in accordance with \n     the definition of that term in Article I of the \n     Convention.\n       Requiring that the exceptions of section 845(c) be \n     established as an affirmative defense would facilitate the \n     prosecution of violations of the new plastic explosives \n     provisions by terrorists and other dangerous criminals in \n     that the Government would not have to bear the difficult, if \n     not impossible, burden of proving that the explosives were \n     not used in one of the research, training, testing, or \n     military device exceptions specified in the statute. The \n     proponent to establish the existence of one of the \n     exceptions.\n       The approach taken in section 845(c) is patterned after the \n     affirmative defense provision in 18 U.S.C. 176 and 177, \n     relating to the use of biological weapons.\n       Section 407.\n       This section provides the Attorney General investigative \n     authority over new subsections (m) and (n) of section 842, \n     relating to the importation, exportation, shipping, \n     transferring, receipt or possession of unmarked plastic \n     explosives, when such provisions are violated by terrorist/\n     revolutionary groups or individuals. This authority is \n     consistent with the existing March 1, 1973, memorandum of \n     understanding on the investigation of explosives violations \n     between the Departments of Justice and the Treasury and the \n     United States Postal Service. The section also makes it clear \n     that, consistent with current national policy, the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the lead Federal agency for \n     investigating all violations of Federal law involving \n     terrorism when the FBI has been given by statute or \n     regulation investigative authority over the relevant offense. \n     See 28 U.S.C. 523 and 28 C.F.R. 0.85(1).\n       Section 408.\n       This section provides that the amendments made by title IV \n     shall take effect one year after the date of enactment. The \n     one year delay should be adequate for manufacturers to obtain \n     sources of one of the specified detection agents and to \n     reformulate the plastic explosives they manufacture to \n     include a detection agent.\n       Section 501.\n       Section 501 expands the scope and jurisdictional bases \n     under 18 U.S.C. 831 (prohibited transactions involving \n     nuclear materials). It is an effort to modify current law to \n     deal with the increased risk stemming from the destruction of \n     certain nuclear weapons that were once in the arsenal of the \n     former Soviet Union and the lessening of security controls \n     over peaceful nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. \n     Among other things, the bill expands the definition of \n     nuclear materials to include those materials which are less \n     than weapons grade but are dangerous to human life and/or the \n     environment. It also expands the jurisdictional bases to \n     reach all situations where a U.S. national or corporation is \n     the victim or perpetrator of an offense. The bill expressly \n     covers those situations where a treat to do some form of \n     prohibited activity is directed at the United States \n     Government.\n       Subsection 501(a)(1) sets forth a series of findings. \n     Subsection 501(a)(2) sets forth the purpose.\n       Subsection 501(b) makes many technical changes to section \n     831 of title 18, United States Code. The ones of substance \n     are:\n       (1) Paragraph (1) adds ``nuclear byproduct material'' to \n     the scope of subsection 831(a).\n       (2) Paragraph (2) ensures coverage of situations under \n     subsection 831(a)(1)(A) where there is substantial damage to \n     the environment.\n       (3) Paragraph (3) rewrites subsection 831(a)(1)(B) in the \n     following ways:\n       (A) drops the requirement that the defendant ``know'' that \n     circumstances exist which the dangerous to life or property. \n     If such circumstances are created through the intentional \n     actions of the defendant, criminal sanctions are appropriate \n     due to the inherently dangerous nature of nuclear material \n     and the extraordinary risk of harm created.\n       (B) adds substantial damage to the environment; and\n       (C) adds language (i.e., ``such circumstances are \n     represented to the defendant to exist'') to cover the \n     situation of sales by undercover law enforcement to \n     prospective buyers of materials purported to be nuclear \n     materials. This is comparable to the new 18 U.S.C. 21 created \n     by section 320910 of Pub. L. 103-322 for undercover \n     operations.\n       (4) Paragraph (4) expands the threat provision of \n     subsection 831(a)(6) to cover threats to do substantial \n     damage to the environment.\n       (5) Paragraph (5) expands the jurisdiction in subsection \n     831(c)(2) beyond those situations where the offender is a \n     United States national. As revised, it includes all \n     situations, anywhere in the world where a United States \n     national is the victim of an offense or where the perpetrator \n     or victim of the offense is a ``United States corporation or \n     other legal entity.''\n       (6) Paragraph (6) drops the requirement in subsection \n     831(c)(3) that the nuclear material be for ``peaceful \n     purposes'', i.e., non-military, and that it be in use, \n     storage, or transport. Hence, the provision now reaches any \n     alien who commits an offense under subsection 831(a) overseas \n     and is subsequently found in the United States. Of course, if \n     the target of the offense was a U.S. national or corporation \n     or the U.S. Government there would be jurisdiction of the \n     offense under another provision of subsection 831(c), even \n     when the perpetrator is still overseas. The activities \n     prohibited by subsection 831(a) are so serious that all \n     civilized nations have recognized their obligations to \n     confront this growing problem because of its inherent \n     dangerousness.\n       (7) Paragraph (8) deletes the requirement for subsection \n     831(c)(4) that the nuclear materials being shipped to or from \n     the United States be for peaceful purposes. Hence, military \n     nuclear materials are now encompassed under subsection \n     831(c)(4). It also adds nuclear byproduct material to the \n     provision.\n       (8) Paragraph (10) adds a new paragraph (5) to subsection \n     831(c) to ensure that there is federal jurisdiction when the \n     governmental entity being threatened under subsection \n     831(a)(5) is the United States and when the threat under \n     subsection 831(a)(6) is directed at the United States.\n       (9) Paragraph (11) deletes an outmoded requirement, so that \n     all plutonium is now covered.\n       (10) Paragraph (14) adds ``nuclear byproduct material'' to \n     the definitions as a new subsection 831(f)(2). Nuclear \n     byproduct material means any material containing any \n     radioactive isotope created through an irradiation process in \n     the operation of a nuclear reactor or accelerator. This will \n     extend the prohibitions of this statute to materials that are \n     not capable of creating a nuclear explosion, but which, \n     nevertheless, could be used to create a radioactive dispersal \n     device capable of spreading highly dangerous radioactive \n     material throughout an area.\n       (11) Paragraph (17) adds to subsection 831(f) the \n     definitions for the terms ``national of the United States'' \n     and ``United States corporation or other legal entity.''\n       Section 601.\n       This section deletes subsection (c) of the material support \n     statute (18 U.S.C. 2339A(c)) enacted as part of the 1994 \n     crime bill (Pub. L. 103-322). It would also correct erroneous \n     statutory references and typographical errors (i.e., changes \n     ``36'' to ``37,'' ``2331'' to ``2332,'' \n     [[Page S6213]] ``2339'' to ``2332a,'' and ``of an escape'' to \n     ``or an escape'').\n       Subsection 2339A(c) of title 18, United States Code, \n     imposes an unprecedented and impractical burden on law \n     enforcement concerning the initiation and continuation of \n     criminal investigations under 18 U.S.C. 2339A. Specifically, \n     subsection (c) provides that the government may not initiate \n     or continue an investigation under this statute unless the \n     existing facts reasonably indicate that the target knowingly \n     and intentionally has engaged, is engaged, or will \n     engage in a violation of federal criminal law. In other \n     words, the government must have facts that reasonably \n     indicate each element of the offense before it even initiates \n     (or continues) an investigation. The normal investigative \n     practice is that the government obtains evidence which \n     indicates that a violation may exist if certain other \n     elements of the offense, particularly the knowledge or intent \n     elements, are also present. The government then seeks to \n     obtain evidence which establishes or negates the existence of \n     the other elements. If such evidence is found to exist, the \n     investigation continues to obtain the necessary evidence to \n     prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt on every element.\n       As drafted, however, subsection (c) reverses the natural \n     flow of a criminal investigation. It is an impediment to the \n     effective use of section 2339A. Moreover, the provision would \n     generate unproductive litigation which would only serve to \n     delay the prosecution of any offender, drain limited \n     investigative and prosecutive resources, and hinder efforts \n     to thwart terrorism. It is the position of the Department of \n     Justice that the investigative guidelines issued by the \n     Attorney General adequately protect individual rights while \n     providing for effective law enforcement.\n       Section 601 deletes subsection (c) retroactive to September \n     13, 1994, the date that the 1994 crime bill was signed into \n     law. Since subsection (c) is procedural in nature, the \n     retroactive nature of the proposed deletion does not pose a \n     constitutional problem. It should suffice, however, to \n     preclude a defendant from availing himself of subsection (c) \n     in the event that the conduct charged in a subsequent \n     indictment arose between September 13, 1994, and the \n     enactment of section 601.\n       Section 102(c) of this Act also proposes to broaden the \n     scope of the material support statute by incorporating, as \n     one of the predicate offenses, the proposed statute relating \n     to conspiracies within the United States to commit terrorist \n     acts abroad.\n       Section 602.\n       This section would add coverage for threats to the weapons \n     of mass destruction statute (18 U.S.C. 2332a). The offense of \n     using a weapon of mass destruction (or attempting or \n     conspiring to use such a weapon) was created by section 60023 \n     of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     (P.L. 103-322). However, no threat offense was included. A \n     threat to use such a weapon is a foreseeable tactic to be \n     employed by a terrorist group. Further, it could necessitate \n     a serious and costly government response, e.g. efforts to \n     eliminate the threat, evacuation of a city or facility, etc. \n     Accordingly, it seems clearly appropriate to make threatening \n     to use a weapon of mass destruction a federal offense.\n       This section amends subsection (a) to include threats among \n     the proscribed offenders. Further, it redesignates subsection \n     (b) of section 2332a as subsection (c) and provides a new \n     subsection (b). The new subsection (b) ensures jurisdiction \n     when a national of the United States outside the United \n     States is the perpetrator of the threat offense.\n       Section 603.\n       Section 603 adds to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \n     Organizations (RICO) statute certain federal violent crimes \n     relating to murder and destruction of property. These are the \n     offenses most often committed by terrorists. Many violent \n     crimes committed within the United States are encompassed as \n     predicate acts for the RICO statute. However, RICO does not \n     presently reach most terrorist acts directed against United \n     States interests overseas. Hence, this section adds to RICO \n     extraterritorial terrorism violations. When an organization \n     commits a series of terrorist acts, a RICO theory of \n     prosecution may be the optimal means of proceeding.\n       The offenses being added to as predicate acts to RICO are: \n     18 U.S.C. (relating to the destruction of aircraft), 37 \n     (relating to violence at international airports), 115 \n     (relating to influencing, impeding or retaliating against a \n     federal official by threatening or injuring a family member), \n     351 (relating to Congressional or Cabinet officer \n     assassination), 831 (relating to prohibited transactions \n     involving nuclear materials as amended by section 501 of this \n     bill), 844 (f) or (i) (relating to destruction by explosives \n     or fire of government property or property affecting \n     interstate or foreign commerce), 956 (relating to conspiracy \n     to kill, kidnap, maim or injure property certain property in \n     a foreign country as amended by section 102 of this bill), \n     1111 (relating to murder), 1114 (relating to murder of \n     United States law enforcement officials,), 1116 (relating \n     to murder of foreign officials, official guests, or \n     internationally protected persons), 1203 (relating to \n     hostage taking), 1361 (relating to willful injury of \n     government property), 1363 (relating to destruction of \n     property within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction), 1751 (relating to Presidential \n     assassination), 2280 (relating to violence against \n     maritime navigation as amended by section 606 of this \n     bill), 2281 (relating to violence against maritime fixed \n     platforms), 2332 (relating to terrorist acts abroad \n     against United States nationals), 2332a (relating to use \n     of weapons of mass destruction as amended by section 602 \n     of this bill), 2332b (relating to acts of terrorism \n     transcending national boundaries created by section 101 of \n     this bill), and 2339A (relating to providing material \n     support to terrorists as amended by sections 102(c) and \n     601 of this bill), and 49 U.S.C. 46502 (relating to \n     aircraft piracy.)\n       Section 604.\n       18 U.S.C. 1956(a)(2)(A) makes it a felony to transfer funds \n     from the United States to a place outside the United States \n     if the transfer is done with the intent to promote the \n     carrying on of ``specified unlawful activity.'' The term \n     ``specified unlawful activity'' is defined in section \n     1956(c)(7)(B) to include an offense against a foreign nation \n     involving kidnapping, robbery, or extortion as well as \n     certain offenses involving controlled substances and fraud by \n     or against a foreign bank. It does not, however, include \n     murder or the destruction of property by means of explosive \n     or fire.\n       In recent investigations of international terrorist \n     organizations, it has been discovered that certain of these \n     organizations collect money in the United States and then \n     transfer the money outside the United States for use in \n     connection with acts of terrorism which may involve murder or \n     destruction of property in foreign nations.\n       In order to prevent terrorist organizations from collecting \n     money inside the United States which is used to finance \n     murders and destruction of property, subsection (a) would add \n     ``murder and destruction of property by explosive or fire'' \n     to the list of specified unlawful activity in section \n     1956(c)(7)(B)(ii). This amendment would also apply to cases \n     where the proceeds of any such murder or property destruction \n     would be laundered in the United States.\n       Subsection (b) would add to the definitions of ``specified \n     unlawful activity'' in section 1956(c)(7)(D) of title 18, \n     United States Code, those violent federal offenses most \n     likely to be violated by terrorists overseas. Hence, if \n     during the course of perpetrating these violent offenses \n     the terrorists transferred funds in interstate or foreign \n     commerce to promote the carrying on of any of these \n     offenses, they would also violate the money laundering \n     statute. The offenses added are the same as those added to \n     the RICO statute by section 603 of this bill, except for \n     18 U.S.C. 1203 (relating to hostage taking) which is \n     already contained as a money laundering predicate. It \n     should be noted that if section 603 of this bill is \n     enacted, subsection 604(b) need not be enacted because any \n     offense which is included as a RICO predicate is \n     automatically a predicate also under the money laundering \n     statute.\n       Section 605.\n       This section would add a number of terrorism-related \n     offenses to 18 U.S.C. 2516, thereby permitting court-\n     authorized interception of wire, oral, and electronic \n     communications when the rigorous requirements of chapter 119 \n     (including section 2516) are met. Presently, section 2516 \n     contains a long list of felony offenses for which electronic \n     surveillance is authorized. The list has grown periodically \n     since the initial enactment of the section in 1968. As a \n     result, coverage of terrorism-related offenses is not \n     comprehensive. Section 2516 already includes such offenses as \n     hostage taking under 18 U.S.C. 1203, train wrecking under 18 \n     U.S.C. 1992, and sabotage of nuclear facilities or fuel under \n     42 U.S.C. 2284.\n       The instant proposal would add 18 U.S.C. 956, as amended by \n     section 103 of this bill, and 960 (proscribing conspiracies \n     to harm people or damage certain property of a foreign nation \n     with which the United States is not at war and organizing or \n     participating in from within the United States an expedition \n     against a friendly nation), 49 U.S.C. 46502 (relating to \n     aircraft piracy), and 18 U.S.C. 2332 (relating to killing \n     United States nationals abroad with intent to coerce the \n     government or a civilian population). It would also add 18 \n     U.S.C. 2332a (relating to offenses involving weapons of mass \n     destruction), 18 U.S.C. 2332b (relating to acts of terrorism \n     transcending national boundaries, which offense is created by \n     section 101 of this bill), 18 U.S.C. 2339A (relating to \n     providing material support to terrorists), and 18 U.S.C. 37 \n     (relating to violence at airports).\n       Terrorism offenses frequently require the use of court-\n     authorized electronic surveillance techniques because of the \n     clandestine and violent nature of the groups that commit such \n     crimes. Adding the proposed predicate offenses to 18 U.S.C. \n     2516 would therefore facilitate the ability of law \n     enforcement successfully to investigate, and sometimes \n     prevent, such offenses in the future.\n       Section 606.\n       In considering legislative proposals which were \n     incorporated into the 1994 crime bill (Pub. L. 103-322), \n     Congress altered the Department's proposed formulation of the \n     jurisdictional provisions of the Maritime Violence \n     legislation, the Violence Against Maritime Fixed Platforms \n     legislation, and Violence at International Airports \n     legislation, because of a concern over possible federal \n     coverage of violence stemming from labor disputes. The \n     altered language created uncertainties which were brought to \n     the attention of Congress. Subsequently, the labor violence \n     concern was addressed by adoption of the bar to prosecution \n     contained in 18 U.S.C. 37(c), 2280(c) and 2281(c). With the \n     adoption of [[Page S6214]] this bar, the sections were to \n     revert to their original wording, as submitted by the \n     Department of Justice. While sections 37 and 2281 were \n     properly corrected, the disturbing altered language was \n     inadvertently left in section 2280.\n       Consequently, as clauses (ii) and (iii) of subsection \n     2280(b)(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code, are presently \n     written, there would be no federal jurisdiction over a \n     prohibited act within the United States by anyone (alien or \n     citizen) if there was a state crime, regardless of whether \n     the state crime is a felony. Moreover, the Maritime \n     Convention mandated that the United States assert \n     jurisdiction when a United States national does a prohibited \n     act anywhere against any covered ship. Limiting jurisdiction \n     over prohibited acts committed by United States nationals to \n     those directed against only foreign ships and ships outside \n     the United States does not fulfill our treaty \n     responsibilities to guard against all wrongful conduct by our \n     own nationals.\n       Moreover, as presently drafted, there is no federal \n     jurisdiction over alien attacks against foreign vessels \n     within the United States, except in the unlikely situation \n     that no state crime is involved. This is a potentially \n     serious gap. Finally, until the federal criminal jurisdiction \n     over the expanded portion of the territorial sea of the \n     United States is clarified, there remains some doubt about \n     federal criminal jurisdiction over aliens committing \n     prohibited acts against foreign vessels in the expanded \n     portion of the territorial sea of the United States (i.e., \n     from 3 to 12 nautical miles out). Consequently, striking the \n     limiting phrases in clauses (ii) and (iii) ensures federal \n     jurisdiction, unless the bar to prosecution under subsection \n     2280(c) relating to labor disputes is applicable, in all \n     situations that are required by the Maritime Convention.\n       Section 607.\n       This section expands federal jurisdiction over certain bomb \n     threats or hoaxes. Presently, 18 U.S.C. 844(e), covers \n     threats to damage by fire or explosive property protected by \n     18 U.S.C. 844 (f) or (i), if the United States mails, the \n     telephone or some other instrument of commerce is used to \n     convey the threat or the false information. Section 607 \n     removes any jurisdictional nexus for the means used to \n     convey the threat or false information. A sufficient \n     jurisdictional nexus is contained in the targeted property \n     itself, i.e., the property (1) belongs to the United \n     States Government, (2) is owned by an organization \n     receiving federal funds, or (3) is used in or affects \n     interstate or foreign commerce. The threat provision has \n     also been drafted to cover a threat to commit an arson in \n     violation of 18 U.S.C. 81 against property located in the \n     special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the \n     United States.\n       Section 608.\n       This section would amend the explosives chapter of title 18 \n     to provide generally that a conspiracy to commit an offense \n     under that chapter is punishable by the same maximum term as \n     that applicable to the substantive offense that was the \n     object of the conspiracy. In contrast, the general conspiracy \n     statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, provides for a maximum of five years' \n     imprisonment. This provision accords with several recent \n     Congressional enactments, including 21 U.S.C. 846 (applicable \n     to drug conspiracies) and 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) (applicable to \n     money laundering conspiracies). See also section 320105 of \n     Pub. Law 103-322, which raised the penalty for the offense of \n     conspiracy to travel interstate with intent to commit murder \n     for hire (18 U.S.C. 1958). This trend in federal law, which \n     is emulated in the penal codes of many States, recognizes \n     that, as the Supreme Court has observed, ``collective \n     criminal agreement--partnership in crime--presents a greater \n     potential threat to the public than individual delicts.'' \n     Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 593 (1961); accord \n     United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671, 693-4 (1975).\n       Section 608 includes the introductory phrase ``[e]xcept as \n     provided in this section'' in order to take account of one \n     area where a different maximum penalty will apply. Section \n     110518(b) of Pub. Law 103-322 enacted a special twenty-year \n     maximum prison penalty (18 U.S.C. 844(m)) for conspiracies to \n     violate 18 U.S.C. 844(h), which prohibits using an explosive \n     to commit certain crimes and which carries a mandatory five-\n     year prison term for the completed crime. Like section \n     844(m), the proposed amendment exempts the penalty of death \n     for a conspiracy offense.\n       Section 609.\n       Section 609 would cure an anomaly in 18 U.S.C. 115. The \n     statute presently punishes violent crimes against the \n     immediate families of certain former federal officials and \n     law enforcement officers (including prosecutors) in \n     retaliation for acts undertaken while the former official was \n     in office. However, the former official is not protected \n     against such crimes. Federal investigators, prosecutors, \n     and judges who are involved in terrorism cases are often \n     the subject of death threats. The danger posed to the \n     safety of such officers does not necessarily abate when \n     they leave government service. Former United States \n     officials should be protected by federal law against \n     retaliation directed at the past performance of their \n     official duties. Section 609 would provide such \n     protection.\n       Section 610.\n       The changes made by this section are similar to that made \n     by section 608 for explosives conspiracies.\n       This section adds ``conspiracy'' to several offenses likely \n     to be committed by terrorists. Conspiracy is added to the \n     offense itself to ensure that coconspirators are subject to \n     the same penalty applicable to those perpetrators who attempt \n     or complete the offense. Presently, the maximum possible \n     imprisonment provided under the general conspiracy statute, \n     18 U.S.C. 371, is only five years. The offenses for which \n     conspiracy is being added are: 18 U.S.C. 32 (destruction of \n     aircraft), 37 (violence at airports serving international \n     civil aviation), 115 (certain violent crimes against former \n     federal officials, added by section 609, and family members \n     of current or former federal officials), 175 (prohibitions \n     with respect to biological weapons), 1203 (hostage taking), \n     2280 (violence against maritime navigation), and 2281 \n     (violence against maritime fixed platforms), and 49 U.S.C. \n     46502 (relating to aircraft piracy).\n       Section 701.\n       This section sets forth the congressional findings for \n     title VII.\n       Section 702.\n       Amending subsection 573(d) of chapter 8 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2349aa2) would allow more \n     flexibility and efficiency in the Department of State's \n     Antiterrorism Training Assistance (ATA) program by permitting \n     more courses to be taught overseas and allowing for \n     instructors to teach overseas for up to 180 days. Current law \n     allows training overseas for only certain specified types of \n     courses and only for up to 30 days. Deleting subsection (f) \n     of section 573 would allow for some personnel expenses for \n     administering the ATA program to be met through the foreign \n     aid appropriation. Currently, all such costs are paid from \n     the Department of State's Salaries and Expenses account.\n\n\n           title viii--substantive investigative enhancements\n\n       Sec. 801. Pen registers and trap and trace devices in \n     foreign counterintelligence and counterterrorism \n     investigations.\n       Section 801 permits the FBI to use pen register and trap \n     and trace device statutes--already available in routine \n     criminal cases--in foreign counterintelligence \n     investigations. Pen registers are devices which record \n     signals pulsed or toned--simply put, the number dialed, while \n     trap and trade devices record the number from which a call \n     originates, simply put, Caller ID. Neither device permits the \n     monitoring of the actual conversation taking place.\n       Sec. 802. Disclosure of information and consumer reports to \n     FBI for foreign counterintelligence purposes.\n       Section 802 permits the FBI to obtain access to consumer \n     credit reports in foreign counterintelligence matters. These \n     are the same reports available on request to car salesmen and \n     real estate agents and to the FBI, by grand jury subpoena, in \n     routine criminal cases. Without the information in these \n     reports, the FBI cannot determine where terrorists hold their \n     assets and accordingly a major part of the investigations is \n     lost. The grand jury subpoena process is not available in \n     foreign counterintelligence matters because these are not \n     necessarily criminal in nature.\n       Sec. 803. Study and requirements for tagging of explosive \n     materials, and study and recommendations for rendering \n     explosive components inert and imposing controls on \n     precursors of explosives\n       Section 803 requires the Department of the Treasury to \n     study the action of taggants--microscopic particles which \n     will survive combustion and which are unique by manufacture \n     and date and which therefore will serve to identify the \n     source of an explosive--as well as whether it is possible to \n     render certain chemicals inert and whether certain explosives \n     precursors can be controlled. The study must be completed \n     within one year of enactment.\n       The provision also requires Treasury to promulgate \n     regulations regarding the addition of these taggants by \n     private manufacturers and criminalizes possession, transfer \n     and other conduct respecting explosives not containing \n     taggants. The criminal provision does not become effective \n     until 90 days after the promulgation of the regulation \n     requiring the taggant addition.\n       Sec. 804. Access to records of common carriers, public \n     accommodation facilities, physical storage facilities and \n     vehicle rental facilities in foreign counterintelligence and \n     counterterrorism cases.\n       Section 804 permits the FBI access to the same records \n     already available to the DEA by administrative subpoena in \n     routine narcotics investigations and which are available to \n     the FBI and all other law enforcement agencies in criminal \n     cases where a grand jury subpoena may properly be obtained.\n       Hotels and motels, storage facilities, airlines, trains and \n     vehicle rental companies all provide services and maintain \n     records which are often of extraordinary value to law \n     enforcement--no less in foreign counterintelligence and \n     counterterrorism cases.\n       Records would be produced pursuant to a special written \n     request which would be signed by a person with a title no \n     lower than Assistant Special Agent In Charge. Such an \n     individual is generally a senior person considered middle-\n     management within the FBI structure.\n       Sec. 805. Limitation of statutory exclusionary rule.\n       Section 805 would simply extend to warrants issued to \n     conduct electronic surveillance, the same ``good faith'' \n     standard which [[Page S6215]] already exists by Supreme Court \n     decision as to routine search warrants. There is no policy \n     basis to apply a different standard to electronic \n     surveillance warrants than is applied to other warrants.\n       Sec. 806. Authority for wiretaps in any terrorism-related \n     or explosives felony.\n       Section 806 would expand the circumstances under which \n     electronic surveillance orders for oral and/or wire \n     intercepts could be issued by a court, to include any felony \n     when an appropriate high-ranking Department of Justice \n     official certifies that the ``felony involves or may involve \n     domestic or international terrorism.'' While most such \n     felonies are already covered in the Electronic Communications \n     Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510, et seq., \n     there are occasions when those engaged in terrorism may have \n     violated statutes which are not enumerated. In such \n     instances, although the statute may not ordinarily merit \n     status as a predicate under ECPA, the specific actions of the \n     target(s) may raise the seriousness of the statute to a level \n     where an ECPA order is appropriate.\n       Section 106 would also expand the list of predicate crimes \n     to include felony explosives violations. Such violations are \n     key to terrorism and violent crime prosecutions and \n     accordingly a key predicate to ECPA orders which may be \n     required in such cases.\n       Sec. 807. Temporary emergency wiretap authority involving \n     terroristic crimes.\n       Section 807 would simply permit the issuance of emergency \n     wiretap orders--already available in organized crime cases--\n     to situations involving domestic or international terrorism. \n     Such orders are only valid for 48 hours but are essential \n     because this period of time is sufficient to permit the FBI \n     to obtain a court-ordered warrant, a process which may take \n     as long as the 48 hours permitted.\n       Sec. 808. Expanded authority for roving wiretaps.\n       Section 808 removes a needless impediment to the issuance \n     of roving wiretaps--wiretaps which protect individual rights \n     because the ``tap'' follows the target from phone to phone \n     rather than remaining on one phone which others may use--by \n     deleting the requirement that the government, which must show \n     that the target is using multiple phones lines, is doing so \n     in order to avoid routine surveillance.\n       This is a hard standard to meet and bears no direct \n     relevance to whether the roving wiretap ought to be \n     authorized by a court. Although roving wiretaps have been \n     authorized since at least 1986, the additional requirement of \n     proof of motive has foiled several major investigations.\n       Sec. 809. Enhanced access to telephone billing records.\n       Section 809 would allow the FBI to obtain telephone billing \n     information already available in routine cases by way of \n     grand jury subpoena. Although toll records are already \n     available, information such as address, length of service and \n     local calling information is essential in many investigations \n     and the very same information is used by many telephone \n     companies for routine marketing and sales promotion programs.\n       Sec. 810. Requirement to preserve evidence.\n       Section 810 would require telephone companies to preserve \n     their records on demand, for at least 90 days, possibly more, \n     until a court order to preserve records can be obtained. \n     Although most mainstream phone companies already preserve \n     their records for more than this period of time, the growth \n     of small companies in the industry has resulted in \n     services which discard records after very short periods of \n     time. Such information is of critical importance in a wide \n     variety of investigations.\n       Sec. 811. Permission to request military assistance with \n     respect to offenses involving chemical and biological \n     weapons.\n       Section 811 would permit the Attorney General to request \n     military assistance in cases involving chemical and \n     biological weapons. New subsections enacted by section 811 \n     and codified at Sec. Sec. 175(c) and 2332b(c) would provide a \n     limited exception to the Posse Comitatus Act to permit the \n     military to provide technical assistance to federal law \n     enforcement officials in enforcing these subsections. \n     Technical assistance could include assistance in \n     investigations, in conducting searches, in evidence \n     collection, and in disarming and disabling individuals but \n     would not include authority to arrest. Further, these \n     subsections do not authorize any intelligence agency to \n     engage in any activity that is not otherwise authorized by \n     law or executive order.\n       Section 811 would also amend current law concerning \n     chemical weapons to include all chemical weapons, whether in \n     gaseous form or not. Under existing law, chemical weapons are \n     covered, only if in gaseous form. Accordingly, an individual \n     who poisoned a city's water supply with a pellet of dioxin \n     would not be chargeable under current law because the pellet \n     was not in gaseous form until it was dropped into the water\n       Sec. 812. General reward authority of the Attorney General.\n       Section 812 would remove the existing $500,000 cap on the \n     Attorney General's reward authority and would also permit the \n     Attorney General to receive funds from other agencies so as \n     to permit ``pooled'' awards when multiple agencies are \n     involved. The Administration intends to submit complementary \n     appropriations language on this subject.\n\n\n             title ix--substantive prosecutive enhancements\n\n       Sec. 901. Possession of stolen explosives.\n       Section 901 would expand federal statutes which already \n     criminalize the knowing possession of stolen firearms to \n     include stolen explosive materials.\n       Sec. 902. Protection of Federal employees on account of the \n     performance of their official duties.\n       Section 902 would expand federal criminal murder and \n     assault jurisdiction to include all federal employees and \n     their immediate families. The provision would also include \n     the uniformed services of the military. Under existing \n     federal law, only certain enumerated federal employees are \n     protected under federal law and as federal employees become \n     targets--not only as the result of their specific job titles, \n     but merely because they are federal employees--the need for \n     federal protection grows.\n\n\n                      title x--criminal penalties\n\n       Sec. 1001. Mandatory penalty for transferring a firearm \n     knowing that it will be used to commit a crime of violence.\n       Section 1001 would increase from a maximum to a minimum of \n     10 years, the sentence of imprisonment which must be imposed \n     when an individual transfers a firearm knowing that the \n     firearm material will be used to commit a crime of violence \n     or a drug trafficking crime. Because such knowledge makes the \n     crime more serious, there is a greater need for punishment.\n       Sec. 1002. Mandatory penalty for transferring an explosive \n     material knowing that it will be used to commit a crime of \n     violence.\n       Section 1002 would create a parallel offense to that \n     involving firearms when an individual transfers explosives \n     material knowing that the material will be used to commit a \n     crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime.\n       Sec. 1003. Increased period of limitations for National \n     Firearms Act.\n       Section 1003 would extend the current three-year statute of \n     limitations which applies to certain serious weapons \n     offenses, to five years, the same statute of limitations as \n     applies to virtually all other felony offenses under federal \n     criminal law. Some of the offenses covered include the \n     possession of machineguns, sawed-off shotguns, silencers and \n     explosive devices.\n\n\n                           title xi--funding\n\n       Sec. 1101. Civil monetary penalty surcharge and \n     telecommunications carrier compliance payments.\n       Section 1101 creates a mechanism to pay for the costs of \n     implementing digital telephony programs. Subject to \n     appropriations action, a surcharge of 40 percent is added to \n     each civil monetary penalty at the time it is assessed by the \n     United States or an agency thereof. The Administration \n     intends to submit complementary appropriations language on \n     this subject.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, terrorists destroyed the \nFederal building in Oklahoma City, took hundreds of lives, and \ndestroyed the lives of thousands of others. Federal, State, and local \ninvestigators continue the search for those responsible for that \nheinous act.\n  In the weeks since the attack, there has been renewed focus on S. \n390, the President's comprehensive \ncounterterrorism bill I introducing in February \nwith Senators Specter and Kohl.\n  Today, I am pleased to join with Senator Daschle and others in \nintroducing expanded counterterrorism legislation, which contains \nadditional proposals to assist law enforcement in the fight against \nterrorism.\n  As I said in February, I believe we must take strong action to \ncounteract terrorism. Now, in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, it \nis clear that we must focus our attention not just on foreign \nterrorists, but on domestic American terrorists as well.\n  There are steps we can take, and this bill combines them. We should \nensure that law enforcement has the tools and resources it needs to \neffectively investigate and prevent terrorist acts, whatever their \norigin.\n  At the same time, we should not, in the heat of the moment, pass \nlegislation that we--and the American public--will later regret. Our \nfreedoms and our Constitution are simply too valuable to be put at risk \nin a hurried rush to respond to this terrible tragedy.\n  Several important provisions in this bill come from S. 390, \nintroduced earlier this year. For instance, the bill expands the \ncircumstances in which we can prosecute crimes committed overseas which \naffect our interests.\n  It also prohibits persons from raising funds for foreign terrorist \norganizations, implements treaties on plastic explosives, and takes a \nnumber of other important actions.\n  New provisions in this bill add to that effort by providing enhanced \nauthority to obtain records in foreign counterintelligence \ninvestigations through letter requests from the FBI. This allows access \nto records such as consumer credit reports and hotel/motel records.\n[[Page S6216]]\n\n  Because foreign counter-intelligence investigations may not involve a \ncriminal prosecution, a grand jury subpoena may not be an option in \nthese cases.\n  This bill now also revises current wiretap laws to provide \nauthorization for wiretaps in connection with any felony if the \nDepartment of Justice certifies that it is connected to foreign or \ndomestic terrorism, and it allows for emergency wiretaps in terrorism \ninvestigations.\n  The bill also alters the standards to obtain a so-called roving \nwiretap--targeted at a person moving from phone to phone or using pay \nphones.\n  In addition, the bill allows use of the military to investigate \noffenses involving chemical and biological weapons.\n  And it allows the Department of the Treasury to promulgate \nregulations requiring explosives manufacturers to use methods making \nthe explosives traceable, known as taggants.\n  While I believe many of the provisions now under consideration in \nthis bill are useful and desirable, I do share some of the concerns \nabout the bill.\n  Specifically, I want to examine closely the need for and the full \nscope of the additional authority sought for law enforcement in \nwiretapping and in collecting records, particularly where domestic \ngroups are targeted.\n  As I said in February, I am also concerned about the alien terrorist \nremoval provisions, which would allow secret evidence to be used to \ndeport a person.\n  Our judicial system generally requires that a defendant be given the \nevidence to be used against him--so that he can prepare a defense. \nUnseen, unheard evidence simply cannot be defended against, and raises \nthe possibility of erroneous decisions.\n  I also believe we should look closely at proposals which would ban \nfundraising for organizations which the President designates as \nterrorist.\n  The first amendment rights of association and free speech are at the \nheart of our system of government. While we should not allow people to \nknowingly support terrorism, we also must ensure that legitimate \npolitical activities are not curtailed.\n  We must examine these and other issues closely before acting on \nterrorism legislation.\n  But I do believe we should act. Americans enjoy freedoms unlike those \nin any other country on the planet. But freedoms bring \nresponsibilities.\n  Incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing have no place in our free \nand democratic society, which allows full expression of all types of \npolitical views through legitimate means. There is simply no excuse for \nturning to violence in a society with open airwaves, uncensored \nnewspapers, and regular and free elections of the peoples' \nrepresentatives.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 762. A bill to implement General Accounting Office recommendations \nregarding the use of commercial software to detect billing code abuse \nin Medicare claims processing, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n            the medicare billing abuse preventon act of 1995\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing the Medicare \nBilling Abuse Prevention Act to implement recommendations of the \nGeneral Accounting Office concerning abusive and improper billing \npractices that are costing the American taxpayer and individual \nMedicare beneficiaries billions of dollars. There is controversy over \nwhat should be done concerning Medicare. But, I am hopeful that we will \nall agree that medical providers should receive what they are entitled \nto and should not receive payments based on improper billings.\n  Last year, I along with the chairman and ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee asked the GAO to look at how much Medicare loses because of \nits inability to prevent and detect abusive and inappropriate billings \nby health care providers. We specifically asked them what savings the \ntaxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries might realize if Medicare was to \nuse the commercially available state of the art computer programs to \ndetect and stop abusive payments.\n  GAO has done their usual excellent work. The results of their review \nare dramatic. Medicare's system for detecting abuse is failing and it's \ncosting American taxpayers and senior citizens millions every day. \nTaxpayers and those on Medicare could save roughly $4 billion over the \nnext 5 years if Medicare harnessed the power of the private sector and \nused state of the art anti-abuse equipment.\n  Although I believed we had a problem, the GAO has uncovered losses \nfrom improper billings that are far larger than I expected. They also \nsuggested a straightforward solution that will conservatively save the \nMedicare trust fund about $640 million per year and Medicare \nbeneficiaries over $140 million a year in their out of pocket costs. \nThose estimates are based on four separate samples of 200,000 actual \nfiled claims each that were processed with commercially available \nsoftware developed by four separate computer companies that now provide \nthe software to commercial users, primarily insurance companies.\n  I was pleased to hear that the great majority of medical care \nproviders billed the Government correctly. The losses were the results \nof billings submitted by 8 percent of providers. I do want to point out \nthat all errors are not purposeful. But, whatever the reason, the \nMedicare trust fund should have the best protections against improper \npayments.\n  In a hearing held by the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education and Related Agencies today, I believe that a solid \ncase was made for immediate action. Losses are mounting by about $2 \nmillion for every day we wait.\n  Many in Congress are proposing dramatic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid \nto pay for tax cuts and reduce the deficit. They are suggesting that \nsenior citizens and the disabled, most of whom live on limited, fixed \nincomes, pay more for Medicare. And they are suggesting dramatic cuts \nin payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers--\ncuts that will either reduce health care access and quality of care for \nolder Americans, or simply be shifted on to the millions of working \nAmericans who have private health insurance.\n\n  While Medicare for years led the health care field in technology, \ntoday it has been left in the dust. While most of the Nation's leading \nprivate health insurers and managed care plans are saving billions by \nusing this state of the art equipment, Medicare lags behind. In fact, \nmany of the same private health insurers that Medicare contracts with \nto process its claims use this new technology on their private sector \nbusiness but can't use the same to bring American taxpayers and seniors \nMedicare savings. This is part of the reason why Medicare's costs are \nrising faster than private sector health care costs.\n  The GAO had four private companies that have developed sophisticated \ncomputer technology to detect and stop billing abuse run a \nrepresentative sample of doctors bills Medicare had already checked and \npaid through their systems. The private sector systems found instance \nafter instance where Medicare, with its outdated computer technology, \npaid abusive or inappropriate bills that should have been denied. The \nmost common form of billing abuse identified was unbundling, where a \ndoctor performs a procedure and bills Medicare not only for the full \nprocedure, but also for components of the procedure. For example, a \ndoctor bills Medicare $5,000 for gall bladder surgery, but also bills \nMedicare $1,000 for the incision and closing the wound. Medicare is \npaying twice for the same service. Other examples of unbundling abuses \nidentified include: billing for multiple visits to the same patient on \nthe same day; billing separately for injections and chemotherapy \nadministration when those injections are simply a component of the \nchemotherapy administration; and, billing for excessive numbers of Pap \nsmears for the same woman on the same day.\n  Billing abuses that the commercial computer systems would identify \ninclude mutually exclusive procedures, the use of an inappropriate \nassistant at surgery, duplicate billings, and global fee period \nviolations where one charge might cover a physician's services for 30 \ndays after surgery and the doctor separately charges for services \nprovided during that time period. [[Page S6217]] \n  The GAO indicates that it would cost around $20 million or less to \ninstall the private sector technology in Medicare. And they have \nclearly demonstrated that such an investment would save Medicare \ntaxpayers and beneficiaries over $3.9 billion in 5 years. So, for every \ndollar we invest, taxpayers will get a $200 return. I call that a \nbargain. I want to reiterate: for every day we fail to invest, \ntaxpayers will lose about $2 million. And more will be lost by \nindividual Medicare patients, sometimes thousands of dollars by a \nsingle individual. I call that a scandal.\n\n  The Billing Abuse Prevention Act will do three things.\n  First, it will provide a definite time when commercially available \ncomputer systems shall be in actual use to catch billing code abuses by \nall of the 32 Medicare contractors who examine Medicare billings so \nerrors and abusive billing practices can be caught. HCFA has been given \n90 days from the date of enactment to set out the exact requirements \nunder which the 32 Medicare contractors shall have a computer checking \nsystem in place. And, it requires that the contractors actually have \nthe system in use within 180 days after enactment.\n  It is my hope and expectation that this can be done more quickly than \nthat. HCFA should now begin the process to develop the criteria without \nwaiting for the legislation to pass. With the full cooperation of the \nagency, I am hopeful that the HCFA implementing requirements could be \nready by the time the President signs the bill. That will allow the \ncontractors to move more quickly as well.\n  Many of the 32 contractors are already using the commercially \navailable systems to review private insurance claims. But, some \nmodifications of the systems will be needed to modify the program to \nmatch HCFA billing practices. And, the contractors will want to review \nall of the systems that are available that meet HCFA's criteria and go \nthrough the appropriate procurement practices.\n  Second, the legislation provides that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services may keep information about the system confidential. If \nthat is not done, detailed information about the system could be used, \nto some degree, to get around the system's safeguards. The legislation \nalso provides that the proprietary information about the systems are \nnot to be released. If it became available, the companies that created \nit might lose a significant part of their investment since other \ncompanies could acquire the technical details of the systems. The \nSecretary is expected to release appropriate information about the \nsystem which is in the public interest.\n  It is important to use commercially available systems because we \nalready know they work and we can put them into place relatively \nquickly with minor modifications. We save time which results in real \nsavings and we avoid what might be a large development cost if HCFA \ntried to create their own system. Another advantage of commercial \nsystems is that they will be continually improved as the private \ndevelopment companies work to further improve their systems to acquire \na larger share of the private marketplace.\n  Third, the Secretary shall order a review of all of the existing \nregulations and guidelines governing Medicare payment policies and \nbilling code abuse to see what modifications might be appropriate to \nmaximize the benefits of the computer checking systems and avoiding \nimproper payments.\n  I urge that this legislation be rapidly considered and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6202-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 326\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Leahy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 326, a bill to prohibit \nUnited States military assistance and arms transfers to foreign \ngovernments that are undemocratic, do not adequately protect human \nrights, are engaged in acts of armed aggression, or are not fully \nparticipating in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms.\n\n\n                                 S. 440\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Dole] was added as a cosponsor of S. 440, a bill to amend title \n23, United States Code, to provide for the designation of the National \nHighway System, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 483\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 483, a bill to amend the \nprovisions of title 17, United States Code, with respect to the \nduration of copyright, and for the other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 607\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Robb] was added as a cosponsor of S. 607, a bill to amend the \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \nof 1980 to clarify the liability of certain recycling transactions, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 692\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Leahy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 692, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to preserve family-held forest lands, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6217-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6217-S6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                COMMONSENSE PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 COVERDELL (AND DOLE) AMENDMENT NO. 690\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL (for himself and Mr. Dole) proposed an amendment to the \namendment No. 596, proposed by Mr. Gorton, to the bill (H.R. 956) to \nestablish legal standards and procedures for product liability \nlitigation, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the \n     raw materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The \n     discovery conducted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be \n     limited to issues that are directly relevant to--\n       (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or\n       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.\n       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) \n     of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to \n     be a biomaterials supplier who is not subject to an action \n     for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an \n     action relating to liability for a violation of contractual \n     requirements or specifications described in subsection (d).\n       (B) Response to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant a \n     motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the \n     defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 205 on the \n     grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to \n     such section 205(b) or seller subject to section 205(c), \n     unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that \n     demonstrates that--\n       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the \n     defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under \n     section 205(b); or\n       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that \n     the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a seller under \n     section 205(c).\n       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--\n       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to \n     dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the \n     pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and \n     any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this \n     section.\n       (B) Motion for summary judgment.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, if the court determines that the pleadings \n     and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this section raise \n     genuine issues as concerning material facts with respect to a \n     motion concerning contractual requirements and \n     specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to \n     be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection \n     (d).\n       (d) Summary Judgment.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier \n     shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the \n     court finds there is no genuine issue as concerning any \n     material fact for each applicable element set forth in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 205(d).\n       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding \n     made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a \n     genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence \n     submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a \n     reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the \n     jury found the evidence to be credible.\n       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for \n     summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court \n     permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary \n     judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery \n     shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine \n     issue of material fact exists.\n       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A \n     biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in \n     connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary \n     judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section \n     205(d) or the failure to establish the applicable elements of \n     section 205(d) solely to the extent permitted by the \n     applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against \n     nonparties.\n       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant \n     has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section \n     205(b) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary has not \n     issued a final decision on the petition, the court shall stay \n     all proceedings with respect to that defendant until such \n     time as the Secretary has issued a final decision on the \n     petition.\n       (f) Manufacturer Conduct of Proceeding.--The manufacturer \n     of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under \n     this title shall be permitted to file and conduct a \n     proceeding on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal \n     filed by a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under \n     this section if the manufacturer and any other defendant in \n     such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual \n     agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the \n     cost of such proceeding or to conduct such proceeding.\n       (g) Attorney Fees.--The court shall require the claimant to \n     compensate the biomaterials supplier (or a manufacturer \n     appearing in lieu of a supplier pursuant to subsection (f)) \n     for attorney fees and costs, if--\n       (1) the claimant named or joined the biomaterials supplier; \n     and\n       (2) the court found the claim against the biomaterials \n     supplier to be without merit and frivolous.\n\n     SEC. 207.

Mr. President, in light of the recent bombing in \nOklahoma City, I rise today to speak about a related, but equally \nserious problem confronting both the world community and the United \nStates. This problem is international terrorism.\n  As a world superpower, the United States has an obligation to help \nmaintain peace and stability and to promote democracy throughout the \nglobe. By doing this we create and strengthen many international \nfriendships. At the same time, however, we encounter those who disagree \nwith our goals and actions. Most of this criticism comes peacefully; \nsome of it, unfortunately, comes violently.\n  The culmination of this violence results in such incidents as the \nbombing of Pan Am flight 109--where 189 Americans died over Locherbie, \nScotland--or the bombing of the World Trade Center, where 6 Americans \nwere killed and more than 1,000 were injured by a terrorist act on our \nown soil. Fortunately, these large scale anti-American incidents are \nmore the exception than the rule.\n  However, American citizens are often the victims of many smaller \ninternational terrorist incidents. Of course, this does not mean that \nthe average American citizen should fear a terrorist attack while \nwalking to the local grocery store. In fact, between 1988 and 1994 \nthere were only 10 terrorist attacks throughout all of North America, \ncompared with the 973 attacks in Latin America, 906 in Western Europe, \nand 628 in the Middle East. Relatively speaking, Americans are still \nquite safe in their own country.\n  The problem occurs when U.S. citizens are working, living, and \ntraveling abroad. In fact, in 1994 approximately 21 percent of all \nterrorist attacks were directed at American targets. This, Mr. \nPresident, is a relatively large percentage. Since Americans can be \nfound in every corner of the Earth, it would be near impossible for the \nU.S. Government to ensure the safety of all of its nationals. What, \nthen, can be done to help protect American nationals and their property \nfrom the threat of terrorism?\n  The answer: We must strike at the roots of international terrorist \norganizations. This, Mr. President, is the goal of the Omnibus Counter-\nTerrorism Act of 1995, which I introduced along with Senators Biden, \nSpecter, and others. This legislation will make it a crime to raise \nfunds within the United States for terrorist organizations while \nsimultaneously enhancing the Government's ability to expel those aliens \nwho are, or have been, engaged in terrorist activities.\n  Mr. President, the sad truth is that fundraising for international \nterrorism now has its roots in America--and has even reached the \nMidwest. In fact, in 1993 a group of Palestinian immigrants, linked to \nthe infamous Abu Nidal terrorist organization, actively raised money \nhere for terrorism abroad. Surprisingly, this terrorist cell extended \nfrom St. Louis to Dayton to Racine, WI. After their arrest, three of \nthe men were accused of plotting to kill American Jews and to blow up \nthe Israeli Embassy in Washington on behalf of the Abu Nidal. They \nadmitted to smuggling money and information, buying weapons, and \nplanning terrorist activities. In July 1994, they pleaded guilty to \nFederal racketeering charges.\n  How can we work as hard to fight terrorism abroad, but allow foreign \nterrorism to flourish within our own borders? The Omnibus Counter-\nTerrorism Act will put an end to this ironic situation.\n  Mr. President, our legislation is simple, effective and \nstraightforward. This bill will create a comprehensive Federal criminal \nstatue to be used against international terrorists, while expanding \ncurrent U.S. antiterrorism laws to apply to any terrorist attack on a \nU.S. citizen, regardless of location. By clarifying and elaborating on \nour current laws, this bill takes a firm and stand against terrorism \nboth in the United States and abroad.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has the responsibility to promote stability \nand to protect our citizens throughout the world. International \nterrorists, however, undermine these goals and sabotage American \ninterests. The Omnibus Counter-Terrorism Act of 1995 is not a perfect \npiece of legislation--we do need to make changes so that we do not \ncircumscribe civil liberties. Nevertheless, this bill does take a step \ntoward combating international terrorism. By preventing terrorist \nfundraising and enhancing antiterrorist laws, this act will strike at \nthe roots of terrorism. Not only will it help to make the world safe \nfor Americans, it will help to make the world safe for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6223-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6223-S6224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MONTANA MEAN TIME\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Senator Max Baucus and I were \nelected to the House of Representatives the same year, 1974, and \nthrough the years, I have been impressed by Max Baucus' consistent and \nthoughtful leadership.\n  His stand and statement in behalf of the balanced budget amendment \nthis year, in my opinion, was one of the high points of our debate.\n  But no action he has taken has shown more courage and more common \nsense than his op-ed piece in the New York Times titled, ``Montana Mean \nTime.''\n  It is a candid discussion of what is happening in his State.\n  It is easy for those of us in public life to duck these things. To \nMax Baucus credit, he has not ducked.\n  I am proud to have him as a colleague, and I ask that his statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 1995]\n\n                           Montana Mean Time\n\n                            (By Max Baucus)\n\n       Since the Oklahoma City bombing, public attention has \n     focused on private militias. I claim no great expertise on \n     the movement as a whole, but I have watched it grow in my \n     state. And as an example of the national phenomenon, the \n     Montana militias deserve a close look.\n       We Montanans take pride in our low crime rate, and believe \n     honest people can disagree without being disagreeable. Maybe \n     extremist groups believe they can find a home in Montana \n     because of our easygoing ways. The so-called Militia of \n     Montana is one such group. At least one of its founders is \n     associated with the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations. It says it exists \n     so that ``if the Government uses its [[Page S6224]] force \n     against the citizens, the people can respond with a superior \n     amount of arms.''\n       The Militia of Montana frequently uses anti-Semitic code \n     words like ``shadow government'' and ``banking elites.'' Its \n     director, Bob Fletcher, defends this rhetoric this way: ``If \n     the bulk of the banking elite are Jewish, is that anti-\n     Semitic? The people who are doing this are the international \n     banking elite, and if they are all Jews, so be it, but that's \n     not the case. I don't care if they're Arabs or monkeys.''\n       Associated with the Militia of Montana is the more extreme \n     Freemen movement. The Militia warns of tyranny to come; the \n     Freemen say it exists today. A Freeman leader offers the \n     following ``proof'': ``A Social Security card/number, \n     marriage licenses, driver's licenses, insurance, vehicle \n     registration, welfare from the corporations, electrical \n     inspections, permits to build your private home, income \n     taxes, property taxes.''\n       Look at the Freemen's racial theories. The same fellow who \n     says marriage licenses are tyranny believes people who are \n     not white are ``beasts.'' Only whites go to heaven; Jews are \n     children of Satan.\n       The rhetoric of these groups embraces a range of enemies, \n     from the Federal Government to ``the New World Order.'' Their \n     real target, however, is local law enforcement. Nick Murnion, \n     the Garfield County Attorney, recalls threats the Freemen \n     made against him last year. ``They told me they weren't going \n     to bother building a gallows. They were just going to let me \n     swing from the bridge,'' he says.\n       A month ago, armed members of yet a third group, the North \n     American Volunteer Militia, threatened the marshal in the \n     town of Darby. He had pulled over a car whose license plates \n     expired in 1992, and later describes what followed: ``They \n     had weapons and they were shaking them at us and yelling that \n     they were going to kill us. We backed off a little bit and \n     then left because we could see that it could turn into a \n     blood-bath.''\n       The good news is that ringleaders of the hate groups are \n     few. Nick Murnion believes there are no more than 30 around \n     Montana. Most refuse to pay taxes and obey the laws. They \n     should be arrested, tried and jailed. Otherwise, the \n     situation may worsen. As one prosecutor, County Attorney John \n     Bohlman, says: ``The more the Federal and local law \n     enforcement agencies behave with a hands-off attitude, the \n     more bold and daring these groups become.''\n       But law enforcement is only part of it. Casual adherents of \n     militias statewide are not criminals. And a united community \n     can deal with them by taking a stand against hate.\n       Americans have the right to say what they believe. But with \n     that right comes the responsibility to respect our neighbors, \n     respect law enforcement and obey the laws.\n       In November 1993, a group of skinheads threw a bottle \n     through the glass door of a Jewish family's in Billings. A \n     few days later, they put a brick through a window of another \n     Jewish household; a 5-year-old boy was in the room at the \n     time.\n       In response, Billings rallied behind the Jewish community. \n     The Billings Gazette printed a full-page drawing of a \n     menorah, and people all over town pasted them in their \n     windows. We held our biggest Martin Luther King Day march \n     ever in February. And the skinheads fled.\n       The same treatment will work this time. Americans \n     everywhere must speak out.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate the White House \nConference on Aging which, as I understand it, just this afternoon \npassed a resolution that I ask unanimous consent be made part of the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Protecting Medicare and Medicaid\n\n       Whereas Congress is beginning an historic debate on \n     Medicare and Medicaid as the 1995 White House Conference on \n     Aging deliberates on its recommendations to the Nation;\n       Whereas U.S. health care cost and coverage shortcomings \n     continue to go unaddressed;\n       Whereas health care reform and the solvency of the Medicare \n     Trust Fund are inextricably intertwined;\n       Whereas the opening session of the Conference heard \n     statements of support for Medicare and Medicaid from both \n     Democratic and Republican members of Congress; and\n       Whereas the President in his address challenged the \n     delegates to come together on a multigenerational, bipartisan \n     basis to address the problems facing the nation. Therefore, \n     be it,\n       Resolved by the 1995 White House Conference on Aging to \n     support policies that:\n       Address problems facing the Medicare and Medicaid programs \n     in the context of broad-based health care reform, as the \n     President has proposed;\n       Oppose massive cuts soon to be considered in Congress;\n       Protect Medicare and Medicaid from any steps backwards by \n     way of reduced health care or long term care coverage;\n       Apply any savings that may come from changes in Medicare \n     and Medicaid as a result of health care reform to strengthen \n     the programs and expand coverage, including long term care, \n     rather than to meet arbitrary deficit reduction targets;\n       Prohibit additional costs being put on beneficiaries that \n     would make health care unaffordable;\n       Maintain quality, preserve choice of provider and oppose \n     proposals that have the effect of financially coercing \n     beneficiaries into plans that do not guarantee access to \n     their own physicians;\n       Prohibit the use of savings in Medicare and Medicaid for \n     tax cuts for well off citizens.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the resolution is entitled ``Protecting \nMedicare and Medicaid.''\n  The important part of the resolution simply says:\n\n       Therefore, be it Resolved by the 1995 White House \n     Conference on Aging to support policies that:\n       Address problems facing the Medicare and Medicaid programs \n     in the context of broad-based health care reform, as the \n     President has proposed;\n       Oppose massive cuts soon to be considered in Congress;\n       Prohibit the use of savings in Medicare and Medicaid for \n     tax cuts for well-off citizens.\n\n  I think it is very important that everyone understand the \nramifications of the proposals to cut Medicare in the budget \nresolution. It would simply be the largest insurance rate hike in \nMedicare history. The plan would cost $900 per person in additional \nout-of-pocket expenses for Medicare recipients by the year 2002, a \ntotal of about $3,500 over the next 7 years. We cannot accept that. I \ndo not believe that the vast majority of the American people will \naccept it. Certainly, if this resolution is any indication, senior \ncitizens across the country, represented by the White House Conference \non Aging, will not accept it as part of our budget, as part of any plan \nrelating to Medicare reform this year.\n  So I am very pleased with the action taken by the White House \nconference. I hope we can talk more about that in the coming days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6224-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6224-S6225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REMEMBERING VIETNAM 20 YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE WAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on April 24, 1964, Sergeant First Class \nRaymond Adams, a 10-year Army veteran, was killed by a hand grenade in \nSouth Vietnam. Sergeant Adams was 30 years old and married. More than 8 \nyears later, on July 21, 1972, Specialist Fifth Class Steven Allen \nTrant died in South Vietnam. He was 21 years old, and had been in the \nArmy less than a year.\n  They were the first, and the last South Dakotans to die in Vietnam. \nIn between their too early deaths, our country was changed utterly.\n  More than 3 million Americans served in Vietnam. Hundreds of \nthousands were injured, some permanently, and more than 58,000 young \nAmericans died in the war.\n  Today, 20 years after the last helicopter lifted off the roof of the \nAmerican embassy in Saigon we pause to say thank you to all of the men \nand women who served in that long, sad war and to remember those who \ndid not return.\n  One of the most important ways we can show our thanks, of course, is \nby making sure Vietnam veterans get the medical care and compensation \nthey need for injuries they suffered in that war.\n  Every man or woman who puts on a uniform is at risk of harm. They \naccept that risk as part of their service. In return, we, as a nation, \nmust accept responsibility to care for men and women if they are harmed \nduring their military service.\n  Congress took a big step toward fulfilling that responsibility to \nVietnam veterans in 1991 when we agreed to allow Vietnam veterans to \nreceive compensation for nine different illnesses and disabilities \ncaused by their exposure to agent orange.\n  The National Academy of Sciences is now investigating possible links \nbetween agent orange exposure and other illnesses. I suspect that \nadditional illnesses will be added to the list of ailments for which \nVietnam veterans may be compensated in the future, and I support the \nAcademy in its continuing research.\n  It doesn't matter whether a wound is inflicted with a bullet or a \npiece of [[Page S6225]] shrapnel or a toxic defoliant. In each case, \nthe wound is real, and so is our obligation to help the veteran who \nsuffers it.\n  We also need more research into our health concerns of Vietnam vets.\n  In all, more than 682,000 Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans are now \ndisabled as a result of their military service.\n  And a respected study by the independent Research Triangle institute \nestimates that more than 960,000 men who fought in Vietnam and 1,900 \nwomen--nearly one in three Vietnam veterans--suffer from post-traumatic \nstress disorder. For some, the effects are few and fleeting. For \nothers, they are chronic and debilitating.\n\n  So as we mark this 20th anniversary of the end of our Nation's most \npainful period this century, let us remember the words of Abraham \nLincoln as he spoke them in his second inaugural to the Nation still \ngrieving from another terrible war that divided our Nation. He said:\n\n       Let us strive to finish the work that we are in, to bind up \n     the Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle and for his widow and orphan, to do all which may \n     achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace.\n\n  Let us show our thanks to Vietnam veterans this week, next week, and \nat all times in the future by pledging to give the Department of \nVeterans Affairs the resources it needs to keep the promises we made to \nall Vietnam veterans.\n  Let us show our thanks by strengthening community-based veterans \nhealth care centers, by making a commitment to keep veterans centers \nvital and independent. These centers do not duplicate the work of VA \nhospitals. They serve different people with different needs, and we \nought to maintain them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is time for this Nation to move toward \nnormalizing relations with Vietnam. I know the arguments against \nnormalization, and I sympathize with them. I understand that the \nprospect of restoring diplomatic ties with Vietnam is painful to many \nAmericans, especially those who have friends and family members among \nthose who remain unaccounted for in Vietnam.\n  Experience has shown that it is precisely by expanding our ties with \nVietnam that we are most likely to learn what happened to soldiers who \nnever returned.\n  In the years when we had no contact with Vietnam, we made no progress \non the question of those missing in action.\n  So I stand with my colleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Bond, Senator \nKerry of Massachusetts, and others on both sides of the aisle in urging \nthat we move cautiously toward a fuller dialog with Vietnam in order to \nsecure answers for the families and healing for our Nation.\n  We can never repay Sgt. Raymond Adams and Specialist Steven Trant or \nany of the other 58,000 Americans who lost their lives in Vietnam, but \nwe can show our respect and our gratitude, and we can continue the \neffort to bind up the Nation's wounds from a war that, in some ways, \nstill divides us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/05/senate-section/article/S6224-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 761\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
