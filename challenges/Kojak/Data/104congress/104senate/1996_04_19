Mr. President, the resolution just agreed to expresses the \nsense of the Senate on this first anniversary of the tragic Oklahoma \nCity bombing that took 168 lives. One of the provisions of the \nresolution is that the Senate join with the Nation in observing a \nmoment of silence at 9:02 a.m. central daylight time.

Mr. President, I now ask that the entire resolution be \nread.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The resolution will be read.\n  The Secretary of the Senate read as follows:\n\n       Whereas, on Wednesday, April 19, 1995, at 9:02 a.m. Central \n     Daylight Time, a bomb exploded at the Alfred P. Murrah \n     Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, collapsing the \n     north face of this nine-story building, killing 168 men, \n     women, and children and injuring scores of other innocent \n     victims;\n       Whereas, today, Friday, April 19, 1996, marks the one-year \n     anniversary of this tragic event which is without equal in \n     our nation's history;\n       Whereas, in the words of the Reverend Billy Graham to the \n     families and survivors, ``Someday the wounds will heal, and \n     someday those who thought they could sew chaos and discord \n     will be brought to justice. The wounds of this tragedy are \n     deep, but the courage and the faith and determination of the \n     people of Oklahoma City are even deeper'';\n       Whereas, this was the deadliest terrorist attack ever on \n     U.S. soil; and\n       Whereas, the United States Senate passed by an overwhelming \n     margin the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act on \n     Wednesday, April 17, 1996; Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States:\n       Observes a moment of silence at 9:02 a.m. Central Daylight \n     Time in remembrance of the innocent children and adults who \n     lost their lives or were injured in this heinous attack one \n     year ago;\n       Remembers the families, friends, and loved ones of those \n     whose lives were taken away by this abhorrent act;\n       Salutes the people of Oklahoma for the courage, faith and \n     determination they have exhibited throughout the past year;\n       Commends the rescuers, federal agencies and countless \n     volunteers who gave of themselves and their resources to \n     provide aid and relief;\n       Commends the federal employees from across the nation who \n     came to the aid of their co-workers during this crisis; and\n       Reaffirms its trust in our system of justice to ensure that \n     the perpetrators of this heinous crime be convicted and \n     appropriately punished so that justice may be served and \n     carried out swiftly.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have long been inspired by the Kansas \nState motto: ``To the Stars Through Difficulties.''\n  The people of Oklahoma have persevered this past year through almost \nunimaginable difficulties with grace, with grit, and with courage. Our \nthoughts and prayers will remain with them as they continue to reach \nfor the stars.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, we look back from the \ndistance of a year's time to a tragic event without equal in our \nNation's history. It is still almost impossible to believe that it \nactually happened--that such an abhorrent, evil act could have been \ncommitted in the heartland of America.\n  However, Oklahomans did not suffer through this tragedy alone. The \nsheer enormity of it drew the entire Nation to our side. People \nthought, ``If something like this could happen in Oklahoma City, it \ncould happen anywhere.''\n  It was that awareness, I believe, coupled with the innate goodness of \nthe American people that brought the flood of rescuers from all corners \nof the Nation. They came as strangers and left as friends. We will \nnever forget them. They made us know we were not alone.\n  I know for many this first awful anniversary brings back the pain \nwith a fresh intensity. But we should also recall the words of the \nReverend Billy Graham who, at a memorial service in the aftermath of \nthis evil deed, gave us hope.\n  He said, ``Someday the wounds will heal, and someday those who \nthought they could sow chaos and discord will be brought to justice. \nThe wounds of this tragedy are deep, but the courage and the faith and \ndetermination of the people of Oklahoma City are even deeper.''\n  He was right.\n  We are introducing this sense-of-the-Senate resolution today because \nwe remember. This resolution calls for a moment of silence at 9:02 a.m. \ncentral daylight time in remembrance of the innocent children and \nadults who lost their lives one year ago.\n  We remember the families, friends, and loved ones of those innocent \nvictims, and we send you our sincerest prayers.\n  We remember the countless hundreds who were injured, physically and \nemotionally by the blast.\n  We remember the many more from all corners of the state and all \ncorners of the Nation who came together to help in the rescue process \nand then in the healing process.\n  And we also are introducing this resolution because we recognize and \npay tribute to the spirit of recovery, courage, and faith that has been \nan example and an encouragement to everyone.\n  I have never been more proud to be an Oklahoman.\n  In honor of those who lost their lives, I ask that their names be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  The names are as follows:\n\n                  Victims of the Oklahoma City Bombing\n\n\n        Names                                                      Ages\nCharles E.

Mr. President, the 1-year anniversary of the \nbombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City reminds us of \nmany things. We recall the emotional shock and grief. We visualize the \nphysical destruction and devastation. We revisit the still unanswered \nquestions: Why this terrible deed and why Oklahoma, of all places?\n  But at the same time, we must also remember the remarkable flowering \nof\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nthe true spirit of our great Nation. In the wake of unspeakable pain \nand adversity, there came extraordinary acts of heroism, compassion, \nand voluntarism. There came a unity of purpose and strength of faith \nfew would have believed possible.\n  We were moved beyond words by the outpouring of help and assistance \nwhich came without solicitation from friends far and wide, from caring \nindividuals, public servants, private organizations, and communities \nthroughout Oklahoma and throughout America. We were reminded what a \ntruly great country this is and how blessed we are here in the land of \nthe free and the home of the brave.\n  On behalf of all of us in Oklahoma, thank you, America. Thank you for \nhelping. Thank you for caring. Thank you for being there in this most \ndifficult time of need.\n  Nothing anyone can do will erase the indelible scars, pain, and loss \nthat innocent citizens in our State have suffered. But the memories of \nthe generosity and compassion displayed by so many will live in our \nhearts forever.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me now yield to my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator.\n  I join my colleague, the majority leader, in his prayers for the \nfamilies of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing and the entire \nAmerican family for the great tragedy that event caused to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3695-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REMEMBERING THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN BOSNIA\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. At this time, Mr. President, I also call upon my \ncolleagues and the American people to offer a prayer in behalf of the \nlate Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, and the 34 others who died with \nhim that tragic day in Bosnia. They were serving our Nation. They were \npursuing the goals of peace, and their deaths all came too soon. \nBecause of those losses, as a country we have lost so much.\n  I appreciate the majority leader giving us this opportunity to \nexpress our great sympathy and condolences to their families and again \nto give us a chance to reaffirm the mission; that they have all given \ntheir lives in pursuit of the higher goals of our Nation.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I now ask, in response to the statement by my colleague \nfrom Illinois, that we now observe a moment of silence in honor of the \nmemory of Ron Brown and others who died in that tragic accident.\n  [A period of silence.]\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the investigation which \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence has undertaken at the majority \nleader's request regarding allegations that the administration may have \nsecretly acquiesced in or facilitated Iranian arms shipments to the \nBosnian Moslems in 1994 and 1995, in violation of stated United States \npolicy. This is a serious request made by a Senator long involved with \nUnited States policy in Bosnia. Some have said this request was made \nfor political reasons. Perhaps that is the case. But there is also \nsufficient reason to believe the Senator from Kansas would have made \nthis request regardless of the political climate or season.\n  The Intelligence Committee begins this task with a solid base of \ninformation because we received some, but not all, of the intelligence \navailable to the administration at the time the Iranian arms shipments \nwere occurring. Our committee has been reviewing and adding to that \ninformation base in the 2 weeks since Chairman Specter received the \nmajority leader's request. We are well positioned to do a through job \nfor the Senate on the sensitive intelligence issues surrounding this \nmatter, particularly the question of whether or not the administration \nconducted a covert action without informing Congress.\n  In addition to our familiarity with the topic, the Intelligence \nCommittee is also likely to do a good job on its part of this \ninvestigation because we are a bipartisan committee. In setting the \nstrength and composition of the committee, the Senate directed, in \nSenate Resolution 400, that our membership be close to balance at nine \nmajority members and eight minority, regardless of the composition of \nthe Senate floor, and that the senior minority member function as a \nvice chairman, not as a ranking member. In creating the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Senate clearly believed that intelligence was too \nsensitive to be overseen in a partisan, adversarial manner. Chairman \nSpecter approaches his leadership duties on the committee in that \nnonpartisan spirit, and so do I.\n  The history of this committee is replete with conduct like that of \nSenators Cohen and Warner, Boren, Nunn, Moynihan, and others, who have \ncome to this committee and said we are not going to serve in a partisan \nfashion. We are not going to answer the call of our party, we are going \nto answer the call of our country. The present and future course of \nthis committee should as well.\n  Open allegations against the administration, and a requirement to \ninvestigate those allegations, can strain even the most sincere \ncommitment to bipartisanship. Those strains have not\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\nyet been felt in the Intelligence Committee in this case. Chairman \nSpecter and I have tasked a single group of professional staff to \nsupport all committee members and all information which comes into the \ncommittee's hands will be shared equally with all members. This is the \nway we have always operated.\n  As for myself, I don't see the vice chairman's role to be an advocate \nof the administration. As we pursue questions, I will not be a \nDemocratic Senator defending fellow Democrats, but rather a U.S. \nSenator following the facts wherever they lead and reaching a \nconclusion based on those facts. I am confident Chairman Specter feels \nthe same way about his role.\n  I spoke of the Intelligence Committee's readiness to do a thorough \njob. Our thoroughness will be improved if we get all the relevant \ninformation from the administration. As many colleagues are aware, the \ncommittee has been denied the opportunity to read the intelligence \noversight board's report on this case. The implication is clear that if \nwe subpoena the report, the President will assert executive privilege.\n\n  The intelligence oversight board is wholly within the Executive \nOffice of the President, so there may be legitimate executive privilege \nhere. But if the report is off limits to Congress, then the \nadministration should not cite the report as having determined that no \ncovert action occurred. The administration can't have it both ways. \nThey should either give Congress the report, or stop citing it as \nvindication.\n  An Associated Press story yesterday quoted a White House spokeswoman, \nMary Ellen Glynn, saying, ``the point is not to withhold information. \nThe point is to protect sources.'' Mr. President, this rationale for \ndenying information to Congress has no basis. The Intelligence \nCommittee has received and stored the most highly classified material \nfor years, and its record for protecting sources and methods is far \nbetter than that of the executive branch. So security is simply no \nexcuse, and an invalid reason to deny information to Congress. My \nadvice to the administration is, fully inform Congress.\n  The committee lacks all the facts, but on the basis of what we have, \nI do not see evidence of a covert action. But I stress that is a \npreliminary assessment and not a conclusion. I am open to the evidence. \nCertainly, if there was a covert action, Congress should have been \ninformed, and the Intelligence Committee received no such information. \nIf press reports are correct, in later 1994 CIA Director Woolsey sensed \nfrom information he was getting from CIA channels that a United States \ncovert action, an action he and presumably other CIA personnel were not \nprivy to, was in progress in Croatia. Director Woolsey reportedly came \nto the White House with his concerns. The Intelligence Committee needs \nto know what evidence was the basis of Director Woolsey's concerns. We \nalso need to know why he did not share his concerns with the oversight \ncommittees.\n  Mr. President, my interest in getting to the bottom of this case is \nnot based solely on the majority leader's request. In my view, if the \npress reports are correct, the United States chose a course of action \nin Croatia and Bosnia with very serious down-side risks. The Bosnian \nsituation was and is exceptionally complex and presented few good \noptions to policymakers. But our alignment with Iran, even if it was a \npassive and accidental alignment, was very dangerous. Every President \nsince Jimmy Carter has declared a state of emergency with respect to \nIran, and United States laws and Executive orders have embargoed \nimports from Iran, limited United States exports to Iran, banned United \nStates trade and investment in Iran including the trading of Iranian \noil overseas by United States companies or their foreign affiliates, \nand placed sanctions on persons or countries who supply Iran with any \ngoods or technologies that could contribute to Iran getting \ndestabilizing conventional weapons or any weapons of mass destruction \ntechnology. These laws and Executive orders are there for a reason: to \ncontain and isolate a country which conducts and supports terrorism and \nattempts to proliferate nuclear and chemical weapons. A policy which \ndepends on such an amoral country to arm the otherwise defenseless \nBosnian Moslems is dangerous--not merely politically dangerous, but \npotentially threatening to our allies and eventually to our own forces, \nwhen they deployed a year later. To turn a blind eye to Iranian \nshipments is to turn a blind eye to the possibility of United States \ncasualties at the hands of the very people we have allowed to be armed, \nespecially with a United States deployment imminent.\n  Critics of this policy have to admit an inconvenient fact: risky as \nit was, the policy worked. Our allies did not pull their forces \nsummarily out of the former Yugoslavia, which they might have done if \nwe had unilaterally lifted the arms embargo. The Bosnian Moslems were \nnot overwhelmed; in fact, they defended themselves creditably and even \nwent on the offensive. The policy brought about a balance which made \npossible the Dayton Accords and the peace which IFOR is enforcing \ntoday.\n  But even though the administration's risky Bosnia policy has worked, \nat least so far, the Intelligence Committee is obligated to investigate \nwhatever may have been the United States role in the Iranian arms \nshipment. I take that obligation very seriously, and I look forward to \njoining with my chairman in rendering a full report.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues from \nAlaska and Georgia for yielding me a moment. I compliment my \ndistinguished colleague from Nebraska for his eloquent statement. I \nthink it is very important, as Senator Kerrey has outlined, the \nbipartisan, nonpartisan nature of the Intelligence Committee being \nemphasized.\n  As Senator Kerrey, I approach this investigation with a total open \nmind and no predisposition and determination to see the inquiry is \ntotally nonpolitical, bipartisan, nonpartisan, as we take a look at the \nshipment of Iranian arms to the Bosnian Moslems.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair and my colleague.\n  Mr. President, on the eve of Earth Day, I want to alert Members of \nlegislation that I will be introducing to help raise funds from the \nprivate sector to support our national parks, particularly with regard \nto repair. In this regard, I think it is appropriate that we thank the \nthousands of people and organizations who are answering the call to \nhelp repair and preserve an important part of this Nation's past and \nfuture: the historic C Canal.\n  That canal extends 184 miles between Cumberland, MD, and Georgetown \nin the District of Columbia. The C Canal National Historic Park is a \nmajor recreation attraction and a part of our national heritage. As we \nknow, the flooding of the Potomac River in the blizzard of 1996 has \ntaken a heavy toll. Repairs require funds at a time when our Federal \nbudget is already stretched to the hilt.\n  That is where the sweat and ingenuity of the private sector is going \nto come in. Let me tell you about it, because it is going to come in a \nbig way.\n  In the spirit of Earth Day, which asks every one of us to do what he \nor she can to help make the Earth a better place, people and \norganizations are rising to the challenge and giving their money, time, \nand effort.\n  The National Parks and Conservation Association, with the help of \nWRC-TV Channel 4 and others, has organized and publicized tomorrow's \nMarch for Parks along the canal route. The purpose is to raise funds \nfor the canal. These organizations have done an outstanding job on the \nproject and thousands of dollars are already pouring in. They are doing \na wonderful service to the Nation.\n  In an effort to keep these private donations coming in, I am today \nannouncing the introduction of legislation which will help raise as \nmuch as $100 million in each year in support of our national parks, \nspecifically for repairs.\n  First, the legislation will revitalize and expand the scope of the \noperation\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\nof the National Park Foundation so it can work with the private sector \nto raise additional funds for parks. It would encourage business \nrelationships similar to those engaged by the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation and the National Forest Foundation.\n  Second, it will grant the sort of authority already enjoyed by the \nU.S. Olympic Committee to sanction appropriate private sponsorship of \nthe parks.\n  Third, each year publishing, advertising, movie making, and similar \npursuits make use of the intellectual property and assets of our \nnational parks with virtually no return to the parks. Reform is needed \nto enable the Park Service, through the National Park Foundation, to \ncapture some of the potential income through licensing and other \nmarketing agreements.\n  Fourth, the legislation will contain safeguards to negate improper \ncommercialization of our parks, but it will allow new revenue-generated \nopportunities outside the parks in partnership with the private sector.\n\n  The National Park Foundation was created by Congress in 1967 as an \nofficial nonprofit partner of the National Park Service. It serves as a \nvehicle for donors who want to contribute with the assurance that gifts \nwill be carefully managed and used wholly and exclusively for the \npurpose specified by the donor. It is governed by a board of civic and \ndistinguished leaders committed to helping the parks, with the \nSecretary of the Interior serving as chairman, and the Director of the \nPark Service serving as secretary. None of this is going to change, Mr. \nPresident.\n  During the last 5 years, the foundation has made over $10 million in \ngrants to our national parks, but the changes contained in my \nlegislation will empower it to contribute much more for the repair and \npreservation of the C Canal and other elements of our park system.\n  Obviously, none of this will or should detract from the Federal \nGovernment's or the Park Service's responsibility to our parks. The \ngoal is to augment that involvement with additional private funds, much \nlike those currently being raised by the March for Parks, and I commend \nthe Secretary of the Interior for his effort in this regard.\n  Finally, we need the private sector, including those for-profit \norganizations who have used the National Park Service facilities and \nproperty and given little or nothing in return to help sustain our \nparks for the future.\n  The private sector can help by providing additional funds for \nresource management and infrastructure repair required in our parks \nacross the Nation.\n  The C Canal National Historical Park and our other park units \nacross the Nation connect us to our past and provide us with a vision \nof the future. They are some of the most beautiful and historic parcels \nof land to be found. In the spirit of Earth Day and American generosity \nand philanthropy, it is time for us to make the effort to meet the \nchallenge.\n  Thanks to the NPCA, WRC-TV and the thousands of marchers and \nvolunteers who tomorrow will be helping to show us the way. In the \nspirit of Earth Day, I ask for each Senator's help in passing this \nlegislation to help our parks, and I commend our leader, Senator Dole, \nfor supporting this.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my friend from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3698-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A TRAGIC ASSAULT: DRUG USE AMONG TEENAGERS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this morning we gathered in the Senate \nChamber to remember a very solemn moment in American history: the \nneedless loss of 168 citizens in Oklahoma City. It reminds me of \nanother tragic assault that goes on against the youth of our country on \na day-to-day basis.\n  In the last 36 months, drug use among our teenagers 8 to 15 years of \nage has doubled, and we are in the midst of a new epidemic. What does \nthat mean? That means that nearly 2 million--2 million--American youth \nhave been ensnared in the assault by the drug lords of this hemisphere \nand their lives are potentially ruined, devastated and stunted.\n  Not only will their lives be impaired and ruined, but a chain of \nevents will follow because as these youngsters are consumed by drugs, \nthey are driven into a life of crime, an effect on our Nation which is \nimmeasurable.\n  Of the 35,000 prisoners in Georgia this morning, 80 percent of them \nare there today because of drug-related offenses. The impact of this \nwar, this assault on the youth of our country is having a devastating \nimpact across the land as it drives crime, assault and battery, murder, \ntheft, robbery, burglary.\n  Mr. President, I spent a few minutes with President Zedillo of Mexico \nnot long ago. He said the drug war was the single greatest threat to \nhis country. I said, ``I agree with you, Mr. President, with one \namendment. The drug war is the single greatest threat to this \nhemisphere of democracies, to all of our nations in this hemisphere of \ndemocracies.''\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of a drug task force and \neminent figure in this issue and assault on the youth of our country. I \nyield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3699-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3699-S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PRESIDENT CLINTON'S JUDICIAL NOMINEES SOFT ON CRIME\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we do remember what happened 1 \nyear ago in Oklahoma City, a very horrible crime. People are concerned \nabout crime in America. People expect the Congress of the United States \nto do something about crime. We have this week taken a giant step by \npassing the antiterrorism bill that the President says he will sign.\n  So I rise this morning to talk about crime as the Senator from \nGeorgia indicated. The war on drugs has a lot to do with the whole \nsubject of crime, but I also want to make some reference to the \nnegative effect that this administration has had on the Federal courts.\n  I think it is fair to say that President Clinton's judicial \nappointments communicate the President's vision of the kind of America \nthat the President would like to have. I do not share his soft-on-crime \nvision. I do not think most Americans do. Mr. President, you can say \nthat you are putting all the cops on the streets all you want, but \nunless you appoint Federal judges who will enforce the law and protect \nvictims over criminals, all the cops in the world will not make any \ndifference.\n  In regard to the appointments that the President made, I read with \namusement in this morning's Washington Post where Vice President Gore \nattempted to defend President Clinton's record on judicial nominations. \nI believe that the Vice President's efforts fall far short. For \ninstance, one of his primary arguments is that this administration's \nnominees have enjoyed more support from the American Bar Association \nthan the last three administrations. Mr. President, this just goes to \nshow how out of touch the Vice President is with the American people \nand with even the President's own appointees.\n  President Clinton has a powerful ally in his judicial jihad to \nprotect criminals, and that happens to be the American Bar Association, \nbecause somehow the ABA mysteriously and without input from the \nAmerican people set itself up as the ultimate arbiter of who should or \nshould not be a judge. The ABA happens to share the President's own \nfrightening vision of criminals' rights over victims' rights.\n\n  We just passed a very fair and balanced antiterrorism bill in this \nbody. That bill contained habeas corpus reform, badly needed, to permit \nprisoners just one bite at the apple and to limit that bite in order to \nstop frivolous and successive postconviction appeals that allowed \npeople to stay on death row for 10 to 15 years. Vice President Gore \nuses the ABA as a mantle to say that the President's judges are ideal \nappointees. Yet the American Bar Association strongly opposes these \nnecessary anticrime provisions that were in the antiterrorism bill.\n  Unfortunately, I believe that the current administration has then \ndone a disservice to the American people by gathering liberal activists \nfrom every coffee house and every street corner in America and \nnominating them to some of the most important and influential Federal \ncourts in America.\n  Few Americans would dispute and few in this body dispute the fact \nthat\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\nin the arena of criminal justice, the legacy of the Earl Warren Supreme \nCourt of the 1960's and 1970's has been devastating. Violent criminals \nwho have committed heinous, shocking crimes are routinely freed on \nbogus technicalities first invented during the Earl Warren period. We \nare still paying that price. These violent individuals go back out on \nthe streets and commit even more crimes and victimizing more people.\n  Until the President came on to the scene, I thought that we had \nturned a corner on that sort of Warren Court thinking. I had thought \nthere was a broad consensus that law enforcement should not have their \nhands tied by highly technical rules. I had thought that there was a \nbroad consensus that serving time in prison for committing crimes \nshould be punishment and not a blissful vacation at taxpayers' expense.\n  But, Mr. President, I was wrong. President Clinton has sent up a \nnumber of law professors and liberal activists to sit on the Federal \nbench and impose their preconceived, unrealistic ideas on the rest of \nAmerica. Now, a simple fact of American Government: Bad judges are \nworse than even bad Presidents, because we can vote bad Presidents out \nof office, but we are stuck with bad judges for life. We cannot send \nthem back to their coffee houses and street corners. To be honest, the \nRepublican-controlled Senate has been somewhat to blame, as we trusted \nthe President to do the right thing. But now with this record, Mr. \nPresident, I think it is time that we start giving judicial nominees \nthe scrutiny that they obviously deserve.\n\n  We have been lax, in deference to the President. But that needs to \nend given his poor performance of nominating judges intent upon \nprotecting criminals over victims' rights. Of course, we in the Senate \nhave a right under the Constitution to comment on the direction the \ncountry is taking and how the courts have played a role in this. So the \nconcept of the separation of powers remains untouched and intact and \nalive and well.\n  Take a good, hard look at some of the President's more notable \njudges. In the first circuit Judge Sandra Lynch overturned a life \nsentence imposed for a brutal murder. This is a pattern that we see \nover and over again--liberal, soft-on-crime, Clinton judges lending \nconvicted felons a hand.\n  In the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Guido Calabresi \ndissented from an opinion which denied a prisoner the right to receive \npornography in his jail cell. This is another theme with Clinton \njudges, making sure that prisoners have all the amenities that they \nwant. The logic must be that prison should not be too uncomfortable or \ntoo difficult.\n  In the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge H. Lee Sarokin has \nissued a few zingers. This judge has ruled that prisoners have a \nconstitutional right to prevent prison officials from opening and \ninspecting mail. This judge has voted to overturn the death sentences \nof two murderers who brutally ended the lives of two elderly couples.\n  In the fourth circuit, Judge Blane Michael argued in a dissenting \nopinion that a criminal who had tried to murder a Federal prosecutor \ncould not be found guilty under Federal statute prohibiting the mailing \nof a bomb to Federal officials because the bomb was poorly made and \nunlikely to actually explode. Mr. President, how could this judge have \ndone any more to help that criminal?\n  In the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, District Judge Robert Parker \nruled that it was unconstitutional for the police to search for hidden \nmarijuana plants by using an infrared device. Mr. President, what more \ncould drug dealers ask for to help them?\n  In the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Rosemary Barkett \nwrote an opinion granting a hearing for a man who had been convicted of \nsetting his former girlfriend's house on fire and killing her two \nchildren.\n  Lest anyone think that the President has seen the errors of his ways \nand will start putting more mainstream judges on the Federal bench, let \nus look at a nonconfirmed nominee to the eleventh circuit. At his \nrecent judiciary confirmation hearing, Mr. Stack was asked what he \nthought of the applicable law of search and seizure law relative to the \nnow infamous New York case in which Judge Baer initially suppressed \nevidence of millions of dollars worth of illegal drugs.\n\n  Mr. Stack was unable to cite even the most fundamental criminal law \nprecedents. In fact, his only comment that he made was that he would \n``applaud the use of all evidence * * * legally obtained in the \ncourtroom'' but would not want to ``throw * * * away the constitutional \nguarantees that each of us in America is afforded.'' I do not believe \nthis is a response worthy of a Federal circuit court nominee. This is \nunacceptable from a circuit court nominee who is supposed to have the \nnecessary credentials and qualifications for appointment to the Federal \nbench.\n  Next to the Supreme Court, the Federal court of appeals is the most \nimportant court in the country. It appears as though Mr. Stack's \nqualifications for the eleventh circuit post has been based solely on \nraising $11 million for President Clinton's 1992 Presidential campaign \nand another $3.4 million for the National Democratic Committee, and not \non Mr. Stack's legal capacity, his competence, or his temperament. If \nthis does not a least give the appearance of buying a Federal court \nseat, I do not know what does.\n  In fact, Mr. Stack has little, if no experience, in criminal law or \npractice before the Federal courts. He has no substantive legal \nwritings to speak of.\n\n  Further, Mr. Stack was surprisingly ignorant about recent \ndevelopments in the law. Mr. Stack was comfortable telling the Senators \nat his confirmation hearing that he would seek guidance from other \njudges and the Federal Judicial Center if he was not knowledgeable \nabout a particular area of law. So I look to him asking Judge Barkett, \nthat what she can teach him and mold him about Mr. Stack's views of \ncriminal law as a fierce defender of criminals--I think it is clear \nthat the American people find this extremely disturbing.\n  In conclusion, with Clinton-appointed judges, I think a pattern has \nemerged. In those rare circumstances when Clinton judges believe that \ncriminals should go to prison, they certainly want to make sure that \nprison is not too inconvenient. While Clinton judges write on and on \nabout the rights of prisoners, they are silent about the rights of \ncrime victims. That is why it is so important for the Senate to speak \nout to be the champions of the victims and not of the predators.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nthoughtful remarks. They were very eloquently presented.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3699-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3700-S3701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CRIME IN AMERICA\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. President, today all Americans will stop and remember the \nterrible tragedy that occurred 1 year ago today in Oklahoma City. We \nextend, all of us in the U.S. Congress and all over America, our \nprayers and our thoughts to those who lost family and friends in that \nsenseless tragedy.\n  Last week, Congress passed laws to make it harder for criminals to \ninflict the kind of terror we saw in Oklahoma City and at the New York \nWorld Trade Center before that. This antiterrorist law is just one \nsmall step toward taking back our cities, our towns, and our \ncommunities. Taking them back from dangerous and predator criminals who \nhave made us afraid to walk the streets at night, who have forced us to \nput bars on our windows, and who have caused us to place metal \ndetectors in our Federal buildings and in some public schools in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, one thing the law we just passed does is make it \nharder for prison inmates to file years and years of appeals that tie \nup our courts for years, dulling the sword of justice. Often, to many \nAmericans, it seems as if our court system cares more about criminals' \nrights than the rights of law-abiding citizens. But there is more the \nAmerican people expect of us. They have had enough of liberal judges \nwho think it is their responsibility to turn dangerous criminals out to \nsociety, when society would like to keep them behind bars. They are \ntired of a revolving-door justice system.\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\n  According to a recent study by the Bureau of Justice statistics, an \nincredible 94 percent of State prisoners are violent criminals or \nrepeat offenders.\n  I introduced legislation this year that is on its way to the \nPresident. It will permit the States to take back control of their \nprison systems away from Federal judges who are out of touch with the \neveryday concerns of working, law-abiding families. In my own State, \none Federal judge has taken it upon himself to say that prison cells in \nthe State prisons are too small and there is not enough recreation \nspace. What is his remedy? His remedy is to release prisoners early. As \na result, in Texas, violent criminals serve 6 months of every year of \ntheir sentences.\n  Mr. President, what we need is judges who understand it is not cruel \nand unusual punishment for a criminal who has a victim to endure a hot, \nuncomfortable jail cell without color TV, without his or her favorite \nfoods, without indoor and outdoor recreational facilities.\n  Mr. President, Americans are ready for a prison system that does not \nmore for prisoners, but less for prisoners and more for law-abiding \ncitizens. No prisoner should be eligible for early release or parole \nwho is not drug free, able to read, and trained in a skill that will \nenable that person to get a job outside. If you cannot function in \nsociety outside, you should remain inside the prison if you have not \nserved your time.\n  We should say very clearly to those who commit crimes and end up \nbehind bars, we want you to learn to cooperate with society. We want to \ngive you a chance. You are locked up because you did not cooperate with \nsociety and you have a victim.\n  The Speaker of the House said, ``We ought to require prisoners to \nwork 48 hours a week and study 12 hours a week. If we kept them busy 60 \nhours a week doing something positive, I think they would be different \npeople when they go out into the word. Recidivism would fall and \nvictims would be spared.''\n  Mr. President, what is the first and foremost responsibility of \nGovernment? The first and foremost responsibility is to provide law-\nabiding citizens the conditions to live freely. But for too long, the \nFederal Government and Federal judges have interfered with the \nresponsibility of States to meet their first responsibility to their \ncitizens. Texans and Americans all over this country have had enough. \nThey are tired of politicians and judges that blame society for crime. \nThey blame criminals for crime. They would like for Government to do \nthe same thing.\n\n  There were 10 million violent crimes in America in 1993. Those were \nthe ones that were reported. Mr. President, 100,000 criminals were sent \nto prison to serve time for violent crimes. What has happened to a \ncriminal justice system that imprisons 1 person in 100 for every \nviolent crime committed in this country?\n  Mr. President, we can put barricades in front of the White House, but \ntoo many Americans do not have that luxury. Ordinary citizens are faced \neach day with the threat of violent crime. They have had enough. They \nwant their streets back. They want their communities back.\n  Mr. President, I want to end with a recollection that I had 1 year \nago today. It was from a victim of the Oklahoma tragedy. I will never \nforget watching television, as so many of us in this country did, and I \nsaw this man, bandaged, his eyes swollen shut, you could not see \nanything else on his face, and a news reporter put a camera and a \nmicrophone in front of this victim. He was a man who had gotten up and \ngone to work that day. His life had blown up in front of him in just a \nfew short minutes. The reporter said, ``How do you feel?'' This man, \nthrough his bandages and his swollen eyes, said, ``I feel like I live \nin the greatest country on Earth, and I'm going to have to work harder \nto make it better.''\n  Mr. President, that victim's spirit will do more to return this \ncountry to its bearing than any laws that Congress could pass.\n  Our Nation's leaders must strive to do what is legally possible to \ngive our citizens a society in which they can go to work and raise \ntheir families freely.\n  But, Mr. President, even more important, our leaders should never \nforget the victims' spirit from Oklahoma City and all the people who \ncame to help after that tragedy in the great spirit of this country. We \nmust remember that spirit is what will rebuild this country, that is \nthe spirit on which this country's future is based.\n  We will provide the laws. We have done that. We have done that this \nweek and we must do more. But we must also come back to our bearings. \nWhat made this country great was people who love this country no matter \nwhat victimization they have had. They are going to work harder to make \nit better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Texas. As always, she is an eloquent voice on this subject, and I \nam most pleased that she could be here this morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank my friend and colleague from Georgia for putting \nthis time together this morning.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk this morning about the question of guns \nand criminals who use guns. We have debates--and often they are very \ncontentious debates--about a lot of issues concerning crime. We talk on \nthis floor about contentious issues, such as the Brady bill and assault \nweapons. And these are important issues. They are important. I happen \nto favor these bills. But I think we need to recognize what really is \nimportant, and we need to step back a little bit and talk about what \nreally makes a difference when we talk about what we do to deal with \nthe crime problem.\n  These two issues--the Brady bill and assault weapons--are highly \ncontentious. Second, frankly, they, at best, only have a marginal \nimpact on the problem. Third, they tend to attract somewhat overblown \nrhetoric, frankly, on both sides of the issue. I think both sides of \nthe Brady bill debate and both sides of the assault weapon debate \noveremphasize what the importance of this debate is.\n\n  I am, frankly, puzzled that we cannot seem to move forward on more \neffective proposals that everyone ought to favor--proposals that will \nreally make a difference. These proposals that I am talking about may \nnot be very exciting, but they are real, they work, they make a \ndifference, they make a difference out on the street.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that we, as a society, ought to do more \nto protect our citizens from armed career criminals. There are \npredators out there--predators, Mr. President--who are repeat violent \ncriminals who use a gun while committing a crime. We, as a society, \nhave to make a strong, effective response to this threat.\n  Mr. President, in this area, as in all areas of national concern, we \nreally need to be asking the following questions: One, what works? What \nreally makes a difference? Two, what level of Government should do this \nparticular job?\n  In the area of gun crimes, we have a pretty good answer. We have an \nanswer that is based on experience and based on history. Now, we all \nknow that there is some controversy over whether general restrictions \non gun ownership would help to reduce crime. But there is no \ncontroversy over whether taking guns away from felons would reduce \ncrime. Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative--I think everyone \ngets that, everyone understands it, and there should not be any \ncontroversy about it. If you take guns out of the hands of felons, you \nare going to reduce crime.\n  When it comes to felons, Mr. President, unilateral disarmament of the \nthugs is simply the best policy. Let us disarm the people who hurt \npeople. Although we can quibble about statistics, the facts are that \nthe vast majority of crimes in this country today, the vast majority of \nviolent crimes, the vast majority of crimes that hurt people are \ncommitted by a small number of the criminals. One estimate is that 70 \npercent of all violent crime in this country is committed by less than \n6 percent of the criminals, which is a relatively small number of \npeople.\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\n  And so what I say that we need to do, Mr. President, is to target the \nviolent career criminals, particularly those who use a gun to commit a \nfelony--target them, convict them, get them off the street, lock them \nup, and keep them locked up.\n\n  Mr. President, we have actually tried this, and we know it works. One \nof the most successful crime fighting initiatives of recent years was \nknown as Project Triggerlock. This project was wildly successful \nprecisely because it addressed a problem squarely head on, and it \nplaced the resources where they were most needed.\n  Let me talk for a moment and share with you the story about Project \nTriggerlock. The U.S. Justice Department began Project Triggerlock in \nMay 1991. The program targeted for prosecution in Federal court armed, \nviolent, repeat offenders. Under Project Triggerlock, U.S. attorneys \nthroughout the country turned to their local, State prosecutors and \nsaid this: ``If you catch a felon, and you catch that felon with a gun, \nand if you want us to, the U.S. attorneys, we, the Federal prosecutors, \nwill take over the prosecution for you. We will prosecute this \nindividual under Federal law--Federal law that many, many times, in \nregard to violent repeat offenders who use a gun in the commission of a \nfelony, is tougher than State law. We will prosecute this individual. \nWe will convict this individual, and we will hit this person with a \nstiff Federal mandatory sentence. And then we will lock him up in a \nFederal prison at no cost to the State or local community. Basically, \nwe will deep-six this guy, get him out of society. We will take the \ncost of prosecution and then we will pay to house him for 10, 15, 20 \nyears while he is out of society.''\n  That is the type of assistance to local communities that makes a \ndifference. That is what Project Triggerlock did. Triggerlock was an \nassault on the very worst criminals in America. Mr. President, it \nworked.\n  Listen to these figures. This program took 15,000--15,000--criminals \noff the streets in an 18-month period of time. Triggerlock caused a \ndramatic increase in Federal firearms prosecutions. In the first 12 \nmonths of Triggerlock, the program initiated firearms prosecutions \nagainst 6,454 defendants. It worked.\n  Now, incredibly, Mr. President--incredibly--the Clinton Justice \nDepartment has chosen to deemphasize Project Triggerlock. They tell us \nthey still have it; they just do not talk about it. Apparently, they do \nnot even keep the statistics on it. They do not make it a priority.\n  Mr. President, Project Triggerlock was the most effective Federal \nprogram in recent history for targeting and removing armed career \ncriminals. But the Clinton administration Justice Department, today, \nacts like Triggerlock simply does not exist. While the Clinton Justice \nDepartment says that Triggerlock remains important, the facts, the \nstatistics do not bear this out. They, apparently, no longer keep \nrecords on these prosecutions--and, I guess, for very good reason.\n  If you look at the records kept in Federal courts--go to the Federal \ncourts to get your statistics, here is what you learn: Since the advent \nof the Clinton administration we have seen a substantial decrease in \nthe prosecution for weapons and firearms offenses.\n\n  That is a shocking fact.\n  We also see a substantial decrease in actual convictions for these \nfirearm related offenses in Federal court.\n  Let us look at the numbers. In 1992, there were 4,501 prosecutions of \ngun criminal charges for these crimes. In 1993, the number of \nprosecutions dropped slightly to 4,348. But in 1994, the number plunged \nall the way down to 3,695. We should have been seeing an increase. \nInstead, we started going the wrong way. That is a 19-percent drop in \nweapons and firearms prosecutions in the Federal courts during the \nClinton administration--a 19-percent drop.\n  Mr. President, who in this country can believe that this is \njustified? Who in this country believes that the threat of gun \ncriminals to the society is less than it was 2 years ago? Clearly, it \nis not.\n  Mr. President, the number of total convictions for firearm-related \nprosecutions in Federal court has dropped as well. Again, let me go \nback to 1992. In 1992, 3,837 of these defendants were convicted. In \n1993, there was a drop, a drop to 3,814. But in 1994, we see a more \nsevere drop--down to 3,345. Again, instead of going up in prosecutions, \nwhich is what you would have expected, we see the trend lines going \ndown. Mr. President, that is going in exactly the wrong direction.\n  Last year, I introduced a crime bill that would have restored Project \nTriggerlock. It would have required a U.S. attorney in every \njurisdiction in this country to make a monthly report to the Attorney \nGeneral in Washington on the number of arrests, the prosecutions and \nconvictions that they had achieved in the previous month on gun-related \ndefenses. The Attorney General under my bill should then report \nsemiannually to the Congress on the work of these prosecutors. Then we \nwould know the information would be available.\n  It is like anything else. When you start counting, when you start \npublicizing the results, you start holding people accountable, and \npeople then respond.\n  Let me say that there are a lot of U.S. prosecutors who are doing a \ngood job in this area who on their own are emphasizing the prosecution \nof people with guns. But it should not just be left up to every U.S. \nattorney in the country to decide one way or the other. This should be \na national policy. It should be a national policy that is driven by the \nAttorney General and driven by the President of the United States. \nQuite frankly, nothing short of that, in my opinion, is acceptable.\n  The truth is that, like all prosecutors, U.S. attorneys have limited \nresources. So like all prosecutors, U.S. attorneys have to exercise \ndiscretion about whom to prosecute. We know that. We all recognize that \nCongress can and should not dictate to prosecutors whom they should \nprosecute. But it is clear that we as a Congress, that we as a Senate, \nshould go on record with the following proposition. There is nothing \nmore important in fighting crime than getting armed career criminals \noff the streets.\n  Mr. President, I think the Project Triggerlock is a very important \nway to keep the focus on the prosecution of gun crimes. Getting gun \ncriminals off the streets is a major national priority. I believe that \nwe should behave accordingly.\n  This is no time to turn our backs on a proven, promising mainstream \nanticrime initiative; an anticrime initiative that is not \ncontroversial, an anticrime initiative that would not tie up 5 minutes \nof debate on the Senate floor in regard to whether or not we should do \nit. Everyone understands that we need to do this. What we need is the \nwill from the executive branch to really reinstitute Project \nTriggerlock and make it work.\n  Mr. President, families who are living in crime-threatened \ncommunities need to know that we are going to do what it takes to get \nguns off their streets. We are going to go after the armed career \ncriminals. We are going to prosecute them, we are going to convict \nthem, we are going to lock them up, and we are going to keep them \nlocked up.\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this is why we have a Government in the \nfirst place--to protect the innocent, to keep ordinary citizens safe \nfrom violent predatory criminals.\n  I think Government needs to do a much better job at this very \nfundamental task, and it is inherently the fundamental task of the \nGovernment. That is why targeting the armed career criminal is such a \nmajor component of our national policy.\n  The Clinton administration, I believe, should reverse its opposition \nto Project Triggerlock, and should do so immediately.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for the time.

Mr. President, I want to thank our colleague from Georgia\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nfor leading this effort. We are always looking for good news in our war \non violent crime and the threat that it poses to our families. This \nmorning I want to share some good news. This good news is based on hard \nfacts presented in a major study done by the National Center for Policy \nAnalysis, which is located in my State. I think that when you listen to \nthe numbers, they speak as loudly and as clearly as a clap of thunder.\n  Five years ago, Texans finally had enough of violent crime, so we \nlaunched the largest prison building program in the history of the \nUnited States of America. Over a 4-year period, we expanded the size of \nthe Texas prison system from a 49,000 criminal capacity to a 150,000 \ncriminal capacity.\n  In terms of our population, Texas started out having a per capita \nviolent criminal incarceration rate that was roughly equal to the \nnational average. Four years later, we have the highest criminal \nincarceration rate of any State in the Union. I believe that this is a \ndirect result of building new prisons, putting people in jail, and \nbeginning to approach what we call ``truth in sentencing,'' so that \nwhen somebody is sentenced to prison for 10 years, they actually, \nhonest to God, serve 10 years in prison.\n  We have seen the following things happen in Texas in terms of \nexpected punishment for committing major crimes. Over the 6-year period \nbetween 1988 and 1994, the expected punishment in Texas for murder rose \nby 360 percent. For rape, the expected punishment rose by 266 percent; \nfor larceny, 167 percent; for aggravated assault, the expected \npunishment rose by 360 percent. For burglary, the expected punishment \nrose by 299 percent; for robbery, 220 percent; and for motor vehicle \ntheft, 222 percent.\n  In other words, we built prisons, we got tough, we sent people to \nprisons, and we extended the amount of time criminals actually spend in \nprison. What happened? Well, what happened is that the overall crime \nrate in Texas has fallen by 30-percent since 1988. Let me repeat that. \nWe increased the number of prison beds. We more than doubled the \nexpected punishment for crimes ranging from murder to car theft, we \nincreased the number of people in prison, and the crime rate fell by 30 \npercent.\n  Let me put that in more meaningful terms: As compared to 5 years ago \nwhen we started building prisons and putting violent criminals in \nprison in Texas--as compared to 1991--the 30-percent lower crime rate \nwe have today means that in this year alone, 1,140 people in Texas who, \nat the crime rate of 5 years ago would have been murdered in my State, \nwill not be murdered. It means that in 1996, 450,000 less serious \ncrimes will be committed than would have been committed had we not \ntripled the capacity of our prisons.\n  The lesson is very clear. We have a small number of violent predator \ncriminals who commit a huge percentage of our violent crimes. When you \nare willing to put them in jail and keep them there, the crime rate \nfalls.\n  The time has come for us to get serious at the Federal level. We have \nthree major statutes that criminalize prison labor. We are one of the \nfew countries in the world which cannot make people in prison work to \nproduce something that can be sold in order to help pay for the cost of \nincarceration. Three depression-years laws make it a crime to require \nprisoners work, make it a crime to sell what they produce, and make it \na crime to transport what is produced. In other words, we can require \ntaxpayers to work in order to pay for building and maintaining prisons, \nbut we cannot make prisoners work in order to do the same. We should \nrepeal those three statutes. We should turn our Federal prisons into \nindustrial parks. We should cut the cost of prison construction by \nstopping the building of prisons like Holiday Inns. We need to put \npeople in jail for violent crimes. We need to have sentences of 10 \nyears in prison without parole for possessing a firearm during the \ncommission of a violent crime or drug felony, 20 years for discharging \nit, and the death penalty for killing one of our neighbors.\n\n  If we do those things, we can end this wave of violence. We are \nallowing our fellow citizens to be brutalized by violent criminals \nbecause we will not do something about it. In Texas, we have shown that \nyou can do something about it and I would like us to follow that lead \nat the Federal level. I commend the National Center for Policy Analysis \nfor conducting this study which was released in January of this year. \nEvery Member of Congress should read this study and I would be happy to \nsupply it to anyone who is interested in doing so.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for listening.\n  Let me now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan [Mr. \nAbraham].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3702-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3703-S3705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONTROL OF PRISONS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I should like to pick up on some of the \ntopics which the Senator from Texas was discussing and particularly \nfocus on one aspect of the Republican agenda on crime, prison reform. I \nwould like today to discuss the proposals we Senate Republicans have \ndeveloped under the leadership of the majority leader, Senator Dole, to \nend frivolous lawsuits brought by prisoners, to remove our prisons from \nthe control of Federal judges, and return control over them to our \nState and local officials.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by outlining the problem. In 1995, 65,000 \nprisoner lawsuits were filed in Federal courts alone. To put that in \ncontext, 65,000 lawsuits is more than the total number of Federal \nprosecutions initiated in 1995. In other words, prisoners incarcerated \nin various prisons brought more cases in the Federal courts than all \nFederal prosecutions last year combined.\n  The vast majority of these lawsuits are nonmeritorious. The National \nAssociation of Attorneys General estimated that 95 percent of them are \ndismissed without the inmate receiving anything.\n  Let me just list a few examples.\n  First, an inmate claimed $1 million in damages for civil rights \nviolations because his ice cream had melted. The judge ruled that the \nright to eat ice cream was clearly not within the contemplation of our \nNation's forefathers.\n  Second, an inmate alleged that being forced to listen to his unit \nmanager's country and western music constituted cruel and unusual \npunishment.\n  Third, an inmate sued because when his dinner tray arrived, the piece \nof cake on it was ``hacked up.''\n  Fourth, an inmate sued because he was served chunky instead of smooth \npeanut butter.\n  Fifth, two prisoners sued to force taxpayers to pay for sex change \nsurgery while they were in prison.\n  On and on the list goes, Mr. President, with more and more ridiculous \nlawsuits brought by inmates in penitentiaries. A prisoner who sued \ndemanding LA Gear or Reebok ``Pumps'' instead of Converse tennis shoes.\n  These kinds of lawsuits are an enormous drain on the resources of our \nStates and localities, resources that would be better spent \nincarcerating more dangerous offenders instead of being consumed in \ncourt battles without merit.\n  Thirty-three States have estimated that they spend at least $54.5 \nmillion annually combined on these lawsuits. The National Association \nof Attorneys General has extrapolated that number to conclude that the \nannual costs for all of these States are approximately $81 million a \nyear to battle cases of the sort that I have just described.\n  In addition to the problems created by the lawsuits the courts have \ndismissed, we have what is, if anything, a more serious problem--\nlawsuits the courts have not dismissed that have resulted in turning \nover the running of our prisons to the courts.\n  In many jurisdictions, including my own State of Michigan, judicial \norders entered under Federal law have effectively turned control of the \nprison system away from elected officials accountable to the taxpayers \nand over to the courts. The courts, in turn, raise the costs of running \nprisons far beyond what is necessary and undermine the very legitimacy \nand deterrent effect of prison sentences. Judicial orders entered under \nFederal law have even resulted in the release of dangerous criminals \nfrom prison. Thus, right now, our existing Federal laws are actually \nwasting the taxpayers' money and creating risk to public safety.\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\n  Let me explain a little bit about how this works. Under a series of \njudicial decrees resulting from Justice Department lawsuits against the \nMichigan Department of Corrections back in the 1960's, the Federal \ncourts now monitor our State prisons to determine: first, how warm the \nfood is; second, how bright the lights are; third, whether there are \nelectrical outlets in each cell; fourth, whether windows are inspected \nand up to code; fifth, whether a prisoner's hair is cut only by \nlicensed barbers; and sixth, whether air and water temperatures in the \nprison are comfortable.\n  Complying with these court orders, litigating over what they mean, \nand producing the reports necessary to keep the courts happy has cost \nthe Michigan taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars since 1984.\n  This would be bad enough if a court had ever found that Michigan's \nprison system was at some point in violation of the Constitution or if \nthe conditions there had been declared inhumane, but that is not the \ncase. To the contrary, nearly all of Michigan's facilities are fully \naccredited by the American Corrections Association.\n  We have what may be the most extensive training program in the Nation \nfor corrections officers. Our rate of prison violence is among the \nlowest of any State. And we have spent an average of $4,000 a year per \nprisoner for health care, including nearly $1,700 for mental health \nservices.\n  Rather, the judicial intervention is the result of a consent decree \nthat Michigan entered into in 1982, 13 years ago, that was supposed to \nend a lawsuit filed at the same time. Instead, the decree has been a \nsource of continuous litigation and intervention by the court into the \nminutia of prison operations.\n  The Michigan story is a bad one, Mr. President, but let me tell you a \nstory that causes me even more concern, and that is on the public \nsafety side, the example that is going on even today in the city of \nPhiladelphia. There a Federal judge has been overseeing what has become \na program of wholesale releases of up to 600 criminal defendants per \nweek to keep the prison population down to what the judge considers an \nappropriate level.\n\n  As a result, a large number of defendants have been released back \nonto the streets. Following their release, thousands of these \ndefendants have been rearrested for new crimes every year including 79 \nmurders, 90 rapes, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing charges, 701 \nburglaries, 2,748 thefts, and 1,113 assaults.\n  Under this order, there are no individualized bail hearings based on \na defendant's criminal history before deciding whether to release the \ndefendant pretrial. Instead, the only consideration is what the \ndefendant is charged with the day of his or her arrest.\n  No matter what the defendant has done before, even, for example, if \nhe or she was previously convicted of murder, if the charge giving rise \nto the specific arrest on the specific date is a nonviolent crime, the \ndefendant may not be held pretrial.\n  Moreover, the so-called nonviolent crimes include stalking, \ncarjacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, \nvehicular homicide, manslaughter, terroristic threats, and gun charges. \nThose are charged as nonviolent and consequently those arrested are not \ndetained.\n  Failure to appear rates, needless to say, for crimes covered by the \ncap are up around 70 percent as opposed to noncovered crimes for \naggravated assault where the rate is just 3 percent.\n  The Philadelphia fugitive rate for defendants charged with drug \ndealing is 76 percent, three times the national average. Over 100 \npersons in Philadelphia have been killed by criminals set free under \nthis prison cap.\n  Mr. President, I think this is all wrong. People deserve to keep \ntheir tax dollars or to have them spent on progress they approve. They \ndeserve better than to have their money spent on keeping prisoners and \nprisons in conditions a particular Federal judge feels are desirable \nbut not required by the Constitution or any law.\n  They certainly do not need it spent on endless litigation over these \nmatters.\n  Meanwhile, criminals, while they must be accorded their \nconstitutional rights, deserve to be punished. Obviously, they should \nnot be tortured or treated cruelly. At the same time, they also should \nnot have all the rights and privileges the rest of us enjoy. Rather, \ntheir lives should, on the whole, be describable by the old concept \nknown as ``hard time.'' By interfering with the fulfillment of this \npunitive function, the courts are effectively seriously undermining the \nentire criminal justice system.\n  Our distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, working with Senator \nHatch, Senator Kyl, Senator Hutchison, and myself, has developed \nlegislation to address these problems. Our proposals will return sanity \nand State control to our prison systems.\n  To begin with, we would institute several measures to reduce \nfrivolous inmate litigation. We would require judicial screening, \nbefore docketing, of any civil complaint filed by a prisoner seeking \nrelief from the Government.\n  This provision would allow a Federal judge to immediately dismiss a \ncomplaint if either the complaint does not state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted, or the defendant is immune from suit. In \naddition, State prisoners would have to exhaust all administrative \nremedies before filing a lawsuit in Federal court.\n  We would also create disincentives for prisoners to file frivolous \nsuits. Under current law, there is no cost to prisoners for filing an \ninfinite number of such suits. First, we would require inmates who file \nlawsuits to pay the full amount of their court fees and other costs. We \nalso would make that requirement enforceable by allowing their trust \naccounts to be garnished to pay these fees. If a prisoner is unable to \nfully pay court fees and other costs at the time of filing a lawsuit, \n20 percent of the funds in his trust account would be garnished for \nthis purpose. Every month thereafter 20 percent of the income credited \nto the prisoner's account would be garnished until the full amount is \npaid off.\n  We would also allow Federal courts to revoke any good-time credits \naccumulated by a prisoner who files a frivolous suit. Finally, we would \nprohibit prisoners who have filed three frivolous or obviously \nnonmeritorious in forma pauperis civil actions from filing any more \nunless they are in imminent danger of severe bodily harm, and we would \ncap and limit the attorney's fees that can be obtained from the \ndefendant in such suits.\n  As to the powers of judges to overrule our legislatures, we would \nforbid courts from entering orders for prospective relief--such as \nregulating food temperatures--unless the order is necessary to correct \nviolations of individual plaintiffs' Federal rights. We also would \nrequire that the relief be narrowly drawn and be the least intrusive \nmeans of protecting the Federal rights. We would direct courts to give \nsubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the \noperation of the criminal justice system caused by the relief. And we \nwould impose important new requirements before a court can enter an \norder that requires the release of prisoners, including that such \norders may be entered in the Federal system only by a three-judge \ncourt.\n  We also would provide that any party can seek to have a court decree \nended after 2 years, and that the court will order it ended unless \nthere is still a constitutional violation that needs to be corrected. \nAs a result, no longer will prison administration be turned over to \nFederal judges for the indefinite future for the slightest reason. No \nlonger will public safety be jeopardized by capricious judicial prison \ncaps. And no longer will the taxpayers be socked for enormous, \nunnecessary bills to pay for all this.\n  Instead, the States will be able to run prisons as they see fit \nunless there is a constitutional violation. If there is, a narrowly \ntailored order to correct the violation may be entered.\n  This is a balanced set of proposals, allowing the courts to step in \nwhere they are needed, but puts an end to unnecessary judicial \nintervention and micromanagement of our prison system we see too often.\n  These proposals were included as part of the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriation bill. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed this \nlegislation. As a result, we continue to have more frivolous prisoner \nlawsuits and we continue to have some courts running prisons.\n  President Clinton said his veto was based on other parts of the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nAccordingly, we will shortly be sending him a new version of an omnibus \nappropriations bill that again includes these proposals. This is one \nmeasure we can take that will plainly advance our fight against crime. \nWe hope this time, President Clinton will help.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield the floor to the Senator from \nTennessee for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are listening to a lot of rhetoric \nabout crime and being tough on crime. But no matter how many cops we \nput on the street, no matter how many laws we pass, unless we have \nstrong law enforcement efforts at the very top of the Justice \nDepartment and the very top of the executive branch of this Government, \nwe are going to be letting out the back door whatever we are putting in \nour prison system in the front door.\n  In fact, the policies of an administration are much more important \nthan any other component of our law enforcement system. An \nadministration's decisions as to who to prosecute, how effectively to \nprosecute, what cases to appeal, and what positions to take, affect \nthousands and thousands of cases. They affect not only the specific \ncases that are brought but maybe even can determine what cases are \nbrought in the future.\n  In other words, an administration needs to be strong in its law \nenforcement position. It needs to advocate the legitimate interests of \nthe Federal Government, when Federal criminal statutes are involved. \nThe President has engaged in strong law enforcement rhetoric. The \nPresident states that he is for the death penalty. But it is my \nunfortunate duty to report that the rhetoric does not match the action.\n  I am specifically referring to the actions of the Solicitor General. \nThe Solicitor General in this country is the Government's lawyer. The \nSolicitor General advocates the Government's position before the \nSupreme Court of the United States. The Solicitor General is appointed \nby the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. \nTime after time, the position taken by the Solicitor General has been \ninconsistent with the rhetoric coming out of the White House.\n  The Solicitor General, in case after case, has refused to appeal \ncases in which lower courts have overruled the Government, have \noverturned the defendant's convictions or have made it practically \nimpossible that the defendant be prosecuted. Instead of appealing that \ncase, even when in some decisions there are strong dissents saying, \n``No, no, no, the Government is right here and the defendant is \nwrong,'' in case after case, the Solicitor General has taken the \nposition of the defendant, essentially, and not appealed that case to \nat least give a higher court an opportunity to hold for the Government.\n  When the Solicitor General makes a decision whether to appeal an \nadverse ruling, he is not in the position of a judge making an \nobjective determination. The Solicitor General is supposed to be an \nadvocate for us, an advocate for the people trying to enforce the law \nin this country. If there is a legitimate position to take in an \nimportant case--and these dissents, if nothing else, would indicate \nthere would be in those cases--the Solicitor General is supposed to \ntake that position and give the courts an opportunity to hold with the \nGovernment and against the defendant in those cases.\n  We will have more to say about that later on next week with regard to \nsome specific cases. But there is one particular point that is very \nrelevant. It has to do with the recent bombing case that we all know \nabout. It has to do with the so-called Cheely decision. There, a panel \nof the court, not even the full court, ruled that death penalties \nprovided in two Federal statutes, essentially statutes prohibiting \nsending bombs through the mails, were unconstitutional. That is the \nninth circuit decision; by a lower court. It was a panel of the full \ncourt that made that decision. The Solicitor General chose not to \nappeal to let the full court of the ninth circuit even have an \nopportunity to overrule the panel.\n  So, as far as it stands out there, the death penalties contained in \nthe mail bomb statutes are unconstitutional as far as that circuit is \nconcerned. Obviously, that has some great relevance to what we are \nseeing now. We are all pleased that a suspect has been taken into \ncustody with regard to the Unabomber case. Whether or not this man is \ncharged with any of the three killings, or the terrorizing of many \nother people through a series of mail bombs, a jury hearing the \nUnabomber case should have the option of imposing the death penalty. \nBut I fear that if he is charged in the Unabomber killings, the Justice \nDepartment may well have made it so that it is impossible for the jury \nor the court out there to impose the death penalty.\n  The problem is that the most recent Unabomber killing occurred in \nCalifornia. California is in the ninth circuit. The ninth circuit \ndecided the case I referred to a minute ago in 1994, called Cheely \nversus United States. Cheely had been convicted of murder. He and his \ncoconspirators arranged for a mail bomb to be sent to the post office \nbox of a key witness against them in a trial. The witness' father was \nkilled when he opened the packaged bomb.\n  Obviously, the facts are similar to the Unabomber case. Cheely was \ncharged with interstate transport of an explosive that resulted in \ndeath and for death resulting from mailing nonmailable items. The Bush \nadministration, which was in office at the time, asked for the death \npenalty. The ninth circuit panel ruled, however, that the death penalty \nstatutes for mail bombings were unconstitutional.\n  The ninth circuit held that the class of persons eligible for the \ndeath penalty under these statutes was unconstitutionally broad. Now \nmind you, a Carter-appointed judge on that same panel dissented from \nthat decision.\n  Given that President Clinton publicly supports the death penalty, it \nwould seem reasonable to expect that the Justice Department would \nautomatically have sought to appeal that sort of decision which struck \ndown a Federal statute allowing the death penalty, with a strong \ndissent included. But the Solicitor General did not file a petition for \nrehearing by the full court.\n  In an extraordinary move, however, the full ninth circuit ordered the \nparties to address whether an en banc hearing should be granted. \nSurprisingly, the Justice Department argued that the ninth circuit \nshould not grant review in this case.\n  Mr. President, the Justice Department wound up arguing against \nitself. Not so surprisingly, the ninth circuit then failed to grant \nrehearing. The Clinton Justice Department did not file an appeal with \nthe Supreme Court.\n  The Judiciary Committee held an oversight hearing this past November. \nAt that hearing, I asked Solicitor General Days why he did not file a \nrehearing petition in Cheely and in another case in another circuit. He \nindicated that although there was an argument to be raised on the other \nside, he did not think that the cases raised large enough concerns to \njustify asking for a rehearing. Of course, the constitutionality of \nmany death sentences obtained on the basis of pre-1976 Federal statutes \nwas at issue. He also indicated that he had discussed the case with \nAttorney General Reno.\n  The effects of this are obvious, because if this man is charged under \nthe Federal mail bomb statutes for the Unabomber killing in California, \nhe cannot be given the death penalty. Had the Sacramento Federal \nbuilding, and not the Oklahoma City Federal building, been bombed, the \ndeath penalty might not be available to be sought against Timothy \nMcVeigh in Federal court.\n  According to the Saturday Washington Post, Justice Department \nofficials say they are ``pondering whether to bring charges against \nKoczynski,'' in the Unabomber case, ``initially in Sacramento, the site \nof the last bombing in April 1995, or in New Jersey,'' where a 1994 \nkilling occurred. I have a good idea why they are pondering. Any other \ntime, the prosecutor might bring charges where the most recent case \noccurred, and where the evidence is fresher. And, in fact, the \nUnabomber sent more bombs to California than anywhere else.\n  But the case maybe cannot be brought there if the administration \ndesires to seek the death penalty. I do not know if the New Jersey case \nis as strong as the California case. The third\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\ncircuit, which includes New Jersey, has not issued opinions striking \ndown the Federal death penalty statutes.\n  I am deeply disturbed, however, that this administration has \nprecluded one death penalty prosecution of the Unabomber, and now we \nwill all have to live with the consequences.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the statement by the Senator from \nTennessee underscores the majority leader's emphasis on a tough \njudiciary, and just points, once again, to what we have been hearing \nfrom Majority Leader Dole with regard to how important the judiciary \nsystem is and the judges we appoint to maintain civil order in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3705-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3706-S3707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ANTITERRORISM BILL\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the day before yesterday, this Senate \ncompleted a vitally important task. A part of that task, an \nantiterrorism bill, was brought into being as a consequence of the \ntragedy 1 year ago in Oklahoma City. Another part of that \naccomplishment is the result of the work of many Members on this side \nof the aisle, some on the other side of the aisle, extending over a \nperiod of well over a decade to reform and make more just our criminal \njustice system.\n  There are those among our constituents, a number of whom have called \nmy office, who oppose the antiterrorism bill simply because they did \nnot wish any enhancement of the criminal justice powers of Federal \nagencies.\n  I believe their apprehension to be misdirected. I am convinced that \nto face the possibility of terrorism, both foreign and domestic, a \npossibility which has clearly been a terrible reality both in Oklahoma \nCity and in New York City, that some enhancement of Federal law \nenforcement was, in fact, necessary, and, as a consequence, I supported \nthe antiterrorism elements in that bill.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, I am convinced that the reform in \nwhat is known technically as habeas corpus will be of a more profound \nand a more positive nature in connection with our criminal justice \nsystem.\n  It is a simple truism that justice delayed is justice denied, and \nwith respect to myriad State court convictions for serious criminal \nviolations, including the most serious criminal violations resulting in \ncapital punishment sentences, we have a spectacle in the United States \nof America unseen anyplace else in the world.\n\n  Here, of course, with our unique and uniquely valuable system of dual \nsovereignty, most criminal justice prosecutions take place in our State \ncourts. Many here claim a sophistication by asserting some kind of \nsecond-rate justice at the State court system. Those observations do \nnot accord with my own practice as attorney general of the State of \nWashington, but, nevertheless, they are reflected in the nature of our \nhabeas corpus proceedings.\n  A normal prosecution proceeds through a trial before a jury in a \nState court, a conviction, a sentence, at least one and usually two \nappeals to an intermediate appellate court and then to a State supreme \ncourt in connection with any serious violation. In most other \njurisdictions in the world, including other countries as free as the \nUnited States, that would be the end of the process. But in the United \nStates, any convicted person can say, ``No, I don't accept that \nproceeding,'' no matter how great the protections of the rights of the \nindividual accused. ``I'm going to start all over again in the Federal \ncourt system and assert some violation of my constitutional rights.''\n  We have the paradox California situation--I believe, again, Mr. \nPresident, unprecedented in the world--in which a single trial level \nFederal judge can say that everything that the State trial judge did, \neverything that the State appellate system, everything that the State \nsupreme court did was wrong and violated the constitutional rights of \nthis individual convicted person. And you have to start all over again \nor perhaps even dismiss the case entirely.\n\n  Even if that single Federal court judge says, no, everything was done \nin accordance with the Constitution, the accused person can then take \nthat to a circuit court of appeals as a matter of right and try it in \nthe Supreme Court of the United States to succeed in his or her claims.\n  But, Mr. President, at the present time it does not stop there. You \ncan go all the way up on one claim of a constitutional violation and \nthen say, oh, by the way, I forgot, I have another claim of a different \nconstitutional violation. And we will start all over again in another \nFederal district court and repeat the process.\n  Mr. President, when I spoke here during the debate of one of the \nmotions to recommit of the distinguished Senator from Delaware, [Mr. \nBiden], I talked about Charles Campbell.\n  Charles Campbell, a released rapist, almost immediately after his \nrelease from a prison in Washington State went to the home of the \nperson he raped and in cold blood murdered her, her child, and a \nneighbor who happened to be there at the time. This took place in 1982, \nMr. President.\n  By 1984 Mr. Campbell had been tried, convicted, sentenced to death, \nand had exhausted his appeals in the Washington court system. But, Mr. \nPresident, that was only the beginning. From 1984 to 1994 Charles \nCampbell cheated justice by endless appeals to the Federal courts of \nthe United States. After literally millions of dollars had been used, \nhis judgment was finally confirmed and he was executed in mid 1994.\n  Mr. President, that was a misuse of the system. It taught disrespect \nof the law to the people of the State of Washington who had to follow \nthis through the newspapers and over television for more than 10 years. \nAnd, Mr. President, fundamental respect for and obedience to our law \nrequires a public opinion that believes that the legal system does \nwork. This kind of misuse undercuts that trust and confidence. We \nsimply cannot have it, Mr. President.\n  Finally, as a result of this bill, and the intense decade-long work \nof the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, we do have reforms in this \nhabeas corpus set of procedures. It is not an abolition, not a way to \ndeny true constitutional violations, but a way that requires them to be \nasserted within a reasonable time and concluded within a reasonable \ntime. And as a consequence, Mr. President, I believe that we have made \na huge step forward in a campaign which has lasted for an extended \nperiod of time.\n  Just going back in the Record to 1980--I find a bill 2 years after \nthat by Senator East. It did not get out of committee. The next year \nthere was one by Senator Thurmond that actually passed the Senate, but \nwas killed in the House. The next year a similar bill by Senator Dole, \nwithout action. During that same year 1984, a proposition from \nCongressman Foley from my own State, before he was Speaker, that said \nwe could not do anything in Congress about habeas corpus until there \nhad been a study and recommendations from the U.S. Supreme Court, which \nstudy has been completed.\n  Then again in 1992 another proposal by Senator Thurmond. In the \nvarious crime bills in the 4 years leading up to 1994, tiny little \nproposals, minor changes--major changes constantly defeated on the \nfloor of the Senate or the floor of the House. And finally now in this \nCongress with appropriate leadership a reform in the system that really \nworks. Mr. President, this is a real triumph.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time under the previous order has \nexpired at this point.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent \nthat our time be extended by 6 minutes. I have spoken to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, upon the \nconclusion of that time period, that Senator Dodd be recognized for the \npurposes of making some remarks, and following that I be recognized for \n20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\n\n\n              THE ADMINISTRATION AND DRUG USE BY OUR YOUTH\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think what we have seen here this \nmorning is that there are consequences from policies. This \nadministration has presided over significant policy changes and \ndecisions for which there have been extraordinary consequences.\n  Mr. President, the interdiction effort of drugs on our borders, \nparticularly between the United States and Mexico, have been reduced by \n40 percent. The drug czar's office under this administration until \nrecently was reduced by 80 percent. This administration has presided \nover the appointment of such judicial figures as Judge Baer who is now \na celebrity in his own right for an initial resistance to a drug case \nbrought in a celebrated case in New York.\n  These isolated incidences though need to be looked at and reviewed \nagain in the context of what has resulted from these decisions. And \nwhat has resulted is an alarming epidemic of drug use among American \ncitizens, particularly our youth.\n  Drug use among teenagers has doubled in the last 36 months. From 1980 \nto 1992 drug use among teenagers was cut in half. It has now \nskyrocketed and as I said has virtually doubled. Mr. President, drug \nuse among our youth age 12 to 17 since 1992 has gone from 2.4 to 3.8 \nmillion. That is all illicit drugs. It has gone from 1.6 to 2.9 million \nfor marijuana. Drug use among 12th graders in that same 36 months is up \n60 percent. For 10th graders it is up 95 percent. For eighth graders, \nMr. President--eighth graders--it is up 110 percent.\n  The emergency room episodes of cocaine-related incidents has gone \nfrom 110,000 to 147,000. The role of substance abuse and violence has \nskyrocketed and is involved in 70 percent-plus of rapes in the United \nStates. Every statistic, Mr. President, we can review is up and we are \nnow presiding over a new drug epidemic in the United States. These \nstatistics are a direct result of major changes in policy.\n  That is where we need to revert to truth-in-sentencing, new \ninterdiction and being tougher on the judges who sit on the bench to \nfulfill and honor the laws of our land.\n  This is a war, Mr. President, that we cannot afford to lose, because \nto do so is to condemn millions, millions of Americans to devastation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3706-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3707-S3708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADM. JAMES S. RUSSELL: IN MEMORIAM\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Jim Russell died last Sunday. My life and \nthe lives of a legion of others are diminished as a result. Today the \nflags in Lakewood, WA, will fly at half mast for retired Adm. James \nRussell, who died last Sunday at the age of 93.\n  It is difficult to compress a panegyric for Admiral Russell into a \nfew short minutes, but he was, after all, a modest man who sought out \nneither praise nor glory. He eschewed grandiloquence, and so shall I. A \nsimple retelling of his remarkable life will suffice.\n  James Russell was born in Tacoma, WA. When he was 15 he tried to join \nthe Navy, but was turned away. Undeterred, he joined the Merchant \nMarine. His official naval career began in 1922 when he entered the \nU.S. Naval Academy. He went to the California Institute of Technology \nto get a master's degree in aeronautical engineering. In 1939 he worked \non the design of the Essex-class aircraft carriers. Seventeen of the \nEssex-class were built, and none were sunk during World War II. He not \nonly helped design, but also helped serve on the carriers, where he \nwas, as the Tacoma News Tribune points out, the first naval aviator to \ntake off from and land on the first six U.S. aircraft carriers.\n  In the war Admiral Russell served as a lieutenant commander of a \npatrol squadron in the Aleutians. He defended Dutch Harbor, and America \nagainst a Japanese fighter attack. Later on he fought in the Pacific \naircraft carrier offensive that destroyed the Japanese fleet and helped \nassure the American victory. For his service, he received the \nDistinguished Service Medal twice, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and \nthe Air Medal for Heroism.\n  Admiral Russell was part of the military occupation in Japan. In 1946 \nhe became commander of the carrier USS Bairoko. In 1958 he rose to the \nNo. 2 position in the Navy: vice chief of naval operations. From 1962 \nto 1965 he was commander in chief of NATO forces in Southern Europe. In \n1965 he retired.\n  During the post-war period Admiral Russell helped develop the F-8 \nCrusader, the first of the Navy's aircrafts to fly 1,000 miles-per-\nhour, for which he was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1956. The Seattle \nPost-Intelligencer quotes Admiral Russell saying in 1994 that, ``one of \nhis proudest accomplishments was to have personally flown Navy aircraft \n`ranging from biplanes to supersonic fighters.' ''\n  After his retirement Admiral Russell was active in his community, and \nalways kept abreast of military matters. He garnered respect and \nadmiration from the people around him. Dignified, courteous, gracious, \nkind--these are some of the words his friends and associates use to \ndescribe him. His son Donald remembers that his father not only did not \nharbor ill feelings against his former Japanese enemies, but sought to \nreconcile with some of them. When two Japanese veterans--former pilots \nwho had attacked the base where Admiral Russell served in the war--came \nto the Tacoma area to attend ceremonies marking the anniversary of the \nsurrender, he insisted they stay with him, at his home. One can hardly \nthink of a more apt example than this to describe the word \n``gracious.'' It was for this and for a lifetime of unimpeachable \nbehavior that Admiral Russell was known as Gentleman Jim.\n  It was in his retirement that I met Jim Russell, who provided \nconstant encouragement to me in my career--and constant wise counsel \nabout the security of our beloved country as well. And so I will \ngreatly miss him.\n  Admiral Russell is survived by his wife, Geraldine; a son and \ndaughter-in-law, Donald and Katherine Russell; a daughter-in-law, \nAnitha Russell; a stepson, Fred Rahn; a stepdaughter, Barbara Frayn; \nfive grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His first wife, \nDorothy, died in 1965. My condolences and prayers go to his family.\n\n  A few years ago Admiral Russell expressed his concern over all the \nhonors he had received. ``It worries me a little,'' he said. ``I wonder \nif I've lived up to it.'' Clearly, the admiral was not a boaster. He \ndid what he enjoyed; he served his country and his community, and he \ndid not expect to be fussed over.\n  The Tacoma News Tribune mentions the mayor of Lakewood, Bill \nHarrison's, recollection of Admiral Russell:\n\n       Harrison said he still remembers seeing Russell during a \n     military parade, dressed in white, a sword gleaming at his \n     side.\n       He was absolutely resplendent, Harrison said. That was the \n     first time I ever saw him, and that's the way I will always \n     think of him.\n\n  What a treasure was James Sargent Russell. His life, of simple \ndignity, bravery, service, enthusiasm, and kindness, reminds us of the \nbetter angels of our nature.\n  One of Admiral Russell's nicknames was the ancient mariner. And so, \nin Coleridge's words, let us bid ``Farewell, farewell, the Mariner is \ngone.'' Farewell, Admiral.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a front page article \ndated April 16, 1996, and a lead editorial dated April 17, 1996, from \nthe Tacoma News Tribune be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Tacoma News Tribune, Apr. 16, 1996]\n\n         Admiral Russell, a Leader and a Gentleman, Dead at 93\n\n                           (By Hector Castro)\n\n       He was known as Gentleman Jim, the Gray Eagle, the Father \n     of Naval Aviation and in recent years, the Ancient Mariner.\n       On Sunday, the man with so many titles, retired Adm. James \n     S. Russell, died at his Lakewood home. He was 93.\n       ``I have very fond memories of him,'' Lakewood Mayor Bill \n     Harrison said. ``He became one of my heroes.''\n       Russell was a Tacoma native who went away to sea as a boy \n     and returned 43 years later as a four-star admiral.\n       In a career that began before World War II, Russell was a \n     Navy flier, a designer of aircraft carriers, commander of \n     nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands and commander-in-chief \n     of NATO forces in Southern Europe.\n       Russell's elder son, Donald Russell of Lakewood, said his \n     father always loved the sea and the water.\n       ``The last day he was alive he looked at me and said, `I \n     want to go to the lake. I want to go to the lake.' '' Donald \n     Russell said.\n       James Russell was 15 when he graduated from Stadium High \n     School and immediately\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\n     tried to join the Navy. He was turned away because of his \n     youth. But he wasn't put off so easily and joined the \n     Merchant Marine.\n       His naval career began in 1922 when he enrolled in the U.S. \n     Naval Academy. He later attended the California Institute of \n     Technology to study aeronautical engineering.\n       That education, plus his experience as a Navy flier, proved \n     invaluable when he helped design the Essex-class aircraft \n     carriers shortly before the start of World War II. The ships \n     proved to be among the toughest in the Navy. None of the 17 \n     built by the start of the war was sunk.\n       Donald Russell remembers the start of the war, and his \n     father's last words to him before shipping out.\n       ``If I don't come back from the war, take care of your \n     mother,'' Donald Russell said he was told. He was 11 years \n     old at the time.\n       James Russell was a lieutenant commander of a patrol \n     squadron during the war. At one time, he patrolled in the \n     Alaskan Theater and helped fend off an attack by Japanese \n     fighters on the American base at Dutch Harbor.\n       His actions during wartime earned him the Distinguished \n     Flying Cross and the Air Medal for Heroism.\n       After the war, Russell rose to become second in command of \n     the U.S. Navy. When he retired in 1965, he was commander-in-\n     chief of NATO forces in Southern Europe, based in Italy.\n       That's when Harrison first met him. At the time, Harrison \n     was a captain in the Army, though he retired as a three-star \n     general.\n       The admiral, he said, immediately impressed him with his \n     dignity and courtly manners.\n       Harrison saw the admiral's diplomacy at work, whether he \n     was negotiating a peace between Greece and Turkey for \n     smoothing over the boorish remarks of a fellow officer at a \n     social function.\n       ``I never saw him when he wasn't spic and span, doing and \n     saying the right things,'' Harrison said.\n       Russell married Dorothy Johnson in 1929 and they had two \n     sons, Donald and Kenneth. Dorothy Russell died in 1965, and \n     Russell married Geraldine Rahn in 1966. She survives him.\n       Friends and family members said Russell enjoyed talking \n     about his experiences, but never boasted.\n       ``He was a very modest man,'' said Paul Hunter, staff \n     commodore of the Tacoma Yacht Club. ``He was not arrogant.''\n       After his retirement, Russell became very involved in local \n     community and military affairs. His popularity was such that \n     last year civic leaders from around Tacoma pushed for a \n     maritime park for him.\n       The park was not named for Russell, but he has received \n     plenty of other honors.\n       They include France's highest award, the Legion of Honor, \n     Greece's Order of King George I, Italy's Order of the \n     Republic, Peru's Great Cross of Naval Merit, and Brazil's \n     Order of Naval Merit. The USO Center at SeaTac bears his \n     name.\n       His grandson, Malcolm Russell, also of Lakewood, said his \n     grandfather's home could pass for a military museum. Walls \n     and bookcases are filled with medals, awards and signed \n     photos from such people as John F. Kennedy and King Paul of \n     Greece.\n       Donald Russell said his father never hated his wartime \n     enemies, and had invited Japanese military men and veterans \n     of the war to his Lakewood home.\n       ``He reconciled with his enemies,'' the younger Russell \n     said. ``It was extraordinarily important to him.''\n       Harrison said he still remembers seeing Russell during a \n     military parade, dressed in white, a sword gleaming at his \n     side.\n       ``He was absolutely resplendent,'' Harrison said. ``That \n     was the first time I ever saw him, and that's the way I will \n     always think of him.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Tacoma News Tribune, Apr. 17, 1996]\n\n               Admiral Russell Gave a Lifetime of Service\n\n       Retired four-star admiral James S. Russell, the most \n     distinguished military leader to come out of Tacoma, was \n     reflecting a few years ago on all the honors that had come \n     his way.\n       ``It worries me a little, I wonder if I've lived up to \n     it,'' he said with typical modesty.\n       The admiral shouldn't have worried. The honors were well-\n     deserved, and he wore them with surpassing grace.\n       Russell died peacefully at his Lakewood home Sunday at the \n     age of 93. He is remembered not only for his 43 years of \n     service to the nation as a much-decorated naval aviator and \n     commanding officer, but for the years he spent here since his \n     retirement in 1965 as a goodwill ambassador to military \n     newcomers and visitors.\n       Russell graduated from Stadium High School at 15, and too \n     young to enlist in the Navy, joined the Merchant Marine. A \n     U.S. Naval Academy graduate, he earned a master's degree in \n     aeronautical engineering at Cal Tech and went on to help \n     design the tough Essex-class aircraft carriers in 1939. He \n     was the first naval aviator to take off from and land on the \n     first six U.S. aircraft carriers.\n       After distinguished service as a patrol squadron lieutenant \n     commander in the Aleutians during World War II, Russell took \n     command of his first carrier, the USS Bairoko, in 1946. He \n     became vice chief of naval operations, the Navy's No. 2 \n     position, in 1958, and was commander in chief of NATO forces \n     in Southern Europe from 1962 until he retired in 1965. He was \n     recalled to active duty twice.\n       One of the more revealing stories about Russell was about \n     the graciousness he showed to one-time enemies. Two former \n     Japanese pilots who had attacked the Aleutians base where \n     Russell served in World War II were in the area last summer \n     to participate in ceremonies marking the anniversary of the \n     surrender.

Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, first of all, I \nhave two sets of remarks I want to make on separate subjects. The first \nhas to do with the subject matter that has been discussed already this \nmorning over a period, I gather, of some 75 minutes. That is, of \ncourse, the 1-year anniversary of the tragedy of the bombing in \nOklahoma City.\n  Allow me on behalf of my constituents, if I may, of the State of \nConnecticut, to express condolences to our colleagues here from \nOklahoma as well as to the people of Oklahoma, particularly the people \nof Oklahoma City, and of course the family, friends, and associates of \nthe 168 people who lost their lives a year ago today in one of the \nworst, if not the worst, incidence of terrorism in the history of the \nUnited States.\n  In addition, among that 168 people who lost their lives a year ago, \nMr. President, 19 were innocent children, mostly in a day care center \nin that building in Oklahoma City. Of the rest, the vast majority, as \nwe know, were Federal employees, Government workers. It was not, \napparently, just any building in Oklahoma City that was the target of \nthis deranged individual or individuals, as only time will tell through \nthe various proceedings, it was a Government building and it was \nGovernment employees. They did not belong to any particular cause, \nthese employees. They were not opposed because they were a particular \ngroup of people engaged in some political activity. They were people \nthat worked at HUD and the Social Security Administration, the \nVeterans' Administration, people that were going to work that morning, \ndoing what they do across this country in a building like it, serving \nour constituents.\n  Because they were Government employees in a Government building, and \nbecause people had decided they needed to send a message about their \nGovernment, they were targets, including 19 innocent children. This was \na crime committed, obviously, by a violent, aberrant American or \npersons. We all know that. I think it is important to remember that the \nvast majority of Americans were repulsed by what happened, that they \nwholly reject violence as a method of political change in this country, \nand that all of us share in the grief that the families and friends of \nthe people of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City are remembering today.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of my constituents and certainly myself and \nour office here, we wish to express our deepest condolences to those \npeople and to rededicate ourselves here to take all necessary steps to \ntry and stop those who would engage in that kind of activity as a way \nof expressing their political views.\n  I point out that I supported the antiterrorism bill yesterday, as \nmost of us did in this body. I felt it could have been a stronger bill, \nMr. President. I must say that. I deeply regret we did not take \nadditional actions such as identified by our colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Biden, and others to strengthen the hand of law enforcement in \nareas where, for instance, people on the Internet now, instruct people \nhow to make bombs with the intent that they be used--we do not prohibit \nthat. We cannot allow our military forces at the direction of the \nAttorney General to step in where terrorism may be used. I think that \nis regrettable. I think we ought to be able to use our\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nforces where appropriate. That is not in the bill. It was struck from \nthe bill.\n\n  Hopefully, we can come back and make some of these changes and \nstrengthen the legislation. Nonetheless, it is a positive step forward. \nI am glad Congress has gone on record in pressing its opposition to \nterrorism, and hope we can do more in the coming weeks and months \nbefore this Congress is adjourned.\n  The major point today is that all of us here, not to use this as a \nforum somehow to express our oppositions to various policies, but at \nleast for a moment or two, to express our deep, deep sense of sorrow to \nthe people of Oklahoma City, and particularly to the families and \nfriends of the 168 individuals who lost their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3708-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3709-S3711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RON BROWN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, just 2 weeks ago, this Nation was saddened \nand anguished by the tragic death of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and \n32 other Government and business leaders in Croatia. As a very close \npersonal friend of Ron Brown's, I regret deeply, Mr. President, that I \ncould not be here to console his widow, Alma, and his children, Michael \nand Tracy, in their time of grief. My thoughts and prayers today, as \nthey have been over the last several weeks, are with the Brown family \nand with the families of all of the victims of this terrible tragedy.\n  Although we have many pressing issues before us in this body, Mr. \nPresident, I want to take just a few minutes, if I can, to reflect and \nremember the extraordinary and distinguished legacy of Ron Brown. As I \nstand before the Senate here today, many thoughts come to mind, Mr. \nPresident, about Ron Brown--civil rights activists, Democratic Party \nchairman, Commerce Secretary, bridge builder, and certainly a very \nclose and dear personal friend.\n  Beyond my great sense of personal loss, Mr. President, when I think \nof Ron Brown I also think of public service and public servant. From \nall the time that I knew Ron Brown, from when he was a trusted aide to \nour colleague, Senator Kennedy, to when he was chairman of the \nDemocratic Party and his last role as Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown \nepitomized, in my view, what public service is all about. Ron Brown \nlabored tirelessly for what he believed in. It seemed that no obstacle \ncould prevent him from attaining his goals.\n  At a time when respect for public service and public servants has \ndiminished, when pundits too often cynically demean those who serve \nAmerica, Ron Brown presented the quiet dignity that comes with superb \npublic servants. Ron believed that one person committed to a task with \nconviction in their heart could make a difference, and he certainly \ndid. His labors were the embodiment of George Bernard Shaw's timeless \nwords, ``You see things, and you say why; but I dream things that never \nwere and say why not.''\n  On April 3, when Secretary Brown's plane crashed in Croatia, Mr. \nPresident, I was in Ireland to fulfill a long-standing commitment. \nTogether with Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith and Prime Minister Bruton, \nwe attended and participated in a wonderful memorial service dedicate \nto Ron Brown's memory at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n  I say as an aside, Mr. President, we anticipated 30 or 40 people \nwould show up, maybe from the Embassy staff, to come by and pay their \nrespects. In fact, over 500 people unannounced showed up at the \ncathedral that morning to participate in that service. I want to thank \nDean Stewart, who was in charge of St. Patrick's Cathedral, along with \nother members of the clergy from throughout Ireland who participated \nthat morning, as well as some very distinguished people who sang and \npurchased musical pieces in memory of Ron Brown, not to mention the 500 \npeople that came from across the island of Ireland to express their \nsense of loss.\n  For all of us there that morning, Mr. President, our remembrances of \nRon Brown hearken back to the visit he had made to Ireland 2 years ago, \nto which I was a member, a trip not unlike the one to Croatia, \ninvolving some 15 chief executive officers of businesses in this \ncountry, as well as others from the House and the Senate that were part \nof an economic mission to Northern Ireland.\n  A visit, Ambassador Smith reminded us, which led to President Clinton \nto dub Ron Brown an ``honorary Irishman,'' and it was mentioned again \nby her that morning at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Ron Brown, Mr. \nPresident, had come to Ireland with an ambitious but challenging goal: \nTo make the dream of peace during the formal cease-fire in Northern \nIreland a reality. Certainly, it was no easy task, as we know, even \ntoday.\n  For anyone who knew Ron Brown, there were not too many challenges \nthat phased him. While I had known him for many years, it was on that \ntrip to Ireland that I had the opportunity to see firsthand the \nenthusiasm and optimism that infused him.\n  Remarkably, Mr. President, I watched an African-American man, born \nand raised in Harlem, with no ethnic or religious connection to \nIreland, come to that island and champion the peace process and the \nopportunities for economic development. While on that trip, Ron Brown \nbecame the first U.S. Cabinet secretary to make an official visit to \nBelfast.\n  The success of Ron's trip to Ireland prompted President Clinton to \nsend Ron on many other missions across the globe, including the one to \nthe former Yugoslavia, a mission which ended so tragically on that \nrainy and wind-swept mountain in Croatia. This final mission, Mr. \nPresident, was one of many that Ron tirelessly made to the world's \ntroubled spots promoting American companies and American workers.\n\n  As Secretary of Commerce, on one level, Ron's job, of course, was to \npromote U.S. business interests, which he did very, very well. But for \nall who knew Ron Brown well, his interests ran much deeper than that. \nRon Brown used the legitimate goal of increasing U.S. economic \nopportunities as a means of advancing other interests as well.\n  Ron traveled to many places that are beginning the difficult journey \ntoward reconciliation and economic revitalization because, as a public \nman, a public servant, he believed that the dynamism of private \nenterprise could help bring lasting peace to regions that, for years, \nhad known only violence and hatred.\n  But Ron Brown understood that these trips were about more than just \nhelping business or free enterprise. As Ambassador Smith noted in her \neulogy in Dublin a week ago, these trips were truly--to use her words--\n``peace and democracy missions, too, missions of hope and idealism.''\n  Mr. President, these trips were about promoting the importance of \nwork, and the notion that through economic opportunity, the process of \npolitical reconciliation could begin and, more importantly, could last.\n  In the absence of it, of course, no permanent healing will ever \noccur.\n  From Ron Brown's earliest days, at his first job carrying records and \nreading public service announcements at WLIB-AM, a radio station in \nHarlem, he understood the critical importance of work. He understood \nthat there is nothing as rewarding, for individuals or a nation, as \nwaking up in the morning, going to work, and coming home in the evening \nknowing that you have earned a true wage.\n  That is why Ron Brown went to Ireland and so many other places, and \nit is why he was in the Balkans on that tragic evening.\n  Ron Brown knew that after the peace treaties were signed and when the \nguns were finally laid to rest, the possibility of a truly lasting \npeace anyplace around the globe would depend on every person having the \nsame opportunity to realize today the dream of a far better tomorrow \nfor themselves and their families.\n  When Ron Brown journeyed to the Balkans, he took with him the \nunquenchable spirit of American optimism. He sought to use American \nenterprise and the American can-do spirit to promote economic \ndevelopment as a means of bringing a truly lasting peace. And he sought \nto heal the lingering anguish of ethnic violence with a promise of a \nbrighter future for all the peoples of the region.\n  Ron Brown leaves this world, Mr. President, with an amazing legacy. \nHe was the first African-American to head a major political party in \nour country. He was the first African-American to be Secretary of \nCommerce. He rebuilt the Democratic Party, and he certainly\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\nhelped to elect President Clinton in 1992. He used the Commerce \nDepartment to create millions of jobs for American workers and spread \nthe doctrine of economic development and cooperation across the globe.\n  Ron Brown enjoyed a full and all-too-brief life on this Earth and \nmust be a source of inspiration to all of us, in not just Government, \nbut in our Nation as a whole.\n  In Ireland, Prime Minister Bruton described Ron Brown in these words, \nwhich I think bear repeating--as a role model ``for those looking for \ninspiration as to how a life can be led for the good of others.''\n  Ron Brown understood, Mr. President, that our lives must have purpose \nand direction. And we can best remember him by emulating the way he \nlived his life. Mr. President, I think the poet Ralph Waldo Emerson \nsaid it well when he said, ``I expect to pass through this world but \nonce. Any good therefore that I can do or any kindness that I can show \nfor any fellow creature, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect \nit, for I shall not pass this way again.''\n  Ron Brown's life symbolized these solemn words. While he passed \nthrough our world, Mr. President, he did good. He showed kindness and, \nregrettably--so regrettably--he will not pass this way again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the comments of our \nAmbassador, Jean Kennedy Smith, along with an article that appeared in \nthe Irish Times, which captured, as well, the remarks of Prime Minister \nBruton, who spoke at the memorial service in Dublin, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks by Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith at Memorial Service for \n           Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and His Delegation\n\n       Taoiseach, distinguished guests, and friends of Ron Brown, \n     of Chuck Meissner, and of the other brave pioneers for peace \n     whose lives of courage and service were so tragically cut \n     short last week.\n       This has, indeed, been a sad week for America, a sad week \n     for Ireland. We have lost friends. But today, we gather not \n     only to mourn them, but to celebrate their lives.\n       Last night, I spoke with Alma Brown and told her of the \n     memorial service we were holding today. She was so pleased \n     that Ron was to be remembered in this way by the people of \n     Ireland, because this country was so important to him.\n       I first met Ron Brown in the fall of 1979. My brother, Ted, \n     was about to begin a campaign for President of the United \n     States in 1980. My husband, Steve, was to manage the \n     campaign, as he had done for my brothers, Jack and Bob. Steve \n     needed a deputy campaign manager for civil rights, and \n     everyone said that Ron Brown was the perfect choice--a new \n     young leader in the civil rights movement, and a worthy heir \n     of the Reverend Martin Luther King.\n       We all loved Ron from the start. He served far above and \n     beyond the call of duty in the campaign. He gave his heart to \n     Ted and Steve and all of us in the Kennedy family gave our \n     hearts to Ron.\n       In the years since, I saw him often, most recently during \n     his frequent visits to Ireland. He once told me that he felt \n     a special welcome and sense of humanity in Ireland, even for \n     those who are not of Irish descent. In fact, he enjoyed his \n     time here so much that President Clinton dubbed him an \n     honorary Irishman.\n       Ron Brown was an original. I never met a person who had \n     greater ability to go into a hornet's nest, come out with the \n     honey, and leave all the bees laughing. No tunnel was too \n     long or too dark for Ron to not see the light at the end. His \n     warmth, and wit, and optimism were inspiring and infectious.\n       He was a charismatic leader, who was good at every job he \n     ever took on--as a leader in the civil rights movement, \n     chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, and as the \n     Secretary of Commerce. A son of Harlem, he was a remarkable \n     American success story, and he dedicated his life to helping \n     others achieve their potential and their dreams, as he had \n     one.\n       He brought that same spirit of optimism to Ireland. As he \n     said during President Clinton's historic visit, he found a \n     ``belief in self that wasn't here before.''\n       ``We are on a path,'' he said, ``and we won't be denied.''\n       Ron was deeply committed to public service, and he \n     instilled that commitment in all who worked for him; in Chuck \n     Meissner, his tireless assistant secretary of commerce, who \n     felt very strongly the pulse for peace in Northern Ireland, \n     and in all those from the Department of Commerce who are here \n     today. The mission Ron Brown led to South Africa and China, \n     to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, and, finally, to \n     Bosnia, were more than trade missions. They were peace and \n     democracy missions too, missions to hope and idealism. The \n     understood that peace, prosperity, and economic justice go \n     hand in hand.\n       As President Clinton has said, ``Ron Brown walked and ran \n     and flew through life. He was a magnificent life force.''\n       In the wake of that force, in the wake of that remarkable \n     life, all of us who knew Ron Brown, Chuck Meissner, and the \n     members of the delegation, all of us who were fortunate to be \n     touched by their warmth and share their vision must try to \n     carry on their work for peace, for that is their legacy to \n     us.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Irish Times, Apr. 11, 1996]\n\n     Bruton Says Brown Was a Model for All Who Want To Help Others\n\n                           (By Mark Brennock)\n\n       Politicians, business people and many others who knew Ron \n     Brown gathered in Dublin's St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday \n     to honour an African-American whom President Clinton had \n     dubbed ``an honorary Irishman.''\n       As one who had not known him the Dean of St. Patrick's the \n     Very Rev Maurice Stewart, said he had two images of the late \n     U.S. Commerce Secretary in his mind.\n       The first was of a man who had been praised after his death \n     by Northern Irish politicians of both persuasions.\n       The second was that when Mr. Brown was seen on television, \n     ``he always seemed to be smiling. He was a happy man, and \n     these days, that is as good an image as any politician could \n     project.''\n       Mr. Brown was among 33 people killed last week when their \n     plane crashed in Crostia. He had been on a trade and aid \n     mission to Bosnia and Crotia, He was also a key figure in the \n     US Administration's involvement in the Northern Ireland peace \n     process.\n       The US Ambassador, Ms. Jean Kennedy Smith, told the \n     congregation Mr. Brown had once said he felt ``a special \n     welcome and sense of humanity in Ireland, even for those who \n     are not of Irish descent. In fact, he enjoyed his time here \n     so much that President Clinton dubbed him an honorary \n     Irishman.\n       ``The missions Ron Brown led to South Africa and China, to \n     the Middle East and Northern Ireland and, finally, to Bosnia, \n     were more than trade missions. They were peace and \n     democracy missions too, missions of hope and idealism. He \n     understood that peace, prosperity and justice go hand in \n     hand.''\n       She said everyone who had known Mr. Brown, Mr. Chuck \n     Meissner and the others who died in the plane crash ``must \n     try to carry on their work for peace, for that is their \n     legacy to us.''\n       US Senator Chris Dodd, who had travelled to Ireland with \n     Mr. Brown in recent years, said on one level he had been in \n     Ireland to promote US business, but ``Ron Brown understood \n     that these trips were about far more than promoting business.\n       ``He knew that after the peace treaties were signed and the \n     guns laid to rest, the possibility of a truly lasting peace \n     depended on each person having the same opportunity to \n     realize their dreams of a better tomorrow. He sought to heal \n     the lingering anguish and ethnic violence with the promise of \n     brighter opportunities.\n       ``On the trip to Ireland, I . . . watched an African-\n     American born and raised in Harlem with no ties here come and \n     champion the cause of peace and economic opportunity in \n     Ireland.''\n       The Taoiscach, Mr. Bruton hailed Mr. Brown as a role model \n     ``for those looking for inspiration as to how a life can be \n     led for the good of others''. He said Mr. Brown had brought \n     his experience of a Harlem upbringing and his involvement in \n     the civil rights movement to work towards the creation of ``a \n     structure of peace'' in the world.\n       ``As head of the Irish Government I want to thank him for \n     the enormous interest he took in peace and prosperity on this \n     small island.''\n       Ireland was not a major strategic interest for the US, he \n     said. The US could have confined itself to expressing pious \n     words and the occasional reference to Ireland at election \n     time. But the Clinton Administration had gone far beyond \n     that.\n       The President, who is in the west of Ireland, was \n     represented at the service by her aide-decamp, Col. Bernard \n     Howard. The attendance included the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. \n     Sean D. Dublin Bay Loftus.\n       The Government was also represented by the Minister for \n     Finance, Mr. Quinn; the Minister for Enterprise and \n     Employment, Mr. Bruton; and the Minister for Tourism and \n     Trade, Mr. Kenny. Ministers of State present included Mr. Pat \n     Rabbitte and Mr. Austin Currie.\n       Other politicians attending included the ?ianna ??il deputy \n     leader, Ms. Mary O'Rourke, the Progressive Democrats leader, \n     Ms. Mary Harney, and the former PD leader, Mr. Desmond \n     O'Malley Sinn Fein was represented by Monaghan, counsellor \n     Mr. * * *\n       There was a large representation from the US Embassy.

Let me associate myself strongly with both sets \nof remarks by the Senator from Connecticut--first, as to our good \nfriend and great loss with regard to Secretary Brown, who we will miss \ngreatly. And, second, nothing could be more on our minds today than the \nhorror of last year in Oklahoma City. The moments of silence here and \nacross the country were a fitting reminder of that tragedy, but also a \ntime to feel some real gratitude toward the employees of our Federal \nGovernment, who do not always get treated with all the respect and \nadmiration they deserve. They had a very rough year in 1995. I, for \none, want to thank them for their services and the sacrifices of their \nfamilies throughout the country, particularly with regard to those who \nsuffered the loss in Oklahoma City.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3709-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3711-S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it looks like a very ambitious agenda \nhas been announced for this session until Memorial Day. I welcome much \nof that agenda, and I especially welcome the type of bill that we \nhandled yesterday, the so-called Kennedy-Kassebaum bill.\n  That bill regarding health care reform is a classic example of a \ngood, bipartisan effort that I think the American people are really \nstarved for. They want nothing more than to see those of us who have \nthe honor of being elected to Congress work together on a bipartisan \nbasis. What we did yesterday, I think, exemplifies better than anything \nelse the possibilities of working together in this body for the good of \nthe country.\n  In fact, Mr. President, in his State of the Union, President Clinton \nendorsed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, saying that that bipartisan effort \nwas acceptable to him and that he would be happy to sign it. That gave \nthe bill a lot of impetus, and I think it was a very important moment \nin the State of the Union.\n  Mr. President, the President of the United States also endorsed \nanother bipartisan bill that night on another topic that might be even \nmore fundamental--I would say it is even more fundamental than the \nimportant bill we passed yesterday. The topic that the President was \nreferring to was campaign finance reform, and the bill that he endorsed \nwas S. 1219, the first bipartisan bill on campaign reform in this body \nin about 10 years.\n  Mr. President, I rise today--and, in a moment, a couple of my \ncolleagues will also rise--to say that the time is now to take up the \nissue of campaign finance reform on this floor, to take up this \nbipartisan effort, which, among other things, will, for the first time, \nvoluntarily limit the overall amount a candidate can spend when they \nrun for the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives, and for the \nfirst time say that you have to get a majority of your campaign \ncontributions from individuals, from the people from your own home \nState, not from PAC's or from out-of-staters, but the majority from \nyour own home State, if you want to get the benefits of the bill; and \nfinally, for the very first time, some reasonable incentives to get \npeople to not spend unlimited amounts of their own cash, so that people \nget the sickening feeling that elections can be bought.\n  All of this is highlighted in S. 1219. In doing so, of course, Mr. \nPresident, I especially pay tribute to the first sponsor of the bill, \nwho has been central to the bipartisan reform efforts in the 104th \nCongress, the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain.\n  He has been steadfast and very dedicated to this effort. He, I, and \nthe others who are involved in this speak almost every day about how we \ncan move this effort from concept to fruition during the 104th \nCongress.\n  In addition, my friend who will speak next, the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, and others have worked together almost on \na daily basis to try to move this issue forward. We have been very \nencouraged that this is not just happening in this House. It is also \nhappening in the other body where another very similar bipartisan \neffort is being led by a group of people from very disparate \nideological viewpoints. It is one of the rare examples, I am told, \nwhere there is not just a bipartisan effort going on but a bicameral \neffort, a real groundswell of effort in both Houses working together \nfor campaign finance reform.\n  Of course, I would be remiss not to mention the tremendous public \nsupport we are finding for S. 1219--groups like Common Cause, Public \nCitizens, and over 50 newspapers have endorsed the bill.\n  So I think it is fair to say we are in an excellent position to say \nthat the time is now to have this issue debated on the floor.\n  So I, Senator McCain, and the others who have been working together \non this bill have come to the conclusion that it may well be necessary \nnow to seek to amend another piece of legislation, perhaps the next \nappropriate vehicle, to move this issue forward given the inability of \nhaving this bill scheduled on its own at this point. I would prefer--I \nthink we would all prefer--that the bill be scheduled separately. But, \ngiven the passage of time, I think we have very little alternative.\n  Mr. President, given the unprecedented level of bipartisan support, \nthere is clearly a consensus among the public that S. 1219 ought to \ncome to the floor. Admittedly, there was a time some years ago when I \ndid not think we could, having passed campaign finance reform in both \nHouses in the 103d Congress and see it die. I was skeptical. When I \nread the Contract With America and saw the other party win the \nelection, campaign finance reform was not even mentioned in the \nContract With America.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, thanks to Members of both parties, this \nis truly a bipartisan effort. The reform agenda has arisen in the 104th \nCongress. It has been proven by not just introducing but by succeeding \non the issues of the gift ban and lobby reform for which my friend from \nMinnesota was very central to in both causes. These are among the very \nfew real accomplishments thus far in the 104th Congress. So the reform \nagenda has done surprisingly well.\n  Mr. President, I want to especially remind the body today that it is \nimportant to do this. This is not just one Senator's view of what ought \nto be on the floor or just the view of the cosponsors of the bill. This \nis the will of the body of the U.S. Senate as voted on a bipartisan \nbasis in July of 1995.\n  Mr. President, last July I authored a bipartisan resolution that \nsimply said we should consider campaign finance reform during the 104th \nCongress. I thought it would be a quick voice vote and be put away. But \nit was tested. It was sorely tested. The majority leader left his \noffice and came to the floor personally and urged that that resolution \nwhich I had proposed be defeated, and called for a rollcall. As we \nknow, the majority leader rarely fails to prevail. The majority leader \nalmost never fails to get a majority. But on this one he did, and 13 \nRepublicans joined with many Democrats so that on a 57 to 41 vote the \nSenate voted not to table our resolution that campaign finance reform \nshould be considered during the 104th Congress. Subsequently, in the \nnext vote, campaign finance reform was added to a list of items that we \nall voted to say ought to be considered in the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I think that was a very key sign of the desire of this \nbody to do campaign finance reform. I certainly believed that every \nSenator, when they said they wanted the issue considered, meant that \nthey wanted it considered in a timely manner so that campaign finance \nreform could become law. In other words, I did not consider this to be \nsomething that Senators would want to do so late that it would not wind \nits way through this difficult process, and so that it would not get to \nthe President who has said he is ready to sign the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, since that time, many other items that were on that \nlist that we all voted for have been passed or dealt with. Welfare \nreform has been dealt with, the Defense Department authorization, \nBosnia arms embargo, job training, and legislative branch \nappropriations have all been considered on the floor of the Senate--but \nnot campaign finance reform.\n  Here we are in mid-April in the second year of the 104th Congress \nwith no debate on campaign finance reform, no consideration, and thus \nfar no votes on the issue.\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\n  So this is obviously somewhat troubling, and it becomes much more \ntroubling when we have a spate of news articles this week announcing \nwhat the agenda will be during this floor period ending with Memorial \nDay. In fact, we have begun the first of several days now that are \ngoing to be devoted not to campaign finance reform but just to the \nissue of term limits. Admittedly, many Americans want that debate on \nterm limits. But where is the mention in the agreement about when \ncampaign finance reform will come up?\n  Some might say the bill need hearings. It has had extensive hearings \nin front of the Senate Rules Committee--helpful, meaningful hearings. \nBut that opportunity has now been given, and the time has come to move \nforward.\n  So, Mr. President, before I yield to my other colleagues, let me say \nthat I remain very optimistic about this bill. We have preferred to go \nthe route of a separate bill, and maybe that can still happen. But we \nhave no choice at this point but to move forward and try to amend \nanother piece of legislation.\n  Some are saying that there is already not enough time to pass this \nbill in this Congress. But do know what that is? That is wishful \nthinking on the part of those who want this bill to go away. That is \nwhat you say when you hope you will try to slow the momentum of those \npushing this issue. You tell everyone there is not enough time and we \ncannot do it until they move on to other things. But supporters of this \nbill all across the country know that we have bipartisan momentum and \nthat we will come to the floor in the near future. And once that act \nbegins, the public support and feeling about this issue will keep the \nissue moving in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, on this one, the public knows because of the \nbipartisan support that they will reject excuses that there was not \nenough time. They know that 6 months remain, at least, before we \nadjourn, and they will certainly tell anyone who tries to tell them \nthere was not time, they will say that, if there is a will, there is a \nway.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very encouraged that we are ready to move.\n  I now yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me just say that I am really proud \nto have introduced this bill with Senator Feingold, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Thompson. Now we have Senator Gramm and Senator Kassebaum. I \nthink that is a really good, bipartisan working group.\n  I am also especially proud to be out here with my colleague from \nWisconsin from the Midwest. I think both of us see this issue in really \nthe same way. This is all about trust.\n  There was in the Washington Post not too long ago an article about \nthe Harvard-Kaiser Foundation study--really, the erosion of trust that \npeople have in basic institutions of American life. By the way, right \nthere at the top of the Congress is politics. I think it is because of \nthe money choice and the appearance of corruption and gifts. By the \nway, I am not arguing that there is individual corruption. I do not \nbelieve that. But the point is people want to have a political process \nthat they believe in. They yearn for a political process that they \nbelieve in. All too often money is too important in campaigns.\n  When I first came here almost 6 years ago, I came to the floor of the \nSenate. I said that the whole question of the way in which money \ndominates politics has become the ethical issue of our time. I have \ngiven many, many speeches on the floor of the Senate about the need for \ncampaign finance reform. I have introduced many amendments and many \nbills. I thought at the end of the last Congress we were going to pass \na bill. But it was filibustered and blocked at the end.\n  But, Mr. President, let me just say that it just looks awful for the \nCongress to try to stonewall this issue. I do not think symbolic \npolitics is going to work. On the House side they are talking about \nsome committee or commission and another study. This has an Alice in \nWonderland quality to it--appoint another study by another commission \nfollowed by the same recommendations, followed by the same inaction, \nfollowed by nothing happening.\n  We know what the problems are. The problems are clear. There is too \nmuch money in the political process. It is too important in determining \nthe outcome of elections. It gives the appearance of corruption. We \nshould have a more open political process, and we should make every \neffort possible to try to get a lot of this big money out of politics.\n  Mr. President, I do not have time to go into the features. But trying \nto get some agreed-upon limits makes all the sense in the world. Trying \nto have some accountability about where the money comes from makes all \nthe sense in the world. Trying to move toward debates and have a \npolitical process more accountable to people makes all the sense in the \nworld.\n  I do not agree with every provision. I think the $250,000 limit on \nwhat an individual can spend on his campaign is too high. A lot of us \ncannot afford that.\n  I also think there is a variable campaign limit that goes up if your \nopponent does not agree, and I would like to work on improving that.\n  We came together as a bipartisan working group because we decided the \ntime is now. The idea of campaign finance reform is an idea, \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, whose time has come in \nAmerica. The idea for campaign finance reform for politics, for \ncampaigns and for elections that people can believe in, this is an idea \nwhose time has come in America.\n  This is deja vu to me, I say to my colleague from Wisconsin. We tried \nto do it on gift ban and lobbying disclosure. We kept getting put off \nand put off and put off. In all due respect to my colleagues, it just \nlooks to me as if some people are not listening. We are not out here \nfor symbolic reactions. We just announced, all of us together, we will \nbring this to the floor in May as an amendment if we do not get a time \ncertain for an up-or-down vote on this piece of legislation, and we \nintend for the Senate to go on record in May. It is important that all \nof us do it. It is important we do it in a bipartisan way.\n  Let me just say again this is all about trust. We want, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, people to trust this political process. We want \npeople to trust their Congress. We want people to have trust in their \npublic officials. I am just telling you that this system in which all \nof us have to operate is fundamentally flawed. It is a core problem. It \nis badly needing reform. There is enough time that has gone by, and we \nare not going to let this Congress stonewall it. We are going to make \nsure that action is taken by this Senate and that action will be taken \nthis May.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. I yield the remainder of my time to the junior Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n  I join in the proposition that it is time we address the issue of \ncampaign finance reform in this body. It is too bad that we are having \nto consider it in what may be considered the midst of a Presidential \ncampaign year. It should not be a partisan matter. Senator John McCain, \nof course, has been the leader, along with Senator Feingold, on the \nbill on which I am privileged to be one of the original cosponsors. So \nwe are trying to take a bipartisan look at it.\n  We have spent entirely too much time in times past as parties trying \nto figure out what would be to our advantage and our disadvantage, and \nboth parties have done that. Nobody really knows the result of reforms \nwe might make in terms of the success of political parties. I continue \nto believe that the primary ingredient is the quality of the candidate \nand the quality of the message regardless of what rules we play under.\n  I have the simple belief that there is too much money in the system. \nI know that it is becoming currently in vogue to say there is not \nenough money in the system; we need to have more. I do not believe \nthat. I have had the opportunity in very short order to run as a \nchallenger. I am now running for reelection after 2 years. Because I \nhad the unexpired term of Vice President Gore, I am now running as an \nincumbent. I have seen it from both sides. It\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\ntakes entirely too much time to raise the millions of dollars it takes \nto run for political office in this country, time that we ought to be \nspending on the Nation's business.\n  People are cynical of the system that we now have. After a brief rise \nin public opinion, it seems, after the last Congress, we are going \nright back to where Congress has always been in the view of the \nAmerican people, and that is basically abysmally very low. People look \nat the huge amounts of money in the system that both parties raise, \nthat all candidates raise if they have any hope of being successful, \nand they simply do not think there is no relationship between the huge \namounts of money being paid out and the actions that are being taken.\n  That is one of the reasons why people have less and less faith in \ntheir Government. It is heavily weighted toward incumbents. As I have \nsaid, I have seen it from both sides now, as the old song goes, and \nincumbency brings the finances that a challenger cannot bring against a \nwell-entrenched incumbent who has had the opportunity to spend the last \nseveral years raising money and putting it back. Someone must have the \ntemerity to go out and challenge him and overcome that big advantage \nthe incumbent has.\n  That is not a good system. It is not serving us well. We can look at \nthe bottom line and tell it is not serving us well. It is not producing \nthe results. Whether it is the fiscal policy or social policy or \nanything you want to look at in terms of the indicators as to what \ndirection our country is going, it is not producing the results we want \nto see produced in this country.\n  There are a lot of problems with any particular piece of legislation. \nI am sure there are problems with the piece that we will be supporting. \nTo me, it is a much broader and more basic question than whether you \nhave a $1,000 limit or a $500 limit or $250 or $5,000 or even whether \nyou have PAC's or not. Political action committees were touted as a \ngreat reform measure just a few years ago. Now they are out of favor. I \ndo not think it makes any difference. Individuals can contribute around \nPAC's anyway. PAC's at least are fully disclosed and there are some \nlimitations on them. The same people contributing to the PAC's can \ncontribute individually. So that is all kind of a sideshow as far as I \nam concerned. I think if we can do something about the overall amounts \nwe will be making real progress.\n  So I join with my colleague's statement, and I am looking forward to \nmaking some progress on this, this year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have heard from several of my \ncolleagues about the need to move forward on campaign finance reform. I \nwholeheartedly agree--but we must not move forward without reviewing, \nanalyzing, and understanding what those reforms entail.\n  Campaign finance reform is indeed a very important issue and one that \nhas received increasing publicity and discussion among the American \npeople.\n  The Senate Rules Committee has taken a bipartisan lead in bringing \nthe full spectrum of the issues surrounding campaign finance to this \ndiscussion, and there are many important and significant issues \nsurrounding the reform efforts.\n  In a series of hearings specifically designed to permit the \nexamination and full discussion of this very important subject, the \nRules Committee has heard from Senators McCain, Feingold, Thompson, \nWellstone, Feinstein, and Bradley, about legislation they have \nproposed. We have also received testimony from Members of the House--\nMessrs. Shays and Meehan, and Mrs. Smith--on legislation they \nintroduced in the House.\n  We have benefited in our understanding of the scope of these \nproposals from several distinguished lawyers and scholars who have \nraised significant--and serious--concerns about the constitutionality \nof some of the proposed reforms. This should cause every Senator to \ntread slowly, and ensure we have the benefit of full analysis. It \nremains my greatest concern that many of the reform proposals carry a \nhigh risk of being held unconstitutional. The American people would be \nrendered a serious disservice if we were to knowingly pass legislation \nwhich would likely prove to be an empty solution to the problems \nassociated with campaign financing. To this end I have asked--just this \npast Wednesday--that the chairmen of the Republican and Democratic \nNational Committees provide us with their analysis of the \nconstitutionality of several of the major reform proposals, including: \nThe ban on political action committees; the limitations placed on \nindependent expenditures; and the soft money restrictions placed on the \npolitical parties.\n  In addition to appreciating the constitutional problems with some of \nthe reform proposals, we need to understand the effects of these \nproposals. We should not head into a darkened tunnel without benefit of \na light.\n  To this end, we heard pros and cons for various aspects of campaign \nfinance reform from prestigious policy institutes--CATO Institute, \nBrookings Institute, and Heritage Foundation, as well as general calls \nfor significant reform by several advocate groups.\n\n  Our hearings have permitted organizations and individuals to provide \nus with their perspective of campaign finance reform proposals that \nwould eliminate political action committees [PAC's] and the bundling of \nfunds.\n  We have also learned about the costs and management problems \nassociated with the proposals that candidates for election be given \nreduced-fee postage. There is no free lunch--reduced-fee postage \nultimately means increased prices to the American postal user. This \ndoes not necessarily mean the idea is bad, but we should understand \nwhat the costs are and who we are asking to bear those costs.\n  The committee has also heard positive, thought-provoking testimony \nabout new ideas for reform that should be considered in any campaign \nreform evaluation. Ideas such as increasing the spending limits to \nadjust for inflation and increasing the role of the political parties \nin supporting campaigns.\n  In our continuing effort to cover the issues in a complete and timely \nmanner, our next hearing is scheduled for May 8. We will bring \nrepresentatives of the broadcast industry to address the costs and \nmechanics of implementing the reduced-fee broadcast proposals. We also \nhope to have testimony on the broadcast industry's efforts to \nvoluntarily provide free broadcast time for the Presidential election--\nand assess the applicability of this effort to Senate elections.\n  In addition, we will hear from a panel of experts on the issue of \ncampaign financing and reform, who will hopefully present meaningful \nanalysis of the proposals as well as provide us with concrete and \nclearly constitutional suggestions for meaningful reform.\n  These bipartisan hearings are providing the basis for intelligent and \nmeaningful floor discussion and knowledgeable voting when the vote is \ntaken.\n  We should not proceed without hearing from those who are directly \naffected; without understanding the constitutional concerns associated \nwith some of the reform proposals; or without permitting those who have \nstudied this matter to present their understanding of the consequences \nof the proposed reforms and their suggestions for improvement.\n  I assure my fellow Senators, the Rules Committee will continue to \nhold hearings at an aggressive pace to cover the remaining issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 4 minutes yielded to the Senator from \nTennessee have expired. The Senator from California is informed there \nare 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3711-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3713-S3714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ALIEN SMUGGLING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last evening, I had a brief \nopportunity to indicate to the majority leader my view of the \nimportance of the illegal immigration bill and my hope that it would be \nrestored to the floor very shortly.\n  Yesterday, the Justice Department made a series of arrests on the \nwest coast which I believe underscore the need for this bill to be \nrapidly considered by this Senate and hopefully passed.\n  Arrests were made yesterday in San Francisco of persons involved in \nlarge-scale alien smuggling. They capped a 3-year investigation by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. attorney in the \nnorthern district of California. This operation was\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\nknown as Operation Sea Dragon, and the investigation resulted in a \nsealed four-count indictment of 23 people, all of whom were members of \norganized and violent gangs.\n  The investigation revealed that a number of powerful New York-based \ngangs, including the White Tigers, the Fuk Ching, and the Broom Street \nBoys, joined forces with two Bay Area gangs to smuggle several hundred \naliens from China into the United States in 1993.\n  According to the U.S. attorney's office, a San Francisco-based \nVietnamese gang was responsible for furnishing the fishing vessels to \nferry the smuggled aliens from the mother ship to the coast. A Chinese \ngang operating out of Oakland then arranged for land transportation and \ndrop houses to facilitate the aliens' travel to New York. More than 270 \nillegal Chinese aliens were detained when the two fishing boats, the \nAngel and the Pelican, landed in San Francisco Bay. As many as 15 \npassengers escaped and an additional 24 smuggled aliens were arrested \nlater at a drop house in New York City.\n  Initially, five people were arrested in San Francisco in connection \nwith the arrival of the two ships. These five smugglers were sentenced \nin June 1994 to just--to just 2 years in prison.\n  What is interesting is that it is clear from the level of \nsophistication in this particular operation that organized smuggling of \nillegal aliens is now becoming a huge business. It is estimated at more \nthan $3 billion a year. It is also clear from the relatively light \nsentences imposed on those involved that the current penalties do not \noutweigh the fortune illegal alien smugglers win by breaking the law. \nAnd that is the point of my remarks today.\n  Since August 1991, at least 21 boatloads carrying almost 3,000 \nillegal aliens have been intercepted in U.S. waters by American \nauthorities, 3 near Los Angeles, 4 outside San Diego, and 3 in San \nFrancisco, including the 2 ships involved in this story.\n  The State Department estimates that today there are at least 50 ships \nused by smugglers, or being constructed to smuggle immigrants. \nSmugglers cram hundreds of illegal immigrants into decrepit ships in \ninhumane, cramped quarters where all kinds of abuse often occurs. They \nare often subject to near starvation. They arrive to lives as \nindentured workers, and they struggle to pay off their crossing debts \nwhich reportedly are around $25,000 to $30,000.\n  Currently the maximum penalty for this kind of smuggling is 5 years. \nThe 23 people indicted in these sealed indictments, these sealed arrest \nindictments, will be charged with 4 counts, including conspiracy, \ntransportation and harboring of illegal aliens. Each count carries a \nmaximum penalty of just 5 years and a fine of $250,000.\n  If past sentences handed down in similar cases serve as any \nindication, it is likely that most of these 23 will serve either a \nyear-and-a-half or maybe somewhat more. So, less than 3 years will be \nserved for smuggling nearly 300 people into the country. That is one of \nthe reasons why present Federal sentences do in no way, shape, or form \ndeter this kind of activity.\n  The illegal immigration bill proposed by the Judiciary Committee, and \nwhich was taken down by the majority leader, provides much stronger \nsentences. Federal prosecutors around my State have asked that the \nCongress increase the penalties against alien smugglers, and the bill \ndoes just that. It doubles the maximum sentence for alien smuggling \nfrom the current 5 years to 10 years for the first and second offenses. \nIf a third offense occurs, the maximum penalty is increased to 15 \nyears.\n\n  The bill would make alien smuggling a predicate act under RICO. This \nwould mean that longer prison sentences could be handed down if other \ncrimes were committed, and in general that the racketeering statutes \ncould be applied.\n  It would also allow fines amounting to twice the profit made through \nsmuggling to be imposed. And it would change the penalty so that \nsmugglers can be charged with a violation for each person smuggled. \nCurrent law makes it one criminal act, regardless of the number of \npeople smuggled.\n  It would also make any person who knowingly hires an illegal alien or \nsmuggled alien subject to a fine and up to 5 years in prison. It would \nincrease prison sentences for smugglers who bring an alien into this \ncountry who later commits a crime, and it would allow asset forfeiture \nlaws to be applied.\n  The U.S. attorney says to us, if this legislation had already become \nlaw, the sentences to these 23 smugglers arrested yesterday would be \nincreased by 50 to 100 percent. Instead of facing maximum sentences of \n20 years, they would be 30 to 40 years, and the end result would be \nthat the actual time served would increase.\n  I would like to particularly congratulate U.S. Attorney Michael \nYamaguchi, the INS, and all the Federal agents involved in this \nsuccessful investigation.\n  Now the Congress must do its job to see that the laws in place are \nadequate to deter this kind of illegal alien smuggling. The bill also \nprovides an opportunity to stop illegal immigration--a huge, huge \nproblem in the State of California, with 2 million people there now \nillegally--the ability to stop it at the borders.\n  It would include an additional 700 Border Patrol officers. It would \ninclude $12 million for infrastructure, for roads and for fencing. And \nit would include an additional 300 INS investigators. It would also \ntoughen the so-called employer sanctions promulgated in 1986.\n  I can only tell you that Proposition 187 passed overwhelmingly in the \nState of California, the largest State in the Union. If this is not a \nmessage that reaches this Congress, I do not know what kinds of actions \nit takes. So I would simply like to say, please, majority leader, I say \nthis very sincerely, reschedule this bill soon so the many amendments \npending can be considered, so this floor can engage in a practical, a \nfair, and a just debate, and so that those sanctions that can prevent \nillegal immigration into this country can be revised and based on \nmodern-day needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HONORABLE EDMUND S. MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle in paying respect to a giant of contemporary \npolitics. Edmund S. Muskie, loyal son of Maine, selflessly gave his \nentire life to public service. His passing is a profound loss, but his \nshining example of integrity and decency is a legacy for all Americans \nto admire.\n  A man of deep intellect, wisdom, and passion, Edmund Muskie graduated \nfrom Maine's Bates College to serve three terms as State legislator, \ntwo terms as Maine's Governor, and 22 years in the U.S. Senate. He \nanswered President Carter's call to resign from the Senate to become \nSecretary of State.\n  As David Broder of the Washington Post has pointed out, Muskie was a \npolitician of rare vision, one who addressed two overriding national \nissues decades before most others--shifting responsibility from the \nFederal Government to the States, and putting America's fiscal house in \norder.\n  While often supporting activist Government, Muskie recognized that \nmany programs needed to be tailored to the varying situations in each \nof the 50 States. Indeed, he was ahead of his time. He was the first \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee and he fought to keep deficits \nof the 1960's a minute fraction of what they have become today.\n  Perhaps standing above all his many achievements is his lead in \ncreating a cleaner environment. He worked tirelessly to create \nbipartisan support for landmark environmental laws which have allowed \nour children to grow up in a more healthy and beautiful America.\n  So today, we pay tribute to a man who cared deeply for his native \nState, his New England, and his country. We grieve with his family, and \nhope their time of suffering is alleviated in some way by knowing that \nAmerica is grateful for his service and shares in their loss. Edmund \nMuskie, a great man, made the United States a greater nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3713-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3714-S3715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

If \nthe amendment process had not been completed, it was the fear of this \nSenator and many others on this side of the aisle that other Members \nwere intending to offer an amendment which would not be relevant to the \npending term limits legislation. With the so-called amendment tree now \nfilled, it is the hope of this Senator that the debate will now stay \nfocused on this very important legislation.\n  It is also the understanding of this Senator that later today, the \nmajority leader will file a cloture motion on the joint resolution \nwhich will allow for a cloture vote on Tuesday, April 23, 1996.\n  I appreciate the cooperation and support of the majority leader for \nbringing this issue before the Senate in such a timely manner, and I \nlook forward to a vigorous debate today, Monday and Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1994, in my campaign for reelection to \nthe U.S. Senate, term limits was part of that campaign, and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee has picked up the yoke, so to speak, and is trying to do \nsomething about that. I was not convinced, when I first came to the \nU.S. Senate, that term limits was needed, but I am even more convinced \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed as in \nmorning business for just the next 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Tennessee. I thank \nthe Chair. I have Americans on my mind today, and I am concerned that \nmaybe some of us are not listening, especially the President and the \nDemocrats, to America as closely as they should.\n  One stark realization, when I was home over the Easter break a few \ndays ago, is that I filed and paid my taxes, like 115 million other \nAmericans did. I imagine that most of them were a little bit upset \nafter they paid the taxes. More than two-thirds of all taxpaying \nAmericans, in a recent poll, think taxes are too high. Well, that is \nnot a very revealing thing, because we know two-thirds of them probably \npay taxes and they probably think they are too high. A third think they \nare about right, and just 1 percent think they are too low.\n  Americans are a little upset--the people I talked to--and they have \ngood reason to be. The Federal Government demands more and more of \ntheir hard-earned money and gives less and less in return. But there \nmay be a blessing in that. Maybe we are lucky we are not getting all \nthe Government that we pay for.\n  But I believe that this President, in the 1993 tax bill or the budget \nthat at that time would put the biggest tax increase on the American \npeople that this country had ever seen, was wrong on taxes and was also \nwrong on spending--both ends of the spectrum.\n\n  I think it is time that we extended the debate on the role of the \nFederal Government. In fact, if 1994 taught us anything, it is to say, \n``Let's reexamine the role of Government at all levels, State, local, \nand Federal, and identify what we are supposed to be doing.''\n  Americans are on my mind, because the average hard-working American \nnow works 2 hours 47 minutes of every single day just to pay their \ntaxes. The average family pays 38.2 percent of the total income in \ntaxes paid each year. This means that he or she will work 128 days, \nuntil May 7 of this year, just to pay its taxes.\n  A typical family pays the Federal Government before it pays its \nmortgage, before it puts food on the table, before it puts clothes on \ntheir kids' back. We must change the direction that the curve is \nheaded. We must change and we must stop that curve. Government is hard \nput because taxes are easy to raise. Most Americans may be astonished \nto know that their taxes have been raised 16 times in the past 30 \nyears, as opposed to being lowered only once. With only a simple \nmajority required to raise taxes, it is easier to pass a tax hike than \nit is to cut runaway entitlement programs.\n  President Clinton proved this in 1993 when he pushed through the \nDemocratic Congress the largest tax increase in Congress, and I alluded \nto that before. Even today, the Federal debt continues to skyrocket \nbecause President Clinton refuses to sign a budget that brings down the \nyearly deficit. Not only has the President blocked passage of a \nbalanced budget, but he has also taken away the middle class tax cut \nthat Republicans promised in 1994 and that he also promised in 1992.\n  I want to bring up one figure, too, that a lot of folks do not \nrealize. Here is how important this is. Forty percent of the income \ntaxes you paid this year to the Federal Government just went to service \nthe national debt, to pay the interest on the national debt--40 \npercent. We cannot allow that to happen if our children and their \nchildren are to have the same opportunities that we had in our growing \nup and the opportunities to live in a great and free country.\n  Americans are on my mind today because of high taxes on American \nfamilies, businesses are strangling, the economy is hurting, and they \nare hurting our children's future. They have to come down.\n  So, as Americans are on my mind, and I think they are on the minds of \nmany of my distinguished colleagues who represent real people in a real \nworld, we must demand this Government to tighten its belt first rather \nthan making you tighten yours. It is a problem that is magnified every \nday in the private sector. All one has to do is go home and just go \ndown that path. Before we ever become Senators or Representatives, \nbefore we ever have anything to do with Government, in our private \nlife, we should talk to the real folks that make America great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3717-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICA CONTINUES TO BE GREAT\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I would like to take up once again the \nbusiness before the Chamber, the constitutional amendment on term \nlimits. This amendment would provide for a limitation of 12 years for \nMembers of the U.S. Senate and 12 years for the House of \nRepresentatives. It is a constitutional amendment which will require \ntwo-thirds vote of this body and then ratification by the States. It is \nprospective in nature. That is what we are about here today.\n  It has been a long time coming. I believe this is the first time that \na constitutional term limits amendment has worked its way through the \ncommittee system. I was proud to be able to sponsor the amendment \ncoming out of the Judiciary Committee, and now we find it finally on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate for the first time in history.\n  I appreciate the leadership and the assistance of the majority leader \nin seeing that this has come about.\n  There was a term limits vote in 1947, as I read my history. I think \nterm limits got one vote at that time. So it has been right at 50 years \nnow since there has been any vote at all on the issue of term limits.\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\n  I find that absolutely remarkable because poll after poll after poll \nindicates that upward of 70 to 75 percent of the people in this country \nsupport term limits. I cannot think of anything else that enjoys such \nbroad popular support that cannot even find its way on to the floor, \nmuch less get passed, before the Congress.\n  In a day and time when we are all hooked up with all kinds of \nelectronic devices in order to monitor the pulse of the American people \nalmost on an hourly basis--some say too much--there is such little time \nwe have to reflect and deliberate, but that is what we do. At a time \nwhen we take public opinion polls, it looks like about every couple of \nhours in this country, in order to test what the people want, and at a \ntime when we pick up the fact that 50 to 55 percent of the people want \nsomething in this country and we seem to jump through hoops around here \nin order to get it done and be responsive to the American people, we \nfind that when it comes to term limits, although an overwhelming \nmajority of people consistently say that they want this, it takes 50 \nyears to even get it to a vote in the U.S. Senate.\n  I find that somewhat remarkable. Obviously, the reason is because in \nour daily lives here in regulating other people's lives and in spending \nother people's moneys, when it comes to us, when it comes to maybe \nshort-circuiting what would otherwise be a lifetime political career, \nwe turn the other way and we are not quite as interested in what the \nmajority of the people want, or we come up with ingenious arguments why \nin this particular case we must show our independence and not give the \nmajority of the people what they want.\n  We cannot say no to any kind of spending program that would balance \nour budget. But in this particular instance, we need to show our \nindependence because what choice do we have if we accede to the wishes \nof the people? We would only have an additional 12 years in the U.S. \nSenate--an additional 12 years--as if this were an onerous proposition.\n  It is not an onerous proposition. It is not revolutionary. It is \nsomething that was contemplated by our Founding Fathers, who knew that \nfrom time to time circumstances would change and who provided in the \nConstitution a way to address those changing circumstances. \nCircumstances have indeed changed, and we will address those and why we \nneed this particular amendment.\n  Let us talk for a moment about what the effort to get the \nconstitutional amendment for term limits on to the floor is not all \nabout. It is not about simply changing new faces for old faces. It is \nnot about simply replacing people for the sake of replacing people. It \nis not because of any vindictiveness because we are mad at Congress, as \na lot of people are, and that we want to punish somebody. It is not \nabout that at all.\n  As a matter of fact, it is about just the opposite. It is about \nmaking Congress more credible with the American people. It is about \nenhancing the stature of Congress. Syndicated columnist George Will \nwrote a book a few years ago entitled ``Restoration.'' It was about \nterm limits and the need for term limits. He is an individual who, he \nsays, opposed term limits for many, many years; and for a variety of \nreasons he came to believe that this was perhaps the only way that we \nwould be able to work our way out of our problems that we are getting \ndeeper and deeper into in this country.\n  But why would he call his book on term limits ``Restoration''? It is \nbecause he believes that term limits would be something that would \nrestore and enhance the credibility and the stature of the U.S. \nCongress. Indeed, how could it get much lower? Poll after poll after \npoll, again, indicates that after a brief blip after this last \nelection, we are back down there in the view of public opinion, the \nAmerican people, where we have been for so long that is abysmally low.\n  People have less and less confidence in their Government, have less \nand less confidence in their Congress. It is Mr. Will's view, and it is \nmy view, that if we had more of a system that was contemplated by our \nFounding Fathers who could not have dreamed of a professional \nlegislature at that time, that if we went back more to a citizen \nlegislature type approach, that people would feel closer to their \nGovernment and have more respect for it.\n\n  I mention our Founding Fathers. I was reading recently, again, after \nGeorge Washington served two terms, they beseeched him to stay on. \n``How can we lose the services of the father of our country? Surely the \nrepublic will fall if George Washington does not stay on past his two \nterms.'' George Washington knew better. That is why he goes down into \nthe history books in the manner that he has and is viewed in the manner \nthat he is viewed. He knew better. He got on his horse, road out of \ntown, and history records that he never even set foot back in \nWashington, DC.\n  The same thing with Thomas Jefferson after serving two terms. \nSurely--surely--we need Jefferson to run again because we know what \nkind of respect and admiration we have for him, and back then also. He \ntook his slings and arrows by his opponents and the press at the time, \nbut he was greatly admired and respected. He, too, knew it would be a \nbad precedent.\n  We are talking about the Presidency in those cases, but it was before \nterm limits, which, of course, we have on the Presidency. People who \nfight most vigorously against term limits for Members of Congress, who \nare usually Members of Congress, seem to be quite content to keep the \nterm limits on the Presidency, which we have. But at a time before we \nhad the term limits on the Presidency, those two great men saw the \nwisdom of serving a couple of terms and then moving on. History will \nreflect that we have had some pretty good ones to follow them, also, \nwho would not have been serving at the time that they served had the \nothers chosen to stay.\n  So that is what it is not about. It is not about change for change's \nsake. There is nothing that inherently goes wrong with an individual \nwhen he reaches a certain age or you have served in Congress for a \ncertain period of time. There is no biological changes that necessarily \ntake place. He does not become evil because of that service.\n  We are talking about doing something that will enhance the stature \nand effectiveness of the Congress. What it is about is more than the \nindividual Members who serve in this body or who have ever served in \nthis body. It is no reflection on them. It is about us as an \ninstitution, and it is about us as a nation and about our future and \nabout equipping ourselves in a way that will more effectively allow us \nto deal with what some believe to be insurmountable problems that we \nalready have, fundamental problems that we really show no indication \nthat we are capable of solving.\n  Mr. President, it is no less true that we are bankrupting this Nation \nsimply because it is heard so often. But it has happened. We know it is \nhappening. We know that the demographics are catching up with us. We \nknow that when the baby boomers start retiring, it is going to wreak \nhavoc on many of our social programs. We know that Social Security is \nin dire jeopardy. We know that Medicare is in dire jeopardy. Yet we \ncannot get to first base in doing anything about it.\n  We continue, after this so-called congressional revolution when my \nparty was rewarded at the polls and we were all brought in, even after \nall of that, we have found that as an institution--I will even include \nthe Presidency in that certainly--as a working government we cannot get \nto first base in solving the most dire fiscal problem that this country \nhas ever faced.\n  We probably cannot do enough wrong to mess things up in the next few \nyears. We will be OK. Most of us will be out of office and drawing our \npensions, and we will once again have handed the problem over to the \nnext generation. But down the road, as surely as I am standing here, we \nknow the demographers tell us that we cannot continue down the road \nthat we are on. It is just that simple. Everybody in Washington, DC, \nbehind closed doors will acknowledge that.\n  Doing something about it, of course, is the hard part. We have not \nshown any indication that we can really do anything about it. We are \ntalking about a 7-year balanced budget plan. The Republicans have tried \nmightily to get that done. We passed in the Senate for the first time \nin decades a balanced budget. The President vetoed it.\n  But even if we had that plan according to what we wanted, at the end \nof\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\nthe 7 years, our country would still be looking at a $6 trillion debt, \na $6 trillion debt. We talk about addressing this problem to the extent \nthat we claim to be addressing it with the assumption there are not \ngoing to be any recessions and not going to be any international \nconflicts and not going to be all the things that always happen--that \nalways happen.\n  What are we doing to try to get to the first step? We are arguing \nover the division between entitlement spending and discretionary \nspending. Nobody really wants to do anything about entitlement spending \nbecause where the problem is is also where the votes are. It is tough \nto tell people we cannot continue to do things the same old way and we \ncannot continue to increase every year at the rate of 10 percent. \nEverybody knows it. We do not have the ability to tell that to \nanybody, because we are afraid to, because we want to get reelected, \nand we want the campaign contributions that come from it.\n\n  The plans that have been laid on the table, and I will be as \nbipartisan as I can about this, all the plans that have been laid on \nthe table back end load the problem. The President's plan does it more \nthan any of the rest of them, but all of them back end load the \nproblem. So when we come up with a so-called balanced budget, all we \nare doing is putting numbers down on a piece of paper, hoping that \nyears later some future Congress will have the guts to do what we do \nnot have the guts to do, and we claim we will slash discretionary \nspending in the outyears, after we are out of office.\n  That is what will happen. That is the way we balance the budget. That \nis hogwash. It will not happen and everybody knows it is not going to \nhappen. That is the best-case scenario. That is the best-case scenario.\n  If we made that initial downpayment, that is what we would be doing. \nIt is not really a downpayment. If it really were a downpayment, we \nwould still be looking at very bleak fiscal circumstances on down the \nroad. That is not even to address the need that we have in so many \nother areas.\n  We talk about--we who call ourselves conservatives--talk about the \nneed to reduce the rate of growth of some of these spending programs \nwhich has surely got to be done--and will be done, also, one way or \nanother or we will monetize the debt and inflate our way out of it and \nbecome a second-rate country.\n  What we do not talk about sometimes is the fact that we need to spend \nmore in certain areas in terms of our infrastructure, in terms of \nresearch and development, things of that nature. What do those things \nhave in common that the things I have been talking about do not? It has \nto do with the future. There is no immediate payoff for infrastructure \nand research and development and things that will make our industry \nstronger, policies that will make our industry stronger down the road. \nThere is no immediate political payoff for that. It is difficult to \nexplain that to people.\n  What is not difficult to explain is a check in the mail 10 percent \nmore than the check you got in the mail last year. That is what is \ndriving the process. That is why we are in the position we are in.\n  So not only are the demographics going to catch up with us as far as \nour spending problems are concerned, we are going--without taking care \nof some basic fundamental needs that any strong nation has, because all \nthis money is being eaten up with regard to a handful of programs \nwhich, with the increased interest on the national debt, is facing us \nwith catastrophic circumstances.\n  You will hear the debate now that the deficit has gone down a little \nbit. Well, it does not make any difference if you look down the road \njust a little, if we look past our nose--and that is about as long \nrange as we look or plan anymore in this country. When our competitors \nthink in terms of decades, we think in terms of the next election and \nnext quarterly statement if we are a corporation. If we look past our \nnose, the temporary ups and downs, the demographics and what is built \ninto the system is simply going to kill us. It cannot be sustained.\n  That is what term limits is about. You wonder maybe where this comes \nin, that and what term limits is all about. It is not about kicking a \nbunch of people out. It is a system, a system. What kind of a system is \nit that produced what I just described? What kind of a system is it \nthat we have that has produced those circumstances?\n  In the first place, it is not a system that we have had since the \nhistory of the country. I mentioned changed circumstances and our \nconstitutional framework being such and our Founding Fathers being wise \nenough to see that there would be times and circumstances when we would \nhave to adjust our underlying document to meet those changing \ncircumstances. You look back in the days of the Founding Fathers and \nlook at the challenges that they faced, it seems to me like, in many \ncases, or in most cases, it was more of an intellectual challenge. You \nneeded people who understood history. You needed people who knew about \nother governments. You needed people who understood human nature. You \nneeded some philosophers. Yes, you even needed some lawyers and people \nwho understood Constitutions and how laws were written. But you needed \nthose intellectual traits that really laid down the most noble document \nin the history of the world as far as what secular man has produced. We \ngot it.\n\n  Then it seems to me that as time came along in the 1930's and the \n1940's, new challenges were presented. We had the Great Depression, \nwhich my mother tells me about. We had a major war, a world war. At \nthat time we needed inspiration. We needed programs. We need the \nGovernment to do the things that the Government maybe had not done \nbefore. We needed unifying actions. That was the era in the beginning \nof what some referred to as the ``rhetorical Presidency,'' when FDR--\nand Woodrow Wilson was a great advocate of this--we needed somebody who \ncould rally the people and get them together to a concentrated course \nof action. That was needed during those times.\n  Those circumstances have changed now. We do not need what we needed \nbefore because we are not faced with what we were faced with before. In \nmany cases, we have to go back and revisit what we have already done, \nbecause since those times the very nature of our Government and society \nhas changed. We, as an institution, are less well equipped to deal with \nthe problems than we have ever been before. Our basic problem now is \nnot one of intellectual leadership. It is not one of rhetorical \nleadership. Our problem now is the lack of will, the lack of will to do \nwhat we know that somebody, either us or our successors, have to do. We \ndo not have the lack of will.\n  Why is it we are in such a system now? I think it is because of many \nreasons. Look at what has happened since then--the growth of \nGovernment. Government has grown mightily since then. That means \nspending, the cult of spending, the political reward you get from \nbribing taxpayers with their own money. It sounds pretty harsh, but \nthat is essentially what it amounts to. No politician was ever turned \nout of office simply because he said yes to somebody, that, yes, they \ncould have whatever they wanted. That is kind of what we feel like we \nare there to do, is to listen to people who want money, want programs, \nwant increases and want more and respond to that. It is the cult of \nspending.\n  Because of our desire not to ever want to say no to anybody, because \nthat could endanger our career, we more likely than thought, ``Go along \nwith it.'' That is a shorthand for the basic problem we have. There are \nother factors--the overall philosophy that you need somebody in the \nSenate, for example, who has been around for a long time. The idea is \nyou come up here and you stay as long as you can and then at the end of \nthe day you are in a position to get more pork for your State than \nanybody else.\n  That is the philosophy that still holds over to this day. You do not \nworry about the Nation necessarily; it will take care of itself. For a \nlong time, the Nation did take care of itself. It was like one old \nTexan said one time, ``I have watched those folks from up North talk \nabout this. They do not do it better than we do, and every time they \nget a ham, I'm going to get a hog.'' That is the way he worked his \ncareer, and he got a lot of hogs.\n  That might have been all right for a while. But now, what is good for \nthe Nation is good for the State; what is\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nbad for the Nation is bad for the State. Nothing is going to be good \nfor any particular State if it is bad for the Nation. We all live in \nthe same world. We are bringing kids up in the same world. They are all \ngoing to be suffering from the consequences of what we are doing right \nnow. But usually, again, getting back to spending, they are the ones \nthat are going to be paying 80 percent tax rates and paying \nastronomical interest rates when they go to buy their first home or \nautomobile. They are the ones who are going to suffer the consequences. \nIt is not going to make any difference to them whether or not we got an \nextra road built somewhere.\n\n  The interest groups have proliferated every year, and more and more \ncome to town. People have a right to come and petition their \nGovernment. I have never been one of those who criticize people who \ncome in and petition their Government, whether they do it personally or \nthrough a hired lobbyist. If we are going to pass laws that affect \npeople's lives, we have to expect people to come in and tell us what \neffect that is going to have. But we have passed so many laws, \nregulating so many aspects of life in America and business in America, \nand everybody now has a stake up here, and they interpret that stake in \nterms of how much more can they get from up here. It is not a matter of \nconcentrating on making the pie bigger anymore, it is a matter of \nmaking sure you get a bigger share of the pie, which means taking it \naway from somebody else. That is the fight up here.\n  As the interest groups grow and become more powerful, they have a \ncarrot and a stick for every Member of Congress. The carrot is \nfinancing them. The stick is working against them for their reelection. \nThose are powerful motivations, all under pressure and going toward the \nultimate result of more and more spending--more and more spending.\n  Someone said one time that the ultimate test of a democracy was \nwhether or not, once the people learn they can pay themselves out of \ntheir own treasury, they will never have interest rates. That is the \nquestion we are going to have to answer in this debate. I am not sure \nthat the answer is looking all that good.\n  So what will term limits do? It is no panacea, we know that. There is \nno short-term solution. This constitutional amendment process in and of \nitself certainly is not a short-term process. But what I think it will \ndo is better give us a chance to deal with these problems, to \nameliorate the influence of the cult of spending that we have all \nfallen into in this town. In the first place, it will open up the \nprocess. People will know that certain positions will be open from time \nto time, and if they ever want to serve their country a little bit and \ncome up here and look after the interests of their children and do the \nright thing, they do not have to go up against some well-entrenched \nincumbent who has all the money he can possibly use because that is \nwhere the money flows, but it is going to be open. They say, yes, I \nhave done something with my life already. I have a career, I am a small \nbusiness woman, or I am a farmer, or I am a professional person. But I \ncan give a few years, knowing that I will be coming back home before \ntoo long. I can give a few years of service. What is the motivation? \nWhat is going to be the motivation of that person to go build a \npolitical career and be timid and say, yes, and spend and spend? No, he \ncannot, because after a certain number of years, under this \nconstitutional amendment, he is out. Two terms in the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues, most of whom are going to oppose me on this \namendment, I regret to say, what it would be like to run or serve 6 \nyears in the U.S. Senate, knowing you are not going to have to raise \nany more money, and knowing that you are not going to have to worry \nabout being turned out of office. Some people do that anyway--under \nself-imposed circumstances. I have committed to do that. I do not say \nthat that is the only way to go. It is not the only way to go. I admire \nmy colleagues who say let us change the system, including me, but until \nthen I am not going to do it myself. I do not personally have any \ndesire to stay past that allotted amount of time. That is my own \npersonal decision. I am looking forward to the time when I can spend \nall of my time doing what the people sent me up here to do. That is the \nkind of system that we would have under term limits.\n  A third of the people, at all times, in this body would be under \nthose circumstances. Would that not be more likely to produce people \nwho would be willing to take some risks in leveling with the American \npeople, and saying we cannot consume any more right now because we are \ntaking it from the unborn, we are taking it from your daughter's unborn \nchild, because they will be the ones that have to pay the consequences. \nSo we cannot have that right now. How many times have you heard anybody \nsay that recently? I think if we had a different kind of system, we \nwould be more likely to see that on a consistent basis. I think we \nwould be more likely to do something about the cynicism that we have \nseen, which has been too prevalent for too many years.\n  I see other colleagues on the floor, Mr. President. So at this time, \nI will relinquish the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. President, under what order \nare we? Is the Senator yielding and controlling the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order with respect to that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the efforts of the \nSenator from Tennessee, and the Senator from Missouri, in support of \nthe amendment to the Constitution to limit terms.\n  Mr. President, wherever I travel in my State, the citizens of my \nState are vastly in support of term limits. The Senator from Tennessee \nsaid it is not a panacea, and that is right. But I do believe that the \nreason the American people are so supportive of term limits is because \nthey have come to view the Nation's Capital as a bastion, a fortress, a \nplace where their accessibility is difficult to accomplish. I think \nthey have come to believe that the responsive nature of our Capital \nCity is lacking. And they are seeking to support every tool, every form \nof discipline, which they envision might contribute to opening it up--\nlike opening windows to air things out in the springtime. They are \nlooking for tools that they believe will help break through this \nfortress, that will help bring change to the way things are managed in \nour Capital City, and that will make the Government, their elected \nofficials, more responsive.\n\n  There can be no doubt but that over the last half century Washington \nhas become a professionalized institution. The politician of today does \nnot remotely resemble what our forefathers had envisioned. They \nenvisioned legislators for an interim period. They envisioned \nlegislators who dedicated a certain portion of their lives of each year \nto legislating, but were still connected in the workplace at home. They \nwere still farmers, they were still merchants, they were still engaged \nin the life-making activities. They were not separated from the trials \nof their own fellow citizens. But today, as we have changed, and \nSenators talked about change, it is an entirely different process.\n  If you go over here to the Russell Building, which is where my office \nis, named after one of the most distinguished Members of this body, \nRichard B. Russell, of Georgia, and if you look up at the top of the \ndoors, they were all numbered differently. The reason is that each one \nof those cubicles was the entire office of a U.S. Senator. Of course, \nit is half the floor now. That Senator had a personal secretary and \nmaybe one other assistant. They got on a train, or they traveled by car \nin that day. They came to Washington, and they were here for a period \nof time entirely and then they went back. That Senator and that one \nemployee were enough to respond to all the inquiries.\n\n  Today those are vastly enlarged offices. I do not know about the \nPresiding Officer's office. But we receive 1,000 to 2,000 inquiries a \nday--a day. It vastly changed the manner in which we function, and it \ntends to separate us.\n  Term limits will cause an opening up of the process. It will free and \nmake more independent the voting of the membership. Perhaps, Mr. \nPresident, the single most important thing that\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\nterm limits will do is to bring to Washington contemporary thought \nabout the day and about the time.\n  Mr. President, in another life I had an opportunity to be director of \nthe U.S. Peace Corps. In that role, I probably met more of our \nambassadors than any other individual in the Government, with perhaps \nthe exception of the President, and I might have met more of them. \nThere has always been an argument that they should be professional and \nnot political appointees, and there is always a pressure that there be \nfewer and fewer political appointees. I always argued against it. I \nthought the majority should be Foreign Service in training. But I \nthought both the Foreign Service and the world were well served by \nmixing with these professionals contemporary thought, people who came \nfrom the workplace and who recently came from the workplace so that the \nForeign Service in the countries around the world could get a feel for \nwhat was being thought in the country at that very time.\n  It is very easy to get disconnected in the Foreign Service, and it is \nvery easy to get disconnected in this service because you are removed. \nIt is not an intentional effort, but you are removed from day-to-day \naffairs, so contemporary thought is left behind. I think term limits \naddresses that issue, just as I believe that there is a purpose and use \nfor involving in the Foreign Service's political appointments people \nwho come from the workplace, who come into that apparatus and who have \nbeen dealing with the trials of the day because they are a better \nreflection and mirror of who we are as we send these people abroad. \nThey can talk in very contemporary terms about what is happening on the \nstreets, so to speak. I think that turnover, or that bringing to the \nCapital City the most contemporary thought, is useful.\n  Both the Presiding Officer and the Senator from Tennessee are \ncontemporarily elected, and I think both agree with me that our \nattitudes are quite different than some of the colleagues who have been \nhere for an extended period of time--not necessarily better, but \ncertainly different because we have been on the hustings. We have been \nin our cities and towns. We brought the newest thoughts, one of which \nis term limits, to the Capital City. We were running for change, and I \nthink term limits would be a perpetual agent of change.\n\n  Mr. President, I will make a couple more comments and then yield.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand why we have term limits for \nmayors, for Governors, for Presidents, for State legislators, but that \nfor some reason it would have a dilatory effect on the U.S. Senate. \nSomehow my State has survived rather adequately with stringent term \nlimits. At one time you could only serve as Governor for one term. At \none time the terms were only 2 years. Yet, the State prospered and grew \nand became better. I cannot find any empirical evidence where term \nlimits have diminished the expertise, or talent, or ability of \nGovernment. In fact, I think it has had the capacity of energizing it \nbecause there was always a new personality coming into the picture, a \nnew emphasis. I think it has stimulated citizen thought because we are \nseeing an array of different personalities and ideas that are being \nbrought into the system. I think again that is what term limits will \nultimately produce.\n  I do not believe it will diminish this institution. I think it will \nhelp the institution as it has in our States as Governors and in our \ncities as mayors. This device has been a useful tool to bring \ncontemporary thought to invigorate the debate of ideas to our \ninstitutions.\n  I commend the Senator from Tennessee, I commend the Senator from \nMissouri, and others who have joined in this historic effort to bring \nthis institutional change.\n  The Senator was talking about the vast difference in our times. It \nwas de Tocqueville who warned us of the one frailty he saw in our new \ndemocracy which was that as time went on, would it be able to have the \nwill to discipline itself from the pressures of elections, the pressure \nto stay elected mounting a burden on that constantly seeking of \nelections? I think it is right to raise that issue because it is \nclearly an issue of independence and intimidation that has produced a \nfinancial dilemma for our country that could bring about the fact that \nwe are sitting here today in the U.S. Senate faced with, in the decade, \nfive different programs consuming 100 percent of the U.S. Treasury. It \nis clearly a result of a citizenry that is not functioning the way our \nforefathers intended it to function.\n\n  So I commend you and the others, and I am pleased to have had an \nopportunity to come to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. He \nhas been a leader in this effort for some time and a leader before I \ngot here. I would like to refer again to the thought that he expressed, \nthat term limits would not diminish this institution; it would enhance \nthe institution, going back to the proposition of restoration, and \nrestoring it.\n  Mr. Will pointed out in his book that back when the country was \nfounded, people would line the streets and say, ``Long live Congress, \nlong live Congress.'' Can you imagine someone--anyone--much less lining \nthe streets, today saying ``Long live Congress''?\n  I think this would do more to enhance the U.S. Congress in the eyes \nof the American people, make it a part of them, and open it up for \nthem. It would give the 250 million people in this country--we have 250 \nmillion. They say, ``My goodness, if we had term limits, we would not \nhave had Senator Jones here for all of these years. We all acknowledge \nthat our Republic would surely have fallen if we had not had Senator \nJones.'' But we have 250 million people. How many potentially wonderful \ncontributors to our society are there out there, if we open up that \nsystem for them and let them compete in the political marketplace \nwithout having to overcome the insurmountable odds and money that our \nsystem has thrown in their way?\n  I see my colleague from Missouri, whom I am proud to say I have \nwalked shoulder to shoulder with through this process. He and I have \nbeen here. No one has worked harder in this area. I see he is present.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. I want to thank the \nSenator from Tennessee for his leadership and commitment on this issue.\n  Term limits, at its core, is about fundamental American values. More \nthan anything else, a free society respects the will of the people. It \nis understood that from time to time the passion of the people will \nmove wildly in one direction or other. But when we are talking about \nterm limits, we are not talking about some passionate wave of support \nfor a novel concept.\n  Term limits is a considered understanding of a reform which is \nworking. It is a limitation on service that has been operative for the \nduration of our democracy in terms of the executive branch, with the \nexception of President Roosevelt. It is in place in States all across \nAmerica. So it is indeed consistent with one of the basic values upon \nwhich this Nation was founded--a respect for the will of the people.\n  Our ability to receive communication from the people and to respond \nconstructively is one of the reasons that I have sponsored and opened \nthe first electronic on-line petition to the Congress of the United \nStates, from the people of the United States, so that groups and \nindividuals can show their support for congressional term limits.\n  I think it is important that we provide this opportunity for the \npeople of America to indicate their support and demonstrate their \ninterest in this issue. And for groups, interest groups and citizens, \nthat have worked together on other projects, they can knock on the door \nof the U.S. Congress through the Internet and alert us. We have had \nmore than 40,000 people visit the term limits petition page.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I was wondering if I could ask the Senator \nfrom Missouri a question regarding just what he has said about this \npetition bill which the groups are trying to help with on the World \nWide Web and Internet. Where do you find the most of the support coming \nfrom? Who has been out there knocking on the door offering their \nsupport, and, maybe more importantly, who has not been\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\nthere when we have needed this type of help and support?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. We have gotten lots \nof support from groups, of course, who are focused on term limits--\nUnited States Term Limits, Americans Back In Charge, the American \nLegion, the American Conservative Union, the Christian Coalition--\npolitically focused groups that understand the need for the revolution, \nwhich the American people have asked for, and a change in the way \nWashington does business.\n  Individuals all across this great land have flooded our term limits \nhome page. It has been especially interesting to see what has happened \non the Internet because it allows people who might not have the \ncapacity to come to Washington the chance to communicate. I have had \nblind people use the Internet. I have also had paraplegics write \nthanking us for opening this link of communication.\n  Interestingly enough, I am pleased to say to the Senator from \nMinnesota, the community at large has been willing and eager to help us \nopen this link of communication. C-SPAN linked our term limits home \npage to their home page. USA Today, the newspaper, linked our term \nlimits home page and our petition to their home page. CNN, the Cable \nNews Network, provided a link. Politics USA, which is on the net, \nprovided the services of CompuServe and America Online. We have had a \ntremendous outpouring of assistance and support. It has been very \ninteresting to see the surge of interest and support that individuals \nhave rendered which have made it possible for Americans to express \nthemselves.\n\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator asked who has not been here. We have had \npeople from virtually every walk of life, but there have been a few \nnotable absences, and that has caused substantial disappointment. For \ninstance, United We Stand, Ross Perot's organization, has always \nadvocated term limits, but I have not heard a thing from Ross Perot \nabout this. That is a disappointment. I certainly hope that his \ncommitment to term limits is not just lip service. People want \ncommitment to revolution--change or reformation--to be substantial, and \nI believe that Americans want a real commitment to this kind of \nrevolution.\n  An important aspect of this debate is the fact that Senator Dole \nfirst scheduled it last fall, and it was clearly sent as a signal. With \nsuch advanced notice, we had the ability to set up the home page for \nterm limits. Not every issue comes to the Senate with this much \nadvanced publicity. With that kind of open communication, people who \nreally care about term limits have had the opportunity to get involved.\n  That is why I thank Americans Back in Charge, US Term Limits, the \nAmerican Legion, the Christian Coalition, the American Conservative \nUnion, and numerous other groups. And I thank groups like USA Today and \nCNN who allowed us to have a link from our home page to theirs. It is \ndisappointing that those I expected to be there, who have given lots of \nvoice to a commitment to term limits, have not shown up. However, I \nbelieve we have very broad-based support. Yes, there are a few \ndisappointments, such as Ross Perot, but that does not mean they do not \nfavor term limits.\n  Speaking of those who favor term limits and what we have done with it \nnationally, let me go to a chart which illustrates some important \npoints.\n  About 7 or 8 out of 10 people, according to all the polls, favor term \nlimits. These States have sought to enact term limits for the U.S. \nCongress, saying that people who represent their State should be \nlimited in the number of terms they can serve.\n\n  It is interesting to know that these are the States, by and large, \nthat have the initiative process for enacting legislation, meaning that \nif you are in one of these States and you do not like what your \nlegislature is doing, you can start a petition drive. You can actually \ninitiate a move to enact, to enshrine in the law, a concept that the \npeople want regardless of what the legislature wants.\n  The fact is, you would find that there are 23 States that, on their \nown motion, simply took the matter into their own hands. They said, \n``We want term limits. We are probably not going to get it from the \nprofessional politicians, but we will do it by signing petitions; we \nwill take to the streets; we will provide the impetus for this \nrevolution.''\n  Arkansas is a good example of a State which took such initiative. \nArkansas was one of the more recent States to attempt to limit the \nnumber of terms the individuals from their State could spend here in \nWashington, DC representing them. And out of that enactment came a \nfamous case which was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year \nsaying the States cannot do this. The States cannot individually decide \non their own that they will limit the terms of the individuals they \nsend to Congress. So, it is 23/50 of the States generally. It is almost \n100 percent of the States with initiatives by the people.\n\n  The Arkansas case, which was ruled on by the U.S. Supreme Court, said \nthat the States cannot limit the period in which their own \nrepresentatives serve. In effect you have the U.S. Supreme court saying \nthat States do not have the authority. You have the courts, public \nservants who upon appointment are there for life, against term limits.\n  One of the reasons we had the judiciary against term limits is that \nthe administration, the executive branch, argued before the court in \nopposition to term limits. With both the executive branch and the \njudicial branch standing before the will of the American people their \nonly hope is for the United States Congress to be for term limits.\n  I suppose it is true that the Congress is for term limits--term \nlimits for everybody but the Congress. It reminds me of that old saying \nin my legislature back in Missouri. They would say, ``I will not tax \nyou and I will not tax me, we will tax the fellow behind the tree.'' We \nare willing to have discipline for everybody but ourselves.\n  The whole idea of term limits is not novel. Senator Thompson, from \nTennessee, has done a masterful job of talking about this concept. It \nis not novel. George Washington set the standard for term limits in \nthis country when he said we should distinguish America from the \nmonarchs of Europe, that we needed to have that renewing flow of \ncreative energy from the citizenry of the country regularly. And he \nwalked away because he understood the value of new life, of new input, \nof the new energy that comes from new people coming forth from the \nAmerican citizenry.\n  Term limits reflects George Washington's view of the depth of the \ntalent pool of a free society. He may have looked to some casual \nobservers like the only person with the integrity and capacity in \nAmerica who could have led the country. There have been times, I \nsuppose, when it may have appeared that there was only one. But I \nhappen to have a view of the talent pool of America that is similar to \nthat of George Washington, and that is that we have enough talent that \nwe do not have to lock a few people into office, thinking they are the \nonly ones who can do the job.\n  I do not think there is any concept that is more ridiculous--and it \nis almost amusing except it is tragic--than the thought by some Members \nof this body that we are the only 100 people who could make good \ndecisions in the U.S. Senate. As a matter of fact, we may not be \ncapable of the good decisions, and I think the marketplace of public \nopinion will determine that. But this country is rich in terms \nof individuals with the capacity to make good judgments. We need not \nfear that we do not have enough talent to change public officials once \nin a while.\n\n  We have established a history of term limits in this country. In the \nearly 1950's, we checked term limits for the President of the United \nStates. We had a President in the mid-1930's and 1940's who ran four \ntimes and, with the tilted field of incumbency, snowballed himself into \noffice four times. The American people understood that the value of \nincumbency is the No. 1 perk of public office. You can talk about \nelection reform. There is no election reform more important than the \nelection reform of term limits. The American people understood that the \ntilted field that came from long-term exploitation of incumbency simply \nhad to be leveled, and they leveled the field for President back in the \nearly 1950's, with the 22d amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The \nPresident became a term-limited office.\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\n  To hear some of the academics talk about term limits, you would think \nthat would have been the ruination of America. Not so. Not so at all. \nAs a matter of fact, there are a number of States that have long \nembraced the concept of term limits for Governor. As my friend from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell, indicated, some of those term limits were \nvery short. But the States prospered, finding that the talent pool \navailable in their jurisdictions was always adequate to supply the need \nfor good public officials. There are 41 States that have sought to \nlimit their terms.\n  Mr. President, 23 States tried to limit the terms of Members of \nCongress, and most of those came as a result of the will of the people \nspecifically, and there are about 20 States where the State \nlegislatures themselves have limited themselves in their terms, because \nthey have understood the value of term limits.\n  I say this to make a point that I hope can be made fundamentally \nclear. Term limits is not an experimental, novel theory. We have only \nhad one time when we did not have a limit of two terms on President of \nthe United States by virtue of the respect for the term-limits policy \nof George Washington, and now we have it by virtue of the 22d amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution.\n  We have 41 Governors who are term limited. We have 20 State \nlegislatures that work under term limits. We have a Congress of the \nUnited States which should have been term limited, I suppose, in 23 \nStates, were the courts to allow the will of the people to prevail. But \nthe courts said that had to be set aside. So that the American people \nhave a vast experience with term limits.\n\n  Not only do we have term limits at the State level but at the \nmunicipal level as well. Cities have term limits, notably the largest \ncity in America, Los Angeles, and the second largest city in America, \nNew York City.\n  The President of the United States works under term limits. The \nGovernors of the States are term limited. You have the State \nlegislatures that are term limited. And you have the individuals who \nwork in the cities that are term limited. You say, ``Wait a second, who \nis out of step here? Members of Congress or the American people?''\n  You also have the academics and those from the think tanks who say \nthat term limits simply cannot be respected and that they cannot be \nexpected to operate. It is a terrible concept. It will destroy \nGovernment. I say to those guys in the think tanks, ``You may not be \nable to work this out in theory, but the American people have worked it \nout in practice.'' It may not work inside the ivy-covered tower of \nacademia, but it has for centuries, and in hundreds and hundreds of \ncircumstances. And what is more impressive to me than that is, where \nare the people rising up to set term limits aside?\n  You have this incredible array of term-limit operations all across \nAmerica, and the people operate in the context of term limits, where it \nis there, and they like it. They do not overthrow it. They do not have \npetitions to get rid of it. They do not have demonstrations against it. \nAs a matter of fact, when the people see it operate in all these \nsegments and the big zero here around the Congress of the United \nStates, what do the people want to do? Does their aspiration reflect \ntheir displeasure with term limits as a concept or their endorsement of \nterm limits as a concept? I submit it takes no rocket scientist to \nfigure this one out. Mr. President, 70 to 80 percent of the American \npeople endorse the concept of term limits for the U.S. Congress.\n  I just want to point out they do not endorse the concept out of \nignorance. They do not endorse the concept out of a lack of \nfamiliarity. They do not endorse the concept because they do not know \nwhat they are talking about. They endorse the concept on a basis, a \nvery substantial basis, of watching, observing and living with the \nobservable impacts of the concept as it is related to the President of \nthe United States, as it is related to the Governors of their States, \nas it is related to legislatures in their States, as it is related to \ncity, county, and local officials in their States. And, all of a \nsudden, we come to the judgment: Wait a second, maybe--maybe--the \npeople could be right about this. Of course, it is part of the \ndefinition of democracy that we value the input of the people, \nespecially when the people are not responding to some cataclysm, but \nthey are reflecting their considered judgment after a rich heritage of \nexperience.\n  It reflects their confidence that America is not a shallow pool \ncontaining scarcely 100 people who could serve in the Senate. No, it \nreflects their understanding that with individuals who can use the perk \nof incumbency to vote themselves back into office by dealing out the \nresources of the next generation, they look at that and say, ``There's \na difference between what we do at the State and local level and what \nthe Congress does.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do not know if the Senator was aware that in the \nJudiciary Committee I had offered an amendment and included in the \nCommittee report that I intended to offer an amendment during this \ndebate which would basically make term limits effective immediately. \nObviously, you could finish the term that you are in; the Constitution \nwould require that. But if, at the end of that term, you fit the \nnumber, whether it is two in the Senate and whatever it might be in the \nHouse, you would have to leave. That would be true term limits.\n  I say this because I have heard a number of Members of the House who \nhave been here for 20 years who say they are for term limits, and we \nhave at least one senior Member of this body who has been for term \nlimits literally before I was born but is still here.\n  Would the Senator from Missouri support my amendment to make term \nlimits effective immediately, that is, at the end of whatever term you \nare in? If you fit the bill you are out?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. First, I was aware of the Judiciary Committee's \ndeliberations on this. Second, I am aware of your position. Now, let me \ntell you what I support.\n  I support a measure which would limit the terms of Members of the \nHouse of Representatives to three terms and Members of the Senate to \ntwo. It would be no problem for me to limit my own terms, particularly \nsince I am new to this Chamber. Indeed, I came here intending to limit \nmy own terms to two.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3699, As Modified\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I modify amendment No. 3699 with the \ntext I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment, and the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following: \n     ``instructions to report the resolution back to the Senate \n     forthwith with an amendment as follows:\n\n     ``(two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the \n     following article is hereby proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1. Each State or the people thereof may prescribe \n     the maximum number of terms to which a person may be elected \n     or appointed to the Senate of the United States.\n       ``Section 2. Each State or the people thereof may prescribe \n     the maximum number of terms to which a person may be elected \n     to the House of Representatives of the United States.\n       ``Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it \n     shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution \n     by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States \n     within seven years from the date of its submission to the \n     States by the Congress.''.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, if I may reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator will be pleased to yield at the conclusion \nof his remarks. I would add that I happen to be one of the few people \nin this body who has been term limited. I think it was a good thing.\n  I have observed the operation of term limits at the State level and, \nbelieve me, it is appropriate. I think it is important that the Senator \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\nwhat differences there might be if we were to have term limits.\n  Term limits change the way decisions are made. It is of interest to \nme that Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute conducted a study to \ndetermine what life under term limits might be like. What he found is \nwe would have passed the balanced budget amendment three times. \nConcurrently, we could have equipped the President with the line-item \nveto as long ago as 1985. Can you imagine? Life under term limits would \nbe different alright.\n  It is my belief that the people of this great land have said, ``We \nare tired of displacing the costs of our own consumption to generations \nyet to come. We are tired of the fact that every new child has a debt \nat birth of $18,000.'' And yet, commonsense reforms like these continue \nto fall short of the support needed for passage.\n  Mr. President, those are the things that did not pass. The study went \non to note things that did. It is interesting. I see my friend, the \nSenator from Tennessee, is nodding his head because he knows what the \nissues are. Neither of the last two tax increases would have passed, \nand the last two pay increases would have failed as well.\n  I do not think that we should have term limits in order to get \nspecific legislation. I think we ought to have term limits because it \nreflects well on the fundamental values of America. We should give the \npeople what they ask for, what they know they want. We should at least \ngive them the opportunity to vote on it. What stuns me is that Members \nof this body do not even want to let the States have a chance to \nconsider it. That is a rather troublesome thing.\n  There are a wide variety of arguments that people bring up against \nterm limits. It is said, ``Well, won't term limits increase the power \nof nonelected bureaucrats and staffers?'' I think in theory you might \nthink the staffers will know everything. That has not been the way \nthings have happened, however. It was not too long ago that Phil Gramm \ncame to the Senate and tried to upset the apple cart of spending in his \nvery first term. I think the 1994 newcomers have brought new ideas and \nenergy as well.\n  Somebody said, ``Well, it will increase the influence of lobbyists.'' \nI think the basis of lobbyist relationships is long-term. As a matter \nof fact, most of the lobbyists I have talked to are opposed to term \nlimits. They make big investments. They want those relationships to be \nas cozy as possible. I do not think we ought to have individuals in the \nCongress looking forward to long careers in Washington, DC. I think we \nneed people looking forward to service in their district or State.\n  I believe the people of America have a strong understanding of term \nlimits. The people have enacted term limits for 41 State Governors. In \nevery State where they have had the initiative process, they have added \nCongress to the mix.\n  The beltway around Washington is the barrier to reform. Roughly 74 \npercent of the people want term limits. We have the opportunity to give \nit to them. And we have resisted. It is our fundamental duty to reflect \nthe will of the people, to offer them the opportunity to embrace term \nlimits for the Constitution of the United States.\n  The Senator from Vermont inquired earlier about retroactive term \nlimits. What is interesting to me is that, to my knowledge, everywhere \nthe people have had an opportunity to enact term limits on their own, \nthey have made the limits prospective. I believe that is why we should \nhave the kind of bill which has been proposed. It is not that you could \nnot have another kind of concept. Instead, it is because this is what \nthe American people prefer.\n  So I think the will of the people themselves is instructive. There \nmay, of course, be a theoretical reasons why people would want a \ndifferent approach. I do not know what that might be. But given the \nexperience that the American people have had, and the durability of \ntheir understanding, I think it would behoove us to make our approach \nconsistent with what they have requested in the past and with what they \nhave specifically asked for themselves. That is consistent with the \nfundamental value of democracy for which this country stands.\n\n  Ultimately, term limits and our ability to offer it to America for \ninclusion into the Constitution at the adoption of the States is \nsomething that should foster, underscore, emphasize, improve, and \nstrengthen the values for which we stand. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I listened to this whole debate on term \nlimits with some interest. I am well aware of the fact that the \nRepublican leadership has tried to set this up so that nobody can \nintroduce any amendments. The Republican leadership has filed for \ncloture within 5 minutes of beginning proceedings and is apparently \ngoing to do everything possible to block anybody from raising \nquestions.\n  I succeeded a Republican Senator. Everybody who has ever been elected \nfrom Vermont has succeeded a Republican Senator because I am the only \nDemocrat our State has ever elected. We are the only State in the Union \nthat has elected only one, and, for better or worse, that is me. My \npredecessor, a distinguished Republican, was elected the year I was \nborn and served until I arrived here. This Republican Senator was \nconsidered the dean of the Senate. The fact that he served from the \nyear I was born until I came here probably gives some sense of term \nlimits in our State.\n  Frankly, I have a great deal of respect for our distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Dole. On term limits, I would have only gotten \na chance to serve with him for one term, way back in the 1970's. Then \nhe would have been gone. The distinguished President pro tempore, \nSenator Thurmond, who held elective office long before I was born, I \nwould not have gotten a chance to serve with him at all. In fact, \nvirtually the whole Republican leadership would have been long gone by \nnow.\n  What I worry about when the amendment is written so as not to apply \nto current Members is that this is a little bit of a shell game on the \nAmerican public. It is a bit of a con. It was probably not meant that \nway, but it amounts to this: You could have a Senator who has been here \nfor, say, three or four terms and vote for term limits. They are up for \nelection this year, knowing that a constitutional amendment cannot be \nratified in time this year. That same three- or four-term Senator if \nreelected this year, could proceed to serve that 6-year term and two \nadditional 6-year terms, 18 more years, after voting to impose a 12-\nyear limit on all those who are first elected to the Senate after the \namendment is ratified. Or somebody who had served five terms, say, a \nSenator who has been here for 30 years, could vote for term limits and, \nhaving served 30 years, serve 18 more. Then they would say, ``I am for \nterm limits.'' Now, be honest. Vote for it or do not vote for it. \nEverybody has to make a determination.\n  There are, of course, term limits. Every 2 years in the House of \nRepresentatives there is a term limit. It is called an election. In my \nState, every 2 years there is a term limit for Governor, and virtually \nevery other office has a term limits. It is called an election. Every 6 \nyears is a term limit for Members of the Senate. It is called an \nelection.\n  However, do not call this proposed constitutional amendment one of \nterm limits when it is set up in such a way that most of the Senators \nin this place could vote for it, and no matter how many terms they had \nalready served, could count on serving for 12 to 18 more years. You \nhave Senators who served here before people were born, who could be \nserving here long after they are retired under these so-called term \nlimits. Now, that is not term limits.\n  Make sure that the American public understands, under this proposal, \nany Senator, no matter how long he or she has been here, could vote for \nthis, see it go into the Constitution and still be in office for \nanother 12 to 18 years, even if they have already been here for 20 \nyears, 30 years or whatever else it might be.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that even though the Republican leadership--\nall of whom have served here for many more than two terms--have done \ntheir best to block any chance for my amendment to come up, I hope they \nwould change their mind and realize that blocking a vote on it might \nappear a tad hypocritical to those people who live in the real world. \nThose are the people who do not rely on their elective office, who do \nnot, as the distinguished Senator from Missouri said, live in\n\n[[Page S3725]]\n\nthink tanks, but the men and women of the streets of Vermont, Missouri, \nor anywhere else. Those people may see a bit of hypocrisy if they see \nsomebody who has been here for 24 or 30 years, whatever, vote for a \nproposal which would still allow them to serve for another 12 to 18 \nyears, and call it term limits.\n  I think the American public will see through that hypocrisy, \nespecially when the American public knows that they can set term limits \nanytime they want, every single election. That is something to keep in \nmind.\n  Some say we do not have it in our power to pass term limits. We have \nit in our power. Every one of us has to file petitions or take steps in \nour States to qualify for election. Any one of us can say, ``I am \nsetting term limits. I am leaving at the end of this term.'' No \nconstitutional amendment is needed to that. It is term limits.\n  I wonder how many Senators are here who are now in their fourth, \nfifth, or sixth term, who every single time they run say, ``We need \nterm limits, we need term limits, and I will keep on saying it for the \nnext 20 years, we need term limits.'' They could limit it simply by \nleaving.\n  Do not call this amendment term limits, where a Senator in his third, \nfourth, fifth or sixth term could vote for this and still run for three \nmore terms. That is not term limits. That is a bumper-sticker slogan. \nThat is a political fundraising device. That is rhetoric for the \ncampaign trail. But that is not term limits.\n  Term limits are imposed when Senators, and we have had a number on \nboth sides of the aisle, who say, ``I came here to serve two terms, or \none term, or three terms,'' and then leave when they say they would. We \nhave had many, many Senators on both sides of the aisle who were facing \nan easy reelection, but said, ``This is the time to go. I leave.''\n  Ultimately, in my State, where my Republican predecessor was elected \nthe year I was born and served until I arrived, enjoying greater \npopularity every year, this is reflective of what happened. I think \nevery so often we have to make it clear what is really happening here. \nI would vote to bring this amendment up for a vote. I think we should. \nBut we should bring up each aspect of it and not do as the Republican \nleadership has: Stack the deck and do everything possible to block the \nchance that somebody might bring up an amendment that would raise a \nreal question. Let us test whether those who claim they are for term \nlimits would be for such limits being applied to them. Let them vote on \nsomething that might limit them at the end of this term, not at the end \nof this term plus another 18 years.\n  What this is, this amendment is an incumbent's protection limit bill, \nnot real term limits. This is saying that somebody elected in the \nfuture will have term limits, but those of us who are already here \nafter several terms, we are protecting ourselves for another 18 years. \nIf you are brandnew out there, a few years from now, we will term \nlimits for you, but, boy, we are sure protecting us. Because if we have \nbeen in the Senate for 24 years or 30 years or 36 years, we are going \nto make sure we can stay around for another 18 years. We have protected \nourselves in this.\n  No one who votes for term limits should stand up and say, ``See how \nbrave I am.'' Go back to the American public and say, ``We are so \nbrave, we limited somebody else to two terms, but for those still \nthere, we have another three terms.''\n  We will limit the men and women out there who have not yet run to two \nterms, but we will protect every single term we have already served and \ngive ourselves another two to three terms. That is not term limits, \nthat is campaign fodder, that is a bumper sticker, that is sloganeering \nrhetoric, but it is not term limitation at all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3717-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3725-S3727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FEDERAL JUDGES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every so often we have to remember that \nthis is an election year, when a lot of campaign rhetoric comes up, \njust as it has in the past few weeks about the Federal judges nominated \nby President Clinton and confirmed by this Senate, which is now under \nRepublican control.\n  I am a member of the Judiciary Committee and I have served on these \nnominations. I am familiar with the outstanding backgrounds of these \nnominees. I believe the U.S. Senate was right when we confirmed them \nand the President was right when he appointed them to the Federal bench \naround the country.\n  President Clinton took a Federal judge, the chief district judge in \nour State, a Republican, appointed by a Republican President, and moved \nhim to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I believe that was the \nright move. The President then appointed J. Garvin Murtha, of \nDummerston, Vermont, as the chief Federal district judge for the \nDistrict of Vermont--another very good move. He appointed William \nSessions of Cornwall, Vermont, as a Federal district judge, another \ngood move and one applauded by Republicans and Democrats alike \nthroughout our State--all three of these. Two of them were former \nprosecutors. I served as a prosecutor with two of them.\n  I am troubled by efforts to characterize President Clinton's \nappointments as soft on crime. Ask some of the people that have been \nsentenced by some of these Federal judges whether they think they are \nsoft on crime. There was one reference made in one of the sentencings, \n``If you ever have to have a heart transplant, you would want the \njudge's heart because it has not been used yet.'' These are tough \njudges.\n  I was privileged to serve for 8 years as a prosecutor before being \nelected to the Senate by the people of Vermont. I know a little bit \nabout law enforcement, and I also know a little bit about political \ncampaigns.\n  If you want to play a game of, ``Oh, look at these judges President \nClinton has appointed,'' and pick out an isolated case here and there--\nand there are tens of thousands of cases--you can play that game. If \nsomeone were cynical, they could play that game. If somebody wanted to \npick out selected cases, they could play the game.\n  If I wanted to--and I do not, of course--I could talk about some of \nthe decisions of judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush, who \nreversed convictions or sentences of defendants that juries found \nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt of atrocious crimes.\n  If I wanted to, I could talk about Judge Daniel Tacha. I believe he \nwas suggested by the distinguished Republican leader for an appointment \nto a seat on the tenth circuit. A good Republican appointment. He \nrecently wrote an interesting opinion that suppressed evidence seized \nby a Utah State trooper. After a lawful stop, upon learning that the \nlicense of the driver had expired and after receiving suspicious \nresponses from the vehicle occupants, the State trooper asked for and \nreceived permission to search the trunk of the car. Let us be clear \nthat he had a right to do that on the face of it. He found a gun, \nscales, and a duffel bag that had crack cocaine in it. Despite the fact \nthat the driver consented to the search, this Republican Judge ruled \nthat once the trooper determined that the car was properly registered, \nhe could no longer detain the defendant and, thus, the search was \nunlawful. The judge ruled that the crack cocaine was to be suppressed. \nIf I were cynical, I would say that was an indication of how the \nRepublican judiciary feels. But I am not going to.\n\n  In another case, a 13-year-old boy was murdered by four young men \nbecause the boy caught them stealing a bicycle worth $5. These men \nstomped this 13-year-old boy to death and stifled his screams by \nshoving stones down his throat. All four men were convicted by a State \ncourt, and their appeals were rejected. But then Judge Richard Korman, \na Reagan appointee, decided that the State appellate court was \nincorrect. He found ``troubling inconsistencies'' in the story told by \nlaw enforcement officials. As a result, he decided to free the \nconvicted murderers--these men convicted of stomping to death this 13-\nyear-old--on $3,000 bail. I have seen traffic cases that got higher \nbail than that.\n  Now, if I was cynical, I would blame President Reagan for appointing \nthem. But, instead, I will praise three other judges appointed by \nPresident Reagan--no, actually I cannot. I was going to say that they \noverturned this decision when it went to the court of appeals. But \nthese other three appointees of President Reagan affirmed this. They \ndid not even bother to issue an opinion. Is that an indication of the\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\njudicial philosophy of President Reagan? No, I do not think so at all. \nBut is it an indication of some of the judges appointed?\n  Judge William Cambridge of Nebraska, a Reagan appointee, overturned \nthe death sentence of a defendant who not only confessed to killing \nthree young boys, but who said that he would do it again if he were \never set free. One of the boys was pinned to the ground by a knife \nthrough his back and was slashed and stabbed to death as he pleaded for \nhis life. One of the other victims endured a similar fate, and when \nthey found his body, it had a drawing of a plant cut into his torso. \nJudge Cambridge vacated the sentence because he concluded that the \nState statute's use of the term ``exceptional depravity'' was too \nvague. If this is not exceptional depravity, I do not know what in \nHeaven's name is.\n\n  On appeal, the deciding vote to reverse Judge Cambridge and affirm \nthe death sentence, the deciding vote to reverse the Reagan appointee's \ndecision was cast by Judge Diana Murphy--and she, incidentally, was a \nClinton appointee. She helped correct what I think was an egregious \nmistake and concluded that under any reasonable interpretation of the \nstatute, these crimes certainly qualified as depraved and for the \nsentence.\n  In another recent case from Nebraska, Judge Richard Kopf, an \nappointee of President Bush, reversed the death sentence of a convicted \ndouble murderer. The defendant was given two capital sentences in the \nstabbing deaths of his cousin and her house guest. Despite suffering \nseven stab wounds, the defendant's cousin was able to make her way to a \nphone, summon help, and then died. After the Nebraska Supreme Court \ntwice rejected appeals, Judge Kopf granted a habeas corpus petition, \nconcluding that the Nebraska Supreme Court had misinterpreted its own \nState law by reweighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances \ninvolved in the case. It went up on appeal, and the eighth circuit \nreversed the decision, finding that Judge Kopf had exceeded his \nauthority by contesting the Nebraska Supreme Court's interpretation of \na Nebraska statute.\n  These were all Reagan and Bush appointees, and one of the most \negregious decisions made was reversed by a Clinton appointee.\n  Those of us who have tried a lot of cases know that sometimes cases \ndo not turn out the way you want. That is why you have appellate \ncourts. Sometimes judges rule in a way that you just cannot understand. \nBut I am not going to condemn President Reagan's appointees as judges \nand President Bush's appointees as judges, or President Reagan or \nPresident Bush, because of a few aberrations, decisions about which I \ndo not know all the facts and in connection with which I have not \nreviewed all the evidence. I would not do this and no one else should \ntry, in a political year, to condemn President Clinton, who I must say \nhas appointed some darned good men and women to the judiciary--just as \nPresident Bush appointed some darned good men and women to the \njudiciary, and President Reagan did, and President Carter did, and \nPresident Ford did. All of these Presidents have appointed judges on \nwhom I had the opportunity to vote.\n\n  I have voted for some Republican nominees and against some. I voted \nfor some Democratic nominees and against some. But that is where we get \ninvolved. We can vote for them or against them. But do not take some \nisolated incident and try to turn it into a Presidential election year \nthing.\n  If we did that, we could go to the notorious 911 murders in Detroit. \nOne of the victims was shot repeatedly while frantically calling for \npolice assistance. The entire episode was recorded by the 911 operator, \nand the defendant ultimately pleaded guilty to two counts of murder. \nSixteen years after the fact, the convicted murderer filed his second \nhabeas corpus petition claiming that comments made by the African-\nAmerican State judge, several years after the case was over, somehow \nrevealed bias against fellow African-Americans. Make sure you \nunderstand this. The defendant said that based on the comments made by \nthe African-American judge 16 years after the case concluded the judge \nhad expressed bias against African Americans. Most judges would just \ntoss this out the window it is so far-fetched. But Judge David \nMcKeague, a Bush appointee, granted relief and ordered resentencing. \nFortunately, the prosecutor appealed and the decision was unanimously \nreversed.\n  The defendant in another case broke into his neighbor's home and \nbrutally attacked four young children. Three children died from \nmultiple skull fractures, and the fourth survived an apparent sexual \nassault. The defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. \nBecause the jury had not been presented with mitigating evidence \nconcerning the childhood abuse and mental disorder the defendant \nallegedly suffered, Judge Sam Sparks, an appointee of President Bush, \nvacated the sentence. That decision, incidentally, was unanimously \nreversed on appeal.\n  Another defendant brutally murdered his ex-wife in the basement of \nher residence, stabbing her over 40 times. He was convicted by a jury \nof murder. Judge Thomas O'Neil, a Reagan appointee, reversed the \nconviction. That decision was unanimously reversed on appeal.\n  Does that mean that President Reagan was soft on crime? Of course \nnot, even though obviously a number of his judges made decisions that I \nas a former prosecutor find very, very difficult to understand.\n  Just like Judge Huff, an appointee of President Bush, who sentenced a \ndefendant to 2 years and 9 months in prison for smuggling illegal \naliens into the country even though three of the illegal aliens died \nduring the attempt. That is hard to understand. But I do not consider \nPresident Bush, whom I happen to know and admire, as being soft on \ncrime because of that.\n  Judge Vaughn Walker, appointed by President Bush, publicly called for \nthe legalization of drugs. He has repeatedly refused to abide by \nbinding Supreme Court precedents, the sentencing guidelines, and \nmandatory minimum sentencing statutes based on his personal beliefs \nabout the propriety of decriminalizing narcotics. The ninth circuit has \nfrequently and summarily reversed him.\n  He has also issued a number of rulings that stymied efforts to \nprosecute drug traffickers. The U.S. attorney's office for the Northern \nDistrict of California, which is headed by a U.S. attorney appointed by \nPresident Clinton, has found itself frustrated with the judge's rulings \nin major drug cases. In a case involving the seizure of 1,000 pounds of \nheroin--incidentally, the largest bust of heroin in U.S. history at the \ntime--Judge Walker repeatedly dealt setbacks to prosecutors, including \nsuppressing several key pieces of evidence and releasing two defendants \non bail. In one of his suppression orders, he minimized heroin \ntrafficking as little more than mercantile crimes. Two of these were \nreversed.\n  Does that mean that President Bush favored legalizing heroin or \ndrugs? I doubt that very much--any more than I do. It is unfortunate \nthat the Clinton appointee, the person that President Clinton appointed \nas U.S. attorney, who is trying to clean up drug trafficking and is \ntrying to stop heroin trafficking, is frustrated by the judge appointed \nby the previous Republican administration. But I do not think it \nreflects the views of President Bush.\n  I think what is more accurately reflected is that a U.S. attorney can \nbe replaced very easily. In fact, you have a tough U.S. attorney out \nthere who really wants to prosecute drugs and who reflects President \nClinton's views.\n  Chief Judge Richard Posner of the seventh circuit, is another \nappointee of President Reagan, who has similarly taken a public \nposition advocating the legalization of drugs.\n  If I was cynical, which, fortunately, I am not, being from a small \nState like Vermont, I could come to the floor and make the case that \nRepublican judges let off criminals on technicalities and that they are \nsoft on crime. Some might even call for impeachment of the judges that \nmade such decisions and took such positions. But in the recorded words \nof another Republican President, for whom I have a lot of affection, I \nsay, That would be wrong.\n  As I said in my statement 2 weeks ago on this floor, no one should be \nmaking such statements or demagoging judges based on isolated \ndecisions. We disserve our system of\n\n[[Page S3727]]\n\njustice, our system of government, and the American people when we \nengage in such rhetoric.\n  As anyone who is at all familiar with our criminal justice systems \nknows, in the overwhelming majority of cases, Federal judges, \nregardless of whether they were appointed by Republican Presidents or \nDemocratic Presidents, uphold the law, and they do an excellent, if \noften difficult, job.\n  We have been fortunate, Mr. President, in this country that \nPresidents of both parties have appointed some of the finest men and \nwomen in this country as Federal judges. Those men and women have \nupheld the liberties of every one of us, no matter what our political \nparty might be, no matter what our ideology might be, no matter whether \nwe are wealthy or poor, and no matter what our backgrounds are.\n  We have been blessed in this country with very, very good Federal \njudges. We have had a few clunkers. Yes, we have a few clunkers. I \nprobably appeared before some at one time or another. But the vast, \nvast majority of our Federal judges do a very difficult, very \nhonorable, and a very good job.\n  The Presidents who appoint them ought to be praised for it. I think \nthat it demeans the Office of the Presidency and it demeans the Federal \njudiciary and it demeans the Senate to make this some a political thing \nwhere we go after the incumbent President and claim that he is not \ndoing a good job in appointing judges.\n  In fact, President Clinton's judicial appointees have won praise \naround the country as well qualified and centrist. That is why we have \nconfirmed each of them--the Republican-controlled Senate has, and the \nDemocratic-controlled Senate has. Each of them has had an exhaustive \nand intrusive examination before the Judiciary Committee, and each has \nbeen confirmed by this body. In fact, only 3 of the 185 lower Federal \ncourt judges who President Clinton appointed to the bench have even \nbeen the subject of contested votes.\n  We hear a lot of criticism now, but the distinguished majority leader \nand the chairman of the Judiciary Committee voted for 182 of the 185 \njudges now on the courts of appeals and districts courts appointed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  In fact, the Legal Times says of President Clinton's judges:\n\n       From the beginning, his philosophy toward judicial \n     selection has differed from that of his two immediate \n     predecessors [who] engaged in a crusade to put committed \n     conservatives on the bench. President Clinton's criteria, by \n     contrast, seem less ideological. He has primarily sought two \n     attributes in his judicial candidates--undisputed legal \n     qualifications, and gender and ethnic diversity.\n\n  In a comprehensive report at the midpoint of President Clinton's \nfirst term, the New York Times reported:\n\n       Political scientists, legal scholars and nonpartisan groups \n     like the American Bar Association who have studied the new \n     judges' records also said Mr. Clinton's choices were better \n     qualified than those of Mr. Reagan or President George Bush.\n       The new judges were deliberately chosen to fit squarely in \n     the judicial mainstream and were, by and large, replacing \n     liberal Democrats.\n\n  Everyone always talks about making the judicial selection process \nless political. Now election year politics threaten to bring political \nrhetoric about judges to the forefront. Let us not make judges or \nisolated decisions into political issues. Let us work together to \nincrease respect for our system of justice and for those who serve \nwithin it.\n  Mr. President, I see my good friend from Tennessee in the Chamber and \nI know he seeks--I see both of my good friends from Tennessee in the \nChamber. I know one or the other is going to want to talk. So I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3725-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3727-S3729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO LIMIT CONGRESSIONAL TERMS\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the fundamental question of the debate on term limits \nto me can be put very simply. Are we as a nation better served by a \nsystem that encourages career politicians who over time grow entrenched \nin Washington and increasingly removed from the concerns of the very \npeople who elected them or are we better served by an ever-changing \nlegislative body of citizens who bring with them those vast experiences \nthat color America, who have no political career to protect and who \nserve and then return home to live under the laws that they helped \npass?\n  Next week, the Senate will get its chance to answer that fundamental \nquestion. I draw upon my own personal experiences. I came directly to \nthe Senate a year and a half ago from the private sector. In fact, I \ncontrast this very Chamber before us, with its rich history and its \nculture and its historical significance, with what I was doing 3 years \nago, and that is moving every day and too many nights in an operating \nroom.\n  It is that contrast, it is that perspective that colors much of what \nI have to say about term limits. I have never served in elective \noffice, and I have had no previous ties to Washington, DC, or the \nFederal Government before coming to this body. I ran on the issue of \nterm limits, and I pledged personally to serve no more than two terms. \nIt is because I believe in that fundamental concept of the citizen \nlegislator contributing in his or her own way based on his or her own \npast experiences to a citizen legislature.\n  That unique perspective on Washington encouraged me to promote not \nonly the issue of term limits but to strongly support Senate Joint \nResolution 21. I now, having been here a year and a half, feel even \nmore strongly than 2 years ago when I was campaigning. Senate Joint \nResolution 21, a constitutional amendment providing for term limits, \nserves as a steppingstone down that long road--and we have a long road \nto go--to renew the citizens' respect, the citizens' faith, the \ncitizens' trust in their Federal Government.\n  Too often, Members of Congress are forced in the current system to \nspend their time focusing on reelection, focusing on fundraising, \nwatching the polls, instead of doing what we need to be doing, and that \nis doing what is best for the country. As a result, I truly feel that \nWashington has become much more of a 2-year town, focused on the short \nterm rather than what it should be, a 20-year town with long-term \nthinking.\n  One need look no further than the recent debate over Medicare and \nentitlement reform to see how true this is. Because of the unrestrained \ngrowth of entitlements, our Nation faces a true fiscal disaster within \n15 years, yet this past Congress has been unable to have a reasoned, \nmeaningful debate on this most critical of issues. Why? Because of the \npolitical ramifications of taking on, of addressing middle-class \nentitlements. We missed a valuable opportunity to take real steps \ntoward reducing the deficit, eventually reducing the debt and truly \nreining in entitlements.\n  I think it is time for us to pause a moment and ask a simple \nquestion. If Members of Congress had been freed in large part from \nreelection concerns, would politics have destroyed the debate that \nprevented us once again from addressing these fundamental problems? The \nanswer to me is clear and the reason is obvious. As long as there are \ncareers to protect, there will be politics to play almost by \ndefinition. The longer politicians stay in Washington, the more risk \naverse they become. They become more attached and more detached from \nthat average citizen and they become more eager to spend the hard-\nearned dollars of America's taxpayers. The answer is this resolution \nbefore us today, Senate Joint Resolution 21.\n  What are the arguments against term limits? Many of my colleagues \noppose term limits on the grounds that we should not alter the \nConstitution, and I think they have a point. As a conservative, I think \nwe have to be very careful before we alter the Constitution in any way, \nand only in rare circumstances should this take place. In fact, the \nfirst bill that I introduced in the Senate was the Electoral Rights \nEnforcement Act of 1995, and it was a very simple statute that would \nhave given the States additional authority to enact term limits on \nMembers of their congressional delegation. Unfortunately, the U.S. \nSupreme Court's decision in U.S. Term Limits versus Thornton mooted \nthat bill and made it clear that the only alternative, the only \nremaining course available to us is a constitutional amendment.\n\n  Others cloud the debate on issues as to whether or not the term \nlimits will be retroactive or should be retroactive\n\n[[Page S3728]]\n\nor the technicalities or whether the real answer should be campaign \nfinance reform. The American people are not going to be fooled. They \nunderstand. They have spoken loudly that they want term limits. Others \nwill say that we have term limits at the ballot box; that we can always \nvote somebody out we do not like.\n  Once again, the American people recognize that you cannot vote \nsomeone out easily. In fact, the statistics are that about 90 percent \nof Senators running for reelection will win. And if you look at the \nelection of 2 years ago, when a new revolution took place, there were \n11 new Senators and only 1 of those defeated an incumbent, full U.S. \nSenator. The power of the incumbency is too strong. The answer is term \nlimits.\n  Finally, some opponents will contend that term limits will rob \nCongress of experienced legislators who are necessary to the proper \nfunctioning of our Government. And, yes, experienced legislators who \nare good, who have contributed significantly will, after a period of \ntime, have to leave this body. Yet, the second half of that is, are \nthey absolutely necessary to the proper functioning of our Government? \nAnd I would argue no. If our Government is so complex and so \ncomplicated and so convoluted that only a full-time career politician, \na class of politicians that is here to stay forever, can run it, that \nis not an argument against term limits; it is an argument for \ndrastically changing the way our Government does business.\n\n  Mr. President, I have an interest in history. As the only physician \nin the U.S. Senate today, I have gone back to look at the number of \nphysicians in the Senate over time. It has been fascinating. Over the \nlast 100 years, there have been only eight physicians who served in the \nU.S. Senate. Over the period of 1800 to 1899, that 100-year period, in \ncontrast to the 8 for the last 100 years, 37 physicians served in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  You can argue that is good or that is bad, I would say, not \nnecessarily because they are physicians, but because they are another \nprofession, not just another lawyer in this body but another \nprofession. I would argue that is good; that is what the American \npeople want. It represents America today.\n  It is interesting to look back at that period of 1800 to 1849. Mr. \nPresident, 23 physicians served in that period. If you look down the \nlist, Dr. Bateman was a Senator for 3 years, Dr. Borland for 5 years, \nDr. Campbell for 4 years, Dr. Harrison for 3 years, Dr. Kent for 4 \nyears. The length of time these Senators served was short, was \nnarrower.\n  Shall we argue they did not contribute in a substantial way in that \nperiod of time? I would argue absolutely not. You do not have to be \nhere for 12 years or for 18 years or for 24 years to contribute.\n  As I look through this history of physicians in the U.S. Senate, it \ncauses me to go back and reflect on that concept upon which this \ncountry was founded, and that is the citizen legislator, someone who \ncomes from running a filling station, someone who comes from having a \nfarm, someone who comes from the practice of medicine here for a period \nof time, from real jobs, after which they go back home and live under \nthe laws that were passed.\n  In closing, Americans understand that Government truly works best \nwhen it is composed and comprised of citizens who have worked alongside \nthem, who still consider themselves part of the communities from which \nthey came. Yes, I truly feel that term limits will focus Members of \nCongress on the issues at hand rather than that next election, or that \nnext fundraiser in preparation for that election. Members will not shy \naway from tough decisions. The doors of Congress will be thrown open \nwith new ideas, innovative ideas, all brought to the table of citizen \nlegislators.\n  Yes, I feel we need term limits. The question remains for our Senate \ncolleagues, how long can we, will we, ignore the will of the American \npeople?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the tally by half century \nof physicians in the Senate that I referred to earlier be printed in \nthe Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``Physicians in the Senate'' Speech Tally by Half Century\n\n       1750-1799: Bradford (1793-1797), Clayton (1798), Elmer \n     (1789-1791), Latimer (1795-1801).\n       1800-1849: Bateman (1826-1829), Bibb (1813-1816), Borland \n     (1848-1853), Campbell (1809-1813), Chambers (1825-1826), \n     Condit (1803-1817), Harper (1826), Harrison (1825-1828), \n     Hunter (1811-1821), Jones (1807), Kent (1833-1837), Leib \n     (1809-1814), Linn (1833-1843), Logan (1801-1807) Mitchell \n     (1804-1809), Morril (1817-1823), Naudain (1830-1836), Pinkney \n     (1819-1822), Spence (1836-1840) Storer (1817-1819), Sturgeon \n     (1840-1851), Tiffin (1807-1809), Ware (1821-1824).\n       1850-1899: Bates (1857-1859), Chilcott (1882-1883), Conover \n     (1873-1879), Cowan (1861-1867), Deboe (1897-1903), Dennis \n     (1873-1879), Fitch (1857-1861), Gallinger (1891-1918), Gwin \n     (1850-1855, 1857-1861), Miller (1871), Mitchell (1861), \n     Nourse (1857), Wade (1851-1869), Withers (1875-1881).\n       1900-1949: Ball (1903-1905, 1919-1925), Copeland (1923-\n     1938), Ferris (1923-1928), France (1917-1923), Hatfield \n     (1929-1935), Lane (1913-1917).\n       1950-present: Frist (1995-?), Gruening (1959-1969).\n       Total: 49 physicians in the Senate.\n       Note: Five Senators who overlapped half-centuries are \n     listed only under the half-century when their first terms \n     began.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to note I am a strong supporter of \nthis term limits resolution, and I will engage in this debate again \nnext week as well and plan to vote for this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Frist, \nfrom Tennessee, because he made a very interesting point there, talking \nabout the number of physicians who served in this body for the first \n100 years. I think the number was 37. We were just talking about that. \nThat was back when there were many fewer Members of the Senate. There \nwere only 15 States by 1800 or so, so we only had about 30 Senators. \nYet, a great number of them seem to have been physicians.\n  I think you can say that about a lot of other professions back then, \ntoo. As time has gone on, that number has diminished. We have fewer and \nfewer people who have done anything except be in politics. So, again, I \nthink he is a good example of the citizen legislator.\n  He and I both came to the Senate together a little over a year ago, \nneither one of us having run for office before. We vowed, together, \nthat we would do what we could to advance the concept of a citizen \nlegislator and fight for term limits. As we said earlier, this is the \nfirst time in 49 years that we will have a vote on term limits in this \nbody.\n  I would like to just very briefly respond to a couple of the comments \nthat the Senator from Vermont made earlier about term limits. The \nopponents of term limits, of course, are a little bit between a rock \nand a hard place. They have a tremendous burden to overcome. One of \nthose burdens is the fact that, as this chart indicates here, 75 \npercent of the people--according to Luntz Research Co.--75 percent of \nthe people are in support of term limits and only 16 percent of the \npeople oppose it. So, what many of the opponents have done is tried \ntheir best to talk Members here into not supporting the term-limits \nconcept. In the process, they have personalized the debate.\n  They talk in terms of how it will affect this Member or how it will \naffect that Member or the majority leader's situation, the President \npro tempore's situation, individual Members on both sides of the aisle. \nI think that points up a problem that we have in this body overall. It \nis a problem with this debate; that is, the personalizing of the \ndebate, the personalizing of it. The point is that it does not matter \nhow it affects individual Members. It does not matter that some Member \nmight have served here for a long time and might be entitled to another \ntwo terms. What we are trying to do is fashion something that \neventually has a chance of passing and becoming law. It is irrelevant \nas to what has gone on in the past. What is relevant is this country \nand what is relevant is this body as an institution as we go into the \nnext century.\n\n  If you want to make the argument that this would lower the quality of \nthis body, that this would hurt the United States, then that is, I \nthink, a valid argument. But to argue that a person cannot support term \nlimits because he has already been here for awhile, I think that is an \ninvalid argument. That is an attempt to label people as hypocrites. So \nthe opponents of term limits say this is not real term\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\nlimits. You have a proposition here that will allow two more terms, 12 \nyears. That is going to be extremely difficult to get passed. It has \ntaken 49 years to get another vote on it as it is.\n  So we say, let us have something reasonable, regardless of the past. \nThe system has served us pretty well in the past. We balanced the \nbudget up to 1967. Let us concentrate on the future --another 12 years. \nBut opponents of term limits say, no, that is not good enough. Let us \nfashion something that we know is impossible of getting passed, like \nmaking it retroactive. That will be consistent. That will be \nnonhypocritical.\n  Perfection should not be the enemy of the good. The strategy is \nobvious on its face. The opponents of term limits are not interested in \nwhat they would call real term limits or genuine term limits. The \nopponents of term limits are interested in deflecting the debate from \nthe future of this Nation onto individual Members and saying you cannot \nvote for term limits because you think that now we have dug ourselves \ninto this hopeless ditch of debt, that you cannot vote for term limits \nfor the future knowing it would be a few years before the ratification \nprocess would even have an opportunity to be completed. Then you have \nanother 12 years. You cannot vote for that because you would be accused \nof being a hypocrite because you have been here for a while.\n\n  That is a part of the ``me'' generation, Mr. President. We criticize \nour kids for a lot of things and ourselves as part of the ``me'' \ngeneration--me, me, me, self-centered. The same thing is true with this \nbody--totally, totally consumed with ourselves as individuals and how \nthings will affect us.\n  Senator Jones here, we would have lost the benefit of his services if \nwe had term limits. Well, there are millions of Mr. Joneses out there \nwho might be Senator Joneses who might be better than Senator Jones. We \nhave 250 million people in this country, and I do not even know what \nfraction of 1 percent have ever served in this body.\n  Are we so self-centered and conceited and blinded that we think that \nthis fraction of 1 percent are the only people qualified because we \nspent a few years up here spending other people's money and regulating \nother people's lives that we have the only expertise in America that \nqualifies us to sit here?\n  Let us, as we go forward with this debate next week, not personalize \nthis thing. Let us not personalize this debate. Let us not accuse \npeople of being hypocrites. Let us not concentrate on the past. You can \nmake an argument that in the past we did not need this. We fought two \nworld wars, we went through a Great Depression, and we were always able \nto come back and balance the budget in short order. We balanced the \nbudget up until 1969.\n  Recently things have gotten out of hand with the growth of Government \nand the growth of spending, the proliferation of interest groups and \nthe pressures on this body, of the desire for constant reelection, \nnever having the will to say no to anybody, but always wanting to say, \n``Yes, you can have this. We can increase this program at 10 percent a \nyear because we want your vote and we want your financial support and \nwe want this system of professional politicians that we have always \nhad.''\n  It has gotten us into a quagmire that our kids will find it hopeless \nto dig themselves out of. We are bankrupting this country in short \norder. We all know it, and it constitutes criminal negligence if we do \nnot do what we can about it.\n  I have heard many, many times, and I heard again today, ``We have \nterm limits; we have term limits, they are called elections.'' If you \nwant to call the present system term limits, you are going to have to \nconvince me that people have a decent shot at getting what they want \nfrom the present system, what they demand.\n  If you are talking about electoral politics, unless you are an \nincumbent, you are not going to have access to the money to even run. \nWe have millions of citizens out there who would like to serve and have \nthe opportunity to serve, but they know, with all of the advantages of \nincumbency and all of the money that incumbency brings in terms of \ncontributions, why bother? Why bother?\n  They say, ``Well, there is a lot of turnover.'' That is for various \nreasons. Some people want to run for other offices; some people leave \ntown one step ahead of the sheriff; some people want to go back and \nlive in the real world. There are a lot of reasons for that. But the \nfact of the matter is, of those who want to stay, of those who run for \nreelection, about 90 percent still get reelected in the middle of all \nthis turnover.\n  So, the question is not what the turnover rate is. It goes up and \ndown. The question is, What is the motivation of the overwhelming \nmajority of the people who serve? If they ultimately decide to leave \nfor whatever reason, or even maybe within their term for whatever \nreason, that still does not answer the question, what was their \nmotivation while they were there?\n  I firmly believe that if that motivation is, in large part, not \ntotally, but in large part, simply staying and getting reelected and \ndoing the things necessary to stay in office year in and year out, \nbecause the longer you stay the less touch you have with the real world \nand, in some cases, the less you feel like you will be able to do, and \nthen age catches up with you perhaps and you become more and more \ndesperate to stay and you are willing to do more and more things to \nstay--what is the motivation of those kind of people?\n  The motivation of those kind of people to point out that ``We cannot \nincrease your program, madam, at 10 percent this year. We maybe could \nincrease it 6 or 7 percent. But your check might be a little less than \nwhat you were expecting it to be from the Federal Government.'' That is \ndangerous. That is dangerous, and we need people in this body who are \nwilling to risk a little danger. That is what we do not have, and that \nis what this is all about.\n  So as I say, next week we can get back on the central issue here: \nWhat is best going to equip this country to meet the challenges of the \nnext century--as we, as sure as I am standing here, are bankrupting \nthis country--not how it affects some individual Members. We will be \nlucky if we are remembered 24 hours after we leave. It does not have to \ndo with that.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I come to the floor today to discuss \nbriefly an issue that causes me some concern.\n  I see from press reports and statements released by the White House \nthat during his recent visit to Japan, President Clinton touted his \nsuccesses vis-a-vis trade with Japan, claiming that his administration \nhas steered that trade relationship in the most positive direction in \nyears. These statements follow others President Clinton made last week \nstating that recent increases in automobile and automotive parts \nexported to Japan are the result of an auto trade agreement his \nadministration signed with Japan last August.\n  Now, you'd think that after two recent articles in the Journal of \nCommerce and the Washington Post--entitled respectively ``More Auto \nExports to Japan: Who Gets the Credit?'' and ``Clinton Claims on Auto \nTrade Disputed''--the President would have thought twice about taking \ncredit for something that's going on anyway. Since the articles speak \nfor themselves, I would ask unanimous consent that they be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follow:\n\n            Move Auto Exports to Japan: Who Gets the Credit?\n\n                            (By John Maggs)\n\n       Washington.--The closer one looks at the upturn in U.S. \n     automotive exports to Japan, the tougher it gets to lay all \n     the credit at the feet of President Clinton and his top trade \n     negotiator Mickey Kantor.\n       President Clinton is expected to trumpet those trade \n     results in a White House event today marking the first six \n     months since last year's landmark U.S. Japan auto trade pact.\n       Claiming credit for that agreement is a small but \n     significant piece of Mr. Clinton's re-election strategy, in \n     which he will argue that his ``free and fair'' trade policy \n     has created thousands of U.S. jobs.\n       As the center of that strategy, the Japan agreement \n     mandates some of the biggest reforms Japan has ever \n     undertaken to loosen formal and informal barriers to imports.\n       U.S. officials cite numerous regulatory changes they expect \n     to yield results in additional imports. The trickier part is \n     making the connection between these reforms and the \n     statistics on auto trade that Mr. Clinton is expected to cite \n     today.\n       The numbers are impressive. Exports to Japan by American \n     and Japanese-owned auto factories in the United States were \n     up 50% in 1995, and exports by Ford, Chrysler and General \n     Motors alone are up 36% in the first two months of 1996.\n       U.S. auto parts exports to Japan--the real focus of the \n     trade agreement--seem to be increasing steadily, although the \n     rise in 1995 was smaller than the year before.\n       The U.S. parts-content of cars made at Japanse-owned \n     ``transplant'' factories in the United States, meanwhile, \n     increased 14% in 1995.\n       The problem is the sheer number of factors affecting the \n     huge U.S.-Japan auto trade, including currency shifts--which \n     made U.S. products much more competitive in 1995--and the \n     lead time to design parts into Japanese models, a factor that \n     makes higher import part levels more likely after 1998.\n       Among replacement parts, there is very encouraging \n     anecdotal evidence of new retail outlets opening in Japan \n     that will carry U.S. parts, but little evidence that this has \n     yet had a trade effect.\n       Mr. Clinton will note that auto parts exports to Japan have \n     increased 60% since 1992 but the growth rate is slowing.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 Clinton Claims on Auto Trade Disputed\n\n                           (By Paul Blustein)\n\n       The hoopla is scheduled to start around 2 p.m. today at the \n     White House. President Clinton will be there, as will \n     representatives of the Big Three U.S. auto companies and the \n     United Auto Workers. Three new American cars will be on \n     display, with the steering wheels on the right-hand side--\n     made to order for the Japanese market.\n       The purpose? To celebrate rising automobile and parts sales \n     to Japan and make the claim--which critics call hype--that a \n     major cause was an auto trade agreement that the \n     administration negotiated with Tokyo last year.\n       The White House has marshaled some impressive-sounding \n     statistics to make the accord look like a job-generating \n     winner. An administration report due to be released today \n     will highlight the fact that in the six months after the pact \n     was signed last August, sales of U.S.-made General Motors \n     Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. vehicles in Japan \n     rose 33 percent over the same period a year earlier, \n     according to people familiar with the report.\n       It also trumpets higher sales of U.S. auto parts to \n     Japanese companies, citing an anticipated increase of 14 \n     percent in the North American content of 1996 model vehicles \n     at Japanese factories on this side of the Pacific.\n       But many experts question whether such recent increases can \n     be attributed to an agreement reached just a few months ago. \n     While the administration can reasonably claim it created new \n     business opportunities in Japan's repair parts market, they \n     say, most of the latest surge in sales of automotive products \n     is part of a longer-term trend stemming from prior trade \n     deals, the weakness of the U.S. dollar and other factors.\n       It's ``a notable achievement'' that U.S. auto parts are \n     making inroads in Japan, said Marcus Noland, a Japan expert \n     at the Institute for International Economics and former \n     senior economist at Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. \n     But ``the administration is probably taking credit for \n     something that's going on anyway.'' Other skeptics note that \n     sales in Japan of European carmakers like AB Volvo and \n     Volkswagen AG have risen at roughly the same sizzling pace \n     over the past few months as those of the Big Three--without \n     the benefit of a trade deal.\n       The upbeat nature of today's event will set the tone for \n     Clinton's trip to Tokyo next week, which is shaping up as one \n     of the friendliest U.S.-Japan summits in years as the two \n     sides concentrate on shoring up their security alliance. \n     While Clinton is expected to raise simmering trade disputes \n     over film, computer chips and insurance, the administration \n     is planning to try to focus attention on successes in other \n     trade areas.\n       U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is fond of pointing \n     out that U.S. exports to Japan soared 20 percent last year, \n     to $64 billion, yielding the first decline since 1990 in the \n     U.S.-Japan trade gap. But many economists ascribe Japan's \n     rising appetite for foreign goods to the strength of the yen, \n     which makes foreign goods cheaper to Japanese buyers, and \n     market-opening measures adopted long ago, rather than to the \n     20 U.S.-Japan trade deals struck during the Clinton era.\n       But in an election year, the White House is eager to claim \n     that its aggressive trade diplomacy is producing results. \n     That's particularly true for the auto pact, which came after \n     a high-stakes confrontation.\n       On one score, the accord has clearly helped generate \n     business for U.S. firms. Tokyo's loosening of its rules \n     concerning the parts used in required periodic auto repairs \n     enabled Tenneco Automotive, among others, to strike a \n     lucrative deal for distribution of its Monroe shock absorbers \n     in Japan.\n       But can the administration claim that it is responsible for \n     the sizable rise in sales of cars and components to Japanese \n     consumers and factories? ``Whatever success you see today, \n     the seeds were planted for that many years earlier,'' said a \n     Bush administration trade official, who noted that Japanese \n     auto companies typically choose their parts suppliers several \n     years before a car model is produced.\n       Moreover, the pact has fallen short of administration hopes \n     in one area--agreements by Japanese auto dealers to sell U.S. \n     cars. When the deal was signed, Washington declared (without \n     Tokyo's concurrence) that over the remainder of this decade, \n     200 dealers a year should sign up with GM, Ford or Chrysler. \n     Only 30 have done so in the months since the accord was \n     struck, although sources said yesterday that Chrysler may \n     soon announce a deal for 60 or 70 more.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. While I would agree that our Trade Representative Mickey \nKantor has done an impressive job, not only in negotiations with Japan \nbut with other countries as well, most notably China, but I would also \nagree with the vast majority of economic analysts who believe that most \nof the improving climate for American cars in Japan is due to natural \nmarket forces. For example, over the last year or so the yen has grown \nstronger compared with the dollar, making American goods cheaper in \nJapan. Matsushita Noriyuki, a senior economic analyst at the Nikko \nResearch Centre, attributes increased sales of U.S. cars in his country \nprimarily to the fact that the price of those cars has decreased. In \naddition, Matsushita points to major changes made by American car \nmanufacturers to accommodate Japanese tastes and habits--such as \nincreased attention to quality, right-hand steering wheels, and smaller \nmodel sizes--as a major factor in increased sales. More importantly, \ntrade agreements struck before Mr. Clinton took office--under \nRepublican administrations--are finally bearing fruit.\n  Mr. President, since 1992 we've grown used to a Clinton foreign \npolicy that is an oxymoron, to a foreign policy that is reactive rather \nthan proactive. We've grown used to a wide credibility gap between what \nGovernor Clinton said as a candidate and what his actions are as \nPresident--I've spoken before on this floor about the irony of a \nPresident who accused George Bush of coddling China now doing more \ncoddling of that country than President Bush could ever have been \naccused of.\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\n We've grown used to President Clinton coopting as his own such \nRepublican initiatives as the line-item veto, budget cutting, and calls \nfor an end to the era of big government.\n  I guess that now, as the November elections approach, it should come \nas no surprise that we can now also look forward to President Clinton's \nrhetoric far outpacing his performance in the foreign policy arena and \nfor him to increasingly take credit for the hard work of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3730-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VIOLENCE IN LEBANON\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nregarding the most recent violence in Lebanon. I have immediately \ncontacted the Clinton administration and urged them in the strongest \npossible terms to do everything in the power of the United States to \ncease the hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Many \ninnocent civilian men, women, and children have been killed and there \nhave been thousands of refugees who have been forced to flee their \nhomes.\n  The Arab-American community, many who have family and friends in \nLebanon, have communicated to me first-hand accounts of the recent \nviolence and tragedy. The most disturbing fact is the great loss of \ncivilian lives, especially the children. These deaths, no matter where \nthey occur, are always tragic.\n  To help us immediately address the plight of these innocent victims, \nI have requested emergency assistance for the Lebanese civilians and \nrefugees from the Department of State, the Agency for International \nDevelopment, and the Department of Defense. The Lebanese are in need of \nfood, medicine, water, emergency electric generators, beds, and other \nnecessities. Mr. President, I am hopeful that my colleagues will \nsupport this request for aid and I am hopeful that this administration \nwill use all of American's influence to cease the fighting in Lebanon \nimmediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3731-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRAISING THE LATE SENATOR EDMUND MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the death of Ed Mudkie marks a deep \npersonal loss for me, and a loss for our Nation. Senator Muskie was a \nclose personal friend and leader in both the Senate and our national \npolitical scene. As a young man, I can remember my admiration for his \nintegrity and dedication when I served as a midwestern State \ncoordinator for his Presidential campaign in 1972. In the Senate he was \nthe leader in urging creation of a Senate Budget Committee so the \nChamber would have a committee with a board overview of the budget \nprocess. In this time of public concern over the Federal budget, it is \nimportant we remember that as the first chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Muskie warned the Congress and the Nation of the \nneed to balance our Federal budget to protect America's future. Those \nof us who serve on the committee today are still mindful of the \nforesight he showed, and are working to see that his legacy is \nfulfilled. Americans of this generation also owe a debt to the former \nSenator from Maine for his vision and his tireless efforts in awakening \nCongress and the Nation to the critical importance of enacting \ncomprehensive laws to protect our Nation's environment for future \ngenerations. Our Nation owes him a deep debt of gratitude we can never \nrepay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3731-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3731-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:45 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following resolution:\n\n       H.

A bill to establish a National Center for Rural Law \nEnforcement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the national rural law enforcement act of 1996\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am introducing the National \nRural Law Enforcement Act of 1996. This bill is not very complicated. \nIt establishes a National Center for Rural Law Enforcement, to provide \nrural police and sheriff departments with the training they need to \nmeet the demands of modern rural law enforcement.\n  Consider a few facts and figures about rural crime and law \nenforcement:\n  One third of all Americans live in rural areas.\n  Ninety percent of the law enforcement agencies in our country serve \npopulations of 25,000 or fewer citizens. Three quarters of those \ndepartments serve fewer than 10,000 citizens.\n  Crime in rural communities has risen more than 35 percent during the \nlast decade.\n  The Criminal Justice Institute at the University of Arkansas at \nLittle Rock\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\nhas been the headquarters of a movement by rural law enforcement \nadministrators to fill the training void they face. The Institute has \nsponsored a number of conferences in five regions around the country to \nidentify the training needs of rural law enforcement and prescribe \nmeasures to meet those needs. This bill is a response to their efforts \nand the needs they have documented and described.\n  The National Center for Rural Law Enforcement will: Provide rural law \nenforcement managers training tailored to rural law enforcement needs; \nprovide research and technical assistance to rural law enforcement \nagencies; provide a communications network linking rural agency heads \naround the country, develop curriculum tailored to the needs of rural \nlaw enforcement officers; articulate the viewpoint of rural law \nenforcement professionals; and project its training capability to sites \nin communities all over the United States.\n  Every Senator represents rural communities. As we travel our States, \nwe hear time and again about sophisticated and vicious crime in small \nrural communities, the sort of crime we used to believe was found only \nin big cities. The National Center for Rural Law Enforcement will help \nto equip rural law enforcement professionals to deal with those \nproblems in the most effective manner, with the same tools their urban \ncolleagues enjoy.\n  The NCRLE will enjoy the participation and input of the FBI and the \nJustice Department and some Federal funding, but its heart and soul \nwill be the State and local law enforcement officers of rural America. \nIt represents the kind of Federal State local cooperation that is so \nvital today. I hope that arrangement, along with the obvious need for a \nNational Center for Rural Law Enforcement, will bring bipartisan \nsupport for this bill. The National Center for Rural Law Enforcement is \nnecessary. It will meet a vital need for rural America, at low cost in \nthe context of a true Federal partnership. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor the National Rural Law Enforcement Act of 1996. \n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1689. A bill to provide regulatory fairness for crude oil \nproducers, and to prohibit fee increases under the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act without the approval of Congress; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           the crude oil transportation fairness act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to remove \nan onerous and, I believe, unintended regulatory burden from \nindependent oil and gas producers. The Crude Oil Transportation \nFairness Act of 1996 would exempt oil and gas producers who do not \ntransport crude oil themselves from the registration and fee \nrequirements of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. Those who \nactually transport crude oil would continue to register and pay fees as \nunder current law. Also, the bill removes the Secretary of \nTransportation's unilateral authority under current law to raise these \nfees on transporters. My colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, has \njoined me in introducing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and that letters of support from the Independent Petroleum \nAssociation of America and the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty \nOwners Association also appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1689\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crude Oil Transportation \n     Fairness Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATORY FAIRNESS FOR CRUDE OIL PRODUCERS.\n\n       Section 5108(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a \n     person who offers crude oil or condensates for transport in \n     commerce shall not be required to file a registration \n     statement or pay a fee otherwise required under this \n     section if that person transfers title to the crude oil or \n     condensates to a transporter at the time that the crude \n     oil or condensates are initially transported in commerce \n     from a storage location by the transporter.\n       ``(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to any person who \n     transports crude oil in commerce in a quantity that is \n     subject to the requirement of this section.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF FEE INCREASES WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF \n                   CONGRESS\n\n       Section 5108(g)(2)(A) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended in the second sentence, by striking ``at least $250 \n     but not more than $5,000'' and inserting ``not more than \n     $250''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Independent Petroleum\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, 370 Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Re Crude Oil Transportation Fairness Act of 1996\n\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The Independent Petroleum Association \n     of America (IPAA) strongly supports The Crude Oil \n     Transportation Fairness Act of 1996 and appreciate your \n     efforts on behalf of independent oil and natural gas \n     producers. As you know, IPAA represents approximately 5,500 \n     independent oil and natural gas producers in 33 states. The \n     regulatory problem which is addressed in the proposed \n     legislation has been particularly onerous for our membership \n     as they are primarily small businesses with less than 20 \n     employees that can not afford the annual fee assessed under \n     this program.\n       The Hazardous Materials Transportation Registration and Fee \n     Assessment Program, which was implemented under the Hazardous \n     Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990, requires \n     registration for persons engaged in transporting or offering \n     for transportation certain categories and quantities of \n     hazardous materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign \n     commerce. Persons subject to the registration program are \n     required to annually file a registration statement with DOT \n     and pay a total annual fee of $300. Last year, DOT \n     unsuccessfully proposed a graduated filing fee that would in \n     many cases raise the registration fee to $5050.\n       After a major educational effort led by IPAA, with strong \n     congressional support, the proposal was defeated. However, \n     even at the $300 per year level, IPAA has strongly opposed \n     the inclusion of persons who ``offered for transportation'' \n     in the registration program as both burdensome and \n     unnecessary. Crude oil producers sell their oil to purchasers \n     who take possession of it on the lease directly from the \n     crude oil storage tank. The purchaser owns the crude oil \n     before it ever reaches a public road. While the oil is in the \n     storage tank the facility owner is subject to numerous state \n     and federal safety requirements.\n       At a time when our domestic oil production has fallen to \n     its lowest point in 40 years, and over 500,000 jobs in the \n     industry have been lost in the last decade, we cannot \n     continue to penalize domestic producers. The current \n     financial state of the domestic oil and gas industry is \n     illustrated by the following indicators:\n       Jobs. Since the early 1980s, oil and gas employment has \n     been cut in half. Employment in the industry through 1996 \n     stood at 305,100 employees compared to 332,800 in 1995. There \n     has been a loss of 9500 employees since 1995 and nearly \n     500,000 since 1985.\n       Crude Oil Production. Crude oil production in 1995 fell to \n     an estimated 6.5 MMb/d, compared to 6.7 MMb/d during 1994, \n     representing a 200,000 b/d decrease. Crude oil production in \n     the lower 48 states has fallen to 5 MMb/d, the lowest level \n     since 1946.\n       Rotary Rig Activity. In 1995, the rotary rig count averaged \n     723 rotary rigs for the United States, a decrease of 52 rigs \n     from 1994. This is the second lowest rig count since World \n     War II. Forty-five percent of the rigs were drilling for oil, \n     53 percent for gas and 2 percent miscellaneous.\n       Well Completions. In 1995, total well completions totaled \n     19,756, with 8,114 wells completed for the production of \n     natural gas, 6,917 wells completed for the production of \n     crude oil and 4,725 dry holes. There were 2,037 fewer \n     completions in 1995 than 1994. In 1985, 70,806 wells were \n     completed, a 72% decline in 10 years.\n       In conclusion, IPAA strongly supports the Crude Oil \n     Transportation Fairness Act which will have the effect of \n     eliminating the DOT Hazardous Materials Transportation fee \n     for individuals and companies that only offer for sale, but \n     do not transport crude oil or condensates.\n       Thank you again for your legislative leadership in this \n     area.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Denise A. Bode,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     Texas Independent Producers &\n\n\n                                   Royalty Owners Association,\n\n                                        Austin TX, March 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, 370 Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of Texas independent oil and \n     gas producers, I wish to thank you for introducing the \n     ``Crude Oil Transportation Fairness Act of 1996.'' As you \n     know, this bill is badly needed to ensure that another \n     unnecessary, onerous regulation does not play a role in the \n     demise of the small independent oil and gas producer.\n       Your bill will ensure that the regulation is properly \n     applied to those who transport crude and not those who only \n     sell it. Some of our members are also transporters and\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\n     should be paying this fee, but far more are producers who \n     produce crude and sell it at the lease. Those producers have \n     unfortunately been required to pay this transporter fee \n     needlessly.

These \npeople have undertaken magnificent and courageous endeavors, endeavors \nof which the American people should be very proud.\n  Today I also want to focus on the challenge that must be faced in \ndealing with this unfortunate turn of events in West Africa.\n  After a few months of guarded optimism that there might be peace in \nLiberia, it appears that this woeful country is once again on the brink \nof collapse. Looting and fighting have overtaken the capital, halting \nimplementation of the Abuja Accords, suspending humanitarian operations \nand limiting food and water supplies. In addition to the 1 million-odd \nrefugees around Liberia, 60,000 people have been newly displaced in \nMonrovia, and 15 to 20,000 Liberians are crowded into the Barclay's \nTraining Center [BTC], seeking protection from tribal warfare. After \nUnited States evacuation efforts, only 19 Americans remain in Liberia \nin an official capacity, and humanitarian efforts are endangered. The \nprospects look bleak, but our resolve to contain the fighting and \ndisintegration must remain steadfast. We have so few alternatives.\n  Since September 1995 when the Abuja Accords were signed by all the \nwarring factions, the United States, along with other interested \nmembers of the international community, has tried to help implement \nthem. The primary tasks were deploying West African peacekeeping forces \nthrough ECOMOG throughout the country, militarily disengaging and \ndisarming the factions, and quickly investing in an economy that had \nvirtually nothing to offer the citizens of Liberia.\n  Mr. President, this has not been overly successful. While thee have \nbeen many false hopes in Liberia, Abuja represented a reasonable plan, \nbut only if each phase of that plan was fully met. It has not been--not \nby the Liberian factions, not by the international community, and not \nby the United States.\n  ECOMOG has never been strong enough to help create an atmosphere of \nstability needed for peace to survive. Nigerian elements have remained \ndominant in ECOMOG, while new forces--such as a Ghanaian battalion that \nhad previously succeeded at peacekeeping missions--have not been \nfunded. This is a failing of the international community, including the \nUnited States, that had pledged to support the Abuja Accords. At the \npledging conference, the United States committed $10 million for \nECOMOG--a small sum for peace in any case. We have only delivered $5.5 \nmillion of that.\n  Mr. President, strengthening ECOMOG to help it carry out its mission \nis a commitment the United States made, correctly, to help prevent an \nexplosion like the current one in Monrovia from occurring. But the fact \nthat we barely delivered on our commitment has been damaging to the \npeace process. Two months ago, Senator Kassebaum and I made a proposal \nto transfer $20 million from democracy programs at AID to help fund a \nnew battalion for ECOMOG. An unusual source of funding, perhaps, but \nindicative of the high priority we placed on the funding of ECOMOG, and \na statement that ECOMOG is part of our development efforts in West \nAfrica. The administration opposed this particular transfer, but \npromised to work to come up with other sources of funding for ECOMOG. \nNot only did the administration not find the money, but it also did \nlittle in this time frame to solicit contributions from others. Crises \nlike these demand creative responses, so I would propose we take a hard \nlook at other programs for this purpose. Strong cases can be made that \nLiberia is relevant to both these accounts. I will work with the \nadministration to continue to look for resources which we can redirect \nto this cause.\n\n  In theory I support the proposals I have heard about on the table \ntoday to extend communications and other logistical support and \ntraining to new battalions for ECOMOG, but I can't resist asking why \nthe administration didn't focus on this earlier? Why did it take \nmassive looting and displacement in Monrovia to solicit this response? \nAnd if the fighting lulls, will the interest in Liberia be sustained \nlong enough to actually realize a support package for the Abuja \nAccords? I will be anxious to see what plan the European Command \nsubmits to the United States at the end of this week, and, if \nappropriate, will do what I can to assist the administration in making \nthese plans operational.\n  While I understand and sympathize with the tight budgets under which \nthe administration must live, this is symptomatic of a larger trend to \nresistance to reinvent U.S. activities in the realm of peacemaking that \nI see. For example, at the time of the Abuja Accords, the United States \npledged $75 million to help implement the peace process; $10 million of \nthat was for ECOMOG, and $65 million for humanitarian assistance. I \nfully support emergency aid, Mr. President, but I think it is short-\nsighted--and perhaps even becomes as self-fulfilling prophecy--when we \nunder-finance peace and development efforts, because we are invested in \nhumanitarian funding. In Liberia, it is to some degree a chicken-and-\negg scenario, given the destruction and desperation in the country. \nHowever, this should not deter us from investing in creation of an \ninfrastructure for peace and development. As we ignore development \nneeds, we only increase the potential for violent outbreaks, which, in \nturn, as we saw in Bosnia and Rwanda, could lead to the use of United \nStates troops. While I understand that the use of United States \nmilitary in Liberia is quite unlikely, if we do not invest in the peace \nprocess and in Liberia's development, we could very well face calls for \nUnited States military engagement, which in my view would be tragic and \nunwise.\n  Regional peacekeeping is a peace and development idea worth investing \nin, Mr. President. In a post-cold-war era, as we restructure U.S. and \nU.N. doctrines for the use of force, it will become inevitable that \nregional forces, in most cases, will be the best deterrent early on to \ncontain the spread of violence and instability. If the international \ncommunity ignores, or does not work to strengthen, these organizations \nthen it will all too often lead to pressure for the deployment of \nforeign--and in some cases American--troops. Bosnia is a prime example: \nfor several years we tried to work with the Europeans to address \neffectively the Balkan war. But when it was clear the Europeans had \ncompletely failed, for a variety of reasons, it was U.S. troops that \nstepped in to fill the vacuum and lead the way to a peace \nimplementation force. I still disagree with the decision to deploy \nUnited States troops in Bosnia, and I see the potential for calls for a \nsimilar path in Liberia if we do not support ECOMOG at this important \njuncture.\n\n  Another serious failure of Abuja has been the process of disarmament. \nUnder Abuja, all parties were to disengage and disarm completely by \nFebruary of this year. Of course, without any economic alternative \nother than soldiering, or any hope of protecting themselves without \ntheir weapons, most Liberians did not disarm. The lack of logistical \nsupport also made it difficult for ECOMOG to deploy to supervise the \ndisarmament. Then, factions such as Charles Taylor's NPFL placed \nconditions on disarmament--in effect, reopening the delicate Abuja \nAccord. Another problem in the disarmament effort has been the last of \neffort by Liberia's neighbors--namely Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire, and \nGuinea--in halting the arms--on both the black and gray markets--that \ncross their borders into Liberia.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue we should take quite seriously. I \nhave\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\nraised the issue directly with parties involved in public and private, \nand am aware that high-ranking administration officials have done the \nsame. Yet even as Abuja had its most reasonable chance to succeed, arms \nhave flowed to the parties each country it favors. I will work to \nfinally activate the U.N. Commission that was created after the U.N. \narms embargo was imposed against Liberia, and establish sanctions for \nthose flaunting the international embargo. I will also submit that if \nthis practice continues, the United States consider sanctions of its \nown against those working to undermine the Abuja Accords. At a minimum, \nwe should revive the sanctions against individuals working against \ndemocratization efforts that were lifted when Abuja was concluded.\n  At this point, I request that an op-ed in yesterdays' New York Times \nby Jeffery Goldburg be printed in the Record. I do not agree with all \nthe conclusions it draws, particularly the proposal that the preferable \ncourse of action is to have U.S. marines occupy Monrovia. However, I do \nrecommend the article as a cogent analysis of what went wrong, and what \nthe United States can try to do the repair the Abuja process.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 15, 1996]\n\n                      Lifting Liberia Out of Chaos\n\n                         (By Jeffrey Goldberg)\n\n       George Boley stood in a clearing deep in a Liberian rain \n     forest and said that he was misunderstood. ``I am not a \n     warlord,'' he told me in late 1994. ``I don't know why they \n     use this term to describe me.''\n       Behind the self-styled chairman of the wildly misnamed \n     Liberian Peace Council stood 80 soldiers. Most were teen-\n     agers, some were as young as 9. All were armed, many were \n     drunk. ``These are professional fighting men,'' he said, \n     without irony.\n       Mr. Boley, who holds a Ph.D. in educational administration \n     from the University of Akron, is most assuredly a warlord, as \n     are the other Liberian faction leaders who last week drove \n     their country back into chaos.\n       Fighting in the capital, Monrovia, has killed untold \n     numbers. United States troops have evacuated more than 1,600 \n     Americans and other foreigners. But the United States must \n     take stronger action to restore peace--and it can do so \n     without endangering American troops.\n       The civil war began in 1989 when Charles Taylor, the \n     warlord of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, invaded \n     from neighboring Ivory Coast. The next year, Liberia's \n     dictator, Master Sgt. Samuel Doe, was killed, setting off six \n     years of gang warfare among several factions.\n       A peace accord struck in Abuja, Nigeria, last August was \n     supposed to end the war. It handed Monrovia over to the \n     warlords, who agreed to share power peacefully. But they \n     never came through on their pledge to disarm their \n     supporters.\n       So it was inevitable that violence would erupt this month \n     after Mr. Taylor sent his men to arrest a rival, Roosevelt \n     Johnson, on murder charges. Mr. Johnson's faction has indeed \n     murdered civilians. But Mr. Taylor's fighters have also \n     indiscriminately killed civilians, including five American \n     nuns in 1992.\n       The fault for this new spasm of violence rests mostly with \n     the warlords, of course. But the United States is also to \n     blame. Last year, it missed a chance to adequately finance a \n     disarmament effort by the United Nations and West African \n     Peacekeeping Force, which has been in Liberia since 1990.\n       The peacekeeping force--with soldiers from nine countries--\n     successfully defended Monrovia from a 1992 attack by Charles \n     Taylor's faction. But it is now demoralized, cashstrapped and \n     undermanned. Its ground forces, once at 12,000, are down to \n     5,000 or so poorly equipped men. Their commanders are for the \n     most part Nigerian Army generals and are widely considered \n     corrupt.\n       For Liberia, the best scenario would have United States \n     Marines occupying Monrovia. But with Somalia still fresh on \n     Americans' minds, this is probably not politically feasible. \n     Still, a strong West African force of about 15,000 men could \n     disarm the ragtag factions and weaken the warlords. This \n     would take American cash and equipment--from ammunition and \n     food to armored vehicles and helicopters. The United States \n     would also have to send military trainers and communications \n     equipment to Ghana and other willing and capable West African \n     nations.\n       All this would cost more than $20 million. But over the \n     past six years, Washington has poured almost half a billion \n     dollars of humanitarian aid into the country, not including \n     the cost of the current evacuation--the third such operation \n     since 1989.\n       America has a special responsibility to Liberia, founded in \n     1847 by freed American slaves. Liberia was also an American \n     ally in the cold war, and $500 million in American aid \n     propped up the brutal Doe regime.\n       The only way to end the terror of the warlords is to take \n     their guns away. If Washington helps West African troops do \n     so, not a single American soldier would be endangered. And it \n     would ultimately cost less than airlifting Americans out of \n     Monrovia every time the city explodes.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Situations like Liberia--and indeed other conflicts \nthat have not been resolved by post-cold-war politics--demand creative \nresponses by the international community. Liberia poses challenges that \ndo not fall under the traditional definitions of United States national \nsecurity, but they do include threats to our well-being and national \ninterests. For instance, as Liberian refugees spill over into Guinea, \nthe stresses on some of the last remaining tropical rainforest in West \nAfrica become untenable, and the rainforest shrinks, causing shortages \nof resources, food, and medicine. Large concentrations on refugees and \ndisplaced persons also heighten potential for outbreaks of disease. One \ncase of Ebola or typhoid in a refugee camp, and we have a humanitarian \ndisaster that can spread anywhere in just a plane ride.\n  Unfortunately, our option is not to pull out of Liberia and wash our \nhands of the problem: because of regional ramifications and threats of \ndisease and environmental degradation, the issue is whether we meet the \nchallenge of Liberia, or invest more after more destruction in the \ntragedies that would unravel in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Cote D'Ivoire, \nBurkina Faso, Ghana, and perhaps elsewhere in West Africa. So, \nMr. President, we don't really have a choice: the problem is \nmaintaining stability in West Africa, whether we call it Liberia or \nBurkina.\n\n  For these reasons, yesterday I introduced a resolution, Senate \nResolution 248 with Senators Kassebaum, Simon, Leahy, Jeffords, and \nPell, declaring the breakdown of the Abuja process would have serious \nramifications for United States interests in Liberia and throughout \nWest Africa, and urging the administration to consider a number of \nsteps. These include scrutinizing the budget to find funding for \nECOMOG; this is key. We also suggest considering the provision of \nexcess defense articles for communications and logistical support for \ntroops willing to participate in ECOMOG. The resolution also urges the \nadministration to use its influence with other governments to solicit \ninterest in ECOMOG, and finally, it calls on the administration to lead \nU.N. efforts to establish finally a committee to enforce the U.N. arms \nembargo against Liberia. These are all suggestions that the \nadministration should consider, and it is not an exhaustive list. The \npoint is, we need decisive and creative action in Liberia--and part of \nthat must be real support for the west African peacekeeping force.\n  So, once again I applaud the work of our diplomatic and military \nforces in Liberia today, and compliment the administration on its \nefforts to help calm the situation. At the same time, I urge them to \nfocus fully on Liberia--not just to quell the current tensions, but \ninvest in trying to prevent them from erupting again.\n  I also want to express our gratitude to Ghana's President Jerry \nRawlings and his senior diplomatic team which has worked tirelessly and \nsomewhat successfully to negotiate a ceasefire. Other ECOWAS states, \nparticularly Cote D'Ivoire, have been very helpful in trying to reach \nthe same goal. We also owe a debt of gratitude to Sierra Leone for \nmaking Freetown available as a transit point for those evacuated. While \nmultilateral efforts may have failed to this point in Liberia, with \neach step--as painful as it is--the United States, ECOWAS, and the rest \nof the international community seem to be strengthening their \nabilities. We must learn from the past and look creatively to the \nfuture: we have no choice, unless we are willing to confront what could \nbe even bigger disasters in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3735-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3736-S3737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Senate moved in \na positive direction in reforming our Nation's health care system. S. \n1028, a bill narrow in scope that builds upon and strengthens the \ncurrent private market system, moved one step closer to becoming law.\n  During yesterday's debate, the merits of including medical savings \naccounts in the legislation were discussed at great length. I believe \nMSA's are a good idea. MSA's give people control over their health care \ndollars and encourage them to make their own decisions about health \ncare benefits. They preserve medical freedom and provide plenty of \nincentives for cost control.\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\n  Choice is the keystone of MSA's. As many of my colleagues have \npointed out, with MSA's people can choose their physician, their \nhospital, their health care plan. Additionally, MSA's will bring about \nlower health care spending. Consumers will become more savvy about \ntheir health care options, and certainly the system will benefit as a \nresult.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that it was absolutely clear that \nincluding an MSA provision would derail the entire bill and a real \nopportunity to enact meaningful health care reform would be lost. If \nthe legislation had included that provision, my Democratic colleagues \nindicated they would filibuster the bill and the President indicated he \nwould veto the entire measure. In short, this targeted, commonsense \nbill would have been killed.\n  I am dedicated to the passage of health care reform and I do not want \na good bill to be sacrificed for one provision, however worthy that \nprovision may be. It was for this reason that I did not support the \ninclusion of MSA's in the final bill, and it's also the reason this MSA \neffort failed.\n  Yes, Mr. President, medical savings accounts are a good idea. \nAlthough S. 1028 was not the right vehicle, I will look for other \nopportunities to promote and encourage them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3736-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE CADDO MAGNET ORCHESTRA\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional group of students from my hometown of Shreveport, LA. The \nCaddo Magnet Orchestra, combined of 103 high school and middle school \nstudents from Caddo Parish in northwestern Louisiana, has for years \nbeen recognized as one of the most outstanding student orchestras in \nour State. Since its inception in 1980, the orchestra has consistently \nreceived superior performance ratings in all regional and State \ncompetitions and has won several prestigious awards from music \nfestivals around the Nation. In light of its impressive reputation, \nthis year the orchestra was invited to perform at Carnegie Hall, a rare \nprivilege offered to very few young performers.\n  After many months of intensive rehearsal and fundraising, the Caddo \nMagnet Orchestra traveled to New York City last month for its March 24 \nCarnegie Hall debut, where its performance was met by a standing \novation from the 1,000 audience members in attendance. The evening's \nperformance, consisting of pieces by English composers Gustav Holst, \nJohn Ireland, Edward Elgar and John Rutter, was flawless and has earned \nthis orchestra national recognition.\n  Louisiana is enormously proud of these outstanding young people, not \nonly for their individual talents, but also for their overall \ncommitment to excellence and their spirit of community. The students \nworked together to make beautiful music, and the harmony they created \nrepresents all that can be achieved when we put forth our best efforts \nto reach a common goal. This is citizenship at its finest.\n  The members of the orchestra have represented the State of Louisiana \nwith great distinction. I congratulate these musicians and their \ndirector, Ms. Johnette Parker, as well as the parents and faculty of \nCaddo Magnet High School and Caddo Middle Magnet School for their \nmarvelous collective effort in reaching this pinnacle and for setting \nan example of excellence from which we all can benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3737-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO JUDI BAYLY AND HER IRISH SETTER, LYRIC\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \nNashua, NH, resident, Judi Bayly and her 8-year-old Irish setter, \nLyric, who dialed 911 and helped save Judi's life when she noticed Judi \nhad stopped breathing.\n  Last month, Judi Bayly who has asthma and sleep apnea, stopped \nbreathing temporarily. When the oxygen generator she uses became \nunplugged and the alarm sounded, Judi did not hear it as she slept. \nLyric, her Irish setter, did and tried to alert Judi by barking, pawing \nand sniffing at her. Unfortunately, Judi didn't wake up so Lyric dialed \n911. When rescuers arrived at Judi's house, Lyric continued to bark and \nguided them to her.\n  Amazingly, Lyric has also saved Judi's life twice before by dialing \n911. Although Lyric is trained by Service Dogs America in New York to \nrecognize Judi's seizures, Lyric has a special loyalty to Judi and is \nby her side constantly. As an emergency medical technician, Judi also \ntrains dogs professionally. She has bred Irish setters before and she \nand her husband own three of Lyric's puppies. I admire Judi's devotion \nto her dogs and her promotion of the use of trained dogs.\n  Lyric is an exceptional dog and deserves the national recognition she \nhas seen over the past few weeks. Lyric is an example of a truly \nsensitive and astute dog. As a dog lover myself, I congratulate Lyric \nand her owner on a job well done!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3737-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REV.

Roosevelt \nAustin and his wife, Dr. Nurame Austin, who will be celebrating their \n40 years of dedicated service to the Saginaw community and the State of \nMichigan. Reverend Austin is the pastor of Zion Missionary Baptist \nChurch in Saginaw, MI.\n  Reverend Austin was ordained June 25, 1953, at Western Seventh \nDistrict Association in Opelousas, LA. This day was the start of a long \nand fruitful career of community service. Reverend Austin's pastoral \nexperience began as a youth minister at Mt. Calvary Baptist Church in \nOpelousas, LA, the church where he was converted on April 7, 1936. \nReverend Austin went on to receive bachelor's and master's degrees in \ntheology. He received a doctorate of divinity degree with honors from \nthe American Divinity School in Chicago, IL.\n  Reverend Austin has always stressed the importance of education. He \nhas become a shining example to the community of what a lifetime of \nlearning can accomplish. He has served on local, State, and national \ncongresses of Christian education. He has also served as a board member \non the Commission on Quality Education for All Children for Saginaw \nPublic Schools. Reverend Austin sees that improving the condition of \nour inner cities begins with improving the education of our children.\n  Reverend Austin's dedication to improving the condition of our \nNation's inner cities has been a driving in his life s work. During the \ncourse of his career, Reverend Austin has taken part in many \ninstitutes, organizations, and community groups that focus on solving \nproblems associated with poverty. He is a board member of the Saginaw \nchapter of the NAACP and also serves as a spiritual advisor to inmates \nat the Saginaw County Jail.\n  On May 4, 1996, Reverend Austin will be awarded an honorary doctor of \nhumanities degree from Saginaw Valley State University for the \nleadership role he has played in seeking neighborhood improvement.\n  Through his life's work, Reverend Austin has touched and improved the \nlives of countless people. I know that my Senate colleagues will join \nme in congratulating Rev. Roosevelt Austin on his 40 years of \noutstanding service to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3737-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3737-S3738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HIGHLAND HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC DECATHLON TEAM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nstudents and coach of the Highland High School Academic Decathlon Team. \nThis team, comprising of 15 New Mexico students, is the New Mexico \nrepresentative to the 1996 National Academic Decathlon competition in \nAtlanta, GA.\n  The academic decathlon is a unique program that encourages \nacademically well rounded students to compete in a variety of events. \nThe decathlon encourages students to develop a greater respect for \nknowledge, promotes wholesome competition in academic areas of study \nand interest, stimulates intellectual growth and achievement, and \nencourages public interest and awareness of outstanding programs in our \nschools. This valuable program challenges students to strive for goals \nand to work hard academically.\n  Mr. President, these 15 students and their coach have worked \nextremely hard since early fall to prepare themselves for this event. \nThrough their hard work and their extensive efforts, they have been \nable to overcome obstacles and achieve very high goals. Too often, Mr. \nPresident, we reward students for their athletic prowess instead of \ntheir academic abilities. Today, I\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\nwant to highlight the achievements of these students. Our students can \nbe champions in the classroom as well as on the athletic field.\n  Mr. President, for their outstanding accomplishments, and their \nsincere commitment to academics, I commend the members of the Highland \nHigh School Decathlon team. I believe that I speak for all New Mexicans \nwhen I wish them the best of luck and congratulate them on their \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3737-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE DOMENICI-WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, last night Senators Domenici and \nWellstone introduced an amendment to establish parity in treatment \nbetween mental health and physical health. I want to thank them for \ntheir leadership. Their remarks, along with those by Senators Conrad \nand Simpson, were moving and sometimes very personal. I know they were \ninspiring to me, and I believe to many others, as the strong vote in \nfavor of their amendment suggests. I congratulate them.\n  There is little doubt remaining even among the most skeptical people \nthat biochemical disturbances are major precipitating factors for the \nmajor mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major \ndepression. Nonetheless, longstanding biases, which are really fears in \ndisguise, still frame our understanding and treatment of mental health \ndisorders and mental illness. As Senators Domenici and Wellstone have \nsaid so well, it is time for this country to speak more openly and \nforcefully about the broad scope of mental health issues. Mr. \nPresident, last night we began the important work of reforming our \nhealth insurance practices so that more Americans have access to health \ninsurance and greater protection against losing coverage. We will \ncomplete this step of that work on Tuesday. With this work, we have an \nexcellent opportunity to begin to build a healthcare insurance \nstructure that recognizes both physical and psychological factors in \nhealth and illness.\n  One of the most promising directions in healthcare is the increased \nrecognition of social and psychological variables. We know that \ndepression is a better predictor of relapse among coronary patients \nthan is a high cholesterol level. We know that breast cancer patients \nwho participate in support groups experience greater longevity than \nthose who do not. We know that 50 to 60 percent of patients who visit a \nprimary care physician do not have a physical condition that can be \ndiagnosed. Instead, they bring the sequelae of trauma, violence, and \nabuse. They bring masked drug and alcohol problems; they bring rage and \nimpulse control problems that are often amplified by the loss of \nemployment, marital and family strains. They bring a sense of \nhopelessness that can get so bad that suicide seems like the only way \nout.\n  Mr. President, we know that emotional and behavioral factors, \nincluding tobacco use, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle are ones \ncontributing to physical health problems and huge healthcare costs.\n  By treating physical, psychological, and other factors together in a \ncollaborative setting, we can begin to control and change many of the \nmanifestations of illness.\n  This insurance reform debate has provided an occasion to highlight \nthis model of health and subsequent opportunities to work toward \ngreater parity for mental health treatment.\n  Last night Senator Domenici has called the inequities in the \ntreatment of mental illness and physical illness ``one of the real, \ncontinuing injustices in America today * * * someone with schizophrenia \nis just as sick as your neighbor with cancer.''\n  Senator Domenici is right. Serious mental illness is devastating in a \nway that few of us can imagine. Enough of the discrimination we have \nshown toward those who are mentally ill. Enough of the blind eye and \ndeaf ear we have turned toward mental health. Today, Mr. President, I \nam asking that this country catch up with science, catch up with the \nreality of who goes to the doctor with what kind of problem. Today, Mr. \nPresident, we need to understand that compassion does not have to be \ncostly. We can use our brains and show our heart and say it is time to \nwork toward parity between mental health and physical health. We can \nwork toward health care treatments that show that mind and body are not \nseparate.\n  As Senator Wellstone said last night, ``for too long mental health \nhas been put in parentheses.'' I agree. I ask that we take away those \nparentheses that are more like prisons to those suffering and begin to \nstudy how we can provide better, comprehensive health care that is fair \nto all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3738-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL COUNTY GOVERNMENT WEEK\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National \nCounty Government Week from April 21 to 27.\n  National County Government Week is an important opportunity to \nremember the values on which our country was founded. County \ngovernments have an advantage over the mammoth Federal bureaucracy--\ncounty governments are able to keep in touch with their constituency.\n  Before the voters in Montana asked me to represent them in \nWashington, DC, the voters in Yellowstone County asked me to be their \ncommissioner. I know from experience that county governments can easily \nmaintain a high level of efficiency.\n  Local governments don't compromise the sovereignty of the individual, \nwhich tends to be the case with the Federal Government. Mr. President, \nas the role of today's Federal Government expands, so does its \nintervention into the privacy of individuals.\n  The Montana Association of County Governments, also known as MACO, \nalong with its national parent organization NACO, has the ability to \nreallocate the power of the Federal bureaucracy in a manner that would \nbenefit all Montana taxpayers.\n  The goal of the Republican agenda, a goal I heartily support, is the \nredistribution of Federal power to the State, county and local \ngovernments. As a former Yellowstone County commissioner, I had face-\nto-face encounters with Montana taxpayers on a daily basis. If a \nMontanan had a concern about local, State, and even Federal issues, all \nthey had to do was pick up the phone and call me at the office or at \nhome--my number was listed. And whether they wanted to talk about the \nneighbors' cattle that seemed to always be loose or potholes you could \nlose a tractor in, my experiences as a Yellowstone County elected \nofficial were a valuable lesson in where the rubber really meets the \nroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3738-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3738-S3739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR, CHUCK \n                               HENDERSON\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a hard-\nworking New Hampshire entrepreneur, Chuck Henderson, on being named the \n1996 New Hampshire Small Business Person of the Year. The New Hampshire \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) recently honored Chuck with this \naward, and in June, he will receive special recognition from the \nPresident.\n  In 1969, as a young high school student, Chuck started a business by \ndeveloping his first skiing product. Twenty-six years later, Chuck is \nthe proud owner of Chuck Roast Equipment, Inc., which now offers more \nthan 100 products for cold weather. His company is nationally known and \nemploys 47 people.\n  Chuck grew up in Conway, NH, and undoubtedly saw a need for warm \nclothing during the severe winter months. Snow gaiters were the first \nproducts he developed while in high school in response to wet socks and \npants during cross country skiing. Chuck Roast Equipment, Inc., now has \nan extensive line of high-quality outerwear. His company has been one \nof the leaders in the production of pile clothing, and its brightly \ncolored and patterned fleece jackets and pullovers are popular across \nthe country. Other products include hats, mittens, blankets, daypacks, \nand baby buntings. He now sells to over 300 retailers, exports to six \ncountries, and operates three retail stores in the State.\n  As a dedicated entrepreneur, Chuck attributes the success of his \nbusiness to perseverance, hiring and keeping competent and loyal \nemployees while also diversifying the product line when\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\nthe need arises. He also donates baby bunting to every baby born at \nMemorial Hospital in North Conway and is involved in other community \nservice projects.\n  He credits the SBA and its resource partners, the Service Corps of \nRetired Executives [SCORE] and the New Hampshire Small Business \nDevelopment Center [SNDC] with helping Chuck Roast get started and grow \nto be the success company it is today. His company received several SBA \nloans and the assistance from the agency's export finance program.\n  Small business is the backbone of our economy in the United States. I \nam proud to honor Chuck for preserving and establishing a thriving \nbusiness in New Hampshire. He has devoted himself to working hard and \nproviding our State with warm clothes during the harsh winters. \nCongratulations to Chuck and all the employees at Chuck Roast \nEquipment, Inc., for this prestigious recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3738-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3739-S3740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HYANNIS FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, May 8, 1996, marks the 100th \nanniversary of the establishment of the Hyannis Fire Department and the \nHyannis Fire District. It is a privilege to take this opportunity to \ncommemorate this important milestone and to commend Commissioner \nRichard Gallagher and all the brave men and women who have served in \nthe Hyannis Fire Department over the past 100 years.\n  Over the years, the members of the department have done an \noutstanding job protecting the people of Hyannis, and they have also \nbeen valued friends and neighbors. My family and I, as longtime \nresidents of Hyannis, have many friends in the department, and we \ngreatly admire their ability and dedication.\n  I welcome this opportunity to join many others in Massachusetts in \npraising the Hyannis Fire Department on this auspicious centennial \nanniversary, and I ask that an article by Edward F. Maher published in \n1930, entitled ``The History and Functioning of the Hyannis Fire \nDistrict,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n        The History and Functioning of the Hyannis Fire District\n\n       The history of the Hyannis Fire District, as given by \n     Edward F. Maher before the Hyannis League of Woman Voters on \n     Tuesday, Dec. 29th last, was of such general interest and so \n     informing in detail that it is printed herewith in its \n     entirety;\n       The science of Civil Government enlightens us on the great \n     aspect of National life, describes the divisions and sub-\n     divisions of the great body politic into which our nation is \n     divided and sets forth the laws and methods by which they are \n     administered.\n       The National government, at Washington levies taxes, makes \n     and executes laws applicable to the country as a whole and to \n     the territories thereof. The various state governments make \n     and execute laws applicable to the states as a whole.\n       The states are divided into counties which have functions \n     dealing with large sections of the state and separated from \n     the rest for political or judicial purposes.\n       The counties of the state are divided into cities and \n     towns.\n       The cities are the large populous and compact sections \n     incorporated as muncipalities usually having a mayor and \n     council in charge.\n       The towns are the more numerous sub-divisions, often large \n     in area but of not sufficient wealth and population to be \n     incorporated as a city. The rights and duties of a city. The \n     rights and duties of the voters of towns are unique in that \n     the matter of raising moneys and its appropriation is \n     exercised by the voters themselves whereas in cities, \n     counties and other large divisions this power is delegated to \n     others. It has been said that the New England town meeting is \n     the ideal form of Democratic government.\n       Now it may transpire that there is a certain populous, and \n     important community within a town that desires certain \n     conveniences, improvements and protection that the town as a \n     whole may not wish to provide funds for. In that case the law \n     provided that this community may petition the town to set it \n     aside as a Fire District and define its boundaries. If the \n     town refuses to comply the petitioners may proceed to \n     organize a Fire District under the general laws.\n       A Fire District may be formed also by special act of the \n     legislature.\n       In the course of events it came about that the village of \n     Hyannis required improvements, conveniences and protection \n     comparable with its material growth, and it was evident these \n     could only be acquired through the incorporation of the \n     village of Hyannis as a Fire District.\n       Now a Fire District is in some respects like a little town \n     with restricted rights. Its powers being the right to raise \n     money by taxation for the maintenance of a Fire Department, \n     including fire houses, fire engines, chemical engines, hook \n     and ladder trucks, articles used in the extinguishment of \n     fires, hose carriages, hydrant rental, pay for firemen, a few \n     other minor matters and the installation and maintenance of \n     street lights, Its activities are limited to these matters, \n     unless by special act of the legislature.\n       Now the establishment and organization of the Hyannis Fire \n     District was achieved in this manner:\n       An article was inserted in the warrant for the annual town \n     meeting held, on March 2, 1896 on petition of a number of \n     citizens, inhabitants of Hyannis, to see if the town of \n     Barnstable will receive and act on said petition for the \n     establishment of a Fire District in the village of Hyannis.\n       Following such refusal a petition signed by a number of \n     freeholders, inhabitants of Hyannis was addressed to the \n     selectmen of the town of Barnstable asking them to notify a \n     meeting of the inhabitants of the proposed District to meet \n     in Hyannis for the purpose of considering the expidiancy of \n     organizing the Fire District and establishing a Fire \n     Department.\n       The selectmen of the town of Barnstable called a meeting of \n     the voters of Hyannis the same being held in Masonic Hall, \n     Hyannis on May 6, 1896 and there after fullfiling all the \n     legal requirements was voted to stablish the Hyannis Fire \n     District with the same limits as set forth in the petition to \n     the selectmen of the town of Barnstable.\n       At this meeting the Fire District organized by the choice \n     of Henry H. Baker, Jr., as clerk and appointed a committee \n     consisting of Messrs. Franklin Crocker, James H. French and \n     Charles C. Crocker to investigate water works and other \n     methods of fire protection.\n       The first Prudential Committee of the District elected May \n     20, 1896 consisted of F. Percy Goss, Charles C. Crocker and \n     George M. Smith.\n       On May 29, 1896 it was voted to purchase a chemical engine, \n     a hook and ladder truck, four hand, extinguishers and to \n     build a house for the use of the department the whole \n     entailing an expenditure of $1,500.00. It was voted at this \n     meeting to establish a Fire Department and at a subsequent \n     meeting O. Howard Crowell was chosen the first Chief Engineer \n     of the District.\n       On May 23, 1902 the sum of $1,100.00 was raised and \n     appropriated with which to purchase a new chemical engine the \n     first one not being deemed adequate as it had been in use \n     elsewhere before coming to Hyannis.\n       During this period and at each annual meeting there were \n     discussions, suggestions and investigations concerning street \n     lightning by the District but nothing was really accomplished \n     until the year 1904.\n       The matter of lighting the streets of Hyannis had always \n     been one of much concern. Years ago the individual would \n     place a kerosene lamp in front of his house and would keep it \n     lighted. This was done here and there throughout the village.\n       Then the Village Improvement Society was organized and with \n     such leaders as Miss Ida Bearse, Miss Clara J. Hallett, Mrs. \n     Sarilla H. Smith, Mrs. Maud P. Chase, Mrs. Cleone Chase, Mrs. \n     Ida Frost and others a more general system of lighting the \n     streets was accomplished.\n       Later under the management of the Hyannis Womans Club the \n     matter was gone into more seriously, more lights were added. \n     A system of gas lighting was introduced and a man employed to \n     care for the lights and light them at the proper time. Much \n     progress was made under that management and through their \n     untiring labors and efforts.\n       On May 25, 1904, the following vote was passed at the \n     Annual meeting of the Hyannis Fire District: Voted to accept \n     certain street lamps, poles and other appurtances, together \n     with a certain sum of money from the Social Service \n     Department of the Hyannis Woman's Club. That sum of $325 was \n     raised and appropriated at this meeting for the erection and \n     maintenance of street lights within the District, and thus \n     the Fire District formally assumed the duties of street \n     lighting. (20 street lights on moonlight schedule).\n       And thus began through the instrumentality and Co-operation \n     of the women of Hyannis a system of street lighting which has \n     steadily increased and today compares favorably with the best \n     in any town in the state.\n       In the year 1905 a movement was started to investigate the \n     installation of Hydrant and Water service in the District and \n     it was voted to petition the legislature for an act \n     authorizing it to produce pure water to the said District for \n     domestic, fire and other purposes.\n       The Legislature, in June 1906, passed an act to provide for \n     a water supply for the Hyannis Fire District to become \n     operative upon its access to the District.\n       The matter was twice formally presented to the voters of \n     the District and each time rejected.\n       Many believe that had we than accepted the provisions of \n     that act and installed our own water system, today we would \n     be free from debt and water would be had at a very low rate.\n       In 1907, a new chemical engine was purchased at an \n     expenditure of $1,300.\n       In 1909, the street lighting system had been so extended as \n     to call for an appropriation of $1,000.\n       Since its establishment and up to the year 1911, the \n     District through its Fire Department depended upon the valor \n     of its firemen and the use of hand drawn chemical engines,\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\n     hand fire extiguishers and the hook and ladder equipment to \n     cope with any conflagration and wish to say that on all \n     occasions the Fire Department has done the best of work.\n       In 1911 the Barnstable Water Company installed a water \n     system in Hyannis and the Fire District in 1912 appropriated \n     $2,380.00 to cover the rental of 68 hydrants which was at the \n     rate of $35.00 per hydrant, per annum. We have one of the \n     best water systems in the state there being a pressure of 80 \n     lbs. to the square inch at the hydrants and capable of \n     throwing three streams of water from the same hydrant to a \n     height of more than 70 ft.\n       Much can be accomplished by the chemical engines if they \n     reach a fire early, but water is the most effective agent \n     after a fire is well started.\n       In 1914 a substantial and artistic drinking fountain \n     dedicated to the use of human beings and dumb animals and \n     erected at a cost of several hundred dollars was presented to \n     the Hyannis Fire District. This fountain is located in Depot \n     Square and is a monument to the benevolence, charity and \n     humanity of the Hyannis Womans Club.\n       The appropriation for Street lighting was increased from \n     year to year according as additional lights were needed and \n     is 1922 electric lights were installed on that part of Main \n     Street between Ocean Street and the residence of Dr. Harris. \n     For a number of years there had been a division of opinion as \n     to whether pole locations should be granted on that part of \n     Main Street, but this matter having been amicably adjusted \n     Main Street received the lights as was its due.\n       In 1922 the Fire District was * * * was given further \n     attention and Main Street from the Yarmouth line to Sherman \n     Square was converted into a great white way by the \n     installation of forty 250 watt lights throughout its length. \n     This has been very satisfactory and strangers entering our \n     village are favorably impressed.\n       The Distrct seems to be very well taken care of at present. \n     There was appropriated for Street lighting at the last annual \n     meeting the sum of $4,728.00 which provides one hundred \n     sixteen 40 watt lights equitably--distributed throughout the \n     district and the forty 250 watt lights on Main Street.\n       For many years a fire alarm system was considered and there \n     was appropriated the sum of $1,100 in 1923 and the following \n     year a siren was purchased and through the courtesy of the \n     officers of the Federated church, it was installed in the \n     belfry of the church. The telephone company have co-operated \n     cordially with the District and when notice of a fire is \n     received the operator through a system of wires connected \n     with the siren sends out the alarm.\n       Heretofore all the equipment in use by the District was \n     drawn by hand or conveyed by horse or automobile but in 1923 \n     a new motorized chemical engine was purchased at a cost of \n     $3,500 which is really a credit to the community.\n       In 1923 the Fire District was enlarged by the addition of \n     adjacent territory at the request of the residents.\n       The organization of the Hyannis Fire District is as \n     follows:\n       A Prudential Committee of three members whose duties in the \n     Fire District are similar to the duties of Selectmen of \n     towns.\n       The following have served at various times since the \n     organization of the District:\n       Chas. Grocker, Percy Goss, George H. Smith, Arthur G. \n     Guyer, Edw. L. Chase, Luther G. Hallet, Irving W. Cook, Edw. \n     C. Hinckley, N.A. Bradford and the present board--Frank \n     Thacher, Chas, W. Megathlin and Edw. F. Maher.\n       The following have served as Clerk and Treasurer: Henry H. \n     Baker, Edw. F. Maher, Walter S. Chase and the present \n     incumbent Wm. G. Currier.\n       The following have served as Chief Engineer: O. Howard \n     Crowell, N. Alphonso Bradford, Irving W. Cook, W.R. Nickerson \n     and the present Chief, Everett O. Bond.\n       The present Asst. Engineers are Winslow K. Thacher, \n     Frederic Scudder and J. Lester Howland.\n       All the officers of the District serve without pay with the \n     exception that for the last few years the Clerk and Treas. \n     held by the same person is paid $50 per year.\n       The Fire Department is organized under the engineers in to \n     Fire Policy Day Crew, Night Crew, and are on call at all \n     times and should the apparatus be called out of town at any \n     time, competent men are always on duty at Hyannis.\n       The money appropriated at Fire District meetings is \n     assessed by the assessors of the town and collected by the \n     tax collector of the town and paid over to Treasurer of the \n     Fire District.\n       A total of $118,416.33 has been appropriated in the Fire \n     District since its establishment.\n       The assessed valuation of property real and personal within \n     the District in 1898 was $970,000.00 and on April of this \n     year it amounted to $2,757,610.00 and at the present time it \n     is probably more than $3,000,000.00 and is larger than most \n     towns in Barnstable County.\n       For some years the old engine house has been inadequate for \n     the needs of the Fire Department and last year the District \n     voted to expend the sum of $28,000.00 for a plot of land and \n     the construction of a new engine house.\n       A plot of land was purchased on Barnstable Road for the sum \n     of $3,000.00 and there has been erected thereon a model fire \n     proof engine house complete in all details and it is believed \n     it will serve the needs of the District for years to come.\n       There is ample room to store the engines, hook and ladder \n     truck, hose reels and other equipment. There is an apartment \n     for drying the hose after a fire. There is an assembly room \n     for the firemen. The building is heated with a modern Spencer \n     heater so there is no danger of the radiators freezing in the \n     cold weather. It is a building that any city might be content \n     with and I am recently told by the Chief Engineer that the \n     assembly will soon be furnished after which open house is to \n     be held to which the public including this worthy gathering \n     are to be invited to attend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3739-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE USE OF FOREIGN TRUSTS TO AVOID TAXES\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last evening the Senate adopted a \nproposal I introduced in September of last year to curb the use of \nforeign trusts to avoid U.S. tax responsibilities.\n  The Treasury Department first called attention to this problem early \nin 1995. Thereafter, I worked with Representative Gibbons to develop \nlegislation to prevent taxpayers from evading taxes by transferring \nassets offshore. Legislation very similar to the bill that I introduced \n(S. 1261) was included in the Senate-passed health insurance reform \nbill late yesterday.\n  There is disturbing evidence of the extent of tax avoidance through \nthe use of foreign trusts. Although taxpayers are required to report \nthe value of their assets held in foreign trusts, only $1.5 billion \nwere reported in 1993, according to the IRS. Yet it is estimated that \ntotal U.S. source funds held abroad in tax haven jurisdictions are in \nthe hundreds of billions.\n  In 1989, the New York Times reported that financial institutions in \nthe Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, and the Bahamas had $240, $200, and \n$180 billion, respectively, on deposit from the U.S. New York Times, \nOctober 29, 1989, page 10. More recently, Barron's estimated that a \ntotal of $440 billion was on deposit in the Cayman Islands in 1993, \nwith 60 percent of that amount--$264 billion--coming from the U.S. \nBarron's, January 4, 1993, page 14. To put this in some perspective, \nBarron's calculated that there was more American money on deposit in \nthe Cayman Islands than in all of the commercial banks in California. \nAlthough only a portion of U.S. funds abroad are held in foreign \ntrusts, the Treasury Department estimates that tens of billions of \ndollars are held in offshore asset protection trusts established by \nU.S. citizens and residents.\n  Once assets move offshore, it has been difficult for the IRS to \nenforce the tax laws. Foreign bank secrecy laws preclude the IRS from \nuncovering the information necessary to determine what is owed. Central \nto the legislative solution that I have proposed are provisions \ndesigned to provide the IRS with better information on foreign trusts. \nThe bill would substantially strengthen the obligations of taxpayers to \nreport information to the IRS and impose penalties with genuine \ndeterrent effect for failure to do so. Among other changes, the bill \nincludes new rules designed to lead most foreign trusts established by \nU.S. persons to appoint a U.S. agent that can provide trust information \nto the IRS.\n  The bill would also close a number of loopholes in the existing \ngrantor trust tax rules. These rules specify when the existence of a \ntrust will be ignored for tax purposes because the creator of the trust \nretains sufficient control over the assets transferred to be treated as \ncontinuing to own the assets. For example, a foreign person; generally \nnot taxable in the United States, transferring assets to a trust for \nthe benefit of U.S. persons generally would not be treated as the tax \nowner of the assets in the trust unless the trust was fully revocable. \nInstead, the U.S. beneficiary receiving income from the trust would be \ntaxed on receipt of that income.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has adopted these changes. These are \npractical rules that would dramatically improve tax compliance without \nunduly burdening legitimate financial transactions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3740-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3740-S3741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                LEBANON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am deeply distressed by the events \nof recent days in southern Lebanon. The deaths of innocent civilians is \na horrible human tragedy and our hearts go out to the families of those \nwho have been lost.

The Secretary will travel to the Middle East \ntomorrow. I am hopeful that he will be able to facilitate diplomatic \nefforts to reach a peaceful settlement and an end to the bloodshed and \nviolence.\n  I have joined with Senator Abraham and others in a letter to the \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the \nAgency for International Development calling for emergency humanitarian \nassistance for civilian refugees in Lebanon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3740-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROWAN COLLEGE\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure \nto congratulate New Jersey's very own Rowan College. As you may know, \nthe Profs of Rowan College recently defeated Hope College by a score of \n100 to 93 to become the 1995-96 NCAA Division III men's basketball \nchampions.\n  Rowan's basketball team is special in more ways than one. Having \nfinished the year with a 28-4 record, the Profs have once again risen \nto the challenges and competition of college basketball. This is hardly \nRowan's first trip to the Final Four. Under the tutelage of their \ncoach, Dr. John Giannini, the Profs have proven to be no flukes, as \nthey have reached the Final Four three years running.\n  This championship season also marks the end of Terrence Stewart's \nstellar career. Terrence leaves Rowan College as its all-time leading \nscorer. Having been named this year's tournament most valuable player, \nTerrence has much to be proud of. As I can attest to, though, a \nchampionship team consists of a group of players who are all dedicated \nto the game, the work ethic, and the goal of being the best. Indeed, \nthe entire team deserves praise and admiration.\n  Having played in a Final Four tournament myself, I know first hand \nhow much hard work, time, and energy these players have put into \nachieving this tremendous goal. For college athletes face not only the \npressures of the hardwood floor, but also the day-to-day pressures of \nperforming in the classroom.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to once again offer \ncongratulations to Rowan College. Success in the sports arena, like \nmany other endeavors, requires a great deal of dedication, hard work, \nand courage. I am very proud to have Rowan College represent our \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3741-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3741-S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AN ANNIVERSARY STATEMENT--THE TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION FOR PEOPLE WITH \n                              DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, Sunday, April 14, was a special anniversary \nfor me. It was on that date during World War II I was wounded and \njoined the ranks of America's disability community.\n  We are a large, diverse community, from all walks of life, of every \nrace and creed, and with the same hopes and dreams as other Americans.\n  Since joining the Senate, it has been my custom to remember this \nanniversary each year by speaking about an issue important to Americans \nwith disabilities.\n  So today I will discuss a revolution in technology for the disabled--\na quiet but extraordinary revolution that is bringing us closer to our \nnational goals of independence and full participation.\n\n\n                   New Technologies for the Disabled\n\n  Mr. President, today's technologies for the disabled are yesterday's \nscience fiction pipedreams.\n  For my friend Kyle Hulet in Hutchinson, KS, technology provides a new \nworld of independence. Kyle has only limited use of his hands, and has \nhad to depend on others for the simplest things--even turning the \nlights on in his room.\n  But with a new environmental control unit strapped to his wheelchair, \nwhich operates much like a TV remote control, Kyle can run 16 \nappliances, including lights, TV, and stereo.\n  Jenni Koebel of Topeka, who cannot speak and has limited use of her \nhands, taps out words on the keyboard of a communication device--that \nthen speaks with a voice synthesizer. Sure, the voice is a little \nmechanical, but Jenni's intelligence and charm shine through.\n  When Jenni visited me sometime back, she was a high school student. \nToday, she is enrolled in my alma mater, Washburn University. \nTechnology has helped make this possible.\n  Even the venerable wheelchair has gone high technology. For too long \nwheelchair users have been described as ``wheelchair bound'' or \n``confined to a wheelchair.'' This stereotype unfortunately contained \nsome truth--wheelchairs were heavy and awkward.\n  That is, until innovators like Marilyn Hamilton came along. Marilyn, \nwho became a wheelchair user following a hang-gliding accident in 1978, \nasked why chairs couldn't be light, compact, fast--and good looking.\n  And when no one could give her a good answer, she went out and built \na chair that was all these things. And then helped set up a company, \nQuickie Designs, to build those chairs for others.\n  And for the amputee, artificial legs made of new plastics can now \nmimic the spring and bounce of the natural footstep.\n  Perhaps the toughest test for these artificial limbs is sports. And \nthe toughest sports events for disabled athletes can be found at the \nParalympic games.\n  For example, in 1992, Tony Volpentest of Edmonds, WA, ran the 100-\nmeter dash in 11.63 seconds, just 1.83 seconds off Carl Lewis' Olympic \nrecord. Tony was born without hands or feet, and uses two high \ntechnology artificial legs.\n  The 1996 Paralympics will be held later this year in Atlanta, \nfollowing the Olympics. Over 120 countries will be represented--and \nwith talent like Tony's, we are talking real competition among world \nclass athletes.\n  In the future, we can expect even more astounding devices--such as \nsystems that will allow blind people to freely navigate city streets \nusing signals beamed from global positioning satellites overhead. And \nsophisticated voice recognition systems that will automatically closed \ncaption videophones of the future.\n  The bottom line here is simple. For people with every kind of \ndisability--whether sensory, cognitive, motor, or communication--\ntechnology can provide tools to speak, hear, see, learn, write, be \nmobile, work, and play--in short, to live as fully and independently as \npossible. Technology increasingly allows people with disabilities to \nmake the same choices about their lives--good and bad--that other \nAmericans often take for granted.\n\n\n                      The Information Superhighway\n\n  Mr. President, one can hardly open a newspaper or turn on the TV \nthese days without hearing about the Internet--the worldwide hookup of \nthousands of computers. For the price of a local phone call, an \nindividual can retrieve information from almost anywhere on the planet.\n  But for Holly Haines, the Internet is about a job. Holly lives in \nrural Pennsylvania. The nearest traffic light is 8 miles away--a lot \nlike western Kansas where I grew up. Because of muscular dystrophy, \nHolly rarely leaves home.\n\n  Several years ago Holly called my office, asking for some help in \ngetting access to the Internet through a local university. She had a \njob offer at a national database company, but to call the company's \ncomputer directly every day would have meant huge, unaffordable long-\ndistance phone bills.\n  Well, Holly got on the Internet and went to work. And about a year \nago the Microsoft Network called to offer her a job as supervisor of \nChat World.\n  Every day hundreds of network subscribers talk on-line in the virtual \ntown square of Chat World. Life in the virtual world can get pretty \nwild, and Holly is Chat World's mayor and Miss Manners rolled into one. \nShe oversees a staff of 75 people.\n  By the way, Microsoft never had a clue that Holly was disabled when \nthey hired her. And here's the important lesson. For Holly, and for \nmillions of Americans with disabilities, the Internet is both a great \nequalizer and a great opportunity.\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\n                  Fulfilling the Promise of Technology\n\n  Mr. President, the news is not all good. Thousands of Americans with \ndisabilities cannot afford these technologies, some of which cost \nthousands of dollars. In my home State of Kansas, the legislature has \nrecognized this problem and recently authorized an annual appropriation \nof $100,000 to help pay for technology.\n  And in the Balanced Budget Act, I sponsored a provision with Senator \nConrad to allow Medicare beneficiaries to use their own funds to pay \nfor more sophisticated technologies, by supplementing Medicare's \npayment for a standard item.\n  But we need to do much, much more.\n  The second big issue is that we must be careful that new \ntechnologies--whether personal computers, the Internet, or whatever--\nare designed to be accessible to the disabled from the start. We have \nlearned the hard way how expensive it can be to retrofit buildings and \nstreets. We do not need to learn that lesson twice.\n  In this regard, the new Telecommunications Act has several provisions \ndesigned to encourage companies that manufacture telecommunications \nequipment or provide services to make their products accessible to the \ndisabled. Another provision in the act also provides for more closed \ncaptioning of TV and video programs.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to say a few words about the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. ADA was passed 6 years ago. Some \npeople claim that I have backed off my support for ADA. That is simply \nnot true. But I believe, and have always believed, that ADA can work, \nmust work, for everyone--people with disabilities, Government, and \nbusiness. I am trying hard to see that happens.\n  The poet Archibald MacLeish once wrote, ``America was always \npromises.'' The technology revolution, together with important laws \nlike ADA, are helping people with disabilities realize America's \npromises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3741-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1028\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, this week marks the final withdrawal of \nUnited States Armed Forces from Haiti. It is an appropriate time to \nask, ``What did our second intervention of the century in Haiti \nachieve?'' Congress and the American people were deeply divided over \nthe wisdom of Operation Uphold Democracy. Many of us were concerned \nthat the American intervention to restore President Aristide would not \nlead to lasting and durable change in Haiti.\n  Unfortunately, it is now clear that U.S. policy has not achieved its \nstated goals of establishing a rule of law, fostering genuine \ndemocratic change, and creating sustainable economic development. A \nbicameral staff delegation visited Haiti over the April recess and has \ncompleted a report which details serious failures of American policy--\nfailures in each of the three critical areas of politics, security, and \nthe economy.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n  The report concludes that the Clinton administration and the United \nStates Embassy have not taken human rights seriously in Haiti. A \nparticularly disturbing incident involves the event leading up to the \nassassination of Mrs. Bertin on March 28, 1995--3 days before President \nClinton visited Haiti. The U.S. Government had concrete information \nabout a plot to kill Mrs. Bertin which implicated Aristide government \nofficials, including the Minister of Interior. Inexplicably, no one in \nthe U.S. Government warned Bertin of the plot. Instead, U.S. officials \ndecided to rely on the same government planning Bertin's murder to \nprovide her with warning of the plot. This incident deserves, as the \nreport recommends, full investigation by the executive branch and by \nthe Congress to examine why U.S. officials neglected to act effectively \non information that they possessed.\n\n\n                     No Progress on Dole Amendment\n\n  The report details lack of progress in meeting the conditions of the \nso-called Dole amendment on investigating political murders. The report \nalso details the lack of action by the U.S. Embassy in examining and \nreporting on a wide range of human rights and police issues. The \ncompromise of police investigations by Aristide loyalists was not \nreported. Basic information about murders involving the U.S.-trained \npolice forces was not even gathered. It seems clear that the attitude \nof the United States Government was they did not want to know about \ngovernment death squads which would prove embarrassing to the claim of \nHaiti as a foreign policy success.\n\n\n                  administration's conflicting stories\n\n  The report also details the sustained campaign by the administration, \nchiefly the Agency for International Development [AID], to blame \nCongress by providing intentionally misleading information about U.S. \nassistance programs. The Clinton administration cannot even get its own \nstory straight. For example, while AID criticizes Congress for delaying \naid to the Haitian police because of human rights concerns, the State \nDepartment takes credit for suspending aid to the Haitian police for \nthe same human rights concerns. And while AID was holding up health \nprograms because of their concerns about the competence of the Haitian \nMinister of Health, AID officials in Washington, regularly criticized \nCongress for holding up health projects in Haiti.\n\n\n                       a foreign policy success?\n\n  There has been much in the media about the success of President \nClinton's Haiti policy. There has been little about the fundamental \nflaws detailed in this report. It is clear, however, that the \nadministration knows it is on thin ice: changes in their Haiti policy \nhave already been announced in recent days. Earlier this year, \ncongressional pressure led to the dismissal of some of the worst human \nrights violators in the Haitian security forces. This week, the \nadministration announced it was suspending aid because the Dole \namendment conditions could not be met. The administration is reportedly \nconsidering reopening a fund for the victims of human rights \nviolations. Most notably, the administration now points to the \nimportance of thwarting former President Artiside's effort to undermine \nimportant policy goals. Long the defender of Aristide, even the Clinton \nadministration now admits he refused to allow progress on police reform \nor free market economics. What a difference congressional pressure can \nmake.\n\n\n                   playing politics with haiti policy\n\n  Mr. President, there is no difference between congressional \nRepublicans and the stated goals of the Clinton administration in \nHaiti--democracy, economic recovery, and the rule of law. Our \ndifferences are about the very real problems which have been swept \nunder the rug--in the name of defending policy failures. Our \ndifferences are over the administration's effort's effort to make Haiti \na political football by blaming Congress for their own shortcomings.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. military did its job. There is no security \nthreat to the government of Haiti. The dictatorship is destroyed and \nthe Haitian army no longer exists. It is on the civilian side where our \npolicy has fallen short.\n  What have we achieved in our Haiti intervention after 18 months and \nmore than $2 billion? The answer is disappointment and missed \nopportunities. The answer is not nearly as much as could have been \nachieved if the administration had been more honest and more able. For \nthe sake of the long-suffering people of Haiti, I hope the \nadministration will jettison its political approach, and begin working \nwith Congress to fashion a workable Haiti policy. I hope they begin \nsoon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: Pursuant to your authorization, we \n     traveled to Haiti from March 30, 1996, to April 3, 1996, to \n     examine political, economic, security and assistance issues. \n     We met with a wide range of U.S., Haitian, and international \n     officials and visited a number of sites including the Haitian \n     National Police Training Center, U.S. Agency for \n     International Development projects, and U.S. Armed Forces \n     headquarters.\n       As the final withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces is underway, \n     we believe our findings\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\n     and recommendations are particularly timely. Still, if the \n     United States is ever to achieve a truly bipartisan policy \n     toward Haiti, the Clinton Administration must cease its \n     efforts to blame Congress for the shortcomings of its own \n     policy. Our seven principal findings are:\n       More than eighteen months after Operation Uphold Democracy \n     began, Haiti's social, political and economic situation \n     remains troubled and tenuous. The U.S. intervention \n     successfully destroyed the military dictatorship, and \n     significantly reduced human rights violations, at a cost of \n     more than $2 billion. However, the U.S. intervention in Haiti \n     has not yet laid the foundation for lasting progress in \n     establishing genuine democracy, in generating economic reform \n     and sustainable development, or fostering respect for the \n     rule of law.\n       The conditions set forth in section 583 of Public Law 104-\n     107 (the ``Dole Amendment'') on conducting thorough \n     investigations and cooperating with the United States on \n     investigations of extrajudicial and political killings have \n     not been met and will not be met in the foreseeable future.\n       The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince has failed to devote \n     sufficient attention or resources to the critical issues of \n     extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses perpetrated by \n     officials of the Haitian government.\n       The work of the SIU has been severely compromised by the \n     presence of three American attorneys and one American \n     ``investigator'' closely identified with many who have \n     publicly and regularly questioned the overwhelming evidence \n     of Haitian government involvement in extrajudicial killings. \n     These individuals are paid by the government of Haiti on \n     terms they refused to disclose to the staff delegation, and \n     have had total access to all SIU investigative files. Prior \n     to the arrival of two American contractors hired by the \n     Department of State to work with the SIU, all SIU \n     investigations were supervised and controlled by these \n     attorneys.\n       The Clinton Administration has conducted a sustained and \n     coordinated inter-agency effort designed to blame the \n     legislative branch for the shortcomings of its own policies \n     in Haiti. By repeatedly seeking to politicize Haiti policy, \n     the Clinton Administration has done a disservice to the \n     appropriate role of Congress and, more importantly, to the \n     Haitian people. They have also, as a result of systematic \n     obfuscation, kept their own program managers in the dark \n     about these matters, risking the effectiveness of important \n     programs.\n       In a striking and profound reversal, U.S. and international \n     officials in Haiti now argue that the Preval government \n     deserves U.S. support in order to prevent former President \n     Aristide from thwarting important policy objectives, \n     especially on economic and judicial reform. The staff \n     delegation consistently heard numerous officials cite policy \n     initiatives--moribund under the Aristide government--which \n     could actually proceed under the Preval government if U.S. \n     and international support was provided. Such criticisms of \n     the Aristide regime, voiced now in retrospect, were not \n     voiced when they could have made a difference.\n       The Haitian economy remains highly dependent on foreign \n     assistance, including food aid, and remittances from Haitians \n     living abroad; at least 65 percent of the 1995 budget was \n     provided by international assistance. Despite attempts to \n     promote private investment, adverse internal political \n     developments have reinforced foreign and Haitian investor \n     concerns about the political and security outlook in Haiti. \n     The 1985 level of private investment in Haiti--a very low \n     baseline--is not likely to be restored in this century.\n       We have attached our full report with appendices. Finally, \n     we wish to express our appreciation for the efforts of U.S. \n     Ambassador to Haiti, William Lacy Swing, and his staff for \n     facilitating our visit. Despite our differences over elements \n     of U.S. policy in Haiti, Ambassador Swing, our control \n     officer Julie Winn, and the Embassy staff provided invaluable \n     support for our visit.\n           Sincerely,\n     Randy Scheunemann,\n     Charles Flickner,\n     Christopher Walker,\n     Louis H. Dupart,\n     Roger Noriega.\n\n           Report of Congressional Staff Delegation to Haiti\n\n       From March 30, 1996 to April 3, 1996, a delegation of \n     Congressional staff members traveled to Haiti to assess \n     political, economic and human rights issues, and to examine \n     U.S. assistance programs. Our staff delegation was assisted \n     by Karen Harbert, a former AID and International Republican \n     Institute official who traveled to Haiti at her own expense.\n       Our delegation included:\n       Randy Scheunemann, Adviser on National Security, Majority \n     Leader, United States Senate;\n       Louis Dupart, Chief Counsel, Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, United States House of Representatives;\n       Charles Flickner, Staff Director, Subcommittee on Foreign \n     Operations, Committee on Appropriations, United States House \n     of Representatives;\n       Roger Noriega, Professional Staff Member, Committee on \n     International Relations, United States House of \n     Representatives;\n       Christopher Walker, Senior Professional Staff Member, \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate.\n\n\n                                FINDINGS\n\n       More than 18 months after Operation Uphold Democracy began, \n     Haiti's social, political and economic situation remains \n     troubled and tenuous. The U.S. intervention successfully \n     destroyed the military dictatorship, and significantly \n     reduced human rights violations, at a cost of more than $2 \n     billion. However, the U.S. intervention in Haiti has not yet \n     laid the foundation for lasting progress in establishing \n     genuine democracy, in generating economic reform and \n     sustainable development, or fostering respect for the rule of \n     law.\n\n\n                              RULE OF LAW\n\n                Human rights and extrajudicial killings\n\n       The conditions set forth in section 583 of Public Law 104-\n     107 (the ``Dole Amendment'') on conducting thorough \n     investigations and cooperating with the United States on \n     investigations of extrajudicial and political killings have \n     not been met and will not be met in the foreseeable future.\n       The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince has failed to devote \n     sufficient attention or resources to the critical issues of \n     extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses perpetrated by \n     officials of the Haitian government.\n       Despite general statements about the importance of human \n     rights and the rule of law in Haiti by senior U.S. \n     policymakers, no unequivocal or specific statement on more \n     than 25 extrajudicial killings or the emergence of \n     government-sponsored death squads in Haiti has been made. \n     Serious inattention in Washington to systematic human rights \n     violations contributed to the Embassy's uneven and incomplete \n     attention to the critical issues of human rights and the rule \n     of law. Moreover, there is no commitment to incarceration and \n     prosecution of anyone involved in political murders.\n       Examples of the Embassy's failure to gather, act on, or \n     report on information concerning extrajudicial killings and \n     human rights abuses includes the following examples:\n       One week prior to the assassination of Mireille Durocher \n     Bertin, the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Armed Forces in Haiti \n     received concrete information concerning a plot to murder her \n     which implicated senior Haitian government officials, \n     including the Minister of Interior. For reasons which remain \n     unclear, no American official ever directly warned Bertin or \n     her family of the assassination plot. The decision not to \n     provide a direct warning based on information in the \n     possession of the United States Government had grave and \n     quite possibly fatal consequences. Apparently, the final \n     decision was made--and not challenged by the U.S. Embassy--by \n     the U.S. Military Commander in Haiti, Major General George \n     Fisher.\n       Until facilitating a meeting requested by the staff \n     delegation, the American Embassy had no contact with the \n     family of slain lawyer Mireille Durocher Bertin more than one \n     year after her murder--despite the dispatch of some 20 U.S. \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agents to investigate \n     the murder. The family provided the staff delegation with new \n     and useful information about the killing.\n       Until facilitating a meeting requested by the staff \n     delegation, the U.S. Embassy had made no contact with the \n     relatives of the March 6, 1996, Cite Soleil massacre in which \n     eight people were killed and 11 were wounded.\n       The November 7, 1995, shooting in which parliamentarian \n     Jean Hubert Feuille was killed and his colleague Gabriel \n     Fortune was injured has not been investigated adequately. \n     This attack had many similar characteristics to other \n     extrajudicial killings. Fortune publicly claimed that the \n     killers were sent by the ``Palace'' because of Fortune's \n     anti-corruption campaign in the Parliament. The Embassy \n     has made no apparent independent effort to follow-up on \n     Fortune's explosive allegations or determine the status of \n     the material evidence and investigation.\n       The Embassy has made no effort to determine basic facts \n     surrounding the May 22, 1995, murder of Michel J. Gonzalez, a \n     neighbor of President Aristide's who was shot and killed near \n     his home by four gunmen riding two motorcycles; the attack \n     was witnessed by Gonzalez' daughter, a U.S. citizen. In a \n     meeting with members of the delegation, sources close to the \n     Gonzalez family confirmed persistent rumors that Gonzalez had \n     been pressed repeatedly to move from his rented home so that \n     President Aristide could acquire the property. Despite these \n     widespread rumors, which might suggest a motive in the \n     attack, neither the Embassy nor MICIVIH has made any effort \n     to determine whether the Gonzalez property (where the house \n     has reportedly been demolished) has been incorporated into \n     Aristide's growing 17-hectare compound.\n       Duly Brutus, a member of the democratic PANPRA party, was \n     arrested briefly in July 1995 and his home was attacked by a \n     300-person mob in October, less than a week after his \n     testimony before the House International Relations \n     Committee's Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. Brutus \n     became aware of threats on his life in November 1995. He was \n     advised by the U.S. military in Haiti to contact the U.S. \n     Embassy with regard to the threat. The Embassy was totally \n     unresponsive to his urgent pleas for help. Because the \n     threats persisted and no one at the Embassy would help, \n     Brutus called the Department of Defense in Washington to \n     request there assistance. DoD interceded on his behalf to \n     ensure that he received safe escort to the airport in Port-\n     au-Prince an onto a airplane\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\n     bound for the U.S. In a bizarre turn of events, the Embassy \n     vocally protested DoD's help, which ironically probably saved \n     Mr. Brutus's life. Mr. Brutus has now sought temporary refuge \n     in the United States.\n       Just before the delegation's arrival in Haiti, Mr. Brutus' \n     wife heard a disturbance during the night at her home in Port \n     au Prince, after which she found five bullets wrapped in \n     stationery of the Ministry of the Interior. An Embassy \n     political officer called Mrs. Brutus after hearing of the \n     incident but took no further action after being assured by \n     Mrs. Brutus that the HNP authorities appeared to be \n     responding adequately to the incident.\n       Carl Denis and four other persons associated with the \n     ``Political Organization for Democracy in Haiti'' (founded by \n     Mireille Durocher Bertin shortly before her murder) were \n     arrested on August 18, 1995, a day after a four-person \n     demonstration in Port au Prince. They have since languished \n     in the Haitian National Penitentiary without being charged \n     with any crime, reportedly in violation of Haitian criminal \n     procedure. Mr. Denis told members of the delegation that the \n     lone U.S. Embassy visit was by a ``staff sergeant''; Mr. \n     Denis' arrest was reported in the State Department's 1995 \n     human rights report on Haiti. In early March, Mr. Denis was \n     visited by a representative of the Minister of Justice, who \n     told him that there was no merit to the case; he and his \n     companions remain in prison today.\n       The Embassy terminated its human rights victims fund \n     shortly after the U.S. intervention. The fund provided more \n     than $219,000 for more than 1,700 victims of human rights \n     abuses and their relatives during the de facto regime's rule. \n     Terminating the fund after the installation of President \n     Aristide sent a clear signal that victims of human rights \n     abuses under the Aristide and Preval governments are of less \n     importance to the U.S. government that victims of abuses \n     under the de facto regime.\n       The U.S. Embassy's Political Section is now fully staffed--\n     which was not the case when one member of the delegation \n     traveled to Haiti in August 1996. The section includes three \n     officers covering political-military issues on a full time \n     basis and one full-time human rights officer. Given the \n     adequate staffing, the Embassy's apparently complete reliance \n     on non-U.S. sources (such as foreigners serving with the \n     United Nations) for reporting on high-profile cases \n     ostensibly important to Washington is perplexing and \n     disturbing.\n       In light of Washington's silence and the Embassy's \n     inaction, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that U.S. \n     officials did not attempt to develop independent information \n     on extrajudicial killings because U.S. policymakers did not \n     want to know the truth.\n       U.S. government lack of interest and attention to \n     extrajudicial killings--until forced by Congressional \n     pressure to act--sent a signal to successive Haitian \n     governments that the U.S. would tolerate these actions.\n       The ``Presidential Commission on Truth and Justice,'' which \n     was established after President Aristide's return, to \n     investigate human rights violations that took place during \n     his exile, presented its report to Aristide on February 5, \n     1996. Although the Commission's findings have not been made \n     public, its recommendations reportedly include compensating \n     victims and establishing an international tribunal with \n     foreign assistance to adjudicate some of the ``5,000 cases'' \n     covered in the Commission's report. The Commission relied on \n     support from the Canadian government and the UN Development \n     Program since USAID failed to deliver on its promise to \n     provide the Commission $50,000 for vehicles, computers, and \n     office equipment.\n\n                           Police dismissals\n\n       Eight individuals in the police and security apparatus of \n     the Aristide regime have been implicated in extrajudicial \n     murders by credible evidence. After pressure from Congress, \n     including passage of the ``Dole Amendment'' and objection to \n     obligation of police assistance by House International \n     Relations Committee Chairman Gilman, the Preval government \n     agreed these individuals would not serve in any police and \n     security force.\n       Congressional Republicans had long raised concerns about \n     these individuals even before Operation Uphold Democracy \n     began. President Aristide consistently refused to take any \n     action against these individuals, and many of them remained \n     in Aristide's inner circle until the end of his rule. Many of \n     them remain close to Aristide today. President Preval \n     deserves credit for doing what his predecessor would not: \n     acting against the most egregious violators of human rights \n     in the Haitian security forces.\n\n                        Haitian National Police\n\n       Creation of a 5,000 person Haitian National Police (HNP) \n     has been a massive undertaking costing the U.S. taxpayers \n     more than $45 million to date. Despite the assistance \n     provided by the Department of Justice's International \n     Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), \n     the HNP continues to be plagued by the absence of qualified \n     leadership, lack of equipment, and lack of clear political \n     support at the highest levels of the Haitian government.\n       The March 6, 1996 killings in Cite Soleil will be a \n     critical watershed for the Haitian National Police. Reliable \n     reports--including eyewitnesses interviewed by the staff \n     delegation--implicate members of the HNP in the murders. \n     Beyond the alleged direct involvement of HNP officers in the \n     crimes, senior HNP officials must bear responsibility for the \n     loss of control of the situation. The new HNP Inspector \n     General--dismissed under the Aristide regime for actually \n     trying to investigate a political murder--has begun to \n     investigate the Cite Soleil incident.\n       In addition to Cite Soleil, HNP officers have been involved \n     in a number of shootings, beatings and other human rights \n     abuses. In addition, at least one officer has been murdered \n     in circumstances which remain unclear.\n       Although the HNP has developed its manuel de directives, a \n     code of regulations and operating procedures, most HNP \n     officers are not familiar with it, making disciplinary action \n     against HNP officers for violations of law or human rights \n     infrequent. Staff were informed by MICIVIH officials in \n     Goniaves that a local HNP commissaire was known to have \n     committed at least two abuses, including severely beating a \n     civilian, but was merely demoted to the rank of officer.\n       The delegation learned from U.N. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) \n     trainers that HNP officers recently destroyed two new U.N. \n     vehicles during routine patrols in Gonaives and that the \n     drivers of the vehicles possessed no driver's licenses nor \n     had been taught how to drive. CIVPOL field personnel estimate \n     that 98 percent of all HNP officers do not know how to drive. \n     According to the U.S. State Department, 300 of the 500 \n     vehicles provided to the HNP have been wrecked.\n       In addition to the Haitian National Police, numerous other \n     armed governmental security forces exist in Haiti, including \n     the National Intelligence Service (SIN), the Ministerial \n     Guards, the National Palace and Residential Security Unit \n     (NPRSU) and the Presidential Security Unit. Particularly in \n     the cases of the SIN, the NPRSU and the Ministerial Guards, \n     it is unclear who in the Government of Haiti controls their \n     activities. There are widespread and credible reports of \n     serious human rights abuses by these security forces.\n\n                    Special Investigative Unit (SIU)\n\n       The much-trumpeted Special Investigative Unit (SIU) of the \n     Haitian National Police is woefully ill-prepared to undertake \n     the criminal investigations with which it has been charged.\n       SIU investigators have no more than one week of specialized \n     training in skills necessary to conduct criminal \n     investigations.\n       The SIU is only at 25 percent of the strength proposed by \n     the U.S., and has yet to receive any of the 100 percent \n     increase in investigators promised by the Haitian government. \n     The SIU currently consists of only 10 officers, charged with \n     more than 80 cases.\n       SIU investigators do not have access to vehicles, \n     communications equipment, office supplies, and basic \n     investigative equipment. The SIU received office space large \n     enough and secure enough to accommodate its needs.\n       The work of the SIU has been severely compromised by the \n     presence of three American attorneys and one American \n     ``investigator'' closely identified with many who have \n     publicly and regularly questioned the overwhelming evidence \n     of Haitian government involvement in extrajudicial killings. \n     These individuals are paid by the government of Haiti on \n     terms they refused to disclose to the staff delegation, and \n     have had total access to all SIU investigative files. Prior \n     to the arrival of two American contractors hired by the \n     Department of State to work with the SIU, all SIU \n     investigations were supervised and controlled by these \n     lawyers.\n       U.S. Embassy officials did not comprehend or report on the \n     significance of critical issues relating to extrajudicial \n     killings, including crucial developments at the Special \n     Investigative Unit (SIU) of the Haitian National Police. The \n     Embassy official responsible for police issues visited the \n     SIU less than once a month since its creation in October, \n     1995.\n       Even if the American lawyers and ``investigator'' who have \n     tainted SIU actions to date are physically removed and \n     receive no further access to SIU investigators and \n     information, severe damage has already compromised the \n     activities of the SIU on the most important cases. One lawyer \n     was present for the December, 1995 FBI briefing of Haitian \n     government officials on the Bertin case, and all SIU files \n     have already been available for their unlimited perusal.\n       It is unclear why the vast majority of the SIU's caseload \n     involves crimes from the de facto years. These cases were the \n     subject of the Truth Commission report, and these crimes were \n     an important factor leading to U.S. intervention. It is also \n     unclear why, in light of the decision to include cases prior \n     to September 1994, cases from the first seven months of \n     President Aristide's rule were excluded.\n\n                               Narcotics\n\n       For years, endemic corruption and unpatrolled borders, \n     water, and ports have made Haiti a prime target for the \n     smuggling of illicit drugs. After months of inaction under \n     Aristide, the new Haitian government has named a chief of its \n     anti-narcotics unit. The police chief has promised but not \n     yet delivered adequate nationwide staffing or resources. \n     Members of the inexperienced police force will require basic \n     investigative and anti-drug training. A full time DEA office \n     and a State Department Narcotics Assistance Section resident \n     in Miami is moving to implement training and cooperation \n     plans.\n\n                            Judicial reform\n\n       Haiti's judicial system is almost completely dysfunctional. \n     Despite more than $3\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\n     million in AID assistance already obligated (AID has \n     programed $18 million through FY 1999), even the most basic \n     training and equipment needs remain unmet. While AID claims \n     that 400 judges and prosecutors have benefited from short-\n     term training seminars, AID has ``detected a steady pattern \n     of judges selected by the Ministry for training only to be \n     fired shortly after--or even during--the two week course.'' \n     Even if HNP investigations bring prosecutions against those \n     responsible for the politically motivated murders, it is \n     unlikely that the judicial system can swiftly, much less \n     impartially, act on these cases.\n\n\n         CLINTON ADMINISTRATION POLITICIZATION OF HAITI POLICY\n\n       The Clinton Administration has conducted a sustained and \n     coordinated inter-agency effort designed to blame the \n     legislative branch for the shortcomings of its own policies \n     in Haiti. By repeatedly seeking to politicize Haiti policy, \n     the Clinton Administration has done a disservice to the \n     appropriate role of Congress and, more importantly, to the \n     Haitian people. It has also, as a result of systematic \n     obfuscation, kept its own program managers in the dark about \n     these matters, risking the effectiveness of important \n     programs.\n       The staff delegation heard numerous examples of incomplete, \n     inaccurate, and intentionally misleading information about \n     the role of Congress provided by Clinton Administration \n     officials in Washington to staff, the AID mission, government \n     of Haiti officials and the Haitian business community.\n       The Embassy and senior Administration officials have \n     repeatedly stated that they welcome Congressional pressure \n     because it leverages their pressure on the Haitian \n     government. Unfortunately, the staff delegation found an \n     absence of pressure by the Administration unless there was \n     Congressional interest.\n       While senior AID officials assert that Congress is \n     responsible for delays in providing police training programs \n     in Haiti, State Department officials take credit for \n     suspending police training assistance because of the presence \n     of alleged criminals in senior police positions. ICITAP \n     officials in Haiti were not informed of key policy decisions \n     impacting police training programs nor the basis for such \n     decisions.\n       Senior Administration officials in Washington also \n     criticize Congress for failing to make available funding for \n     certain AID projects in Haiti, yet they conceal the complete \n     picture of serious problems with U.S. assistance programs in \n     Haiti.\n       While criticizing Congressional concerns about $4.2 million \n     in development assistance programs alleged to be \n     ``humanitarian'', AID itself has delayed obligation of more \n     than $5.5 million for similar programs because of serious \n     concerns about the competence of the Haitian cabinet minister \n     responsible for administering these funds.\n       AID, not Congress, has withheld since 1995 a $4.6 million \n     cash transfer to the Haitian treasury because of that \n     government's failure to meet mutually-agreed upon \n     privatization goals.\n       AID officials have criticized a congressional hold on an \n     environmental project known as ``Agricultural Sustainable \n     Systems and Environmental Transformations'' (ASSET). Yet at a \n     bipartisan congressional staff briefing in February, 1996, \n     AID officials stated that they intended to withdraw the \n     project altogether because, according to internal AID \n     documents, the project ``has been stymied'' by the Haitian \n     Ministry of Environment. Other AID electronic mail messages \n     reveal that AID did not withdraw the project because AID's \n     Assistant Administrator of Latin America and the Caribbean \n     sought political advantage in blaming Congress for holding up \n     the project.\n       In Washington, the Administrator of AID blames Congress for \n     withholding humanitarian aid, but in Haiti, AID internal \n     documents state that ``the $50 million Health Systems 2004 \n     Project ``is languishing'' because of problems with the \n     Haitian Minister of Health.\n       The impact of the ``Dole Amendment'' has been consistently \n     misrepresented by officials in Washington and within the U.S. \n     Embassy in Haiti. Despite the clear exemptions for \n     humanitarian and electoral assistance, numerous Haitian and \n     U.S. officials have been informed--incorrectly--that the \n     ``Dole Amendment'' is responsible for delays in such \n     programs.\n\n\n                  DEMOCRATIZATION AND POLITICAL ISSUES\n\n                    Haiti's political power struggle\n\n       In a striking and profound reversal, U.S. and international \n     officials in Haiti now argue that the Preval government \n     deserves U.S. support in order to prevent former President \n     Aristide from thwarting important policy objectives, \n     especially on economic and judicial reform. The staff \n     delegation consistently heard numerous officials cite policy \n     initiatives--moribund under the Aristide government--which \n     could actually proceed under the Preval government if U.S. \n     and international support were provided. Such criticisms of \n     the Aristide regime, voiced now in retrospect, were not \n     voiced when they could have made a difference.\n       Although Lavalas formally controls the executive, \n     legislative and judicial branches of government, a three way \n     struggle for political power is thought to be underway in \n     Haiti: President Preval has the government, Gerard Pierre \n     Charles has the Lavalas political organization, and former \n     President Aristide has the popular support. Unfortunately, \n     while President Preval's stated objectives most closely match \n     U.S. policy goals, he is the weakest of the three contenders.\n\n                         Presidential elections\n\n       Presidential elections were held on December 17, 1995. \n     Aristide's hand-picked successor, Rene Preval, won 80 percent \n     of the vote with only 25 percent of eligible voters casting \n     ballots. Preval campaigned as Aristide's ``twin,'' touting \n     ``Five More Years of Lavalas.'' Although these elections were \n     run more efficiently than the controversial June 25 \n     parliamentary balloting, a level playing field did not exist. \n     Aristide's Lavalas movement dominated the Provisional \n     Electoral Council (CEP) on national and regional levels. \n     Lavalas partisans routinely harassed opposition figures, \n     driving some center-to-right leaders out of the country \n     altogether. The presidential filing deadline coincided with \n     widespread political riots, incited by President Aristide's \n     November 11, 1995 eulogy for slain parliamentarian Jean \n     Hubert Feuille.\n       Opposition parties, whose many valid complaints about the \n     parliamentary elections were unheeded, boycotted the \n     elections altogether. What remained of the ``independent \n     media'' (where radio is most important) practiced ``self-\n     censorship,'' avoiding stories that might offend Lavalas \n     partisans. And, international observers (including the United \n     States government, the OAS, and the UN), in a rush to \n     vindicate their mission, rubber-stamped the parliamentary and \n     presidential results.\n\n                           The 1995 elections\n\n       Haiti's series of elections in 1995 were deeply flawed and \n     did little to advance genuine democracy in Haiti. The \n     egregious flaws before, during and after the June, August, \n     September and November elections cast a serious and lingering \n     cloud over the limited progress toward democratic pluralism \n     in Haiti.\n       The democratic opposition in Haiti is demoralized and \n     fragmented. U.S. credibility with the democratic opposition \n     never recovered from two serious blows: refusal to \n     acknowledge systematic problems before the June 25 elections; \n     and the rapid U.S. stamp of approval issued the day of the \n     elections before the polls closed by the head of the official \n     U.S. observer delegation, AID Administrator J. Brian Atwood. \n     Overwhelming evidence of insecure ballots, candidate \n     exclusion and a host of other problems has been detailed \n     comprehensively by the International Republican Institute and \n     the Carter Center. AID documents published recently have \n     dropped the word ``fair'' from its descriptions of the 1995 \n     electoral process.\n       A U.S. government-brokered accord between the democratic \n     opposition and Aristide government after the June 25 \n     elections were belated, and ultimately ineffective. The most \n     significant potential breakthrough in these negotiations was \n     halted by President Aristide's own intransigence.\n       There still has not been a full and satisfactory accounting \n     of all U.S. election support assistance in 1995 (in excess of \n     $12 million). Because of this failure, AID has no funds \n     programmed for the 1996 Territorial Assembly and Senate \n     elections and refuses to provide any election support until \n     the United Nations and the Haitian Provisional Electoral \n     Council (CEP) undertake and release a complete accounting of \n     all USAID funds in the Haitian Election Trust Fund.\n\n                           Haitian Parliament\n\n       The Lavalas-dominated bicameral parliament has demonstrated \n     unusual independence from the executive branch by rejecting \n     Aristide's choice for police chief, negotiating prime \n     minister and cabinet candidates, and scrutinizing Preval's \n     budget request. Preval is moving slowly to educate and inform \n     a skeptical, populist Parliament that will be called upon, \n     within a few months, to consider budget cuts, civil service \n     reform, privatization of state enterprises, among others. \n     Many parliamentarians have no government experience, and the \n     institution has no research staff or facilities to carry out \n     basic analytical or deliberative functions. For these \n     reasons, despite the guarded optimism about the Preval \n     government's commitment to economic reform, the parliament \n     may prove to be a battleground--and a bottleneck.\n\n\n                         INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE\n\n       O.A.S./U.N. civilian monitoring mission in Haiti (MICIVIH)\n\n       A case has been made for a continued international presence \n     in Haiti after the expiration of the UNMIH II and MICIVIH \n     mandates, but it is by no means certain that extension of \n     either of these operations under their current mandate is the \n     best form for such a presence to take.\n       MICIVIH's current mandate expires on May 31 and an internal \n     U.N. Security Council dispute may preclude extension. In its \n     current scaled-down form, MICIVIH has 64 observers in Haiti \n     (each paid $5-6000 monthly) down from a peak of 170, and has \n     7 offices down from a peak of 12. MICIVIH currently spends \n     almost $600,000 monthly.\n       MICIVIH has adopted a passive role in observing human \n     rights conditions in Haiti, with the mission's director \n     describing conditions today as ``relatively quiet.'' MICIVIH \n     has identified more than 20 murders in the past year as \n     ``commando-style executions'', the victims of which include \n     political opposition leaders and business persons. U.S. \n     officials acknowledge publicly that several of these killings \n     are linked and that Haitian\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\n     government officials appear to have been involved in the \n     murders and the subsequent cover-up. MICIVIH, which played an \n     activist role when the de facto regime held power, has made \n     little effort to press the Haitian government for \n     investigation or prosecution of these killings.\n\n\n                         U.S. Military Presence\n\n       All U.S. military forces associated with UNMIH operation \n     are scheduled to leave Haiti by April 23. The U.S. bilateral \n     military engineering, medical, and civil affairs exercise \n     ``Fairwinds'', consisting of active duty and reserve forces, \n     will continue through 1997.\n       The U.S. military continues to provide important \n     engineering and civil works support in Haiti. Despite the \n     persistent refusal of the government of Haiti to respond to \n     requests about priority projects, the U.S. military has \n     undertaken a series of successful civil works efforts to \n     rehabilitate roads, sewers, schools and health clinics.\n       The Administration recently decided to keep two Chinook \n     heavy-lift helicopters and 40 personnel in Haiti to support \n     the Canadian contingent of UNMIH through May 10. After that, \n     a U.S. contractor will operate helicopters in support of \n     UNMIH forces. On April 10, 1996, the State Department \n     notified Congress of its intent to finance the air support \n     (at least $1.2 million during the next six months) from its \n     voluntary peacekeeping account.\n\n\n                        ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n                            Haitian Economy\n\n       The Haitian economy remains highly dependent on foreign \n     assistance, including food aid, and remittances from Haitians \n     living abroad; at least 65 percent of the 1995 budget was \n     provided by international assistance. Despite attempts to \n     promote private investment, adverse internal political \n     developments have reinforced foreign and Haitian investor \n     concerns about the political and security outlook in Haiti. \n     The 1985 level of private investment in Haiti--a very low \n     baseline --is not likely to be restored in this century.\n       A major problem for Haitians seeking to break their \n     nation's cycle of misgovernance and poverty is the simple \n     fact that revenues (at about 3 percent of GDP) do not come \n     close to the admittedly inadequate level of government \n     spending (about 7 percent of GDP). Ambitious U.S. Embassy and \n     AID attempts to ``irreversibly and fundamentally change \n     Haitian society'' through projects aimed at Haitian \n     institutions over several years will fail if Haiti cannot pay \n     its government workers and police. They will also fail if \n     Haiti cannot correct its macroeconomic policy. Sustainable \n     development is a distant dream under these circumstances.\n\n                             Privatization\n\n       President Preval renewed the commitments he made in \n     Washington, D.C. in late March 1996 to resume the \n     privatization program halted by former President Aristide in \n     October 1995. Whether the new President can overcome strident \n     opposition to privatization from his predecessor and a \n     skeptical parliament remains to be seen.\n       An ambitious schedule for comprehensive economic reforms \n     calls for negotiations between the Preval Government and \n     international donors to begin on April 15, possibly resulting \n     in signed agreements by the end of May. The untested new \n     Haitian Minister of Finance and the remaining Preval economic \n     team will have to stretch their limited political mandate and \n     untested political skills to the limit if there is to be hope \n     of reaching agreements acceptable to both Washington and the \n     Lavalas coalition.\n       Privatization will continue to be a major sticking point. \n     Both the U.S. and the World Bank appear to be insisting on \n     completion of the process of turning over to private \n     management on a lease basis the local flour mill and cement \n     plant--both of which are idle. Both became symbols of \n     Aristide's resistance to economic reform when he refused to \n     open bids for management of the mill and plant in October \n     1995. This led to the resignation of reformist Prime Minister \n     Smarck Michel, and the termination of nascent economic \n     recovery in the months since.\n       At the beginning of April, some elements of Haiti's \n     economic team were searching for a way to proceed with \n     privatization while taking into account popular resistance to \n     the concept. A draft proposal would accelerate the outright \n     sale of 50 percent of the flour mill and cement plant. The \n     remaining 50 percent would be assigned to a holding company \n     representing local authorities who could eventually benefit \n     from any distributed profits.\n       Bureaucratic waste, fraud and corruption continue to be a \n     major drag on the Haitian government. More than 90 percent of \n     the entire Haitian budget is dedicated to salaries, and up to \n     30 percent of the Haitian civil service consists of \n     ``phantom'' employees drawing 50 percent of the payroll.\n\n                  International financial institutions\n\n       The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and \n     the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are committing far \n     more economic resources to Haiti than the major bilateral \n     donors, the United States, Canada, and France. About $230 \n     million was made available by the IFIs in 1995 through the \n     simple device of releasing funds frozen during Aristide's \n     exile. An equal or greater amount is scheduled for 1996. Of \n     course, the military costs absorbed by the United States and \n     Canada in restoring President Aristide have not been taken \n     into account when measuring bilateral foreign aid \n     contributions.\n       More than $100 million in IFI assistance is frozen because \n     of the Haitian government's refusal to meet mutually-agreed \n     upon privatization goals.\n       The IMF and World Bank are approaching their 1996 \n     negotiations with the Preval Government with some \n     determination to avoid repeating the exceptional procedures \n     used to disburse funds to the Aristide Government in early \n     1995. Those loans lacked specific conditions and were heavily \n     front-loaded, precluding any opportunity to match promises \n     with performance.\n       By summer, IMF and World Bank disbursements will be needed \n     in order to meet GOH payrolls and balance of payments \n     requirements. Without a viable economic reform package in \n     place by June 1, that schedule will not be met. Any delays or \n     breakdown in negotiations with the IFIs will result in a \n     renewal of Clinton Administration efforts to fill the \n     resulting budget gap through use of bilateral ESF, of which \n     up to $60 million may remain from the 1996 appropriation. \n     Much of the ESF for Haiti is now allocated to projects.\n       The IDB representative in Haiti may be more willing than \n     his IFI counterparts to advance up to $350 million in \n     additional concessional loans to the Preval Government. He \n     appeared to measure success by the level of loans committed, \n     not their contribution to sound policies in Haiti. It should \n     be noted that the IDB and the World Bank were willing to co-\n     finance public works projects in Haiti undertaken by U.S. \n     armed forces engineers when AID appeared unable to do so.\n\n                          AID mission in Haiti\n\n       Many AID projects do not meet the basic criteria of \n     ``sustainability''. For example, according to an internal AID \n     evaluation of its community development projects in one area \n     of Port-au-Prince, a majority either failed or were \n     unsustainable. AID's internal auditor notes in the case of \n     renovations to the school, Ecole La Sanctification, ``This \n     was a gift, not a project!'' and for another project AID \n     writes, ``This project was a one time affair without a \n     sustainable component towards development.''\n       AID's sole contribution to privatization in Haiti has been \n     a $2 million grant to the International Finance Corporation \n     to fund IFC-sponsored reports and, according to AID, a \n     ``public awareness campaign''. In light of the strong--and \n     ill-informed--public opposition to privatization in Haiti, \n     any public awareness campaign has failed.\n       Through AID's new ``Results Review and Resource \n     Requirements'' (``R4'') process, it is difficult to assess \n     AID's successes and failures since AID now claims credit for \n     projects in which it has no financial or technical stake. For \n     example, AID claims it ``assisted the U.S. military. . .to \n     identify infrastructure projects.'' Senior U.S. military \n     officials claim that no collaboration exists between the U.S. \n     military and USAID. Further, the project in question, repairs \n     to Harry Truman Blvd.--the city's main thoroughfare which \n     runs in front of the U.S. Embassy--were paid for by the \n     Inter-American Development Bank.\n       As part of its short term jobs program, AID contracted to \n     develop a data-base of Haitians and Haitian-American \n     residents with marketable technical skills. An AID contractor \n     was paid to develop the skills bank data-base, which includes \n     1,171 listings, and it completed its work in October 1995. \n     Despite AID's purported goal of the project which was ``rapid \n     mobilization of individuals'', today--five months later--no \n     part of the data-base has been made available to the Haitian \n     government or local organizations.\n       AID lacks innovative methods for dealing with the critical \n     problems facing Haiti. For example, AID's ASSET project seeks \n     to plant more trees in Haiti, continuing a program which has \n     resulted in the planting of 90 million trees over 15 years. \n     Regrettably, there is little evidence that additional tree \n     planting will be effective since Haitians continue the \n     massive deforestation of their country at a rate of 30 \n     million trees annually.\n       AID's grantee to work with the Parliament, has little \n     experience working with legislatures or working with Haiti, \n     is moving slowly in its critical work. A previous contractor \n     with extensive experience in Haiti and in parliamentary \n     development, was dropped by AID, apparently because of the \n     contractor's previous work with the democratic opposition to \n     President Aristide.\n       AID takes credit for a training program for 3,000 \n     demobilized enlisted former members of the Haitian armed \n     forces (FAd'H), and for 2,400 ex-members of Interim Public \n     Security Force. While AID claims 2,800 ``employment \n     opportunities with private employers have been identified,'' \n     AID documents omit the fact that less than 4 percent of the \n     former FAd'H members have actually found employment. AID \n     officials also reportedly boycotted graduation ceremonies for \n     the former FAd'H trainees for ideological reasons.\n\n                        U.N. development program\n\n       As with all UNDP projects, it is difficult to determine \n     their success, failure or sustainability since nearly all of \n     UNDP projects are subcontracted out to other United Nations \n     agencies or to private contractors to provide ``technical \n     assistance.'' Staff did learn that UNDP's contribution to \n     Haitian privatization consisted of a single technical report, \n     which, despite 15 months of preparation and review, has not \n     yet been submitted to the government of Haiti nor \n     disseminated to the private sector. The U.S. Embassy also \n     remains at odds with UNDP over a prison reform project, \n     repeatedly yet unsuccessfully\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\n     urging UNDP to do more than offer seminars.\n       Staff visited a $10,000 pilot project designed by UNDP to \n     teach rural farmers basic agricultural methods to alleviate \n     soil erosion from hillside farming. It is curious that UNDP \n     is only now undertaking a pilot project of this nature since \n     environmental destruction due to this method of farming has \n     been evident in Haiti for decades.\n\n\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n                              Rule of Law\n\n                        Haitian National Police\n\n       The Government of Haiti should immediately demonstrate its \n     commitment to the Haitian National Police and the Special \n     Investigative Unit. President Preval's visit to the SIU \n     immediately after the delegation left Haiti was a positive \n     step--unfortunately, the visit was not well-coordinated and \n     no one was at the unit's headquarters during the visit.\n       ICITAP should repair the critical flaws apparent in its \n     Haiti training program, especially in supervisory and \n     investigative personnel, revising future training programs it \n     carries out. The desperate lack of trained supervisory and \n     investigatory personnel must also be immediately addressed if \n     the Haitian National Police and its specialized units are \n     ever to operate effectively. Both shortages should have been \n     foreseen much earlier, and should be addressed in future \n     ICITAP programs.\n       Visas to enter the United States should be immediately \n     withdrawn for all current or former Haitian officials \n     suspected on the basis of credible evidence to be involved in \n     extrajudicial killings or other gross violations of human \n     rights until they are formally cleared by the Haitian \n     judicial system.\n       In light of the fact that the report required by the ``Dole \n     Amendment'' cannot be honestly made, U.S. assistance to the \n     government of Haiti must be immediately reviewed, and all \n     ongoing assistance programs, except for legitimate \n     humanitarian or electoral assistance, to the government \n     should be suspended pending the outcome of the review.\n\n                       Special Investigative Unit\n\n       No further assistance to the HNP or the SIU should be \n     obligated or expended until the following conditions have \n     occurred:\n\n       A credible, respected head of the SIU is appointed.\n       A full-time prosecutor is assigned to the SIU.\n       Additional investigators are assigned to the unit, \n     reflecting the U.S. preference for 40 full-time \n     investigators.\n       Priority in manpower and other resources is given to cases \n     of extrajudicial killing after the return of former President \n     Aristide.\n       Access to SIU investigations, investigators and material is \n     completely and demonstrably denied to the American lawyers \n     and ``investigator'' who have been working with the SIU or \n     anyone else who might compromise the integrity of the \n     investigations.\n\n       If the above conditions have been met, and after prior \n     consultation with Congress, ICITAP should move immediately to \n     augment training and technical assistance for the Inspector \n     General of the HNP and the Special Investigative Unit, \n     including forensics, communication and other much-needed aid.\n       After the modus operandi of the SIU is clearly defined to \n     ensure the security of sensitive material, the FBI should \n     cooperate fully, including sharing complete files, with the \n     U.S. SIU contractors to ensure timely access to all evidence \n     and reports needed to conduct a thorough investigation of \n     extrajudicial killings.\n\n                              U.S. Embassy\n\n       The Embassy must make human rights a priority. The Embassy \n     should immediately reconstitute its human rights fund to \n     assist victims of political violence and their families. The \n     Embassy should assume responsibility for monitoring, \n     gathering information and reporting on extrajudical killings, \n     including the murders of Mireille Bertin, Jean Hubert \n     Feuille, Michael Gonzalez, and those killed in the Cite \n     Soleil massacre.\n       The Inspectors General at the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of State, the General Accounting Office and the \n     U.S. Congress should conduct independent investigations into \n     the reasons why no U.S. government official warned Mireille \n     Durocher Bertin of an assassination plot against her \n     involving senior Haitian government officials, despite \n     possessing clear and credible information of such a plot. The \n     investigation should include the role of U.S. Embassy and \n     U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the decision not to directly \n     inform Bertin about the assassination plot.\n\n                             Politicization\n\n       The Administration should cooperate fully with all \n     Congressional Committee requests for documents related to \n     U.S. policy in Haiti. Timely responses to all Congressional \n     requests for information regarding the Administration's \n     policies in Haiti would be a positive, good faith step in \n     restoring bipartisan cooperation in Haiti.\n       Administration officials should end their intentional \n     mischaracterizations of the ``Dole Amendment'' and should \n     make available to the U.S. Embassy, the USAID mission in \n     Haiti, the government of Haiti, nongovernmental organizations \n     and the media accurate information about the reasons for the \n     withholding of U.S. assistance.\n\n                        Economy and development\n\n                       AID and assistance issues\n\n       AID should not consider releasing the Fiscal Year 1995 $4.6 \n     million cash transfer to the government of Haiti until true \n     privatization has taken hold. Under current circumstances, \n     the staff delegation does not foresee the situation in Haiti \n     improving to the point at which there would be justification \n     for releasing any Fiscal Year 1996 funds for balance of \n     payments support. Without swift action by the government of \n     Haiti to substantially cut its civil service payroll, any \n     U.S. balance of payments support will only be wasted.\n       Congress should not approve any additional Administration \n     requests to use scarce ESF funds in Haiti until a sustainable \n     economic reform program has been implemented. Congress should \n     also carefully monitor the use of the $60 million in ESF made \n     available from the FY 1996 appropriation.\n       Given that AID claims it cannot move forward on its ASSET \n     project due to government of Haiti intransigence, AID should \n     immediately withdraw this Congressional Notification.\n       AID should immediately terminate projects which are not \n     sustainable. While many of the short term jobs programs and \n     training aid have given the perception that Haiti's economy \n     is progressing and that AID's efforts in this area have been \n     successful, that is simply not the case. As seen by the staff \n     delegation, when AID resources for these projects are \n     exhausted, the projects have failed.\n\n                             Privatization\n\n       The Government of Haiti must accelerate the rate of \n     privatization. Privatizing the cement factory and the flour \n     mill, while important, should not represent the culmination \n     of the government's efforts, rather they should serve as a \n     useful first step catalysts to further privatization.\n       The International Financial Institutions should hold firm \n     on their insistence on steps toward privatization, requiring \n     that reforms be enacted before assistance is disbursed. \n     Congress should carefully review the 1997 request for the \n     IADB's Fund for Special Operations to ensure that its use in \n     Haiti would not result in the postponing of economic and \n     civil service reform and privatization. Further, U.S. \n     executive directors at these institutions should use \n     significant American leverage, including their voice and \n     vote, to ensure that reforms precede assistance.\n\n                      Democratization and politics\n\n       AID must intensify its effort to provide material and \n     technical support so the Parliament can function as \n     efficiently as possible. Current delays, in large part due to \n     AID's change of contractor midstream, should be immediately \n     resolved. Support should include timely, practical assistance \n     on substantive issues which are expected to be taken up by \n     the Parliament soon.\n       AID should demand a full and complete accounting from the \n     United Nations and the government of Haiti for all U.S. \n     assistance provided for the 1995 elections. No additional \n     election assistance should be provided until this accounting \n     is made public and made available to Congress.\n\n                         International presence\n\n       The MICIVIH mission should not divert all its attention \n     toward long-term institution building in Haiti at this time, \n     rather it should be more aggressive in its basic human rights \n     monitoring and reporting activities. MICIVIH should further \n     press the Preval government to investigate all human rights \n     violations, especially those cases under the investigative \n     jurisdiction of the SIU and the Truth Commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/19/senate-section/article/S3742-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3747-S3748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, APRIL 22, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
