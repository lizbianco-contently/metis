Mr. President, I would like to continue a series of \npresentations I have made in this body concerning the opening of the \nArctic oil reserve in ANWR.\n  Before I make a reference to the specifics, let me show you a map and \nshare with you an observation relative to this huge landmass of Alaska, \nwhich is one-fifth the size of the United States. In the Arctic region, \nabove the Arctic Circle facing the Arctic Ocean, we have a resident \npopulation of Eskimos. The primary area where they are concentrated is \nin Barrow. It moves down to Wainwright, Icy Cape, Point Lay, Kaktovik, \nover to the Canadian border.\n  They are a nomadic people that to a large degree depend on \nsubsistence for a lifestyle, but as a consequence of the oil discovery \nin Prudhoe Bay, they now have a tax base. They now have jobs. They are \nbeginning to generate sewer and water facilities in the larger \nvillages. This is brought about only because of the reality of having a \ntax base and activity in their area.\n  If I may share with you, Mr. President, the issue of opening up the \nArctic oil reserve of ANWR for a quick review, it involves Congress \ntaking action on authorizing the lease-sale of 300,000 acres out of the \n19 million acres of ANWR. That is a pretty small footprint. Most of \nANWR, about 17 million acres, has been set aside in perpetuity by \nCongress in either wilderness or refuge. That is evidenced by the area \nin green. Congress set aside the yellow area in 1980 for a \ndetermination at a later time, whether to allow oil and gas leasing. \nThe area in red is the small Eskimo village of Kaktovik. This is \nlocated on the map in this far corner of Alaska near the Canadian \nborder.\n  The reality is that Prudhoe Bay, which is the largest oil field in \nNorth America and has been producing about 25 percent of the total \ncrude oil produced in the United States for the last 18 years, is now \nin decline. As a consequence, geologists tell us this is the most \nlikely area for a major oil discovery to be found. \n\n[[Page S 16842]]\n\n  This happens to be Federal land. As a consequence, only the Federal \nGovernment can authorize opening it. Both the House and Senate, in the \nreconciliation package, have included a proposal to allow the lease-\nsale. It is anticipated the lease-sale will bring about $2.6 billion, \nfunded strictly by the oil companies who would bid on these Federal \nleases. This would provide the largest employment, the largest \nconcentration of new jobs that we can identify in North America, some \n250,000 to 700,000 jobs over the anticipated life of the field.\n  Is it needed? Certainly it is needed, because the Prudhoe field is in \ndecline, from about 2 million barrels a day to about 1.5 million \nbarrels a day. When Prudhoe Bay was found and opened, we were about 34 \npercent dependent on imported oil. Today we are 51.4 percent dependent \non imported oil. Much of that oil comes from the Mideast, so we are \nbecoming more and more dependent on the Mideast. We are relying, \nobviously, on governments that have shown some instability--Iran, Iraq, \nLibya. It is still very much of a hot spot from the standpoint of \nstability. Yet, we are sending our dollars and sending our jobs \noverseas when we could be developing our own resources. The question \nis, can we do it safely? And the answer clearly is yes.\n  The problems that we have associated with opening this are emotional \narguments from America's environmental community. Let me show you an ad \nthat appeared in the Washington Post. It appeared in the Roll Call. \nThis is an ad by the Indian Gaming Association. It shows a little \nnative girl whose future could be affected by an act of Congress. The \nheadline is, ``Don't Tax Her Opportunity To Get Off Welfare.''\n  The same situation applies to the Alaska Natives and the exploration \nin this area. As we look at Alaska and the large area, the idea of oil \nexploration in this very, very small area is the only identified job \nopportunity for the Eskimo people in the Arctic.\n  What about rural Alaska? It is an area that probably has about the \nhighest unemployment of anywhere in the United States. Rural sanitation \nwas virtually unknown until a few years ago. There are a few villages \nthat have running water. Most of them still have honey buckets instead \nof indoor plumbing.\n  What we have here is a case of wealthy environmental and preservation \norganizations that are opposed to opening up this area to create jobs \nfor Alaska's Eskimo and Native people. The Eskimo people want jobs. \nThey want to have a future. They want to have an opportunity to educate \ntheir children. They live in a harsh climate. Without exception, \nvirtually the entire Eskimo population of Alaska supports opening this \narea.\n  What does the issue consist of? Some have said, ``Well, it is big \noil.'' I would suggest that we reflect for a moment and recognize that \nthe big business associated with this issue is really the big business \nof America's environmental community. Where do these people live? \nWashington, DC; New York; Boston. They take indoor plumbing for \ngranted. They oppose ANWR. Today a number of them are meeting down at \nthe White House with the administration on this and a number of other \nenvironmental issues.\n  It has been suggested that this is going to harm the Arctic and harm \nthe Eskimo and native way of life. The Eskimo people would not do \nanything to harm their environment. They want safe oil development \nbecause they want better lives. And, clearly, as I have indicated, \nbecause of our increased imports of foreign oil, America needs the oil.\n  Many of the professional environmentalists have never been up to the \nArctic oil reserve of ANWR and have never been up to this part of \nAlaska. They do not really care about the Eskimos' or Natives' future. \nSome of them have been up and have shared some of the unique \nexperiences in some of this area. It is a very expensive operation. It \ntakes about a $5,000 bill to charter an aircraft and hire the comforts \nof life that are necessary to enjoy and experience the wilderness.\n  But make no mistake, we are talking about a very small footprint--\nauthorizing 300,000 acres out of 19 million acres. And industry says, \nif the oil is there, they can develop it within 2,000 acres.\n  Mr. President, if you have ever been out to Dulles International \nAirport, that complex is 12,500 acres. If you compare the huge area of \nANWR, it is about the size of the State of South Carolina. We are only \ntalking about 2,000 acres, if the oil is there.\n  Who are these professional environmental groups? Why do they focus on \nan issue way up in North America that most Americans cannot see? It is \nfar away. It is costly to get there. The answer is these organizations \nneed a cause. A cause gives them dollars. A cause gives them \nmembership.\n  Mr. President, they are now big business. The environmental \nmovement's income, salaries, contributions, and investment patterns are \nextraordinary. I would like to share a report from the Center for the \nDefense Free Enterprise that gives us all an opportunity to review some \nof the executive salaries, expense accounts, the huge incomes, the big \ninvestment portfolios, the big offices, and the staff. The report says \nthat the environmental movement is arguably the richest and most \npowerful pressure center in America.\n  So just what kind of people make up the professional environmental \nestablishment? They are certainly better off than the Native people of \nAlaska. Let me share some of the executive compensations, just a few \nthat are listed here.\n  The Nature Conservancy, John Sawhill, president and chief executive, \nsalary $185,000, benefits $17,118; National Wildlife Federation, Jay \nHair, executive director, salary, benefits, expense account, roughly \n$300,000; World Wildlife Fund, Kathryn Fuller, executive director, \nsalary, $185,000, total with benefits, $201,650; and on down the line. \nOver here is the Environmental Defense Fund, Fred Krupp, executive \ndirector, salary, $193,000, with benefits $210,000. That is big \nbusiness.\n  These 12 groups I have listed here have a net worth--not just in \nthousands, not hundreds of thousands, but $1.03 billion. Their combined \nrevenue for 1 year was $633 million. Their 4-year lobbying expenses \nwere $32 million. This is big business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tables entitled \n``Executive Compensation'' and ``Environmental Organization Incomes'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                                                                 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                  Expense               \n               Organization                          Executive                      Title                Salary      Benefits     account       Total   \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Nature Conservancy...................

Mr. President, I also want to add and take a brief \nmoment to make a statement in regard to the peso, which continues to \nslide rather dramatically today. I would like to bring to the attention \nof this body that the economic crisis continues in Mexico. As we \nrecalled yesterday, the Mexican peso fell to a record low against the \ndollar--7.8 pesos to the dollar. That peso evaluation is even lower \nthan last January and February when the administration told us that the \nMexican economy was in crisis and the American taxpayer had to bail out \nMexico. There was a good deal of debate in this body at that time.\n  One of the reasons that Mexico's economy is in such deep trouble is \nthe Government's PACTO with labor, agriculture, and business leaders. \nThe Bank of Mexico announced some 2 weeks ago it will raise its minimum \nwages 10 percent by December and another 10 percent in April 1996. It \nwill raise the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, electricity by 7 percent \nin December and another 6 percent next April. And there will be \nincreases of 1.2 percent in all other months.\n  Think about that. These price increases follow the 35-percent oil \nprice increase and 20 percent electricity price increase set last \nMarch. Investors Business Daily called the PACTO ``centralized economic \nplanning at its worst--more reminiscent of Soviet style 5 year plans \nthan of the free market.'' Still, Treasury Secretary Rubin said that \n``structural reform continues to improve the long-term prospects for \nthe--Mexican--economy, attracting both domestic and foreign \ninvestment.''\n  Well, I suggest, Mr. President, that the Secretary of the Treasury \nhas it all wrong. The Mexican economy is in a free-fall. Just this \nThursday interest rates on 28-day Treasury bills soared to 54 percent. \nInflation is currently running at 40 percent.\n  Mr. President, this administration earlier this year told the \nCongress that by the second half of 1995 Mexico's economy would \nstabilize, it would stabilize only if we bailed out the speculators \nwith American taxpayer dollars. The only thing that has happened is \nthat the speculators in tesobonos have all been paid off 100 cents on \nthe dollar, courtesy of the United States taxpayer, and the Mexican \neconomy today is in shambles.\n  The $20 billion bailout and the economic conditions we forced on \nMexico have produced, in the opinion of this Senator from Alaska, an \neconomic disaster. I doubt that we will see Mexico pay back the \nAmerican taxpayer. I fear that the economic austerity that we have \nforced on Mexico will lead to a political disaster south of the border.\n  I hope that prediction is not true. But I think it is time to go back \nand reassess--reassess, Mr. President--what we did earlier this year in \nbailing out those investors in tesobonos, most \n\n[[Page S 16845]]\nof which were sophisticated U.S. investors. The American taxpayers \nbailed them out. Here today we are seeing that that effort to try to \nstabilize the Mexican Government apparently has failed.\n  Mr. President, I have concluded my remarks. I wish the President a \ngood day, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, pursuant to a previous order, I believe I \nhave 20 minutes during morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16844-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16845-S16848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICAID PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I conclude a series of talks on the \nMedicaid Program. I began a four-part presentation last Friday by \ndebunking the myth that the Medicaid Program has been a failure. In \nfact, an objective review of the accomplishments of this Federal-State \npartnership tells us that the Medicaid Program has been an American \nsuccess story.\n  Just a few examples: The decrease in infant mortality rate from 10.6 \ndeaths per thousand livebirths as recently as 1985 to 8.5 in 1992, \nlargely attributable to an expanded effort in the Medicaid Program;\n  The improved quality of long-term care for millions of elderly \ncitizens in a manner befitting their human dignity;\n  The deinstitutionalization of 125,000 profoundly handicapped \nAmericans.\n  With that record of accomplishment established, on Tuesday of this \nweek, I examined why Federal spending on Medicaid has increased \nthroughout its history and why it is expected to increase in the next \nyears. I pointed to such things as the demographic changes in America, \nparticularly the increasing longevity which has driven up the number of \npersons who are in need of long-term care.\n  I addressed the numerous programmatic expansions in Medicaid that \nreflected compelling policy decisions, such as the decision to reduce \ninfant mortality. That has led to increased costs as well.\n  Finally, I cited the erosion of private health coverage for millions \nof children, an issue which has become a major subject of public \nconcern this week with the publication of a study in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association on that very topic, documenting the trend \nthat as private sector insurance abandon children and their parents, \nthe Medicaid Program picked up the slack, helping them get \nimmunizations, checkups, and, when needed, specialty care.\n  Mr. President, this is not to say that part of the increase in the \ncost of Medicaid was not attributable to abusive or wasteful practices. \nYesterday, I spoke about the abuses in the Disproportionate Share \nHospital Program, known as DSH. I decried how the Senate, by its vote \non October 27, rewarded with millions, and in some cases billions, of \ndollars those very States that gamed the DSH program. What is worse, \nthe Senate majority voted to fund these rewards by raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund and by perverting sound budgetary practices.\n  Mr. President, with that backdrop in place, I come to the Senate \nfloor today with a message of hope. I bring to this Chamber a proposal \nthat recognizes the importance of maintaining the Federal-State \npartnership in Medicaid and restraining costs.\n  The Senate is not in a posture of block grants or bust. There is \nanother way. Why should we consider an alternative? We should consider \nan alternative because the alleged benefits of block grants--\nflexibility to the States particularly--are minimal, and the costs and \nloss of a Federal partner in a time of need for the most vulnerable of \nAmericans are great.\n  The foundation upon which the block grants have been built, that they \nenhance flexibility for the States, is on shaky ground--shaky ground \nwhich erodes by close examination; shaky, that is, unless you define \n``flexibility'' as the freedom to raise State taxes or local property \ntaxes, or the flexibility to pit the elderly against children as \nbeneficiaries for the Medicaid Program. Otherwise, there is precious \nlittle flexibility the States can receive that they cannot already get \nunder the current Medicaid program waiver.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has pioneered, with \nwilling States, extraordinary demonstration projects where statutory \nand regulatory requirements can be waived to permit new approaches to \nhealth care. In my State of Florida, we have been in the vanguard of \nthis waiver movement, particularly in the area of providing community-\nbased services for older citizens and expanding the use of managed care \nfor poor children.\n  Before the Senate brought the Medicaid legislation to the floor, I \nmet with Mr. Bruce Vladeck of the Health Care Financing Administration, \ngenerally known as HCFA. My question to him was:\n\n       What flexibility, to allow innovation, would the block \n     grants give States that they cannot get today through the \n     waiver program?\n\n  Here is a summary of his answer:\n\n       States today can test new approaches to publicly supported \n     health care by obtaining waivers to statutory requirements \n     and limitations. Waivers permit States flexibility from \n     Federal Medicaid statutory and regulatory requirements. State \n     Medicaid demonstrations present valuable opportunities to \n     both State and Federal policymakers to refine and test \n     policies that improve access to the quality of care for \n     vulnerable Medicaid populations and to more effectively \n     manage the cost of providing that care.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full statement by Mr. \nVladeck be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What do the States relinquish in exchange for the \nmarginal new flexibility that they will allegedly receive? The Federal \npartnership to assist them, if they experience caseload growth, will be \nsurrendered. The Federal partnership, during times of economic hardship \nor recession, will be surrendered. And the Federal partnership, if \nthere is a natural disaster--when Hurricane Andrew hit south Florida, \nMr. President, our Medicaid caseload shot up by 12,000 people. Not only \nhad their homes been blown away, their jobs had been blown away. \nTherefore, people who had been employed and self-supporting needed the \nassistance of Medicaid during that time of crisis.\n  Under block grants, a State that is knocked down to its knees by a \nflood, earthquake, hurricane, would not find a helping hand from the \nFederal Government at the time it needed help to get back on its feet. \nNo, Mr. President, acts of God and block grants do not mix.\n  Mr. President, this is not a new debate. In January 1982, during his \nState of the Union Address, on the 26th day of that month, President \nReagan recognized the issue of the States and the Federal Government's \npartnership in Medicaid. Did President Reagan advocate that Medicaid \nought to be turned back to the States in the form of a block grant? Did \nhe advocate that the States be left alone to deal with issues of \nchanges in their growth, changes in economic circumstances, natural \ndisasters? No, Mr. President, that was not the position of President \nReagan.\n  Let me quote from his State of the Union Address what President \nReagan said on January 26, 1982:\n\n       Starting in fiscal year 1984, the Federal Government will \n     assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly \n     growing Medicaid Program, to go along with its existing \n     responsibility for Medicare. As part of this financially \n     equal swap, the States will simultaneously take full \n     responsibility for Aid for Families with Dependent Children \n     and food stamps.\n\n  Mr. President, that was the swap that President Reagan proposed on \nJanuary 26, 1982. I believe the President's advice, in terms of a \ngreater, not a lesser, Federal role in Medicaid, was wise then, and it \nis advice that we should seriously consider following today.\n  If block grants are as bad as I suggest they are, is the only \nalternative to them business as usual? No, Mr. President. There is a \nway to have the best of both worlds, and to contain costs while \nmaintaining the Federal-State partnership in Medicaid. \n\n[[Page S 16846]]\n\n  The best of both worlds is the per capita cap proposal that is \ngaining momentum as the win-win answer to the block grants' lose-lose \nproposition.\n  The per capita cap approach provides that health care and coverage \ncould be protected, and costs can be controlled by disciplining the \nprogram with an annual limit in Federal spending per beneficiary.\n  This approach maintains the individual guarantee to Medicaid services \nand creates an incentive to maintain health care coverage. Funding \nwould follow the people in need, not some political entity.\n  The per capita cap approach, which I presented to the Senate 2 weeks \nago, saves $62 billion over the next 7 years. It enhances State \nflexibility, and it reduces the rate of growth in Federal Medicaid \nspending to a level that is sustainable for the States, the \nbeneficiaries, and the Federal Government.\n  The per capita cap assures that States with innovative demonstrations \nalready underway can continue to operate their programs, and that other \nStates wishing to innovate have the resources and ability to do so.\n  Let me briefly outline how the per capita cap approach would work.\n  Federal funding would be allocated to States on a per person in need \nbasis. For example, one of those categories of per persons in need are \npoor children. If the cost of providing services to a poor child in \nCalifornia, for example, has been $1,000, then the Federal Government \nwould continue its Federal-State matching share, which in the case of \nthat State is 50 percent State, 50 percent Federal, and the Federal \nGovernment would continue to provide $500 per each poor child \nqualifying for Medicaid services in the State of California.\n  If needs increase because the population of poor children goes up, or \nif they decrease because the population goes down, or if there is a \nnatural disaster or a public health calamity and more children become \neligible for coverage, the Federal partnership and the contribution of \n$500 per child would be guaranteed, unlike a block grant, where a fixed \nsum of money is allocated regardless of change in circumstances.\n  The incentive is to reduce costs and not cut people off coverage \nbecause if you arbitrarily cut children off, you lose the Federal \nmatch.\n  Costs are what must be controlled. If, for example, California were \nto spend more than $1,000 per child, then the State of California would \nbe required to make up the difference between the actual cost and what \nMedicaid would cover--$500 of State and $500 of Federal funds.\n  Again, under a per capita cap, the money follows the need and the \nperson. As a result, during economic booms, or if health care needs \ndecline, the Federal Government would share in the savings--also unlike \na block grant which straitjackets and obligates money regardless of \nneed.\n  The Federal Government would make payments to each State based on the \nstatutory Federal matching rate or the per capita rate, whichever is \nlower. The cap would be stated in inflation terms.\n  Our proposal, Mr. President, is that that inflation term be stated at \n1 percentage point below the projected rate of medical inflation in the \nNation. Today it is projected that the medical rate of inflation for \nthe next 7 years will average 7.1 percent per year per person. We \nwould, therefore, propose to set the inflation rate under the per \ncapita cap at 6.1 percent, thus producing the $62 billion in savings \nover the next 7 years.\n  The cap would be cumulative and thus allow States enough flexibility \nto apply savings under the cap from one year to the next. Caps would be \napplied separately to each of the four principle categories of Medicaid \nbeneficiaries: the elderly, the disabled, children and their mothers. \nThis separation into four distinct groups avoids the sinister zero-sum \ngame that is endemic to block grants, where one group's interests are \npitted against another.\n  Mr. President, on first hearing this formula, some may say it sounds \nvery complicated. For those who have had a background in State \ngovernment, it really is a clone of the way States allocate and \ndistribute school dollars to individual school districts. In fact, with \nonly four categories of beneficiaries to consider, it is far simpler \nthan most per pupil school district formulas.\n  The per capita cap idea is not a new idea. It is one which should be \nfamiliar to many of our Republican colleagues. It is a concept that was \nsupported in health care proposals introduced within the last year by \nSenators Dole, Packwood, Gramm, and Chafee.\n  Mr. President, among those merits, the Medicaid per capita cap \napproach permits the States to move toward managed care and other types \nof arrangements which save money without having to secure specific \nFederal waivers. That, Mr. President, is real flexibility.\n  Another advantage of the per capita cap approach is that many other \ndetailed rules and process-oriented requirements would be phased out. \nStates would be held accountable to performance outcomes with respect \nto certain quality access measures. The Federal Government would be \ninterested in the outcomes of State health long-term care delivery \nsystems but would not be mandating how to achieve those outcomes.\n  Finally, the per capita cap approach would cap and retarget future \ngrowth in the Disproportionate Share Hospital Program, referred to as \nDSH. My colleagues who have read about or possibly heard my remarks \nyesterday on the flagrant, unflinching abuse of the DSH program by some \nStates will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.\n  Mr. President, the per capita cap approach I outlined today would \nassure 18 million children, 8 million low-income women, 6 million \ndisabled, and 4 million elderly Americans continued coverage for \nhospital, physician, and nursing home care services. This approach \nwould cut costs, not cut people.\n  Mr. President, suppose for a moment that in 2 years oil prices fell \nas they did in the early and late 1970's, another economic recession \nwere to strike a region of our country such as the southwestern States. \nSuppose the same phenomenon ensued with layoffs, real estate fire \nsales, and businesses start canceling health insurance coverage.\n  As we know from the history of the last 15 years, suppose, further, \nthat families ran through their savings, ran out of money to care for \ntheir elders. This may sound far-fetched, but it was not that long ago \nthat the former Governor of Texas held a garage sale and sold personal \nitems to generate cash during those hard times.\n  For purposes of this discussion, we will say that the citizens of the \nSouthwest ran out of money, so their frail elderly turned to Government \nfor long-term care. With no help from the Federal Government in their \nhour of need, those States would be in a financial straitjacket under \nblock grant.\n  Mr. President, this is insanity, and unnecessary insanity.\n  Under per capita caps, those same States would get help. The Federal \nGovernment's contribution would increase as the need increased. Most \nimportant, the elderly, the disabled, the children, and pregnant \nmothers would not pay for the economic downturn with their help if not \nwith their lives.\n  Mr. President, this makes sense. There is a legitimate national \ninterest in such an outcome. The $62 billion reduction in spending \namounts to a surgical cut, not the meat-ax approach that the $176 \nbillion block grant legislation that passed the Senate 2 weeks ago \nrepresents.\n  Further, Mr. President, the per capita cap approach would continue \nthe Federal-State partnership in detecting fraud and punishing \ndefrauders. Medicaid fraud, the DSH abuse and the uncontained spending \namount to a cancer on our Nation's health and long-term care delivery \nsystems. But it is treatable--not a terminal condition. In our zeal to \ncure this affliction, let us not kill the patient in the process; let \nus not kill the very Federal-State partnership that has served this \nNation so well for 30 years.\n  For the past week, Mr. President, I have attempted to spotlight the \nMedicaid Program, to expose the recklessness of $176 billion in block \ngrant cuts and the raid on the Social Security to reward DSH abusers.\n  Today, I propose another way, a way that maintains the Federal-State \npartnership while still containing costs. After all, Mr. President, \nbehind those $176 billion in cuts are human beings who will pay the \nprice for our free-lance legislating, for our don't-ask, don't-care \nindifference, to the casualties of these block grants. \n\n[[Page S 16847]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a column by Mr. David \nBroder, which appeared in the Washington Post on August 6, 1995, \nentitled ``Race to the Bottom?'' be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we will all be able to read that in \naddressing the Medicaid and welfare block grant debates, Mr. Broder \nwrote eloquently of the fear that under block grants the States will \nengage in a ``race to the bottom that shreds the social safety net.''\n  He predicted the likeliest scenario under block grants would be as \nfollows: ``What would happen when Federal funding is reduced and \nFederal standards are eliminated is that 50 legislatures would become \nthe arena, each year, in which the welfare population would have to \ncompete against other claimants for scarce dollars.''\n  Mr. President, I share this view of the future in America under block \ngrants. You cannot have a race to the bottom without casualties along \nthe way. Along the way in the block grant race to the bottom will be \neye glasses for elderly, unfilled prescriptions that used to be covered \nunder Medicaid. They will not survive the race to the bottom.\n  Along the way in the race for block grants, the race to the bottom, \nwill be families torn apart by unnecessary nursing home placements and \ninstitutionalization. Communities' care for the elderly and other \nMedicaid waiver services are not likely to survive the race to the \nbottom.\n  Along the way in the block grant race to the bottom will be ugly \nlegislative sessions in 50 States, legislatures where the frail elderly \nwill be pitted against children, and the mentally retarded against the \nAIDS sufferer in a battle royal for block grant money.\n  Is that what we want for America? Mr. President, there is another \nway. The race to the bottom has yet to begin and it need not begin. \nThere is still time.\n  Per capita cap legislation is our way out of the race to the bottom \nand is our ticket to a 21st century that maintains an American Federal-\nState stake in the health and welfare of its citizens.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Statement of Bruce Vladeck\n\n       Senator Graham. What cannot be waived under this 1115 \n     program for either legal or administrative policy reasons?\n       Mr. Vladeck. States can test new approaches to publicly \n     supported health care by obtaining waivers of statutory \n     requirements and limitations from the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services. Waivers permit \n     States flexibility from the Federal Medicaid statutory and \n     regulatory requirements that cannot be altered through the \n     Medicaid State plan amendment process. State Medicaid \n     demonstrations present valuable opportunities to both States \n     and Federal policy makers to refine and test policies that \n     improve access to, and quality of care for vulnerable \n     Medicaid populations, and to more effectively manage the \n     costs of providing that care.\n       Although, section 1115 authority is very broad, certain \n     statutory restrictions exist for State demonstrations. In \n     addition, HHS has made a number of policy decisions that \n     affect statutory provisions we will and will not waive for \n     demonstration programs.\n\n\n                          statutory provisions\n\n       FMAP Rates. The rate at which the Federal government \n     matches States expenditures cannot be waived.\n       Services for Pregnant Women and Children. The obligation to \n     cover certain women and children described in section 1902(1) \n     cannot be waived under section 1115 authority.\n       Drug Rebate Provisions. Section 1902 also requires that a \n     State provide medical assistance for covered outpatient drugs \n     in accordance with section 1927, which also contains the drug \n     rebate program provisions. Section 1927 excludes drugs \n     dispensed by HMOs from the requirements of the drug rebate \n     program. Since the drug rebate provisions are imposed on drug \n     manufacturers, and not on the State, this provision cannot be \n     waived through a waiver of section 1902. Only those drug \n     rebate and best price provisions of section 1927 which apply \n     directly to the State may be waived, not those which apply to \n     drug manufacturers.\n       Copayments and Other Cost Sharing. Section 1916 enables \n     States to impose deductibles, copayments and other cost \n     sharing requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, but also \n     prohibits States from requiring copayments from \n     categorically-eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in \n     managed care systems. The Secretary's authority to waive this \n     restriction is limited. These limitations make it impractical \n     to waive section 1916 to enable states to require copayments. \n     Copayments and other cost sharing can be imposed for managed \n     care services, however, in the case of medically needy \n     individually and on individuals who are newly Medicaid-\n     eligible due to the demonstration.\n       Spousal Impoverishment Provisions. Section 1924 prohibits \n     the Secretary from waiving spousal impoverishment provisions \n     for institutionalized individuals.\n       Work Transition. Section 1925 prohibits waiving work \n     transition provisions extending Medicaid eligibility for \n     certain individuals who lose their eligibility for Medicaid \n     through their loss of eligibility for Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children.\n       Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries, Specified Low Income \n     Beneficiaries, and Qualified Working Disabled Individuals. \n     Section 1905 requires States to provide coverage to these \n     groups of individuals regardless of an 1115 demonstration.\n       Competitive Bidding. Procurement rules in Part 74 of the \n     Code of Federal Regulations require States and other entities \n     to use competitive bidding ``to the extent practical''. \n     Because the statutory basis for these rules exists outside of \n     Title XIX, section 1115 cannot be used to waive this \n     requirement.\n\n\n                            policy positions\n\n       Reduced Quality of Care. Programs or policies which \n     inappropriately reduce access, benefits, or otherwise reduce \n     quality of care for current eligibles cannot be approved.\n       Quality Assurance. States are expected to maintain quality \n     assurance processes (e.g., eligibility quality control, \n     external medical review requirements, etc.).\n       Budget Neutrality. Demonstrations must be budget neutral. \n     That is, Federal expenditures under the demonstration may not \n     exceed the projected level of Federal payments to the State \n     in the absence of a demonstration.\n       Through negotiations with the National Governors \n     Association, HHS has agreed that States may achieve budget \n     neutrality over the life of the project, rather than on a \n     year by year basis.\n       Unnecessary Utilization and Access Safeguards. Section 1902 \n     requires safeguards against unnecessary utilization of \n     services. The statute also protects access to care by \n     requiring States to make adequate payments to providers. Such \n     safeguards must be maintained.\n       Boren Amendment. States must meet the Boren amendment's \n     access and payment requirements in fee-for-service settings. \n     Because these provisions do not apply to managed care \n     settings, States do not need a waiver of the Boren amendment \n     for managed care programs.\n       Contract Provisions. Most existing contract requirements \n     for comprehensive managed care plans in section 1903(m) will \n     continue to apply to managed care demonstrations. HCFA will \n     consider waiving the enrollment composition requirement (the \n     ``75/25 rule'') and disenrollment on demand if the State \n     plans to substitute a data-oriented, quality improvement \n     system for these statutory provisions.\n       Duration. The terms ``experiment,'' ``pilot'', and \n     ``demonstration'' all suggest that programs authorized under \n     section 1115 should, some point, conclude. Thus, States and \n     health care providers potentially affected by section 1115 \n     demonstration projects should be aware that section 1115 \n     demonstrations are time-limited.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                           Race to the Bottom\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       The Republicans in Congress are proposing a revolution in \n     domestic policy and in the relationship between the federal \n     government and the states. Last week, at their meeting in \n     Burlington, Vt., the nation's governors tried but failed to \n     agree whether the proposed changes would be a blessing or a \n     disaster. The 30 Republicans, 19 Democrats and one \n     independent could agree only to disagree.\n       Now the proposition is before Congress. This month the \n     Senate is debating several alternatives to the House-passed \n     welfare reform. After Labor Day, the House will launch a \n     similar debate on Medicaid.\n       On the face of it, the fight is about money. The welfare \n     bill was blocked for weeks in the Senate by a dispute between \n     states like Wisconsin and Massachusetts, which have high \n     benefits and little growth in their welfare populations, and \n     those like Texas, which have low benefits but are \n     experiencing rapid growth. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole \n     found a solution by coming up with enough money to guarantee \n     current allocations to the first group of states while \n     providing a bonus for the second.\n       That will be much harder when it comes to Medicaid, the \n     program that provides long-term care for the indigent elderly \n     and disabled and basic medical services for other welfare \n     families. It is by far the biggest single federal-state \n     program today, and the Republican budget calls for $181 \n     billion in savings from it in the next seven years. Finding a \n     way to distribute the pain will be difficult.\n       But money is just one of the dimensions of this struggle. \n     Equally important is the question of minimum standards--and \n     where they will be set. Until now the floors have been \n     established in Washington for Medicaid and for the main \n     welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     (AFDC). The states have been the junior partners, both in \n     designing and paying for these basic ``safety net'' programs.\n       What the Republicans want to do is reverse that. By capping \n     the amount of money the \n\n[[Page S 16848]]\n     federal government would appropriate for these two programs and \n     converting them from individual entitlements to state block \n     grants, they would force the states, over time, to pay for a \n     bigger share. In return, the states would be given much wider \n     leeway, immediately, to redesign the programs to their own \n     taste.\n       The hope is that this will encourage experimentation that \n     may reduce costs while actually improving outcomes for \n     beneficiaries. The Medicaid population could benefit from \n     moving into managed-care programs, it is argued. Welfare \n     programs could be tailored more easily to local \n     circumstances, helping people move off the dole and into \n     paying work.\n       The critics' fear is that instead of innovating, the states \n     will engage in a ``race to the bottom'' that shreds the \n     social safety net.\n       In back-to-back speeches to the governors, Dole argued that \n     the first of those results is likeliest; Clinton said he \n     worried that the second would be the case.\n       No one can be certain, but logic and experience suggest \n     that the second scenario is more likely. What would happen \n     when federal funding is reduced and federal standards are \n     eliminated is that the 50 legislatures would become the \n     arena, each year, in which the welfare population would have \n     to compete against other claimants for scarce dollars.\n       The reality is that, as Clinton said, ``the poor children's \n     lobby is a poor match'' for other interests that pressure the \n     legislatures. Teachers, road builders, law enforcement \n     people, county and local governments, universities all have \n     more clout. That was demonstrated this year in states from \n     New York to California, where welfare benefits were trimmed \n     to avert deeper cuts in other parts of the budget.\n       Dole, who is shepherding the welfare bill in the Senate and \n     who would like to challenge Clinton in next year's \n     presidential race, cozied up to the governors by expressing \n     his indignation at Clinton's ``race to the bottom'' charge. \n     ``I wonder which states he thinks would participate in such a \n     race,'' Dole said. ``Which states does he believe cannot be \n     trusted with welfare, education and protection of their \n     people?''\n       But it is not a question of trust. The political realities \n     of the legislatures are much as Clinton described them. To \n     ignore that reality is to court trouble--not just for the \n     aged and the poor but for the federal system.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, last night, I along with a number of our \ncolleagues in both bodies, Republican and Democrat, those who have \nresponsibility for foreign policy decisions, gathered with the \nPresident for nearly a couple of hours to talk about the situation in \nBosnia, and whether and under what circumstance American troops might \nbe sent there.\n  And in the future, when the discussions in Dayton, OH, are over, I \nwill speak more about what I think can be and should be America's role \nin Bosnia, as the leader of NATO. But during the discussion last night, \nI could not help but think, whoever goes into the former Yugoslavia, \nassuming there is a peace agreement and the fighting has stopped, and \nthe tanks are rolled back and the troops withdrawn, there is 1 killer \nthat will remain--actually, not 1 killer, there are over 2 million \nkillers that will remain in the former Yugoslavia. Those are, of \ncourse, the landmines that have been put there.\n  These landmines do not sign peace agreements. The landmines do not \nwithdraw. The landmines do not say, ``We have agreed to stop killing.'' \nIn fact, the landmines do not agree that they will kill and maim only \ncombatants. They will destroy the life of whoever steps on them, \ncivilian or combatant.\n  I have spoken many times about landmines on the floor of the Senate, \nand also in the halls of the United Nations where I had the privilege \nof serving as a delegate from the United States.\n  The immense human misery that is caused by landmines is finally \nbecoming known. Just last week, on the CBS program ``60 Minutes,'' they \nshowed how Cambodia has become a land of amputees from the millions of \nlandmines that have littered the country. Tim Rieser from my office has \nbeen there and seen that, as have many others who have worked with me \non the landmine problem.\n  Each one of those landmines waits silently. It is hidden until some \nunsuspecting child steps on it, loses a leg or their face or eyes or \ntheir life from loss of blood. And people who have come back from \nCambodia, like so many of the countries that are strewn with landmines, \nand have told me that after awhile they become almost inured to walking \ndown the street and seeing men, women, and children with a leg missing \nor an arm missing or their face horribly scarred and blinded, all from \nlandmines.\n  We think how terrible it is in these countries, where unlike in our \nown country where we can walk safely almost anywhere, the people there \ncannot even go out to the fields to raise crops or to feed their \nanimals, get water, or go to school. Whenever they venture outside they \nknow that any minute could be their last.\n  But ours is a false sense of security, Mr. President, because \nlandmines also maim and kill Americans, whether those are Americans in \ncombat missions, the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who are \nsent into combat or on peacekeeping missions, or Americans who are on \nother missions overseas.\n  I have spoken many times about my friend Ken Rutherford of Boulder, \nCO. Two years ago, he lost a leg from a landmine in Somalia where he \nwas working for the International Rescue Committee, a noncombatant on a \nhumanitarian mission. He has undergone at least seven operations to \nsave his other foot that was badly damaged.\n  Those who were in the Senate hearing room when he testified about the \nexplosion when the landmine blew apart the vehicle he was riding in, \nremember the image of him sitting there in shock holding his foot in \nhis hand trying to put it back onto his leg--an impossibility, of \ncourse--those who were there remember, as did people operating the \ncameras from networks who stood there with tears running down their \nfaces, witnesses and others who had heard similar horrible stories \nbefore, were stunned into silence listening to this man.\n  Last June, two Americans, one from Long Island, the other from \nMinnesota, both in the military but on their honeymoon--on their \nhoneymoon--were killed from a landmine in the Sinai Desert on their way \nto a resort on the Red Sea, even though peace had long since come to \nthe area.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, another American fell victim to a landmine in \nZaire. Marianne Holtz of Seattle, WA, was working for the American \nRefugee Committee on the Rwanda border doing the highest of missionary \nand humanitarian work. She was following, really, the precepts of the \nBible, of caring for these, the least fortunate of our brothers. She \nlost both legs, part of her face and today she is on a respirator in a \nhospital thousands of miles from home fighting for her life from \ninternal injuries, because the vehicle she was riding in was blown \napart by a landmine.\n  That is not an isolated incident. Four people have died and over 20 \nwere injured in two separate incidents in the past 2 months in Rwanda \nwhere landmines blew up a Red Cross ambulance and a truck filled with \nrefugees.\n  Mr. President, if there were a Red Cross ambulance filled with \nrefugees and humanitarian workers, and a soldier were to fire a weapon \nat them and blow up that truck, we would say, ``What an outrageous \nthing. Don't they know this is the Red Cross? Don't they know these are \nnoncombatants?'' It would be a war crime. But the landmine does not \nknow that, and the landmine exploded and it is just as horrible.\n  This is happening, Mr. President, every 22 minutes of every day. \nSomebody in one of the 60 countries infested with mines loses an arm, \nleg, or is killed.\n  I have talked about four Americans who are among the tens of \nthousands of innocent people who have been killed or horribly mutilated \nby landmines in recent months. They are in addition to the 18 Americans \nwho died from landmines in the Persian Gulf. In fact, a quarter of all \nthe American soldiers who died in the Persian Gulf war died from \nlandmines.\n  With 100 million landmines in over 60 countries, more Americans will \nbe among their victims. Millions more landmines are being laid each \nyear, and \n\n[[Page S 16849]]\nsooner or later, we have to realize whatever the military utility these \ninsidious weapons have, it is time we paid attention to the terrible \nhuman suffering it is causing indiscriminately day after day after day. \nIt is time, as civilized nations on this Earth, to join together to end \nthe use of these indiscriminate, inhumane weapons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized. \nThe Chair advises the Senator from Massachusetts that morning business \nis set to expire at 12 noon--just to advise the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16848-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16849-S16851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PART B MEDICARE PREMIUMS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in just a very short period of time, we will address \nthe continuing resolution, and I want to bring the attention of our \ncolleagues to a provision in there which I find objectionable and will \neither personally offer an amendment or will join with others to \naddress what I consider to be an unacceptable inclusion in the \nproposal, and that is dealing with the part B Medicare premium.\n  We have had a debate on the issues of Medicare during earlier \nconsideration, about the unjustified, I believe, cuts in the Medicare \nsystem that are being advanced by our Republican colleagues in order to \njustify the tax breaks for wealthy individuals. And now as a result of \nthe actions that we have taken, we are seeing put into play the first \nof the results of the actions that have been taken by the Senate and \nthe House. It is being added to this continuing resolution.\n  I hope that the President will veto the proposal. I join with him in \nrejecting the attempt to try and blackmail the President of the United \nStates on this continuing resolution into accepting this particular \nprovision, and I would like to outline to the Senate the reasons why I \nfind it so objectionable.\n  The amendment would strike from the continuing resolution the \nprovision increasing the part B premium by $136 next year, compared to \nthe level provided under the current Medicare law. This proposal is a \npart of the overall Republican assault on Medicare, does not deserve to \nbe enacted into law and it certainly does not belong on a continuing \nresolution.\n  If the Republican program becomes law, it will devastate senior \ncitizens, working families and children in every community in America. \nIt extends an open hand to powerful special interests and gives the \nback of the hand to hard-working Americans. It makes a mockery of the \nfamily values the Republican majority pretends to represent.\n  The Republican assault on Medicare is a frontal attack on the \nNation's elderly. Medicare is part of Social Security. It is a contract \nbetween the Government and the people that says, ``put into a trust \nfund during your working years and we will guarantee good health care \nin your retirement years.'' It is wrong for the Republicans to break \nthat contract, and it is wrong for Republicans to propose deep cuts in \nMedicare in excess of anything needed to protect the trust fund, and it \nis doubly wrong for the Republicans to propose those deep cuts in \nMedicare in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  The cuts in Medicare are too harsh and too extreme: $280 billion over \nthe next 7 years, premiums will double, deductibles will double, senior \ncitizens will be squeezed hard to give up their own doctors and HMO's.\n  The fundamental unfairness of this proposal is plain: Senior \ncitizens' median income is only $17,750; 40 percent have incomes of \nless than $10,000, and because of the gaps in Medicare, senior citizens \nalready pay too much for the health care they need. Yet, the out-of-\npocket costs that seniors must pay for premiums and deductibles will \nrise by $71 billion over the next 7 years--$71 billion rise over the \nnext 7 years--an average of almost $4,000 for elderly couples.\n  The Medicare trustees have stated clearly that $89 billion is all \nthat is needed to protect the trust fund for a decade, not $280 \nbillion.\n  The Democratic alternative provides that amount and will not raise \npremiums an additional dime, will not raise deductibles a dime. It will \ngive senior citizens real choices, not force them to give up their own \ndoctor.\n  The Republican Medicare plan also deserves to be rejected because of \nthe lavish giveaways to special interest groups. In the House and \nSenate proposals, insurance companies got what they wanted--the \nopportunity to get their hands on Medicare and obtain billions of \ndollars in profit; the American Medical Association got what it \nwanted--no reduction in fees to doctors and limits on malpractice \nawards. The list goes on and on. Clinical labs no longer have to meet \nFederal standards to guarantee the accuracy of tests. Federal standards \nto prevent the abuse of patients in nursing homes will be eliminated. \nPharmaceutical firms will be given the right to charge higher prices \nfor their drugs.\n  Because of this unjust Republican plan, millions of elderly Americans \nwill be forced to go without the health care they need. Millions more \nwill have to choose between food on the table or adequate heat in the \nwinter, paying the rent or paying for medical care.\n  Senior citizens have earned their Medicare benefits. They pay for \nthem and they deserve them. It is bad enough that the Republicans have \nproposed this unjust plan, and it is worse that they have taken the \nsingle largest cost increase for senior citizens, the increase in the \nMedicare part B premium, and attached it to the continuing resolution.\n  Cuts in payments to doctors are not included in the continuing \nresolution. Cuts in payments to hospitals are not included in the \ncontinuing resolution. The only Medicare cut that is in this bill is a \nproposal to impose a new tax on the elderly and disabled.\n  The Republican strategy is clear: Try to rush through your \nunacceptable proposals because you know they cannot stand the light of \nday; try to blackmail the President into signing them, with the threat \nof shutting down the Government if he does not go along.\n  The part B premium increase is particularly objectionable because it \nbreaks the national compact with senior citizens over Social Security. \nEvery American should know about it, and every senior citizen should \nobject to it. Medicare is part of Social Security. The Medicare premium \nis deducted directly from a senior citizens' Social Security check. \nEvery increase in the Medicare premium is a reduction in Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  The Republican plan proposes an increase in the part B premium and a \nreduction in Social Security, which is unprecedented in size. Premiums \nare already scheduled to go up, under current law, from $553 a year \ntoday, to $730 by the year 2002. Under the Republican plan, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, the premium will go up much higher, \nto $1,068 a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator that the time \nfor the period of morning business has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 \nmore minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the Republican plan, as I say, and \nunder the existing law, by 2002, it will be $730. It will go up under \nthis proposal to $1,068 a year. As a result, over the life of the \nRepublican plan, all senior citizens will have a minimum of $1,240 more \ndeducted from their Social Security checks. Every elderly couple will \npay $2,400 more.\n  The impact of this program is devastating for moderate and low-income \nseniors. It is instructive to compare the premium increase next year to \nthe portion of the Republican plan tucked into the continuing \nresolution to the Social Security cost-of-living increase that \nmaintains the purchasing power of the Social Security check.\n  One-quarter of all seniors have Social Security benefits of $5,364, \nwhich is indicated here on the chart. The COLA for a senior at this \nbenefit level will be $139 next year. The average senior citizen has a \nSocial Security benefit of $7,874 a year. The COLA for someone at this \nbenefit is $205.\n  But under the Republican plan, the premium, next year, will be $126 \nhigher than under the current law. The average-income seniors will be \nrobbed of almost two-thirds of their COLA. Low-income seniors will be \nrobbed of a whopping 90 percent of their COLA. That is, with the \nincrease of $136, which would \n\n[[Page S 16850]]\nbe the increase in the premium, they would receive the $139, which \nleaves them $3 and, essentially, the increase in the premiums of part B \nthat is included in the continuing resolution will take 98 percent out \nof the Social Security checks of American seniors that are receiving \nthe $5,364.\n  So the idea that this is somehow separated from Social Security is \nwrong. For those individuals who try to give assurances to our senior \ncitizens that the increase in the Medicare is leaving Social Security \nalone is absolutely and fundamentally wrong. If you were receiving the \naverage, which is $7,874 a year, your COLA increase would be $205. With \nthe subtraction of $136, again, which is the increased Republican \npremium, you would have $69 left. In other words, there is a 66 percent \ncut in your COLA--a real cut in your quality of life--which is there to \naddress the challenges that seniors face with the increased cost of \nliving. If you are receiving the $10,043 per year, which is the top \npercentile of the seniors, you get an average of $261. They will have \n$125 left, and it is taking half of all of their increase--their \nprotections under Social Security.\n  So the Republicans' attack on Medicare will make life harder, sicker, \nand shorter for millions of elderly Americans, who built this country \nand made it great. They deserve better from Congress. This cruel and \nunjust Republican plan to turn the Medicare trust fund into a slush \nfund for tax breaks for the wealthy deserves to be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I think we have outlined what I consider to be the \nmost objectionable features of the add-ons that have been included in \nthe continuing resolution. There are other provisions which I find \nobjectionable. But every senior ought to know what is happening to \ntheir Medicare next year under the Republican proposal--an alleged \ncontinuing resolution, to ensure that the existing basic structure of \nour system of Government and our support for existing programs, so many \nof which our seniors depend upon, the extension of that--the \nRepublicans have added on the increases in the part B premiums, which \nis going to, if enacted, have an absolutely devastating impact not just \non the Medicare, but on the Social Security system.\n  This demonstrates how this kind of proposal of the Republicans, under \nthe continuing resolution, which historically has never been used for a \nsleight of hand maneuver--which this is--to try and jam this \nunjustified, unwarranted and, I find, dangerous proposal to the health \nand well-being of our seniors, and certainly to their security, through \nthe Senate on a Thursday afternoon prior to the Veterans Day weekend is \ncompletely unacceptable. It is wrong and unfair. When you look at why \nthis is being done--not to preserve the basic integrity of the Medicare \nsystem, but we are adding these kinds of burdens on the seniors of our \ncountry in order to have tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals. \nThis is not necessary. This is not right. It is wrong to take out of \nthe pockets of our seniors this kind of protection, which the COLA \nprovides, in order to provide tax breaks for wealthy individuals and \nthe corporations of this country.\n  We know this sleight-of-hand effort by the Republicans to do this, \nthey feel they have to do it in order to comply with the other \nprovisions of their budget. It is unjustified and unwise.\n  The President has identified this as an unacceptable provision. The \nAmerican people ought to understand the attempts to tinker with Social \nSecurity. This effectively reaches the basic issue of Social Security; \nthat is, whether the cost of living, which reflects the increased cost \nof food and medicines and heat and shelter for our senior citizens, \nwill effectively be emasculated.\n  It is particularly unfair to the neediest people on Social Security. \nThose that are in the lowest level of Social Security effectively are \nhaving all of their COLA wiped out. It is wrong and unfair. It is \nunjustified.\n  It is a prime reason why this sleight-of-hand maneuver by our \nRepublican friends should be rejected by the President. He was right to \nidentify it, and I hope it will be vetoed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to respond to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I find it a bit disingenuous that Members of the other party would \ncome to this floor and state that it is robbing senior citizens, \ninappropriately treating senior citizens, for us as Republicans to be \nputting forward proposals which essentially assure the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund, the purpose of which is to supply health insurance \nfor our senior citizens, when no proposal--no proposal--has come from \nthe other side of the aisle or from the President.\n  Furthermore, to state that allowing the percentage of premium that is \npaid by seniors to drop from 31.5 percent, which it is today and which \nit has been for a while, back to 25 percent is an action of good will \nor a gesture of kindness or gratitude or appropriateness that we should \npursue as a nation on behalf of our senior citizens, is to ignore who \npays the difference.\n  Under the present law for the part B premium, seniors' children, \ntheir grandchildren who are working--most seniors have children and \ngrandchildren who are working--support 69 percent, approximately, of \nthe cost of their seniors' health insurance. So if you happen to be a \nworking American today and you have parents who are on Medicare, or an \nuncle or grandfather who is on Medicare, or just a friend who is a \nsenior citizen who is on Medicare, you are paying as a working American \n69 percent of the cost of that individual's health insurance.\n  We have, as a society, said that is reasonable, that is fair. We, the \nworking generation, are willing to do that. I am happy to do it. My \ntaxes go to support that.\n  If we reduce that percentage from 31.5 percent--which seniors pay; so \nthey pay a third of the cost, and working Americans, their children, \nand grandchildren, are paying two-thirds of the cost--if we reduce that \nto 25 percent, which is the proposal of the President or the course \nwhich the President wishes to pursue and which the Senator from \nMassachusetts has so aggressively spoken here in behalf of, then what \nyou are doing is you are essentially raising the taxes of working \nAmericans of the children and the grandchildren of those seniors by an \nincredible amount of dollars--hundreds of millions of dollars. You are \nincreasing the taxes on working Americans and increasing the \nobligation, the subsidy of working Americans, which goes to support \nseniors.\n  Now, I think the split of two-thirds/one-third--actually it is more \nthan that--70 percent, approximately, 69 percent/30 percent is a pretty \ngood effort made by working Americans, children of seniors and \ngrandchildren of seniors to support the senior citizen population in \nthis country.\n  I think most seniors would understand and recognize that the fact \nthey are asked to pay 30 percent of the cost of their health insurance \nis a reasonable request. To reduce that to 25 percent is to skew the \nprocess to mean that their children and their grandchildren, who are \ntrying to raise their families in these sometimes difficult economic \ntimes, who are trying to help their children go to school, who are \ntrying to, maybe, buy their first home, maybe just make ends meet, to \nsay we are going to raise the taxes on those people in order to further \ndramatically skew the process and subsidize the senior citizen \npopulation at an even higher level for their part B premium seems to me \nto be the height of pandering to one interest at the expense of another \ninterest. Intergenerational pandering is what it amounts to, or extra-\ngenerational pandering.\n  The fact is, the differential between or the difference, the support \nthat is now being paid by children and grandchildren of seniors, \nworking children and grandchildren of seniors, of 69 percent of the \ncost of that seniors' health care insurance is a fair amount. To \nincrease the tax on working Americans by another 6\\1/2\\ percent, which \nis what is being suggested in this proposal, is not fair.\n  Then there is the other issue here. We have heard a large amount of \ncrocodile tears from the other side of the aisle about how the \nRepublicans are helping the wealthy at the expense of the poor in our \ntax cuts. Of course, you might note--which is never noted by the other \nside of the aisle--that the President raised taxes by about $240 \nbillion and said it was too much of a \n\n[[Page S 16851]]\ntax increase just a few weeks ago. He raised taxes by $240 billion when \nhe said he would not increase taxes during the first term in office, \nover a 5-year-period, and we are cutting taxes by $240 billion \napproximately over a 7-year period.\n  We are basically at a wash. We are getting back to the point that the \nPresident appears to want to be at now when he said he raised taxes, \ntoo. We are trying to correct that, getting taxes back to where they \nwere when he came to office.\n  Independent of that we hear--the crocodile tears about it being \nhorrible what is being done here to the poor and moderate income \nAmericans by the Republican tax cut, and helping the wealthy--first, it \nis factually inaccurate. The tax cut that we are proposing, 70 percent \nof it flows to people, families with incomes under $75,000, and 90 \npercent of it flows to people with incomes under $100,000, and people \nwith incomes up to $70,000 are not wealthy in this society.\n  More significantly, something that is conveniently ignored by the \nother side in the area of Medicare legislation and which the President \nappears ready to veto is the fact we are saying to the wealthy \nAmericans who are seniors, ``Hey, you have to stop being subsidized by \nyour working children and grandchildren.'' We do not think it is right \nthat a working child and grandchild who is trying to raise a family \nshould have to pay 69 percent of the cost of the insurance of the \nfellow who just retired from IBM last year and is making hundreds of \nthousands of dollars maybe--tens of thousands, anyway--in pension \nbenefits.\n  It is not fair that a person who is working 40, 50, 60 hours a week \ntrying to make ends meet on a computer assembly line in New Hampshire \nor at a farm in the Midwest or at some other activity--garage or a \nrestaurant--that an individual, family, a husband and wife, working \ntheir hearts out trying to make ends meet should have to subsidize the \ntop 100 people who retired from General Motors or Ford last year, whose \nincomes on pensions exceed the earnings of the people who are paying \nthe taxes to subsidize their health benefits. It is just not right.\n\n  So, in the Republican plan, we say if you have more than $50,000 of \nindividual income or as a husband and wife you have more than $75,000 \nof income, you have to start paying a higher percentage of the cost of \nyour part B premium. Instead of being subsidized at 69 percent by the \nworking Americans in this country, you are going to have to start to \npay more. And if your income exceeds $100,000 as an individual or \n$150,000 as a husband and wife, then you have to pay the full cost of \nyour part B premium. That is good policy. That is exactly what we \nshould be doing. We should be making this more fair.\n  So, let us have a little integrity in the process here as we debate \nthis issue. Let us note that, when the President says he wants to \nreduce the amount of the premium that seniors are paying, when he wants \nthat 31 percent to go down to 25 percent, that is a tax increase on the \npeople who pick up the difference, the people who pick up the cost for \nthat tax cut to seniors. It is a tax increase on working children and \ngrandchildren. Mr. President, 70 percent today, or 69 percent, of \nsenior's premiums today are already subsidized and we have accepted \nthat as a fair number. But to go to 75 percent, as the President wants, \nmeans you are going to raise the taxes on working Americans, the \nchildren and grandchildren of those seniors, by at least 6.5 percent, \nunder the President's proposal. That is not right and it is not fair.\n  Let us remember also that wealthy Americans today are subsidized by \nworking Americans who cannot afford it. It is time to change that and \nthat is what the Republican proposal does.\n  As we continue this debate I think a little forthrightness on the \nfacts would help the process.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my good friend and colleague from New \nHampshire has basically not responded to the central thrust of our \namendment, and that is the cuts which are being proposed by the \nRepublican program, according to CBO, means that there will be $50 \nbillion in premium increases and $24 billion in increases in \ndeductibles. We are also talking about $245 billion in tax breaks for \nthe wealthy individuals.\n  He failed to explain the connection, but the connection is there for \neveryone to see. The Democrats offered, under the leadership of Tom \nDaschle, the proposal which would guarantee the financial integrity of \nthe Medicare system without a single dime increase for the premiums for \nthose under Medicare and Social Security; not a single dime. Every \nDemocrat voted for that and only one Republican voted for it. Every \nother Republican voted against it. It would have preserved the \nintegrity of the Medicare system for the next 10 years.\n  But, nonetheless, the Republicans wanted to move the burden over to \nthe payment of senior citizens, to collect the $50 billion--$51 \nbillion, according to CBO. It is right there in the chart, $51 billion. \nIt says, ``Increase in the premiums, $51 billion.'' It is there under \nyour proposal. It is not there under ours. What is under yours is the \ntax breaks for wealthy individuals that is going right along with this \nproposal. That is the justification and the reason for this kind of \ncut. We can maintain the integrity of the Medicare system without \nhaving these kinds of increases. The only reason you need these kinds \nof increases is to have a tax cut.\n  So the American people have to say why should the major tax cut, that \nis being proposed by the Republicans, go to the wealthy individuals and \ncorporations, and the premium increases are coming out of people who \nare going to rely on $5,300 or $7,800 or, at the top, $10,000 a year to \nsurvive?\n  So this, the increase in premiums for our seniors over this period of \ntime, is $12,400 more in premiums over the 7 years. That is what the \nseniors are going to pay under the Republican proposal.\n  You can complain all you like about what your proposal is going to \ndo, but you cannot argue with the CBO figures. If you have something \nbetter on it, then address it. And that kind of wholesale increase, tax \nincrease, the wiping out of the COLA's, the increasing of the premiums \nand the deductibles by that amount in order to justify a tax break is \nsomething that I find is absolutely unacceptable and I think most \nAmericans find unacceptable. Certainly the seniors would find that \nunacceptable.\n  To do it on a continuing resolution at this time without full \ndiscussion and debate, I think, is unjustified and unwarranted and \nunfair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, those of us in public life are accustomed \nto being surprised as the morning newspaper is delivered to us each day \nto find extraordinary examples of bureaucratic abuse, waste, and misuse \nof the taxpayers' dollars. I must say, this morning the level of my \noutrage at this most recent abuse, which I will comment on in just a \nmoment, has been unsurpassed in my recent memory.\n  As the Wall Street Journal reports this morning, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Energy, Mrs. O'Leary, has \n\n[[Page S 16852]]\nhired an investigative service at taxpayers' expense in the amount of \n$43,500.\n  This is not a clipping service. All of us are familiar with clipping \nservices. I think they have a legitimate purpose in ascertaining what \ntypes of information may be being printed, broadcast, as the case may \nbe, about the functions of an agency. But this is an image-enhancing \neffort in which the Secretary has engaged, again at taxpayers' expense, \nto the amount of $43,500, an investigative service. This outfit is \nknown as ``Carma International.'' They were charged with not only \nclipping stories but doing some investigative reporting, both as to the \nreporters themselves and the stories. I think, if I might just share a \nparagraph or two very briefly with my colleagues, the flavor of this \nstory will be very clear.\n\n       From April through August, the service, Washington-based \n     Carma International, tracked more than two dozen individual \n     reporters and hundreds of newspapers, magazines and \n     newscasts. It also pored over thousands of stories, giving \n     each one a numerical ranking based upon how favorable or \n     unfavorable it was. It then calculated scores for how \n     favorably or unfavorably the DOE fared on various issues, \n     from nuclear waste to Mrs. O'Leary's own reputation. And it \n     scrutinized sources quoted in those stories.\n\n  Then, Mr. President, it went on to compile a ``Top 25'' list of \n``Unfavorable Sources.''\n  I must say, in a previous generation, this has a striking similarity \nin terms of the mentality involved of the Nixon ``Enemies List.'' This \nis not an attempt to gather information or ascertain what has been \nreported. This is a subjective analysis of ``look how the reporters \nfrom a particular news service or news organization are treating us.''\n  For this kind of money to be expended at taxpayers' expense is simply \noutrageous. I cannot conceive of a rationale or a justification to \nspend this kind of money.\n  So I am going to ask in a moment this article be printed in the \nRecord, but also indicate it is my intention to call upon the Secretary \nto reimburse the American taxpayers at her own expense for what I \nbelieve to be a truly outrageous expenditure of taxpayers' dollars, \nwithout any public use or justification at all, primarily driven, I \nsuspect, by the ego of the individual involved and by a paranoia that \nseems rampant at some levels in the agency.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article from the Wall \nStreet Journal of this morning be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Turning the Tables, Energy Department Reports on Reporters\n\n\nIt paid $43,500 in tax dollars to find ``unfavorables,'' ``a little bit \n                               of Nixon''\n\n                           (By Michael Moss)\n\n       Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary had an image problem. Her \n     department seemed to be taking a drubbing in the press for \n     everything from nuclear waste-disposal problems to its \n     allegedly bloated bureaucracy.\n       Mrs. O'Leary wanted those unfortunate stories to go away. \n     Badly. So she hit on a plan: She would ``build communication \n     and trust,'' explains Barbara Semedo, the Department of \n     Energy's press secretary.\n       And just how did she plan to build that trust?\n       By reporting on the reporters.\n       In an extraordinary tale of man-bites-dog, Mrs. O'Leary \n     quietly hired an investigative service to poke into the \n     reporters who were poking around the DOE. From April through \n     August, the service, Washington-based Carma International, \n     tracked more than two dozen individual reporters and hundreds \n     of newspapers, magazines and newscasts. It also pored over \n     thousands of stories, giving each one a numerical ranking \n     based on how favorable or unfavorable it was. It then \n     calculated scores for how favorably or unfavorably the DOE \n     fared on various issues, from nuclear waste to Mrs. O'Leary's \n     own reputation. And it scrutinized sources quoted in those \n     stories, coming up with its own ``Top 25'' list of \n     ``Unfavorable Sources.''\n       The result: detailed monthly reports, chock full of \n     colorful graphics and charts, with each report culminating in \n     favorability rankings for reporters, sources and news \n     organizations. All for $43,500--paid for with U.S. tax \n     dollars.\n       The DOE's Ms. Semedo defends the investigations, saying a \n     reporter's unfavorable rating ``meant we weren't getting our \n     message across, that we needed to work on this person a \n     little.''\n       Some of the journalists and sources who were scrutinized \n     aren't so sanguine. None knew about the existence of the \n     lists before being contacted by this newspaper yesterday. \n     It's ``an enemies' list,'' says Jerry Taylor of the Cato \n     Institute, a libertarian think tank, who ranked No. 25 on the \n     July list of unfavorables. ``I guess it shows you there's a \n     little bit of Nixon in everybody in the federal government.''\n\n\n                             bottoming out\n\n       Carma is part of a small but growing cottage industry of \n     firms that analyze reporters--and reporters' sources. \n     Government agencies and corporations have long used clip \n     searches, which find articles about them or about issues in \n     which they are interested. But these new services go much \n     further, coming up with pseudo-scientific methodology to rate \n     reporters. Some of the services, not including Carma, also \n     delve much deeper. They interview reporters' sources, their \n     employers and their friends and colleagues, and report on \n     information about the reporters' personal lives and \n     activities outside of work.\n       The DOE provided copies of reports for two months, April \n     and July, which make clear which reporters and news \n     organizations were considered friendly--and which weren't. \n     Its July report, for example, ranked the Associated Press's \n     H. Josef Hebert dead last, with a 30.8 overall score. That \n     month, he wrote an article that said ``sloppy'' Energy \n     Department monitoring at weapons facilities led to radiation \n     exposure, and another about victims of secret government-\n     radiation tests during the Cold War.\n       If a reporter gets ``too good a rating, you aren't doing \n     your job,'' Mr. Hebert said yesterday. Also scoring \n     relatively low in July was Matthew Wald of the New York \n     Times, who received a 46.7 for stories on plutonium storage. \n     (The Wall Street Journal didn't appear in the reports.)\n       At the other end of the spectrum were several reporters for \n     smaller newspapers, including Tony Batt of the Las Vegas \n     Review-Journal, who got a 56 in the July report. ``I've never \n     been rated before, especially by a government agency,'' says \n     Mr. Batt, who works in the paper's Washington bureau. ``I'm \n     uneasy about that.''\n\n\n                          ``slanted'' stories\n\n       DOE resorted to this latest tactic after a 1993 survey it \n     commissioned found it to be one of the least-trusted entities \n     around--right ``down with Congress,'' Ms. Semedo marvels. At \n     first, the department thought it would monitor the press \n     itself, at an estimated cost of about $80,000, she says. Then \n     DOE officials heard about Carma, which also had done work for \n     the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Postal Service.\n       Carma, which stands for Computer-Aided Research and Media \n     Analysis, warns in brochures that ``stories are sometimes \n     `slanted.' '' It boasts that if a reporter seeks an interview \n     with a CEO, Carma can find ``if a predetermined bias has \n     shown up in past coverage,'' thus giving the CEO ``a \n     strategic advantage.''\n       For DOE, Carma went through a rather complex process to \n     evaluate reporters and stories. Carma employees--generally \n     former academics or people with journalism backgrounds--\n     scrutinized close to 800 articles some months, paying close \n     attention to captions, photos and headlines, says Albert J. \n     Barr, president. Each employee also was armed with a list of \n     55 issues DOE had identified, from energy taxes to worker \n     safety. For every article, the employee singled out which \n     issues were discussed and assigned a score of 0 to 100 to \n     each issue mentioned, with 50 signaling a neutral comment and \n     100 an extremely favorable one.\n       Using the individual scores of every issue in a single \n     article, Carma employees worked out an overall score for the \n     article. That score was then fed into a computer, which \n     calculated a cumulative rating for the reporter involved and \n     for each of the issues mentioned.\n\n\n                         surprise: no surprises\n\n       And with all that scientific scrutiny, what bombshells did \n     DOE uncover?\n       Well, actually, none. ``It confirmed what those of us who \n     work with these reporters daily know--who is going to write \n     what and how are they going to cover us,'' Ms. Semedo says.\n       Indeed, Carma's ``Top 25'' lists of favorable and \n     unfavorable sources hardly required sophisticated analysis. \n     Topping the April list of ``Favorable'' sources: Mrs. O'Leary \n     herself. And leading the pack of ``Unfavorables'': Sen. \n     Robert Dole, a longtime critic of the agency who has \n     suggested it should be dismantled. Also making appearances on \n     the ``Unfavorable'' list were such obvious choices as \n     Beatrice Brailsford, program director of Snake River \n     Alliance, a watchdog group created in response to an Idaho \n     DOE project; and civil-rights attorney Roy Haber, who is \n     representing people suing over exposure to radiation \n     beginning in 1944.\n       ``This is wild, it's absolutely wild,'' Mr. Haber said \n     yesterday, calling the list ``disturbing'' and \n     ``frightening.'' He added, ``This will be investigated in \n     great depth, and we're going to find out the genesis of who \n     promulgated that list.''\n       At this point, he may no longer have to worry. If the \n     reports are any judge, the DOE's reputation only got worse \n     during the time Carma monitored the press, with its overall \n     favorability steadily dropping from 52 in January to 50, or \n     neutral, in July. Certainly, the DOE wasn't helped by its \n     admission that cleanup of former weapons-production sites \n     could cost at least $230 billion, or by press reports sniping \n     about Mrs. O'Leary flying first class and patronizing \n     expensive hotels.\n       Ms. Semedo, who in an earlier interview said Carma had been \n     dropped for budgetary reasons, said yesterday, ``It wasn't \n     particularly useful, and we stopped the service.'' \n\n[[Page S 16853]]\n     Anyway, she added, Secretary O'Leary only read a few of the reports: \n     ``She found it too complicated.''\n\n  Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, tonight is the 57th anniversary of a \nhorrible event. In Germany, 57 years ago this evening, it was ``the \nnight of broken glass''--Kristallnacht--when throughout Nazi Germany, \nJews were killed and Jewish cultural and business sites were destroyed \nin an organized campaign by the Nazi state.\n  In a little under 2 days, many Jews were murdered, and 30,000 were \narrested by the Nazi authorities, sent to swell the growing populations \nof Dachau, Buchenwald, and the other camps already built. On the night \nof Kristallnacht, over 1,000 synagogues were destroyed, and their \nsacred texts were burned and defiled. Jewish businesses around the \ncountry were sacked. Cemeteries were desecrated. Homes were burned. The \npolice and fire departments were instructed not to intervene.\n  Kristallnacht marked an escalation in kind of the Nazi persecution. \nIt came barely 6 weeks after the infamous Munich conference, which \nproduced the chilling declaration of peace in our time. After \nKristallnacht, the world could no longer ignore the behavior of this \nevil regime. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, 5 days later:\n\n       The news of the past few days in Germany has deeply shocked \n     public opinion in the United States * * * I, myself, could \n     scarcely believe that such things could occur in 20th century \n     civilization.\n\n  But within a week of Kristallnacht, Jews were banned from the German \nschool system. Within a month, Jews were being banned from public \nplaces.\n  The Holocaust, as it would come to be known, was fully underway. \nWithin less than a decade, this conflagration of historic proportions \nwould result in the systematic murders of 6 million European Jews.\n  While it represented the nadir of anti-Semitism in our modern age, \nthe destruction spawned by the Nazis' racial hatred consumed many more \nmillions of others, including Poles, Gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses, \nhomosexuals, and persons with physical and mental disabilities.\n  Mr. President, 57 years after Kristallnacht, we are fortunate to \nstill have survivors of the Holocaust among us. There are still some \nneighborhoods in this country where, tonight, survivors and their \nfamilies commemorate the night of broken glass by burning candles in \nthe windows. These flames are in memory of those who suffered the \nHolocaust. These flickers in the windows are the testaments of the \nsurvivors.\n  Mr. President, I worry about the memory of the Holocaust when the \nsurvivors will no longer be here. With each passing year, we have fewer \nsurvivors among us.\n  Mr. President, as the decades have passed from the dark era of the \nHolocaust, I have been greatly troubled by the increase in \npronouncements by those who willfully disbelieve the existence of the \nHolocaust. These ``Holocaust deniers,'' as they have come to be known, \npresent us with a troubling specter. They threaten our collective \nmemory with lies, distortions, and half-truths to challenge the reality \nof the Holocaust.\n  One of America's preeminent scholars of this phenomenon, Dr. Deborah \nLipstadt of Emory University, has written:\n\n       While Holocaust denial is not a new phenomenon, it has \n     increased in scope and intensity since the mid-1970's. It is \n     important to understand that deniers do not work in a vacuum. \n     Part of their success can be traced to an intellectual \n     climate that has made its mark in the scholarly world during \n     the past two decades. The deniers are plying their trade at a \n     time when much of history seems up for grabs and attacks on \n     the Western rationalist tradition have become commonplace.\n\n  Sadly, this erosion in the intellectual climate has infected our \npopular culture. Today, in addition to the pseudo-scholarly venues the \nHolocaust deniers have created, they have managed to present their \ninjurious views on high school campuses, in the media, and, in a few \ncases, in the political process.\n  Mr. President, we are fortunate, for many reasons, that we live in a \nfree and democratic society, and one of those reasons is that freedom \npreserves the ability of the scholar to study historical truth. An open \nsociety such as ours allows the student of history to apply methods of \nhistorical scrutiny and verification without bias or distortion, and \nthus to openly determine historical fact.\n  I must stress, Mr. President, that the same principles of an open and \ndemocratic society also allow for the holding of unpopular opinions, \nhowever factually incorrect or hurtful to others. A free society must \nprotect the opinions of all, Mr. President, and that includes the \ncontrarians and solipsists. If you choose to believe the Earth is flat, \nthat is your right in this society.\n  Our freedom of expression is wide, but falsehoods must be answered \nwith the truth. Denying the Holocaust is absurd.\n  Holocaust denial may be animated by ignorance and solipsism, but we \ncannot avoid the fact that it is often motivated by anti-Semitism and \nhatred. We must recognize that many of those who promote Holocaust \ndenial do so not out of an innocent but willful ignorance, but do so to \npromote political agendas, anti-Semitism and hatred.\n  We must deplore, in the words of the scholar Kenneth Stern ``anti-\nSemitism masquerading as objective scholarly inquiry.''\n  That is why I am introducing this resolution today, along with \nseveral of my colleagues, which ``deplores persistent, ongoing and \nmalicious efforts by some persons of this country and abroad to deny \nthe historical reality of the Holocaust.'' This resolution also praises \nthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for its essential work in honoring \nthe memory of all the victims of the Holocaust, and teaching ``all who \nare willing to learn profoundly compelling and universally resonant \nmoral lessons.''\n  Mr. President, as the last generation of Holocaust survivors fades \nfrom our midst, we are left with a chasm, a generational divide between \nthe primary witnesses and the rest of us, who must carry their witness. \nInto that chasm the Holocaust deniers may throw their malicious lies.\n  It is our responsibility that we close that chasm with a dedication \nto promoting scholarship about the Holocaust. We must cultivate the \nhistory of the Holocaust in order to preserve our memory and to \nreinforce the lessons we learn from such horrors. We must strengthen \nour younger generation's weakening grasp on history.\n  A free and democratic society must be supported by an informed \npopulace. And an informed populace requires a knowledge of history. As \nindividuals with amnesia suffer degrees of disorientation, a society \nseparated from history is bereft of its shared experience with the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, we must recognize the crucial role played by education \nin preserving the memory of the Holocaust. In 1980, the U.S. Congress \nassumed this responsibility when we chartered the U.S. Holocaust \nMemorial Museum. Since its opening in 1993, the Museum has played a \nsignal role in teaching the history of the Holocaust.\n  So powerful has the museum's message been that in it has been \noperating beyond capacity since its opening. Of the more than 2 million \nvisitors each year, 80 percent have traveled more than 100 miles to \nvisit this awesome place. As of today, 5.3 million have visited this \nremarkable institution, a number four times greater than expected.\n  People come to witness and to learn. More than 11,000 scholars and \nuniversity students, more than 700 members of the media and museum \ncommunity, and more than 14,500 survivors have used the museum's \nresearch institute. Through its connections to the information \nsuperhighway, 50,000 inquiries \n\n[[Page S 16854]]\ncome every week. Requests for teaching materials have come from every \nState in our Nation. Over 400,000 students from around the country came \nin school groups this year.\n  Mr. President, the success of the Museum demonstrates our country's \ninterest in studying the Holocaust. It is most reassuring to note, \nindeed, that the desire to learn the moral lessons of the Holocaust \ndwarf the messages of hate perpetuated by the Holocaust deniers.\n  Mr. President, I wish to close with two more quotes. Again from \nProfessor Lipstadt:\n\n       Holocaust denial . . . is not an assault on the history of \n     one particular group. Though denial of the Holocaust may be \n     an attack on the history of the annihilation of the Jews, at \n     its core it poses a threat to all who believe that knowledge \n     and memory are among the keystones of our civilization. Just \n     as the Holocaust was not a tragedy of the Jews but a tragedy \n     of civilization in which the victims were Jews, so too denial \n     of the Holocaust is not a threat just to Jewish history but a \n     threat to all who believe in the ultimate power of reason. It \n     repudiates reasoned discussion the way the Holocaust \n     repudiated civilized values. It is undeniably a form of anti-\n     Semitism, and such it constitutes an attack on the most basic \n     values of a reasoned society. Like any form of prejudice, it \n     is irrational animus that cannot be countered with normal \n     forces of investigation, argument, and debate.\n\n  And now, from an article by the current executive director of the \nHolocaust Memorial Museum, Dr. Walter Reich, who wrote a few years ago:\n\n       The devastating truth about the Holocaust is that it was a \n     fact, not a dream. And the devastating truth about the \n     Holocaust deniers is that they will go on using whatever \n     falsehoods they can muster, and taking advantage of whatever \n     vulnerabilities in an audience they can find, to argue, with \n     skill and evil intent, that the Holocaust never happened. By \n     being vigilant to these arguments we can all fight this \n     second murder of the Jews--fight it, and weep not only for \n     the victims' mortality but also for the fragility, and \n     mortality, of memory.\n\n  Mr. President, we are nearing the end of a bloody century, littered \nwith so many man-made catastrophes that it invites a numbing \nrelativism. Today, on ``the night of broken glass,'' let the legacy of \nthe victims strengthen our memories and sharpen our consciences to \nremain ever vigilant to the profoundly compelling and universally \nresonant moral lessons of the Holocaust.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16853-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

There will \nprobably be, hopefully, not many amendments, but an amendment or two, \nand we have to get it back to the House yet this evening or be here \ntomorrow, notwithstanding the fact that it is a Federal holiday.\n  I hope we could have everyone's cooperation and that we can move very \nquickly on the continuing resolution, and then be in a position when \nthe debt ceiling extension arrives to move quickly on that.\n  The President has indicated he will veto both the continuing \nresolution and the debt extension, which I hope is not the case because \nwe would have very little time to act on Monday to prevent a shutdown \nof the Government.

Mr. President, I wanted to call to the attention of the \nSenate today the release of the fifth annual national education goals \nreport, which was released earlier this morning by a group, a \nbipartisan group of Governors, myself, and several State legislators \nwho are members of this national education goals panel.\n  The panel is presently chaired by Governor Bayh of Indiana, and soon \nit will be chaired by Governor Engler of Michigan. Governor Engler was \nthere this morning, as were Gov. Christine Todd Whitman from New Jersey \nand Governor Romer from Colorado, who was the first chairman of this \npanel, and various others of us.\n  I wanted to just briefly summarize what was found in that national \neducation goals panel report, because I do think it is important. This \nis the midpoint between 1990 and the turn of the century. As people \nwill recall, in 1989, President Bush met with 50 Governors in \nCharlottesville, VA, to set out national education goals for the \ncountry to pursue between the year 1989 and the year 2000. Those goals \nwere agreed upon. I think they are good goals for the country. And we \nbegan the process.\n  Part of what was agreed to there was that we not only had to have \ngoals, but also had to have some standards, and we had to have a way of \nassessing progress, to determine whether or not the country was moving \nin the right direction or moving in the wrong direction. The report \ntoday says that we are moving in the right direction but at a very, \nvery slow pace. In some States the pace is very much slower than in \nothers. It also makes the point, strongly, that we do not have enough \ndata to understand what is happening to the extent we would like to.\n  There is good news in the report. There is also bad news in the \nreport. Let me just summarize a little bit of the good news first.\n  The report shows that during the period 1990 through 1992, and \nunfortunately we only have statistics now through 1992, but during that \nperiod math achievement at grades 4 and 8 in the United States did \nimprove. It went up fairly significantly, I would point out. It did not \ndo near as well in some States as it did in others. Where the national \naverage went from 20 to 25 percent, that is 25 percent of the students \nwho were tested measured up as being proficient in math in the eighth \ngrade in 1992, in my home State of New Mexico, unfortunately, the \nfigure was 14 percent. So we have a ways to go, not just in my State \nbut throughout the country.\n  The same basic questions and same basic testing and proficiency \nmeasurements were used internationally as well as in this country. \nWhere we have set a goal, and the President and Governors set a goal of \nbeing first in the world in math and science achievement by the year \n2000, this set of statistics we released today shows that in fact we \nare substantially behind Taiwan, which is at 41 percent on this same \ngraph. So \n\n[[Page S 16855]]\nthough there is progress to report, it is not enough progress.\n  Another item of progress that should be noted is that students took \nmore of the challenging advanced placement tests in basic academic \nsubjects--in English and math and science and history. That also is \ngood news.\n  We also are able to report that, among adults, more adults took adult \neducation classes throughout this country in 1992. A significantly \nlarger number took adult education classes than they did in 1990. \nAgain, that is good information and good news.\n  The bad news, unfortunately, is in the report as well. That is what \nthe report's purpose is. It is to point out where we are making \nprogress and where we are not. Unfortunately, high school graduation \nrates have remained at about 86 percent. That is not a change. That is \nnot improvement. We need to make improvement in that area.\n  Reading achievement at grades 4 and 8 have remained about the same. \nAgain, that is not good news.\n  There is a large gap that continues, between minority and white \nstudents as far as college enrollment and completion of college. Again, \nthat large gap is not good news.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, as I indicated, we have not done as \nwell as the national average in some important respects, particularly \nin the math criteria, but also in the reading. I think other States can \nalso learn from this data that was released today, where they need to \nmake progress.\n  The bottom line is that the work of improving educational performance \nin this country needs to continue. We are part way through the 10 \nyears. We are not all the way. We have a great distance to go.\n  I would point out one important fact. That is, the greatest progress \nthat is shown in all of this data is in the area of math achievement, \nand that is the only area where we have general agreement on the \nstandards that we are striving to achieve. The credit for that goes to \nthe National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. They came up with \ntheir own set of standards, which they have promulgated throughout the \ncountry and urged math teachers to adopt. Many teachers have. Many \nschool districts have. Many States have. And I think progress in math \nperformance is improving. Performance in math is improving to a \nsignificant extent because we have focused on that area and we have \nconcentrated on how to, in fact, define what we want to accomplish and \ngo about accomplishing it.\n  So I wanted to make the point that this effort continues. It is a \nbipartisan effort. I think it is a very important effort.\n  I know we get caught up in all kinds of political battles here in the \nCongress. In my opinion, this is one subject and one issue that ought \nto be above politics. Both Democrats and Republicans should, I believe, \nrenew our commitment to improving education in this country. I think \nthe Congress has a role in that, which of course we have debated. The \nStates have the primary responsibility. I do not think anybody would \nargue with that. Of course, local school districts, local schools, \nteachers, principals, parents and students have the ultimate \nresponsibility.\n  I appreciate the chance to bring these issues to the attention of my \ncolleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16854-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16855-S16858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, are we now on the \ncontinuing resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, there is a provision in this continuing \nresolution--indeed, there are many provisions in it. But there is one \nin particular that deals with lobbying.\n  Just on the face of it--I know other Senators are concerned about it; \nI know the Senator from Colorado was prepared to move to strike this \nprovision--I believe it should be stricken.\n  Let me make, first and foremost, this point about the appropriateness \nof having lobbying reform on the continuing resolution. I just think it \nis totally inappropriate. This Congress cannot function with 70 Members \nof the House basically writing a letter threatening that they are not \ngoing to support the continuing resolution if it does not contain this \nprovision.\n  I have an interest in impact aid. I have an interest in things \nrelating to agriculture--things that are not likely to pass this year. \nI suspect that I could probably round up 15 or 20 people or so who \nwould say, send a letter to Leader Dole and Leader Daschle saying that, \nif this is not included, we are not going to vote for it.\n  I know these new Members of the Congress get quite enthusiastic about \nsaying they have a mandate to do everything that comes to mind. But \nthis lobbying reform provision was not in the Contract With America. It \nis not in any contract that I have seen. I appreciate their enthusiasm \nfor change. But this provision--a lobbying provision changing our \nlobbying laws--does not belong on this bill. Indeed, I find it rather \nodd that the House has not taken up the lobbying reform legislation \nthat this body has addressed already. We debated it as a freestanding \nbill. Those who are enthusiastic about lobbying reform did not just \nwrite a letter insisting that lobbying reform provisions be included in \nthe continuing resolution.\n  I see with regret that the Speaker, the majority leader, and the \nPresident are now at loggerheads saying maybe the Government is going \nto be shut down on Tuesday because we cannot get a continuing \nresolution passed. It is tough to pass a continuing resolution, even \none that is clean, even one that has some provisions that connect to \nthe budget. I can stretch and understand that.\n  But when we have provisions relating to lobbying, I just think we \nhave to take a stand on this side and say to the House that we passed \nlobbying reform on this side. We brought it up on the calendar. We had \na lengthy debate about it. We changed the law. We propose to change the \nlaw relating to lobbying. The House should take it up over there; take \nup lobbying reform. If you want to add this amendment to lobbying \nreform legislation, do so.\n  I think it is a bad change. I would like to have the opportunity--if \nthey pass that over there, go to conference on the bill and it comes \nback over in that fashion, I would argue against it.\n  But I think that Republicans and Democrats here, if this body is \ngoing to function, are going to have to take a stand against 60 are 70 \nMembers of the House who are constantly saying, ``Do it our way or we \nare going to shut the place down.''\n  Mr. President, we all understand, for example, the rules of the \nSenate allow us to come down and expel large volumes of air and tie \nthings up with repeated debate. With all kinds of conversation, we \ncould slow this thing down, shut it down, and get nothing done, if that \nis what we choose to do.\n  I think the Senate, in this particular case, needs to take a stand. I \nknow the Senator from Wyoming, in fact, feels strongly about this. When \nwe took up the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, I joined with him \nand allowed an amendment to be accepted. But in the Treasury-Postal \nconference, again we find ourselves faced with a threat. We find \nourselves faced with a single individual who says in the conference \ncommittee, ``I do not care what happens to Treasury-Postal. I do not \nmind shutting the Government down. I insist that I get this provision \naccepted and changed into law.''\n  Mr. President, again, I do not mind sitting down here and fighting \nthe battle over something important. But nobody is calling me from home \nproposing this thing. This does not come from the grassroots. This came \nfrom a couple of people who had an idea that somehow we are \nincreasingly calling upon 50l(c)(3) organizations to help us. But I \nsuspect every Member of this body has gotten up and talked about the \nkind of partnerships that we need \n\n[[Page S 16856]]\nto make our Government more efficient and effective, and we have called \nupon nongovernment organizations to participate in the process.\n  What are we doing here with this language? We are saying essentially \nthat we are going to regulate you? After we have asked you to help, \nafter we have said to the Red Cross, ``We would like to have you help \nus with disaster programs,'' after we say to the YMCA and the YWCA, \n``We would like to have you help us with our violence against families \nefforts at the local level with the State taxpayer money,'' then we \nsay, ``Oh, by the way, do you make any effort to influence Congress? If \nyou do, we are going to restrict you.''\n  That is what Mr. Istook and Mr. McIntosh are saying. They are \nunwilling to pass lobbying reform over in the House and restrict the \nreal lobbyists that hang out here all day long. They will go after the \n501(c)(3)'s because in some cases they do not like the agenda. If push \ncomes to shove in the House, they will make an exception. We will \nexempt out veterans organizations. As I understand it, there may be an \nattempt over here to say let us take care of the Catholic Church and \nexempt them as well.\n  I say to Mr. Istook and Mr. McIntosh that, if your principle is \nsound, if you really believe your own words, that we are subsidizing \nlobbyists, we are not. And, by the way, this legislation addresses \nprivate money, not public money. This legislation put in place \nextensive regulation. 501(c)(3)'s would have to prove they are in \ncompliance. Speaker after speaker last night went down and said there \nare lots of organizations that are not affected. We exempted them all. \nTake care what you vote for around here because you may find yourself \ncreating a problem that you did not realize you were going to create, \nand that is precisely what would happen with the House language.\n  With the House language, you may say you are exempting these \norganizations, but they have to prove they are in compliance. They have \nto show the Federal Government that they are doing the right thing. We \nare now saying to these organizations that we have asked to help that \nnow you have to prove you are in compliance, and you have to keep your \nrecords for 5 years.\n  Again, this particular amendment is offered by individuals who \nrepeatedly go to the floor and talk about excessive regulation and the \nneed to reduce the cost of bureaucracy, to reduce the cost of \npaperwork. We asked in conference, What about the paperwork? What about \nthe bureaucracy? There was stony silence. ``We do not think it is going \nto be that big of a problem.'' We hear that a lot when somebody is \nproposing a new regulation. ``It is not going to be that big of a \nproblem.'' The answer is they have not really thought it through. They \nare trying to restrict the activities of organizations that have come \nto Washington and are asking that the budget be shaped a certain way, \nthat the appropriations be shaped. They do not like these requests.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator knows where my position is on this \nparticular issue.\n  I would like to merely say that the managers of the bill have not \nbeen able to make their opening statements at this point because a \nDemocratic Senator arrived on the floor after it was laid down and \nasked for permission to go back to morning business to make 10 or 15 \nminutes of remarks. We had no objection to that to accommodate the \nDemocratic Senator, and expected then to open up the issue by our \nopening statements--Senator Byrd and myself.\n  I want to say to the Senator that part of that delay also has been in \ntrying to work out some kind of an agreement on this particular point.\n  I wonder if the Senator would yield in order to return to that \nprocedure.\n  Mr. KERREY. Absolutely. Mr. President, I came to the floor with no \nidea precisely when it was that the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember would be coming down here to take the bill up. It was my \nintention to talk just briefly about this particular provision and, \nwhenever they got here, to yield.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I would ask for a quorum call for a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senate now has under consideration \nHouse Joint Resolution 115, the second continuing resolution for fiscal \nyear 1996. The current continuing resolution, Public Law 104-31, \nexpires on Monday, November 13, and only 2 of our 13 appropriations \nbills have been signed into law, so another measure is necessary to \nprovide executive branch authority to obligate funds for Government \noperations.\n  This continuing resolution has four titles. Title I is the operative \npart, providing that the rate of operations for activities funded in \nthe 11 appropriations bills not yet signed into law shall be the lowest \nof the rates provided by the House-passed bill, the Senate-passed bill, \nor the current rate. Specific provision is made for programs that might \nbe zeroed out under that formulation; namely, such programs may be \nmaintained at a rate of 60 percent of the current rate. The existing CR \npegs this minimal level at not to exceed 90 percent of the current \nrate.\n  In addition, this CR carries a provision, section 112, providing that \nspending rates may be adjusted to avoid any reduction in force, or RIF, \nat any of the affected agencies.\n  The expiration of this measure is Friday, December 1.\n  Title II of this measure is an internal housekeeping matter providing \nfor hand enrollment of the reconciliation bill, the debt limit bill, \nand continuing resolutions. This provision will expedite transmittal of \nthis legislation to the President once passed by both Houses.\n  Title III is the so-called Istook amendment. I expect there will be a \nmotion to strike this title. I will vote for that motion, and I hope it \nwill succeed.\n  Title IV carries two provisions within the jurisdiction of the \nFinance Committee. Both pertain to the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, it should be noted that this joint resolution has been \nbrought to the floor without referral to the Appropriations Committee. \nI have no objection to doing so, for I recognize the need to save time. \nBut I want to emphasize that this is not a product of the \nAppropriations Committee, and thus it does not necessarily represent \nthe views of a majority of our committee. In fact, I do not believe our \ncommittee would have reported this measure in this form, and I doubt \nthat the members of the committee will support this measure in all of \nits particulars.\n  I will now yield the floor to Senator Byrd to make whatever opening \nremarks he may wish to make, and then we can proceed with any \namendments or motions that may be offered.\n  I wish to indicate again the pleasure and the efficiency that has \nbeen developed by the working relationship with Senator Byrd as the \nformer chairman of our committee which I have enjoyed over a number of \nyears, and now that I am chairman and he is the ranking member, \nreversed to what it was in previous years, I want to say that it has \ncontinued to be an unassailable partnership from which I have derived \ngreat pleasure.\n  I also wish once again to thank Senator Kerrey of Nebraska for \npermitting us to return to this procedure at this time to introduce the \nresolution and to also assure the Senator, as he is now conversing with \nthe Senator from Wyoming, we are attempting to work out some kind of a \nresolution of the title relating to the Istook amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nobservations with respect to the working relationship that has existed \nfrom the beginning between the chairman, Mr. Hatfield, and myself. He \nhas accorded to me a great deal of courtesy and understanding, and I am \nproud that I share the responsibility with him of managing this measure \nas well as various and sundry appropriations bills that we have brought \nto the floor from \n\n[[Page S 16857]]\ntime to time. I enjoy that relationship with the chairman, and I \ncherish it.\n  Mr. President, as Senators are aware, the Federal Government has been \noperating under a continuing resolution--Public Law 104-31--since the \nbeginning of the new fiscal year, October 1st. That continuing \nresolution was necessary to give Congress more time to complete its \nannual appropriations process on the fiscal year 1996 appropriations \nbills. While that measure continued essential functions of government \nat rates below levels allowed in the 1996 budget resolution, it \nnevertheless did not prejudge final budget decisions for fiscal year \n1996, nor did it attempt to enact new policies into law. Instead, it \nwas a product upon which the President and Congress agreed to continue \nnecessary functions of the government through November 13.\n  It had been hoped that this six-week extension beyond the beginning \nof fiscal year 1996 would be sufficient to enable Congress and the \nPresident to enact most, if not all, of the 13 fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bills. But, unfortunately, that has not been the case.\n  To date, the President has signed only two appropriations bills into \nlaw--Military Construction and Agriculture. Two others--the Energy and \nWater Development and Transportation appropriations bills--have been \nsent to the President and his signature is expected. In addition, the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill, which the President \nunfortunately--and I think unwisely--vetoed, has been adopted a second \ntime by both Houses of Congress and is ready for submission to the \nPresident for his signature, which I hope that he will put on the \ndotted line this time.\n\n  I have never been able to understand the curious logic that went into \nhis veto of the legislative appropriations bill. The Constitution \ncreates this branch, the legislative branch. It is the branch closest \nto the people, and we have the responsibility to fund the operations of \nthe branch. There is no question but that the bill which was sent had \nbeen reduced in the amounts, so it was not a question of the amounts \nbeing out of line. It was just some kind of false logic on the part of \nthose down at the White House who have, I suppose, advised the \nPresident to veto that bill. He did not garner any kudos, as far as \nthis Senator is concerned, or any credits when he vetoed that bill. The \nmere fact that it was the first to reach his desk somehow must have \nresulted in a pique of someone down there, but it was not sent down \nfirst by calculation or design. It just turned out that way.\n  So I think it was silly for him to veto that bill, and I told that to \nthe people at the White House when they called me to ask me about it. I \nsaid it was faulty logic and it could come back to create problems for \nyou. I hope we will at this time pass that stage of sophomoric \ndevelopment.\n  All eight of the remaining appropriation bills are in various stages \nof completion. These bills are: Defense, Interior, Foreign Operations, \nTreasury-Postal, Commerce-State-Justice, VA-HUD, Labor-HHS, and \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  As a result of these difficulties, it has become necessary to enact a \nsecond continuing resolution. Unfortunately, the second continuing \nresolution now before the Senate, H.J. Res. 115, is not one which I can \nsupport. It not only contains unnecessarily deep funding cuts in \nprograms for education--and I have got to say this about education \nwhile I am on the subject; I cannot understand why we continue to spend \nmore and more moneys for education, and turn out a lower and lower \nperformance with respect to scholastic results that come out of the \nschools; I just cannot understand that--on infrastructure and other \ncritical areas, but it also contains a number of controversial \nlegislative provisions that have no business being included in a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  One such controversial provision--the so-called ``Istook \namendment''--is addressed in the President's Statement of \nAdministration Policy, dated November 8, 1995. That Statement of \nAdministration Policy contains the following language:\n\n       One provision of H.J. Res. 115, the so-called ``Istook \n     amendment,'' would launch a broad attack on the right to free \n     speech of such organizations as the Red Cross and the Girl \n     Scouts; it would limit their ability, and that of other \n     organizations that receive Federal funds, to participate in \n     administrative or judicial proceedings. The Justice \n     Department believes that the provision does not pass \n     constitutional muster because it imposes unconstitutional \n     penalties for the exercise of free speech rights. Among other \n     things, the provision would impose restrictions and penalties \n     on organizations that were involved in advocacy during the \n     year prior to passage of the legislation--thereby \n     violating the fundamental principle that prevents the \n     government from retaliating retroactively against persons \n     or organizations that have exercised free speech rights.\n\n  Another provision in this resolution would raise the contribution \nthat beneficiaries must pay for Medicare Part B premiums to $53.50, \neffective in January of 1996. Without this change, those premiums would \nbe approximately $10 less per month per person.\n  For these reasons, the President has indicated that he will veto H.J. \nRes. 115 if presented to him in its present form.\n  I support the President's position regarding H.J. Res. 115, as it is \nnow drafted. I am hopeful that the Senate will adopt sufficient \nmodifications to H.J. Res. 115 and that the House will concur in those \nmodifications, so that the President can be presented with a measure \nthat he can sign prior to the shutdown of the government at midnight on \nMonday, November 13. If such a shutdown occurs, it will not be the \nfault--I suppose it will be the fault of everyone to some extent. It \nwill be due to the inability of this Congress to complete its work in a \ntimely manner.\n  There are only two responsibilities that are absolutely essential for \nthis session of Congress. Those are, one, the enactment of annual \nappropriations for the Federal Government for fiscal year 1996 and the \nraising of the debt limit to a level sufficient to enable the \ngovernment to meet its financial obligations without default. \nThroughout the past year, we have heard the Republican majority of both \nHouses of Congress playing up their so-called ``Contract With America'' \nand touting all of the benefits that will be forthcoming to the \nAmerican people as a result of that so-called ``contract.''\n  As I have done on previous occasions, my contract with America I keep \nright here in my shirt pocket. And it cost 19 cents some years ago when \nI first purchased it. And it is entitled, ``The Constitution of the \nUnited States.'' That is my contract with America. And I do not swear \nto any other contract with America.\n  I am one that ran also last year, and I did not receive any mandate \nfrom the voters of West Virginia. Not one voter ever asked me about the \nso-called Contract With America. I was never asked to sign it or \nsupport it. I do not swear to it. I never expect to bow down to it. I \nonly bow down to the Bible, No. 1, and the Constitution of the United \nStates, No. 2, in that order.\n  If one looks at what they do and not what they say, the record speaks \nfor itself. Despite all of the rhetoric to the contrary, this is one of \nthe poorest performances that I can recall as far as the timely \nenactment of appropriations bills is concerned.\n  I hasten to say that I do not fault the chairman of the committee, \nthe distinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for this delay. \nAnd I do not fault the other members of the Appropriations Committee \nfor the delay. The major cause is the fact that a number of these \nappropriation bills include controversial legislative riders, such as \nthose that are contained in the pending measure.\n  Therefore, it is incumbent upon Congress to enact a clean continuing \nresolution and a clean debt limit increase without adding unnecessary \nlegislative provisions to either. If we are unable to do so, the blame \nwill be properly at our doorstep for the shutdown of the operations of \nthe Federal Government on Tuesday, November 14th, and the default on \nthe payment of its obligations shortly thereafter.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendments which I understand will be \noffered to this resolution which, if adopted, I believe will enhance \nchances that H.J. Res. 115 will be signed into law. If such amendments \nare not made by the Senate and agreed to by the House, then I feel sure \nthat H.J. Res. 115 stands no chance whatsoever of becoming law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado. \n\n[[Page S 16858]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16855-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16858-S16892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3045\n\n(Purpose: To strike title III which restricts the use of private funds \n     for political advocacy activities by nonprofit organizations.)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nwhat is now title III of the continuing resolution. I might say that I \ndid vote for the original Senate language. I opposed this provision as \npart of the Treasury-Postal conference committee. And I will tell you \nwhy. This measure, if adopted, would effectively eliminate the ability \nof nonprofits throughout this Nation to express their political views \nto their elected representatives at every level--at the Federal level, \nState level, local level, and tribal level. This legislation, I think, \nslams the door of Congress in the face of hundreds of thousands of \ngrassroots organizations.\n  In the Senate Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, this body adopted \nan amendment to keep large, well-financed nonprofit organizations from \nabusing the lobbying regulations. Certainly they should not use \ntaxpayers' money by the millions simply to lobby to get more taxpayers' \nmoney. But the House-passed version, on the other hand, goes much \nfurther and muzzles grassroots organizations and puts roadblocks in the \nway of legitimate advocacy efforts.\n  It would affect, as I understand it, churches, Boy Scouts, tribes, \nart groups, chambers of commerce, water conservancy districts, and \nhundreds of other very diverse nonprofit groups. In effect, it would \nmuzzle the free speech of millions of people. These groups are the same \ngroups that as elected officials we are supposed to be here to defend \nand represent. I see a clear difference, as many of my colleagues do, \nbetween the high-powered, well-financed professional lobbying firms, \nwho hire well-financed professional lobbyists, and the grassroots-based \ncommunity organizations. I think my colleagues see the difference too.\n  For the last couple of months the Senate has focused its efforts on \ngetting Government out of people's lives. Well, this provision would do \njust the opposite because it would tell the nonprofits how they could \nspend their private moneys. By law, these organizations cannot spend \nGovernment funds for lobbying activities, which I think makes sense.\n  What does not make any sense to me is that we are stepping in and \nlegislating how nonprofits can spend their privately raised funds on \nadvocacy efforts. It is wrong for us to do that. That is why I will \noffer a motion to strike title III. This provision is bad for our \ncommunities because it treats State and local organizations and their \nnational affiliates as one. This provision is bad because the \ndefinition of advocacy is too broad. This provision is bad because it \nhamstrings the many organizations that, with reduced Government, we \nwill have to rely on more heavily than ever to deliver services to our \ncommunities. It also is bad because this provision casts a net so wide \nit will muzzle political advocacy groups in our towns, our communities, \nin our States.\n  In short, it is bad language. The administration has already \nthreatened to veto it, as the Chair knows. I think it is important to \nsend a message to our constituents that we will not allow them to be \nsilenced. We want Government out of people's lives, but we do not want \nto keep people out of Government.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would move to strike title III of the \ncontinuing resolution, and send an amendment to the desk, and ask for \nthe yeas and nays after the motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator sending an amendment to the \ndesk?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerrey, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n     Glenn, proposes an amendment numbered 3045.\n       Strike Title III of the resolution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator request the yeas and nays on \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the Istook amendment before the Senate \ntoday presents a difficult issue because the principles fueling both \nsides of the debate have some merit.\n  On the one hand, organizations that are subsidized by the Federal \nGovernment should not be allowed to lobby the Government or engage in \nunlimited grassroots political activism. When highly subsidized \norganizations are actively participating in political activities, the \npublic perception is that taxpayer funds are being used for partisan \npurposes.\n  This perception if formed even if there are safeguards in place to \nprohibit the use of Federal funds for lobbying or political \ncampaigning.\n  On the other hand, our political process would suffer if nonprofit \ngroups were restrained from engaging in public debate. These \norganizations represent millions of Americans who do not have the time \nor ability to monitor day-to-day events in Congress or their State \nlegislatures, but want their interests to be represented on issues \nranging from environmental protection to the right to bear arms. To \nplace severe restrictions on the ability of these organizations to \nanalyze legislation, testify at public hearings, comment on pending \nregulations, and advocate their views in the political arena would not \nonly deprive policymakers of valuable expertise, but would leave many \nAmericans without an effective voice in the political process.\n  In my view, our Tax Code does a fairly good job of balancing these \ncompeting principles. Section 501(c)(3) of the Code allows taxpayers to \ndeduct contributions to charitable organizations. Since virtually all \nthe revenue of these 501(c)(3) organizations are federally subsidized \nthrough the Tax Code modest limitations are placed on the \norganizations' lobbying and grassroots activities. However, in \nrecognition of the important role that charitable organizations play in \nour society, they are allowed to comment on regulations that affect \nthem, join litigation that implicates their interests, and communicate \nwith their members on political issues without limitation.\n\n  The Simpson-Craig amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill made an important modification to the Tax Code. The amendment \napplies to tax-exempt nonprofit corporations, which, under section \n501(c)(4) of the Tax Code, are allowed to lobby without limitation. \nUnder the amendment, 501(c)(4) organizations with annual revenues in \nexcess of $10 million would no longer be permitted to both lobby \nwithout limitation and receive Federal grants. I support this change in \nthe law because I do not believe that large organizations engaged in \nsubstantial lobbying activities should be eligible to receive taxpayer \nfunds. If an organization wants to apply for Federal funding, it should \nbe required to submit to the restrictions on lobbying activities \ncontained in section 501(c)(3) of the Code.\n  The Istook amendment, however, would have a much more sweeping impact \non nonprofit organizations. It would affect every organization that \nreceives Federal grant money, as well as, organizations that believe \nthey may wish to apply for grants in the future. In addition, the \nIstook amendment places limits on a broad category of activities that \nhave never been regulated by the Federal Government before such as \nfiling an amicus brief, writing a letter to the editor, or providing \noffice space to an affiliate organization.\n  Most significant, the Istook amendment would impose a byzantine set \nof reporting requirements on nonprofit corporations. Each organization \nwould be required to establish separate accounts to keep track of how \nmuch money it spends on lobbying and political advocacy, since the \namendment imposes different monetary thresholds on each category of \nactivity. They would also be required to determine whether any \ncorporation or organization they do business with spends more than 15 \n\n[[Page S 16859]]\npercent of their funds on political advocacy, because, if so, any funds \ntransferred to such an organization counts toward the grantee's \nadvocacy threshold. Through this provision, the sponsors of the Istook \namendment have imposed a new recordkeeping requirement on virtually \nevery private corporation in the country.\n  The Istook amendment will cause many more problems than it would \nsolve. If there are nonprofit organizations that are abusing their tax \nstatus or misusing Federal grantees, adjustments to the Tax Code such \nas the Simpson-Craig proposal may be necessary. But there is no reason \nto impose such a restrictive and burdensome new law on a sector of \nsociety that does much good work and plays an important role in our \ndemocracy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as an American and a Member of the Senate \nof the United States of America, I have certain responsibilities \nregarding what I say here on the floor.\n  But unlike thinking individuals in most other societies throughout \nhuman history, I--uniquely in my role as a U.S. Senator--can come to \nthe Senate floor and speak my mind freely, and no one can stop me, or \nretaliate against me, so long as I follow the few rules of common \ncourtesy.\n  If we adopt the Istook language, other American citizens, not lucky \nenough to be Members of this august body, are going to be told they can \nno longer speak freely before their Government. The Istook amendment to \nrestrict advocacy, under consideration by the Senate will send this \nmessage loud and clear to every American citizen.\n  Well, almost every American citizen.\n  What the Istook amendment says is this: If you belong to a nonprofit \ngroup you will be restricted from lobbying Congress. If, however, you \nare a member of a Fortune 500 company or any other special interest \nconstituency with money, you will have no restrictions.\n  If you as a senior citizen join a group to receive services designed \nfor seniors like you, your Government has no problem with that, and \nmight even give your group a grant to do their important work.\n  But if part of what your group does is relay to your Senator your \nwish to keep pharmaceutical prices down, your Government is no longer \ngoing to allow that to happen.\n  If, however, you work for a large pharmaceutical company, you can \nlobby Congress like there's no tomorrow for your company's needs.\n  I believe most Americans have a problem with this. Over half of the \nMembers would argue with me, but I believe this Tuesday we heard at \nleast the first rumblings among Americans about what their Government \nis about to do to them. I believe when America wakes up, Members of \nthis Congress won't be able to shut out the free speech. We will hear \nfrom all of America loud and clear if this language becomes law.\n  Not since the days of McCarthyism has such an assault on the rights \nof free speech been considered. There are already protections in \nFederal law that restrict the use of Federal funds for lobbying \nactivities. There are already stiff penalties for breaking the rules. \nThere is no evidence that ladies from trailer parks in Middle America \nhave been misusing Federal funds to buy Congress.\n  And if there was evidence of such a crime, then the knitting circle \nwould be going up against the Internal Revenue Service of the United \nStates of America. That's under current law. Surely, there are few \ndeterrents stronger than the first-strike capabilities of our tax \nwatchdogs.\n  I would like us all to remember: People mostly join nonprofits to \nhelp other people. I would like us all to remember: If the current \nbudget cuts go through, people in this country are going to need a lot \nof help. And, I would like people to remember: If we do get information \nfrom a nonprofit group helping Americans at the grassroots, the \ninformation is coming from a place far closer to the needs of real \npeople than the halls of Washington, DC.\n  Most of the nonprofits I hear from give me good information from \npeople who cannot speak for themselves, and be heard 3,000 miles away. \nYes, I get calls and visits from citizens in my State, but I also \nrepresent people without plane fare, telephones, and some who don't \neven have a roof over their head. And now we're going to tell them they \ncan't even lobby Congress. That is not reform Mr. President, that is \nmuzzling the citizens I represent, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes \nfor the Campbell amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I earlier was presented substitute \nlanguage by the distinguished Senator from Wyoming and the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho. I would be willing to accept the \noriginal language that was on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. \nThis substitute language is not the same. Though it appears that it \nmight be relatively close, it is simply not the same.\n  I continue to argue, for those who are wrestling with this issue and \nit can be a difficult issue, I believe a sufficient reason to vote to \nstrike this should just be this does not belong on a continuing \nresolution. It does not belong on a continuing resolution. If I, as I \nindicated earlier, wanted to try to put all kinds of things on this \ncontinuing resolution, I could do so. As I said, I have interests in \nimpact aid; I have interest in agriculture; I have interest in a \nvariety of things that are unlikely to be addressed this year.\n  This amendment belongs on lobbying reform. But guess what, Mr. \nPresident? There is no vehicle in the House for lobbying reform, \nbecause they have not passed lobbying reform. They have not taken up \nthat issue. We took up that issue. It is a very contentious issue, a \nvery difficult issue. We passed lobbying reform that restricts \nlobbyists' access to Members of Congress. It passed this body. It was a \nlong and healthy debate, but the House has not taken it up. So all \ntheir conversation about ``we are going to clean up the lobbying \nactivity'' begs the question. If that is the case, where is your bill? \nThe answer is, they do not have one.\n  So they are putting lobbying reform on a continuing resolution \nbecause they have not taken the issue up on the other side. I think it \nis very important for Members of this side, regardless of how you feel \non this issue--you might support this language, you might feel this \nlanguage is good language and ought to be enacted into law, but not on \na continuing resolution, Mr. President, particularly in an environment \nwhere the House has not even taken up lobbying reform and this body \nhas. That is where it belongs. It is highly inappropriate for it to be \ntaken up here.\n  Next, the proponents of this amendment refer to grants given to \n501(c)(3)'s as welfare for lobbyists. Let us be clear on this, the law \nsays that lobbying activities are currently prohibited with the use of \ntaxpayer-funded grants. That is the law. That is the current law. And \nif somebody has an instance where they think a 501(c)(3)--a church or \nveterans group, YMCA, the Red Cross--if they think they are in \nviolation of the law, then they should bring a case against them. They \nshould come and say, ``This organization is using taxpayer money in \nviolation of the law.''\n  I say it for emphasis, citizens who say, ``You know, those House guys \nare right, we ought to change the law to make lobbying illegal with \npublic funds,'' as I say, the law already prohibits that activity. That \nis not what this amendment does, propose changes in the law. It says \nthat private money cannot be used. That is what it does. Let us be \nclear on that.\n  All conversations and statements that were made last night on the \nfloor saying, ``We don't want to subsidize lobbyists,'' Mr. President, \nA, if you House Members are excited about lobbying reform, why do you \nnot pass a bill? And, B, why do you not tell the American people that \nwe cannot subsidize lobbyists, you cannot use tax dollars for lobbying \nactivity?\n  If you have a church in mind, I say to the proponents on the House \nside, if there is a veterans group out there or somebody at your \ncommunity level that you think is flying back here to Washington trying \nto influence legislation, for gosh sakes, find somebody to file a \ncriminal charge against them, because it is illegal now.\n  The next thing I will say is it is odd this legislation is being \nproposed by people who are constantly talking \n\n[[Page S 16860]]\nabout decreasing regulation on the private sector. This increases \nregulation on the private sector. Again, once that is pointed out they \nsay, ``Oh, we have written in exemptions.'' Now we have exempted \nveterans organizations. We have raised the threshold so it only affects \na very small number. Mr. President, every 501(c)(3) would have to prove \nthey are in compliance. Everyone would, and they would have to keep \nrecords for 5 years to prove that they are in compliance.\n  For Members who are wondering on the substance of the issue, if you \ncan get over the threshold that this continuing resolution is an \nappropriate vehicle for lobbying reform, which I think is a pretty \nsubstantial hurdle to jump, if you can get over that hurdle and you \nsay, ``Fine, let's do lobbying reform on a continuing resolution,'' \nthen, first, be advised that use of public funds for lobbying is \nalready prohibited under law and, second, be advised that this law is \nserious business.\n  You are going to hear from people out there in the community that are \ngoing to come to you a year from now, 2 years from now and say, \n``Senator, did you have any idea of the paperwork I was going to have \nto fill out? Did you have any idea what you were doing?''\n  We get this all the time, whether it is leaking underground storage \ntanks or other regulations that we pass here that sound real good--\nclinical laboratory regulations--it all sounds terrific, but when the \nrubber meets the road out in the community, all of a sudden the \ncitizens comes to us saying, ``I just spent 100 hours on this thing. I \nhope you are getting something beneficial out of it, because I am \nspending a lot of time.''\n  For a 501(c)(3) out soliciting funds and typically today struggling \nto get that money, I daresay that increased cost of doing business at \nthe community level is a rather substantial burden, and we are going to \nhear about it. We are going to hear about it from citizens who are not \ngoing to like this change in the law.\n  Next, Mr. President, how many of us talk about public-private \npartnerships? How many of us, when we are talking about how to maximize \nand stretch and lengthen the use of our tax dollars, get up and say, \n``The Government cannot do it all''? I cannot take tax dollars and have \nthe Government doing it all. I have to develop partnerships, not just \nwith State government, local governments, but I have to get the private \nsector engaged. What better vehicle, what better opportunity than a \n501(c)(3)?\n  And, indeed, that is the case today. We are asking the Red Cross to \ndo more with their money. We are asking them to help us with disaster \nprograms. We are asking the YMCA and the YWCA and other 501(c)(3) \norganizations to get involved.\n  Mr. President, the real problem here is that some people do not like \nwhat these 501(c)(3)'s do. That is the problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a story that appeared in yesterday's \nWall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 8, 1995]\n\n  Consumer Groups Attack Bill Curbing Political Advocacy by Nonprofit \n                                 Groups\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Washington.--A Republican initiative to limit political \n     advocacy by nonprofit organizations is meeting strong \n     resistance from consumer groups, which accuse business \n     interests of using the bill to silence their critics on \n     regulatory issues.\n       The measure, which passed the House this summer, has drawn \n     an amalgam of conservative and industry supporters from the \n     Christian Coalition to the National Beer Wholesalers \n     Association. But yesterday, Mothers Against Drunk Driving \n     accused the beer lobby of using the bill to weaken and harass \n     its own efforts at the state level to tighten drinking laws.\n       The Beer Wholesalers group responded angrily that its \n     involvement has had nothing to do with MADD but was provoked \n     more by smaller, less-known advocacy groups that have \n     received federal grants. But MADD officials said it and the \n     beer wholesalers and their affiliates are frequent foes at \n     the state level, where MADD has sought legislation to tighten \n     blood-alcohol standards for judging when a driver is \n     intoxicated.\n       ``While MADD will be buried in an avalanche of red tape and \n     paperwork, the beer industry will be free to lobby to their \n     heart's content,'' said Katherine Prescott, MADD's national \n     president. ``The voice of the special interest will be \n     unimpeded, while the voices of the public interest will be \n     silenced.''\n       Yesterday's attacks, in which MADD was joined by such \n     groups as the American Lung Association, reflect a concerted \n     effort to reframe the debate by focusing on special interests \n     behind the GOP initiative. House Republicans, who last night \n     attached their proposal to a stopgap spending bill that will \n     be voted on today in the chamber, have championed the measure \n     as ``anti-welfare'' for lobbyists; the groups yesterday cast \n     the fight as one of public vs. private interests.\n       A variety of business organizations have been active in \n     support of the initiative. The chief sponsors include Reps. \n     David McIntosh (R., Ind.) and the Ernest Istook (R., Okla.), \n     who have taken the lead on antiregulatory legislation favored \n     by many of the same groups. The Beer Wholesalers, for \n     example, have promoted House-passed legislative riders to \n     block the Labor Department from developing new worker safety \n     rules affecting the industry. And in general, the group has \n     raised its profile this year in tandem with the rise of House \n     Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R., Texas). He is a leader of the \n     antiregulatory forces and chief proponent of the legislation \n     now to curb advocacy by non-profit organizations receiving \n     federal grants.\n       David Rehr, the Beer Wholesalers' vice president of \n     governmental affairs, assisted in Mr. Delay's race for the \n     leadership, for example. But not all those involved in the \n     fight have so welcomed the influence of business interests.\n       Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) has been Rep. Istook's Senate \n     counterpart in recent negotiations between the two chambers \n     aimed toward striking some compromise on the issue. During \n     one session, Mr. Simpson was apparently surprised to find \n     outside, private interests in the room during the talks. ``I \n     just told all of them to get the hell out,'' said Mr. Simpson \n     yesterday.\n       In a statement yesterday, the Beer Wholesalers group said \n     it shares with MADD ``a serious commitment to reduce drunk \n     driving and end illegal underage drinking'' and had supported \n     bills in Congress with that aim.\n       But at the state level, officials painted a more severe \n     picture. New Mexico was a major battleground two years ago \n     for legislation to curb drunken driving and tighten standards \n     for the blood alcohol content of drivers. ``MADD has been \n     four-square behind these efforts to toughen up the laws,'' \n     said Kay Roybal, press secretary for the state's attorney \n     general. ``The beer industry, and liquor industry more \n     generally, have consistently opposed all of these efforts.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the headline on this says, ``Consumer \nGroups Attack Bill Curbing Political Advocacy by Nonprofit Groups.'' It \npoints to a rather interesting confrontation with beer wholesalers and \nan organization called Mothers Against Drunk Driving. I know MADD well. \nI know this group called Mothers Against Drunk Driving. They are tough.\n  They come to the local level, the State level and they want these \nlaws changed. They will bring a victim in, somebody who is disabled, \nsomeone who was injured permanently as a consequence of a drunk driver, \nand they will say to you, ``Senator, I understand you just attended a \nfundraiser with the beer wholesalers, liquor distributors,'' so forth, \n``and they are telling you, ``Let the market take care of it.' I tell \nyou, Senator, the market is not taking care of it.''\n  We have changed our liquor laws in the State of Nebraska as a \nconsequence of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. They can be plenty \nirritating, let me tell you. They come with evidence and they come with \na proposed change, and it is darn hard to say no to them. Sometimes it \ncan have an impact upon your retail sales. It can change the behavior \nof people, as a consequence of the law being changed. But our streets \nare safer as a result, and our people are healthier as a consequence. \nIt has produced a constructive change.\n\n  So let there be no mistake about it. One of the things motivating \nthis proposed change in the law--particularly the feverish urgency that \nis attached, threatening to hold up the continuing resolution, \nthreatening to hold up an appropriations bill, and anything that is out \nthere. This was not in the Contract With America. If you want to do \nlobby reform, I say to the House, then pass it; pass lobbying reform. I \nquite agree that the people are sick and tired of watching lobbyists \nunnecessarily and unfairly influence the process around here. But if \nyou want to change that, Mr. President, pass lobbying reform, pass \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Senator McCain, Senator Thompson, and Senator Simpson, I believe, \nhave a piece of legislation to change campaign finance laws. Let us \nenact it and reduce the amount of money that can be spent in a \ncampaign. Let us provide an opportunity for more people to come to \n\n[[Page S 16861]]\nthe U.S. Congress. Let us get after the special interests so that \ncitizens can have confidence, in fact, that they will have some \ninfluence over this Government. One of the most alarming polls I have \nseen recently is a poll that showed that, by a 3-to-1 margin, people in \nthe United States believe that special interests have more power than \neither the President or the Congress. So there is a need to change, to \nempower Americans so that they feel more a part of the process.\n  There is a need to change our lobbying laws and to change our \ncampaign finance laws. We have to address those issues, Mr. President. \nThis body has dealt with lobbying reform. This body is trying to \ndevelop a bipartisan movement to change our campaign finance laws. \nThere is an urgency attached to it for the sake of representative \ndemocracy and people's confidence that they can have some influence \nover this. But not on a continuing resolution, Mr. President, and \ncertainly not in this form.\n  This does not give citizens more power; it gives them less power. \nThis does not tilt the balance of power in favor of the people, who are \nout there scratching around trying to organize these sorts of efforts. \nIt tilts it away from them. I do not know why--frankly, I have been on \n501(c)(3) boards, and I do not know why anybody, given the hurdles they \nhave, are out there raising money all the time and holding raffles and \nauctions and trying to generate enthusiasm--it is darned hard work, and \nyou sometimes scratch your head and wonder why citizens are willing to \ndo it, and then you thank God they are. All of us have seen these \norganizations perform miracles and do wonderful things out there with \nfamilies and young people in their communities.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand the vitriol attached to this \nlegislation, to the point to saying we are willing to shut down the \nGovernment, which is what some have said--as if we do not care if \nSocial Security checks are issued or if anything passes this body \nagain. We do not care if it was in the contract. We want to make this \nchange. We believe it is the most important change that can be made.\n  So, as I said, I was happy to accommodate the change that the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming proposed on the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. I said earlier, Mr. President--the Senator from \nWyoming was not on the floor at the time. He asked that we give this \nproposed substitute of his some reasonable consideration. I do not know \nthat I gave it reasonable consideration. I gave it consideration. I \nwould be pleased to accept the precise language that the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming had attached to the Treasury-Postal bill some 30 \ndays or so ago when that appropriations bill was taken up. But I \nsupport the motion to strike made by the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I hear very clear what my friend from \nNebraska is saying. I enjoy working with him. We proved up together on \nmany issues, and we will again because the tough ones are still out \nthere, like Social Security and Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement. \nWe seem to be the only ones who are willing to leap into that cauldron. \nBut it is because of my admiration for him in what he did on the \nentitlements commission--the bipartisan entitlements commission, \nchaired by the Senator from Nebraska and our fine friend, Jack Danforth \nof Missouri, that we know what we have to do. The American public, \nhopefully, will know, when we finish telling them, what they have to do \non those issues. So that is separate and apart from this.\n  Let me be as brief as possible. That is quite a difficult task in \nitself. But there really is not a need for a lengthy debate and, yet, \nwe must be aware of what we are doing here. I have been in the Senate a \ngood long time, since 1978, to be exact. My role for 10 years was to \nlearn how to count votes. If there were a motion to strike the language \nthat came from the House, there is a question in my mind that that \nwould carry. But in this situation, there is more to it than this.\n  We did some work here on this issue in the Senate. All of you were \npresent. The Senator from Michigan was involved in that debate. Many \nothers on both sides of the aisle also were. Questions arose: Who does \nthis affect? Does it affect the Red Cross? Does it affect the Boy \nScouts? Does it affect the Girl Scouts?\n  Let me share this with you, once again, until we have our eye on the \nrabbit. What I did was to affect only section 501(c)(4) corporations. \nThere are a lot of them. Some of them spend nothing much, and some \nspend a ton because if you are a 501(c)(4)--this is all I was ever \nspeaking of--you have the ability of unlimited lobbying. You can spend \nyourself to oblivion. You are able to lobby without monetary \nrestriction.\n  Now, some 501(c)(4)'s love that role and perform it beautifully. \nOthers simply have huge resources and revenues and seem to restrain \nthemselves somewhat. But 501(c)(4) is a corporation under the tax laws \nthat is ``nonprofit,'' if you will, in that sense, that can do \nunlimited lobbying. And so what we were saying was very simple: Any \n501(c)(4) that receives money from the Federal Government in the form \nof a grant, or anything of that nature, will not be allowed to lobby; \nor if a 501(c)(4) loves to lobby, then they will not get Federal money. \nThat was not directed at the AARP. I have had some interesting \ndiscussions with them, however, through months past. It was not \ndirected at them. It was directed at any corporation, any 501(c)(4), \nwhether it was the NRA, AARP, any other 501(c)(4) corporation in \nAmerica that chooses that particular title.\n  The reason they choose that title is to do what they do best, in many \nways, which is to lobby. It seemed incongruous that a corporation would \nthen receive money from the Federal Government, which would help them \nthen go lobby the Congress for more money for their members. That is \nexactly what some of them do. They lobby vigorously, and they will say, \n``We do not keep that, we do not get that money; that goes to the \ncitizens, to our members, to the good of society.'' But it also reduces \nthe amount of money they have to dig out of their own coffers to do \ntheir work. So we were saying if you want to play in the big time, you \nwant to be a 501(c)(4), and you get grant money from the Federal \nGovernment, you are not going to be able to lobby without \nrestriction. Then that passed here by a vote of 59-37, a good, strong, \nbipartisan vote.\n\n  Then we went forward into the usual procedures of legislating. It \nwent out in that fashion. As we began to try to compose our differences \nin the conference committee on Treasury and Postal--remember, this \nmeasure came up on the Treasury-Postal bill here when it went through \nthe House on the Labor Committee, that appropriation--Labor, Health, \nHuman Services.\n  So it ended up a little off center in the sense of jurisdiction. We \nagreed to try to resolve things there to make that limit, instead of \n$10 million, where it would apply to any organization, the original \nSimpson-Craig language, Senator Larry Craig and I, these are the \ncosponsors of this measure. That was the ban on C-4's which was above \n$10 million. That passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote. I did not \nhear any objection to that. Treasury-Postal was a unanimous vote, \nincluding the $10 million threshold.\n  Now, we are ready to bring that down to a $3 million threshold and \nsay that it does not apply to those under that figure. What occurred, \nthen, with the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich proposal--it was a very sweeping \nmeasure; there is not any question about that. Senator Craig and I \nworked with them and said this is going to be very difficult, if not \nimpossible, to pass in the Senate. They felt very, very strongly that \nthey should proceed. They did.\n  In that proposal that the three fine House Members prepared, there \nwas tremendous complexity. There was tremendous controversy. That was \nborne out again last night when the measure was discussed and debated \nin the House with regard to the continuing resolution. You can bet it \nwas contentious.\n  There is an amendment that I will shortly propose at some appropriate \ntime which would strike the lion's share of the language passed by the \nHouse known as the Istook amendment.\n  The language has been the subject of much, much controversy and \nexcitement here in Washington these past few weeks--editorial \ncommentary, opinion pages. It is something that the \n\n[[Page S 16862]]\nHouse Members feel very strongly about. I cannot identify how \npassionately they feel about it. I hear that. That is why I have tried \nto work with them.\n  I find staff--and Chuck Blahaus, my legislative director, has \ninvested innumerable hours of his day in this effort. Senator Larry \nCraig and his fine staff person have done the same. We have been \nactively, all of us, involved in negotiations with the House sponsors \nof it.\n  I know that much of what has been said about it is simply not true. \nNow is not the time nor the place to debate the fine points of that \namendment--the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich amendment. This amendment is too \ncomplex at this time, too cumbersome at this time, to subject to any \nlengthy debate here in the context of a continuing resolution. If it \nwere any other place, it would be highly appropriate. In fact, there is \na vehicle for it that is just built for it. That is lobbying reform, \nand lobbying reform will be up very shortly in the House of \nRepresentatives--I believe next week.\n  In the context of the continuing resolution, it is simply \ninappropriate and, more importantly, impossible to move the language \nthat has been worked on so hard by my colleagues and friends in the \nHouse.\n  It is precisely because of that complexity that this language, known \nas that amendment, will not pass the Senate. That is reality. The votes \nare not there. It would be a bipartisan vote to eliminate that.\n  I have spoken to many of my colleagues in the House and in the Senate \nabout the particulars of the language. I know their concerns. I know \ntheir hopes. I know their fears. I know their confusion about this \nlanguage.\n  This is a very, very sweeping and comprehensive piece of legislation. \nI can understand every single reason for every bit of it because of the \nfrustration and anguish of the political arena that gave rise to it in \nthe House. That deserves a full airing so that the American people can \nunderstand what some 501(c)(3)'s really do with their money and how \nthey get thoroughly involved in political activity. You can believe \nthey do. We will deal with that. It will be a very important part of \nlobbying reform.\n  In the context of the continuing resolution, not 100 percent of it \nwill come through, not 90 percent of it will come through, not 80 \npercent of it will come through. It is my intent to offer an amendment \nto strike out almost the entirety of it, leaving only a few components. \nThe amendment would strike out all of the House language and leave \nsimply the following:\n  It would leave the Craig-Simpson or Simpson-Craig ban for grant money \nfor the largest 501(c)(4) lobbying organizations. This provision passed \nthe Senate unanimously by voice vote. I would not think it would be \ncontroversial.\n  There would be a provision simply requiring that Federal grantees \nreport their expenses on lobbying activity and that this report be \npublicly available. Simple, short, and I think uncontroversial.\n  Finally, a provision mandating that the current law, 501(h), limits \non lobbying activities expenses apply to the Federal grantee \norganizations. Right now, under current law, the formula applies only \nto certain 501(c)(3) organizations. It would here apply to all of the \ngrantee organizations, except that there would be no global cap of $1 \nmillion, even though current law has such a cap. And we will detail how \nthat will be expanded. A cap is controversial so we would remove it as \nfar as grantees would be affected.\n  That is it. That is it. That is the measure as it would be dealt \nwith. If it were then to go back to the House, it would not go back \ninto conference. There would be no further conference activity with \nthis measure as it would leave the Senate. It would not come up on \nanother bill. It would not come up on Treasury-Postal. It can come up \nlater, but it would not come up under the Treasury-Postal bill, which \nis the other pending material floating in these last hours and days \nbefore we reach our statutory limit.\n  So I simply believe we regretfully have to strike all of the \nprovisions of this legislation which are controversial in the eyes of \nthe Senate. I could detail them all, but I think all of us know what \nthey are. Some have been magnificently distorted by groups that have \nlearned to love Federal largess as they do their lobbying work.\n  Those things will be debated at length here in private and in public. \nWe will not settle those issues today. The Senate will not come to \nagreement on what kinds of reforms to make in this area today. They \nwill not be settled in the context of the CR. This is reality. It is \nnot the invention of Senator Simpson. It is not the invention of \nSenator Larry Craig.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at the text of our amendment closely \nand will give their full support. There are no tricks, nothing up the \nsleeve as to getting it before you. It is extended as an effort to try \nto resolve a very vexatious issue and try to recognize clearly the fine \nwork of three able Congresspersons in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3046\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Wyoming very \n\n\n[[Page S 16863]]\ncarefully about all the reasons why the so-called Istook amendment \nshould not be before us on the continuing resolution. The problem is, \nit is before us on the continuing resolution and it is a big problem. \nWe ought to dispose of this amendment by striking it. I very much \nsupport the amendment of Senator Campbell.\n  The Istook language is the most intrusive intervention of Government \ninto the free speech rights of private organizations that I have ever \nseen in my 17 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  We have talked a lot recently about trying to reduce the Federal \nGovernment intervention in the lives of private people and private \norganizations. This amendment, this Istook language, represents a \nmassive intervention into rights, under the first amendment, of private \norganizations to use private money--I emphasize private money, not \nGovernment money--for political expression.\n  It has been characterized as being aimed at welfare for lobbying. It \nhas nothing to do with lobbying reform. I know about lobby reform. I \nwas a sponsor, along with a number of others in this body, of lobbying \nreform legislation. The Istook language is not anything to do with \nlobbying reform. It has everything to do with placing restrictions on \nrights of citizens of this country to use their own funds to express \ntheir own political views, not just to this Congress and not just to \nthe Federal Government, but to the State and local governments as well.\n  This is an unprecedented intrusion, for reasons I will get into in a \nmoment. What the Istook language does is place a limit on what \npercentage of funds can be used by a private entity, if that entity is \neither the recipient of a Federal grant or, indeed, may be a recipient \nin the future of a Federal grant--because there is a throwback of 5 \nyears. Anybody applying for a Federal grant cannot have used more than \na fixed percentage of its own private funds for political advocacy in \nthe previous 5 years.\n  So, even though you do not have a Federal grant, if you think maybe \nin the next 5 years you might want to apply for a Federal grant, you \nhave to watch how much of your own privately raised funds are going to \nexpress your own political opinion during that 5-year period.\n  Then there is this percentage cap that is placed on grantees. Mind \nyou, it is not placed on people who are seeking to sell the Government \nB-2 bombers. They can spend all of their own funds, otherwise raised, \non lobbying, that they want. The restriction here is on nonprofits.\n  So, if the Cancer Society or the Alzheimer's Society or the Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving or any of the other nonprofits apply for a grant \nor are the recipients of a grant, they are restricted even though they \nare not using grant funds for lobbying. They cannot come to the \nCongress and lobby us for legislation to try to reduce the number of \ndrunk drivers on the road or the purity of our drug supply, or of our \nblood supply. They cannot come and do that, even with their own funds.\n  But there is no restriction on contractors receiving public funds. If \nyou want to come and sell B-2 bombers to the U.S. Government there is \nno restriction on you. But if you were providing a service to the U.S. \nGovernment such as getting a grant to deliver lunches to seniors or \ngetting a grant in order to provide a reduction in the number of drunk \ndrivers that we face out on the road, or a whole host of other things \nthat we obtained through our grants--then the restrictions apply to \nyou. That is a distinction which does not make any sense to begin with.\n  And it goes way beyond that. Because, not only are you restricted in \nthe percentage of your expenditures that you can spend on political \nadvocacy, not only does this go back 5 years before you ever got a \ngrant, but what is also counted in this is if you purchase something \nfrom another entity which spends more than 15 percent of its funds on \npolitical advocacy. Let us just think through the massive intrusion in \nthat one. You have the American Cancer Society. It obviously cares \nabout health care reform. It cares about research dollars for cancer. \nBut it is told it cannot use its non-Federal funds beyond a certain \nlimit for that. And what counts against that limit is not only the \nfunds that it spends on advocacy, what counts against that limit is the \nmoney in excess of 15 percent that any people it purchases anything \nfrom spend on political advocacy.\n  Now the American Cancer Society wants to buy a new computer. They are \nthinking maybe they will buy an IBM computer, let us say. They have to \ncheck with that vendor under this language to find out if that vendor, \nIBM, has spent in the preceding year more than 15 percent of its \nexpenditures on political advocacy. Nobody can comply with this kind of \nmonstrous paperwork requirement. And nobody in their right mind can \never apply for a Federal grant under this requirement because they have \nto certify to the U.S. Government that not only have they not in the \nlast 5 years spent more than 5 percent, but they would have to check \nwhat moneys were spent by everybody it bought anything from in the last \nyear to make sure that its suppliers--people that it bought its \nhardware from, its office supplies from, and its electricity from, I \nassume too--to make sure that they did not go over the 15-percent \nlevel.\n  I cannot think of anything this intrusive which has been seriously \nproposed to this Congress during the 17 years that I have been here. I \nhave gone back. I have looked to see if anything comes close to do \nthis, and it does not.\n  Why do I refer to the 15-percent rule? Because under the definition \nof political advocacy, it says that ``political advocacy includes \ndisbursing any monetary support to any organization whose expenditures \nfor political advocacy for the previous Federal fiscal year exceeded 15 \npercent of its total expenditures.'' That is what it says. If you spend \nmoney, and provide money to any organization that is for the purchase \nof supplies, you have to check out that organization's contributions to \npolitical advocacy.\n  The person or the entity that has a Federal grant--or that is \napplying for a Federal grant--not only has to certify that these limits \nhave not been exceeded, but it has to do so by clear and convincing \nevidence. Preponderance of the evidence here is not enough, folks. This \nis clear and convincing evidence. That is subsection 301(b)(1)(c)--\nclear and convincing evidence. That is the certification. And any \ntaxpayer can take you to court, too, not just the Government, under \nthis legislation as proposed. Under the Istook language, any taxpayer \ncan stand to take any grantee to court who has made such a \ncertification.\n  That is the kind of extreme measure that is before us in this \nlanguage.\n  Does it have any place in the continuing resolution? No. It does not. \nDoes it have any place in any other legislation? No. It does not. It \ndoes not have any place in a country which relishes its first amendment \nand its free speech right. It does not have any place in a democracy.\n  We should not place this kind of restriction on people who are using \ntheir own funds to lobby their own Government. I want to emphasize this \npoint. We have a law already which prohibits the use of Federal grant \nfunds to lobby, and we should. We should not be using taxpayers' funds \nto lobby. People though should not be limited in the way they are in \nthis language as to how they are going to use their own privately \nraised funds in terms of their own political expression.\n  We have received a lot of letters, as I am sure everybody else has, \non this issue. I would like to read some excerpts from just a few of \nthese letters.\n  The first one is dated November 2, and goes to Speaker Gingrich and \nMajority Leader Dole. This letter comes from the Adventists, from the \nAmerican Jewish Conference, from the Church World Service, from \nCatholic Charities, from the National Council of Churches of Christ in \nthe United States, National Council of Jewish Women, the Archdiocese of \nPhiladelphia, the Council of Jewish Federations, the Lutheran World \nRelief Network, the Presbyterian Church, and World Vision. This is what \nthey say about the Istook language:\n\n       We strongly believe that advocacy on behalf of justice and \n     the common good are an important part of our calling in the \n     world, and an important part of this Nation's democratic \n     tradition. Do not allow this Congress to establish a \n     dangerous precedent by restricting both our imperative to \n     service and our Nation's traditional respect for a variety of \n     viewpoints. Do not allow Congress to tie our hands or stifle \n     our voices.\n\n\n[[Page S 16864]]\n\n  The American Baptist Churches wrote the following:\n\n       By expanding the Federal funds restriction to include \n     private funds and broadening the definition of advocacy, the \n     Istook amendment would severely limit the extent to which \n     nonprofits can speak on public policy issues. The amendment \n     would require the Federal Government to monitor political \n     activity and would threaten the freedom of expression \n     protected by the first amendment.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we are going to strike the Istook \nlanguage. Again, it has no place on this continuing resolution. It is \ninappropriate on this continuing resolution. I believe it should not be \npassed on any vehicle, and should not be passed standing on its own \nbecause it represents such a massive intrusion on the rights of \ncitizens of this country using their own privately raised funds to \nexpress themselves.\n  Last year, a question was raised on the lobby reform bill which was a \nlobby reform bill. It had to do with paid professional lobbyists, and \nmaking certain that those who are professional lobbyists register and \ndisclose how much money they are being paid by whom to lobby Congress \nand the executive branch. There was language in that bill which some \nargued might have a chilling effect on grassroots lobbying. That \nlanguage was stricken, although many of us felt it did not have that \neffect at all. Nonetheless, it was stricken from the bill which we have \nrecently passed. That language pales by comparison to this language. On \na scale of 1 to 100, in terms of the chilling effect on first amendment \nrights and political advocacy, that language was a 1. This language is \n100.\n  I doubt very much that this language could possibly pass \nconstitutional muster, if it were tested in a court, because of its \nrestrictions on the rights of private entities relative to the use of \ntheir own funds. But whether it ever got that far is what we are going \nto decide today. In the first instance, what we are going to do is \ndecide whether or not we want this restriction, this kind of a massive \nintrusion on the rights, this kind of a monstrous bureaucratic \npaperwork requirement, or whether we want this to go any further. That \nis our job. This should never get to a court because this should never \nget past the Senate of the United States which has shown on a \nbipartisan basis over the years tremendous respect for the first \namendment to the Constitution.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The amendment that has been offered by \nthe Senator from Colorado is a bipartisan amendment to strike this \nlanguage. There is going to be strong support to strike the Istook \nlanguage on both sides of this aisle. And what that reflects is the \nhistoric reality of this Senate, that this Senate is, has been, and I \nhope always will be a strong bastion in the defense of the rights of \nfree speech and political expression.\n  Mr. President, I hope we adopt the Campbell amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I hope that everyone hears that. That was magnificent \nwork by my friend from Michigan, and he is addressing the language that \nI am striking. Everything the Senator from Michigan has said is what I \nhave taken out. He has debated the Istook amendment, and we have \nstripped that. This is startling to me, because there is not anyone \nmore adroit in this body than my old friend from Michigan, who came \nhere when I did. Every single bit of the debate in these last minutes \nby the Senator from Michigan has addressed the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich \namendment, and I and Senator Craig have struck it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if my friend from Wyoming will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Indeed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Has the language yet been stricken?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. There is a motion to strike. The motion to strike is \namended by the series of amendments to fill the tree, as the Senator \nknows, of the Senator from Idaho and myself, to strike completely the \nIstook amendment and leave only behind something that passed here \nunanimously by voice vote, passed the Senate unanimously. It was called \na restriction on 501(c)(4), and it had to do with a 501(c)(4) receiving \nFederal grants. And if they received Federal grants, they could not do \nunlimited lobbying. That passed here unanimously.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will my dear friend from Wyoming answer another question?\n  I gather the answer to the first question is that the language is \nstill in the bill before us and has not yet been stricken, but that \nunder both the Campbell amendment and under the Simpson amendment the \nIstook language would be stricken?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Under the Simpson amendment, which would come to the \nattention of the Senate first, the Istook language would be stricken, \nif it passes the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if my friend will yield for another question.\n  Does the language being offered by the Senator from Wyoming go beyond \nthe language previously adopted by the Senate or is it precisely the \nsame as the previous language?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It has this additional matter. It retains fully the \nSimpson-Craig, or Craig-Simpson ban on grants to large 501(c)(4)'s. The \ndefinitions section has no expansion whatsoever, but it defines \nlobbying activities as passed by the Senate, in the lobbying reform \nbill of which the Senator from Michigan was very instrumental, and, of \ncourse, adds the definition of ``grant'' in that section. And then \nthere is a reporting requirement.\n  These are the only things added, so I want the Senator from Michigan \nto know--a bare-bones reporting requirement, which is that grantees \nmust simply say whether they spent less than $25,000 on lobbying \nactivities or estimate the amount if they spent more, and finally it \nalso applies the 501(h) formula for lobbying to Federal grantees, not \njust 501(c)(3)'s, and that is it.\n  It also says that if you will--I know the Senator from Michigan well. \nWe want to remember that these groups, some of them, are huge. One of \nthem is a $5.5 billion operation. They filed their returns, and they \nare not public. And we are saying that those returns will be public--\n501(c)(4)'s only. That is what this amendment does. That is all that it \ndoes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my friend again will yield, and I thank him for the \nanswer, these are significant differences between what the Senator is \noffering today and what the Senate has previously considered and for no \nother reason than the language being offered today by my good friend \nfrom Wyoming covers all Federal grantees whereas the previous language \ndid not.\n  Without getting into the complexities or the details of it --and this \nis a 17-page amendment that the Senator has filed--I do not think that \nthe continuing resolution is a place for the Senate to be moving into \nsignificant new ground relative to a very important area, which is the \nfree speech, first amendment rights of organizations. This comes as \nadditional new matter, different from what has previously been adopted \nby the Senate in the ways that my friend from Wyoming has just \ndescribed, but those are significant differences because this would \napply to all Federal grantees, this language, whereas the language \npreviously adopted by the Senate did not.\n  So I do not think this is the place to be debating and considering \nand deliberating on an amendment which has this kind of major \ndifferences from previously adopted language.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is very important to hear this. Most \nof the 17 pages of definitions the Senator speaks of are the Senator's \ncreation. These are definitions taken from Senator Levin's lobbying \nreform bill and maybe two or three paragraphs of the substance--nothing \ndramatic.\n  We are not talking about the first amendment, I submit to my friend. \nWe are not talking about the chilling effect. We are talking about \nresponsibility, and what is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment in handing out grants to groups that then use the money to \nlobby the Federal Government for more money--using Federal money for \nthat purpose, and that we ought not to have public moneys administered \nby political organizations in some cases, and that is exactly what this \nis about. It is not about the first amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Is the Senator suggesting that these organizations have used Federal \ngrant \n\n[[Page S 16865]]\nmoney to lobby the Federal Government despite the fact that the law \nprohibits the use of Federal grant money for that purpose?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. If I might direct my comments through the Chair, I say \nto the Senator, it must be evident to many that these groups get \nFederal money, and then they lobby us for more Federal money, for \nMedicare, Medicaid--you name it--Social Security. That is what they do. \nAnd as 501(c)(4)'s, they have unlimited ability to lobby and unlimited \namounts of money to spend in that process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, is he suggesting that those \norganizations are using Federal grant money for that purpose in \nviolation of existing law which prohibits the use of Federal grant \nmoney?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Under current law, the groups can count Federal money \ntoward allowed expenses for lobbying.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question to my good friend is, is the Senator from \nWyoming suggesting that Federal grant money, which is given to an \norganization, for instance, to provide a cleaner blood supply or to \nprovide lunches in a neighborhood or whatever the grant is for, is my \nfriend from Wyoming suggesting that that Federal grant money is being \nused for lobbying purposes despite the current law that prohibits \nFederal grant money from being used in that way?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I would say to my friend from Michigan, a 501(c)(3)--and \nthat is what most of these are, that do good works out in the land--can \nspend more on lobbying if they get grant money. So we are not talking \nabout those that serve the commonweal. We are talking about groups that \ncome in before us in our offices and say we want to see more money for \nthis program or that program or that program or that program. If they \nget Federal money, it frees up, it frees up--it is fungible, and they \ncan go out and use more to do their lobbying after they offset \nthat. Some have said, ``Well, if you take away the Federal money, we'll \nbe able to do less for people.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. My final question, if my friend would yield for an \nadditional question, is, one of the key changes that is being proposed \nhere that has not been adopted by the Senate, as I understand it, is \nthat for the first time restrictions would be applied to any \norganization--or these additional restrictions would be applied to \nFederal grantees who are receiving, in the aggregate, grants of more \nthan $125,000. That is an additional group that would be covered here \nthat was not previously covered. Is that correct? That is the section \n301(a) on page 1. That is new language?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is the language that has to be identified from your \nprevious legislation and the language of the two or three paragraphs of \nsubstantive legislation. Under that section we are applying to Federal \ngrantees what is currently applied to 501(c)(3).\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is new language, not previously in the Senator's----\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is described in that way, yes. As I say, we are \ngoing to apply to all Federal grantees what is currently applied to \n501(c)(3).\n  I would now yield to my friend from Idaho, who has been absolutely \nsuperb in assistance with this matter, and I commend him greatly.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues here in the \nSenate are listening to the debate and the colloquies that are going on \nat this moment on this very, very important issue. For if one is to \nassume that after we deal with the amendments offered by my colleague \nfrom Wyoming and my second-degree amendment and a third or a fourth, or \nfilling up the tree, we are debating the whole McIntosh issue, that \nwould be an inaccurate assumption.\n  We are returning to the language that the Senate has already voted on \nunanimously. And, as the Senator from Michigan has appropriately \npointed out, there are some slight adjustments in it. But those slight \nadjustments are something that are not first amendment issues, not in \nany sense of the word. When it comes to spending Federal dollars, that \nis not a first amendment issue, never has been, most assuredly never \nwill be.\n  Thomas Jefferson made that very clear to us in many of his writings \nwhen he said that, ``No man should be lobbied with his own tax \ndollar.'' What we are saying here is very clear. We are simply taking \nthe Internal Revenue Code rules, the lobbying of nonprofit charitables, \nthe 501(c)(3) groups, and make that formula a little more generous and \napply it to all organizations that do both lobbying and receive grants.\n  The Senator from Michigan is absolutely right, the threshold is \n$125,000. But then what we say is there is a formula of a sliding scale \nthat is simple and very easy to understand until you arrive at a \ncertain level, and beyond that you can take that first million that you \ncan lobby with, and if you are above the $17 million, then you apply 1 \npercent, and if you stay within those categories, you report.\n  I believe the taxpayers of this country have a right to know how \ntheir money is being spent. And it is not, nor was it ever, the intent \nof the Senator from Wyoming or the Senator from Idaho, who joined with \nhim in the original Simpson-Craig amendments on the floor that all of \nus unanimously supported, that we would stifle anybody's right to speak \nor to express their concern.\n  But we also said something very clearly. What are you going to be? \nAre you going to be a lobbying organization or are you going to be an \norganization that takes grants and applies them for the meaningful \npurpose for which they are given? You cannot be dominantly both, nor \nshould you be under the law, because you are given a very special tax-\nexempt status to do certain things.\n  If you are taking grants, for whatever purpose they are allowed, you \nare given that opportunity. But if you have decided to lobby with it to \ngenerate more money, to do exactly what the Senator from Michigan knows \ncan be done--and the term is called fungibility--then you can get \nincreasingly larger and larger and larger to lobby a specific point of \nview.\n  I will not suggest that our colleagues in the House went too far in \none form or another. But I will agree that some of those organizations \nthat the Senator from Michigan mentions--or I might agree--ought not to \nplay by these rules--they clearly are the charitables of our country \nthat have served this country and its interested parties well--ought \nnot have these kinds of restrictions. That is what this Senate \nrecognized. That is why we have come back to change the language in \nthis continuing resolution to deal with it as we had originally \nattempted to deal with it here in the Senate, because I think all of us \nrecognize that it is time that we do a course correction, and that is, \nfrankly, all that these amendments are, is a course correction from \nthose very large multihundred million dollar organizations that have \nbecome very powerful in their skillful use of Federal grant dollars for \ntheir specific and very directed interests.\n  All we are saying to them is that there is going to be a criteria \nfrom now on, and we are going to apply the 501(c)(3) formula with a \ngreater generosity to the 501(c)(4)'s. They have been misled, I think, \nstampeded by Washington special interests into suggesting that we are \ndoing something tragic, different.\n  You have to remember, those who are lobbying against this have a \nspecial interest. Their special interest is access through the grant \nprocess to the Federal Treasury. And we are saying to them, ``You can \nstill have access because many of you do very worthwhile things. But \nwhat you cannot have is a free and open rein to lobby unless you meet \ncertain criteria.'' We think that is important.\n  Why should we use tax dollars to lobby to get more tax dollars to \nlobby to get more tax dollars to get larger and larger and more \npowerful and powerful for political purposes, in some instances, \ninstead of to meet the needs of the grants as we originally saw them? \nAnd as the activities of Government suggested, these agencies in a \nquasi-private manner could better administer them. That is what we \nwanted. And that is what has been our intent all along.\n  But what the Congress has failed to do over the last decade is take a \nserious look at how some organizations have recognized the unique \nability to \n\n[[Page S 16866]]\nmisuse the IRS Code for their particular advantage. And, frankly, we \nthink that is just wrong. We want to adhere to the simple approach to \ndeal with the larger organizations that we felt it was necessary to \ndeal with.\n  Those who do not lobby do not have a problem. Their first amendment \nrights in the use of their own dollars are not questioned. Those who do \nlobby and take $125,000 or more of grant dollars have to adhere to a \nreporting process and a percentage of limitation. And they can choose \nto do that. Many organizations already have because they did not want \nto violate the rules or they did not want to misuse the congressional \nintent of that particular area of the IRS Code.\n  That is why the legislation was before us. That is why Senator \nSimpson and I have come back to amend the language in this CR because \nwe understand what the Senator said. We can count votes. And we thought \nit was important that we deal at least with this segment of the code \nand the particular organizations that identify with that segment of the \ncode.\n  I think most groups----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, my question is this: Apparently there \nseems to be agreement--I certainly concur in that--that the language \nthat came over from the House is not acceptable. Now, it seems to me we \nought to leave well enough alone, take it out, strike it. It has to go \nback to the House, and then we go on with our business when it comes \nback from the House. Hopefully, it would be without that language. And \nthen we could proceed with the passage of the continuing resolution.\n  What the distinguished Senator from Idaho and the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming are proposing is that in lieu of the language that \nwas objectionable in the House, that we insert other language. Now, it \nis my understanding, having listened to the debate, that this language \nis not exactly the same as the so-called Simpson language that was \nadopted unanimously by voice vote.\n  There are variations to it. What they are, I am not sure. But my \nquestion to the Senator from Idaho is as follows: Why are we doing \nthis? Why get involved at this point, when we are trying to pass a \ncontinuing resolution, with an extraneous bill that the Senators \nindicate is extremely popular and, if so, it ought to be able to pass \non its own.\n  Why bog down this legislation with that and tie us up in something as \nwe are, as I understand it, near unanimity that we do not want the \nlanguage that came out from the House?\n  So let us strike it and go on with a clean CR. Frankly, I am in favor \nof a clean continuing resolution. All of us can think of nice things \nthat ought to be added on it. Why, we can do something about Social \nSecurity for the senior citizens being able to earn more money----\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I respond to the Senator's question? I reclaim my time \nfor the purpose of responding to the question. The Senator makes a good \npoint, and I am not going to try to dispute him on his logic. He and I \nmay disagree on clean CR's and the use of vehicles like CR's to move \nlegislation, but the fact is, the House did act, and they acted by \nputting in the McIntosh-Istook language.\n  If we strike it, will they agree to that? I do not know. What I do \nbelieve they might agree to is the fact that we have changed their \nlanguage to conform to the language that the Senate voted on by a \nunanimous vote with some very slight changes that we have already \nexpressed to the Senators that are not changes in the intent. They \nclearly are clarifying provisions, the kind Senator Chafee and others \nspoke of with some concern in the earlier legislation.\n  I think we stand a greater chance of moving the CR and the House \naccepting it as we send it back to them with the amendments provided by \nthe Senator from Wyoming and myself to clarify this issue, for we at \nleast address it. The House has addressed it. They spoke to it last \nnight, and I am not at all convinced that if we send back a clean CR \nwith this stricken from it that we can deal with it in that manner. \nThat is why we came with this approach. We think it is important, and \nit does conform with the Senate's wishes earlier expressed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, my own view----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I hold the time, thank you very much. I \nwill simply yield the floor at this point. I made my points. I know the \nSenator wishes to speak. At the moment, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, my own view on this is, if after long, \ncontinuous debate--and I do not know when it will be we finally get to \nvote, whether the Simpson language is included or not, I do not know--\nbut my own belief is, if it is included and goes back over there, it \nwill be a slice of salami. Then they will come back with some \nvariations to it, and back and forth we go with the House in deciding \njust how far we want to go.\n  They have staked out a big measure. Instead of us saying ``No, we \ndon't want any part of it, we will take that up at another time,'' it \nis very popular here, we can do our version any time we want, we will \ndo that within the next several weeks, we send this back with the \nvariations, as the distinguished Senator from Idaho and the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming have proposed, then back it comes \nwith a small alteration, and on and on it goes. I think it is a \nmistake, Mr. President.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let us be very clear here, that will not \nhappen. The House leadership told us, and I hold it not in any sense a \ndirective or anything else, but the House leadership has told us \nwhatever comes out of here in the form of the Craig-Simpson amendment \nwill be acceptable to the House. There will be no slicing of salami. \nThere will be no slicing of anything.\n  In addition, that measure will not come up on Treasury-Postal. That \nis a critical thing. We cannot continue to delay the program because \ncertain people have certain things they want. But there are certain \nthings that are critical, not in the eyes of three Members of the \nHouse, but by the entire House, or at least a majority of the House. So \nthat is why we have altered--altered?--we have slashed the measure to \nshreds and leave now the basic element of what we did in the Senate \nunanimously and the issue of the 501(h), which is a minimal, \ntremendously minimal requirement.\n  This is not going to go back into the grinder. It is not going to \ncome forward. But if you are looking for clarity and simplicity and \nspeed, I can tell you, it will not come with a motion to strike, \nbecause the motion to strike will create a most horrendous reaction in \nthe House which, again, is destructive of the process.\n  So we are trying to get a crumb when we cannot get a loaf, and all of \nus who legislate know that. This is not any dramatic thing. The \nprincipal substance of it passed here on a voice vote, so it cannot be \nthat bad.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that point, on that issue for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Both the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Idaho \nsaid there is a slight difference. There are significant differences. \nTo put the question in the form of a question: Can the Senator from \nWyoming tell us what percentage of current Federal grantees, \napproximately, would be covered by the new language where there is at \nleast three significant changes from the old Simpson language? What \npercentage of Federal grantees would be covered by the new language in \ncertification requirements and reporting requirements that were not \ncovered by the original Simpson language?\n  For instance, would this double the number of grantees that are \ncovered by certification and paperwork requirements? Would it triple \nit? Quadruple it? What are called slight differences here I think, \nindeed, are major differences. Can the Senator give us approximately \nwhat multiple of Federal grantees would be brought into this net for \nthe first time?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am presented with figures, and \nremember, \n\n[[Page S 16867]]\ntoo, that not a single 501(c)(3) is, by our figures, spending more than \n$1 million on lobbying. Not one. Not one single 501(c)(3) is spending, \naccording to our records, more than $1 million on lobbying, and that is \nmost of the grantees. So I think----\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield for a follow-on to that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we can get the answer to that question, \nbecause I included reporting requirements, paperwork requirements. If \nthe Senator can tell us what percentage, what multiple of Federal \ngrantees would be covered by the paperwork and certification and \nreporting requirements that were covered under the original Simpson \nlanguage, is it twice as many, three times as many? About what \npercentage more?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have no ability to discern that. The \npaperwork requirement, however, if we can get this in perspective, is \nabout less than an I-9 form that you would furnish with Immigration. It \nrequires ID, name and amount spent on lobbying.\n  So it is not something they are going to have to hire a battalion of \naccountants to do or management officials. It is name, amount spent.\n  I can only tell you, I hope some of you will begin to look at some of \nthe forms that the nonprofits file. Some of them are huge. Often the \nbigger the nonprofit in the (c)(4) area, the more they are done in \nhandwriting. They are not typed, because if you do it in handwriting, \nit makes you look like one of the little guys. So you do it in \nhandwriting, and you can almost miss the commas.\n  I cite on that one, on the 501(c)(4), the AARP. Their huge report, \nwhere they report $314 million in the bank in T-bills, where they get \n$106 million a year from Prudential life insurance, getting 3 percent \nof every premium, where they have $26 million in yield on their \ninvestments, where they get money from New York Life, Scudder-Stevens, \nRV Insurance, and all the rest, and get $86 million from the Federal \nGovernment. I think any group that can do that and can lease their \ndowntown headquarters for $17 million a year on a 20-year lease, while \nthey are raising bucks from the little people for $8 a pop, do not need \nFederal funding to do unlimited lobbying.\n\n  These are the (c)(4)'s. That is who I was after when I started. And \ntheir report is done by, I think, ``Edna the Enforcer,'' down in some \nbasement in California. It is written in commas--you cannot tell. You \nare not to disclose that to anyone. I had to search out that form. And \nthis is a nonprofit organization. I had to search that out. When I \nreceived it--and I kept my promise--they said, ``We do not want anyone \nto have access to this, or the public, to see this report.'' Got that? \nThis does say that, from then on, this will be presented to the public. \nThat is a change in this procedure, in the reporting requirement. They \ndo not have to talk about where they spent it or who gave it to them--\njust a total amount spent; the total amount expended, which they are \nalready entrusted, I think, to keep track of. We are not giving them a \nnew item to keep track of. We are using current law definitions for \nlobbying expenses. I hope that might answer the question. At least that \nis the intent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, under what law are all Federal \ngrantees required to keep track of all their expenditures so they can \ndetermine how much spending on lobbying there is. This covers all \ngrantees. You are not limiting this the way it was before. I wonder \nwhether the law requires all grantees to keep track, as the Senator \njust said, of how much money they are spending and what percentage of \ndollars is spent on lobbying, of their own funds. We are talking about \ntheir own funds.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Currently, I simply say, Mr. President, all grantees do \nnot, and we think they should.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is a new requirement?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I explained that fully when we started, that there would \nbe a reporting requirement. I said that when I began the debate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to my friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator for yielding. I \nwould like to address the question the Senator from Michigan just spoke \nto.\n  All organizations keep books. All organizations have to report to the \nIRS. We are not asking that they do anything differently. We say that \nif you meet certain criteria, you have to make a certain amount of \ndecisions.\n  Mr. President, $39 billion worth of tax money goes out in grants \nevery year. You mean you are saying that you do not want the taxpayers \nof this country to have a right to have accountability for that money? \nAbsolutely, we do. And we do. The 501(c)(3)'s are accountable, and they \nreport. That is a very large chunk of the money. So, right now, the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Idaho are saying that it is \nOK under the law, under the IRS Code, for 98 percent of everybody to \nplay by the rules and file the forms. That is what we are saying, is \nthat not?\n  Now we are talking about a window which several billion dollars \nslides through, in which there is no accountability. Why should those \nwho do not account today not be under the same rules as the 98 percent \nwho do? You and I both understand that giving the privilege of tax \nexempt in this society is a very large Federal subsidy. That is a \nunique privilege. All we are saying is, to retain that privilege, to do \nthe special things that you should be wanting to do under your \norganization, we are saying that these are the requirements, which are \nvery limited, and 98 percent play by those rules; why not the other 2 \npercent?\n  Mr. KERREY. Parliamentary inquiry. Did the Senator from Wyoming yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yielded to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield back to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I yielded the floor to my friend from Idaho. I am glad \nto yield for a question and have a spirited debate.\n  Let me, if I can, read the language as to what is required. It is \nvery short. Here is what we are requiring of people who get money from \nthe Federal Government. We call them ``taxpayer-subsidized grantees.'' \nIt may not be a term of art, but that is what we call them. They get \nmoney from the Federal Government. They use the money to go out and do \nthings with it--lots of times, trying to get more money from the \nFederal Government for things they strongly believe in. Here is what we \nwould require of them. It is on page 16 of this amendment. We require--\n       . . . a statement that the taxpayer-subsidized grantee \n     spent less than $25,000 on lobbying activity in the grantee's \n     most recent taxable year, or the amount or value of the \n     taxpayer-subsidized grant, including all administrative and \n     overhead costs awarded, a good faith estimate of the \n     grantee's actual expenses on lobbying activities in the most \n     recent taxable year, and a good-faith estimate of the \n     grantee's allowed expenses on lobbying activities under \n     section 301 of this act.\n\n  That is all the reporting there is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if my friend will yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Office of Management and Budget wrote the following:\n\n       We have looked for any evidence regarding violations of \n     prohibitions on use of Federal grant dollars for lobbying. We \n     know of none. We have also contacted inspectors general at \n     DOD, HHS, HUD, and the Department of Labor. They are not \n     aware of any cases of violations.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator from Wyoming has evidence of \nviolations of the prohibitions on the use of Federal grant dollars for \nlobbying. That is in existing law--prohibiting the use of Federal \ngrants. Both the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Idaho have \nsuggested that Federal grant dollars are being used to lobby. They may \nnot be so used under current law. For instance, the Senator from Idaho \nsuggested that there is a current use of Federal grant money to lobby \nfor more grant money, despite the existing prohibition in Federal law \nagainst doing that.\n  So my question is: The Office of Management and Budget does not know \nof any violations of the prohibitions on the use of Federal grant \ndollars for lobbying. Does the Senator from Wyoming have a list of \nviolations of those prohibitions?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we are going to be here a long time, and \nI have eaten well and refreshed myself, and I will be glad to stay here \nfor as long as it takes. \n\n[[Page S 16868]]\n\n  My language does not seek to apply any penalties to anyone. It is not \nto strike at the first amendment. It is not to weave the web of a \nchilling effect. My question was the one I started on many weeks ago \nright here in this Chamber, which must have been somewhat acceptable to \nmy colleagues, since the first vote on it was 57-20 or 30, whatever. \nThe next time it passed unanimously. The rub is, should this Government \ngive money--and I was, at that time, speaking of the AARP, which is a \n501(c)(4) corporation, which has the power of unlimited lobbying \nexpenditure--unlimited. I said, ``Why should the taxpayers of the \nUnited States cough up $86 million a year to the AARP or--listen \ncarefully--to the NRA?\n  I hope that people are listening to this. I am talking about every \nsingle 501(c)(4) corporation or the Heritage Foundation or the \nChristian Coalition--you name it; any one organization that gets \nFederal money, when they have the ability of unlimited lobbying \nactivity--that is who I am after.\n  You can decide what you wish to do with that. You can bring up every \nnuance of question, every shading of meaning.\n  I hope--strange, wonderful thing that drives us around here--that you \nrealize that 96 percent of all 501(c)(3)'s spend less than $25,000 on \nlobbying; 96 percent of all 501(c)(3)'s spends less than 25,000 bucks \non lobbying. I can furnish those statistics.\n  That may not answer your question. It may be a great diversion. I can \ntell you who we are after. I think I have explained that for the last \nseveral weeks.\n  The Senator from Michigan was on the other side then. He will be on \nthe other side tomorrow. He will be on the other side the day after \ntomorrow. So we should at least realize what it is we are addressing. \nWe are talking about the big guys.\n  That is why we put in the $125,000 provision. That is why we have \ndone this, done that. We are after the big guys. We are not after the \nlittle guy. We are not after the soup kitchen people. We are after \npeople who really ought to be addressed--and we will have hearings on \nit--on business activities, untaxed business activity.\n  I hope the Senator from Michigan will help me on that, and I think he \nwill because there is serious abuse with huge organizations that bring \nin unrelated business income. We will have some hearings on that. That \nis big time, big ticket. That is where we start. Where we will end, \nonly the Senate knows.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the most important question for the \nSenators to answer as they prepare to vote for the amendment offered, \nthe substitute offered by the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from \nIdaho: Is this body going to get held up every time we do a CR?\n  We have three people in the House of Representatives saying, ``We are \nwilling to shut the Government of the United States of America down--\nwhatever the consequences are, we do not care--because we want this \nprovision attached to the continuing resolution.''\n  To be clear, they did not even have a majority in the appropriations \nsubcommittee, Treasury-Postal, and I am a ranking member. They did not \nhave a majority on that committee to pass the Istook language.\n  Even the Senator from Wyoming, the Senator from Idaho, acknowledge \nthat the Istook language would be rejected by the Senate. So what we \nare trying to do is compromise with a minority in the House of \nRepresentatives which is basically saying, ``We will hold our breath \nuntil we get our way. We do not care if our face turns blue. We do not \ncare if the Government shuts down. We are mad at a few organizations \nthat campaigned against us, and we will pay them back.''\n  Mr. President, the net is big. The Senator from Wyoming talked about \nhis amendment earlier on Treasury-Postal. I would have supported that. \nIt would have affected approximately 409 501(c)(4)'s. Even by raising--\nwe voted at that time on a $10 million threshold. This drops it down to \n$3 million. You will jack it up to some 700 additional 501(c)(4)'s.\n  Far more troubling, Mr. President, is the language. This is not a \nchange to the earlier proposal of the Senator from Wyoming. This is an \nattempt to compromise with a group of people in the House who are \nsaying, ``We will shut the Government down--not for a balanced budget, \nnot to do something to strengthen the U.S. economy, not for the future. \nNone of that. We think a couple 501(c) (3)'s or (4)'s were negative in \nour campaigns, and we want to get them.''\n  That is what is driving this whole thing. This is revenge, the motive \nof a handful of people who are now saying, ``We will shut the \nGovernment of the United States of America down if we do not get \nrevenge.''\n  I believe this body needs to say to those folks ``No, that is not how \nwe are going to operate a CR.''\n  Last week, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming--and I supported \nhim strongly--made a motion to put back into committee an amendment \nthat the distinguished Senator from Arizona offered that would have \nraised the earnings test on people who get Social Security. We sent \nthat to committee, this body did. We sent that issue to committee.\n  We said to one of our colleagues, a Member of this body, ``No, this \nneeds to go to committee. We need to evaluate this a little bit.''\n  Now, I have folks--and one was on the floor earlier; I thought he \nwould grab a microphone and try to get recognized--they are saying to \nus, ``Unless we get our way on welfare, we will shut the Government \ndown.'' We need to say to them, ``No.'' We need to say to that little \nsmall group of people, ``No.''\n  It is not in the Contract With America. It has not been heard. We \nhave not had an opportunity to evaluate this.\n  Colleagues say I will go along with Senator Simpson--normally I go \nalong with Senator Simpson, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. \nThis is 17 pages of changes, Mr. President, that Members ought to \nunderstand could have a heck of an impact.\n  It might be fine for Mr. Istook or Mr. McIntosh, but all of us \nunderstand we will be held accountable for this vote. I think the most \nimportant, perhaps the only question, rather than getting into the \ndetails of what this will do: Will it make life better? Will it make \nlife worse?\n  This does not belong on a continuing resolution. This body ought to \nstand unified against a relatively small group of people who say this \nyear it is going after 501(c)(4)'s and trying to get some reform for \nthe purpose of getting revenge.\n  What will it be next year, Mr. President? What will it be next time \nwe try to get a continuing resolution so we can do the work of the \nAppropriations Committee? Who knows what it will be?\n  This is an act essentially of political terrorism where they are \nsaying, ``We will hold you hostage unless you give us what we want.'' \nThey will hold us hostage. Give us what we want. Give us an airplane, \ngive us this, give us that, and we will go along.\n  We ought to say, ``No, don't negotiate with terrorists, Mr. \nPresident. Do not negotiate with a relatively small handful of people \nthat are involved in this process.''\n  It is difficult enough to get a continuing resolution with all the \nproblems in the budget and all the disagreements and the various \nproblems that we have in the budget, to be held up here on this \ncontinuing resolution, get held up and require us to come down on the \nfloor and argue a piece of legislation.\n  I understand the Senator from Wyoming has made a good-faith effort to \ntry to reach agreement. We ought to say no to a person, to these folks, \nand say, ``You do not have a majority even in the Treasury-Postal \nSubcommittee in Appropriations. You lost the battle. We are not going \nto allow you to hold us, we will not allow you to hold the people of \nthe United States of America hostage to your desire for revenge.''\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nebraska. I hear \nhim clearly. I was kind of reviewing the continuing resolution and who \ndid what to who--a good thing to do in political combat from time to \ntime. I remember how those on the other side of the aisle would hang \ntheir laundry on the continuing resolutions in days of yore.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S 16869]]\n\n\n                            Whip Memorandum\n\n     To: TL.\n     From: Alison Carroll.\n     Subject: History of Riders on Continuing Resolutions.\n     Date: November 3, 1995.\n       This memo lists the most notable riders (substantial \n     legislative items outside the jurisdictions of the \n     Appropriations Committees) on Continuing Resolutions since \n     1984. Continuing Resolutions are attractive vehicles for such \n     provisions because they are considered must-pass legislation \n     over which the President and Congress eventually must reach \n     agreement.\n       Vetoes of Continuing Resolutions have been extremely rare--\n     only five Continuing Resolutions have been vetoed since World \n     War II. All vetoes occurred between 1974 and 1990, and none \n     were overridden. The vetoes of FY82 and FY91 measures led to \n     brief shutdowns of some federal agencies.\n\n\n                       FY84 Continuing Resolution\n\n       International Security and Development Assistance \n     Authorization Act\n       Establishment of National Board for Food Distribution and \n     Emergency Shelter\n       Penalty for Forging Endorsements on Treasury Checks or \n     Bonds\n       Taxes on Reimbursements for Travel Transportation, and \n     Relocation Expenses of Employee\n\n\n                       FY85 Continuing Resolution\n\n       Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (over 200 pages \n     long)\n       President's Emergency Food Assistance Act\n       Child Abuse Prevention\n\n\n                       fy86 continuing resolution\n\n       Export-Import Bank\n       Denial of MFN Status to the Products of Afghanistan\n       Federal Salary Act Amendments\n       Child Care Services for Federal Employees\n       Ethics in Government Act Amendments\n\n\n                       fy87 continuing resolution\n\n       Contained all 13 appropriations bills\n       Defense Acquisition Improvement Act\n       Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act\n       Human Rights in Romania\n       School Lunch and Child Nutrition Amendments\n       Aviation Safety Commission Act\n       Metropolitan Washington Airports\n\n\n                       fy88 continuing resolution\n\n       Contained all 13 appropriations bills (3 of 10 had not been \n     considered previously by the Senate)\n       Cancellation of FY88 Sequester Order\n       Special House and Senate procedures for considering funding \n     requests for the Nicaraguan Resistance (Contra Aid)\n       Agriculture Aid and Trade Missions Act\n\n\n                       fy91 continuing resolution\n\n       Extension of Certain Medicare Hospital Payment Provisions\n       Acceptance of Contributions for Department of Defense\n       Extension of Temporary Increase in the Public Debt\n\n\n                       fy92 continuing resolution\n\n       Extension of Sections 8012 and 8013 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. In fiscal year 1985, we had hung on the CR the \nComprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, emergency food assistance, \nchild abuse prevention. In 1986, we had hung on the CR Export-Import \nBank, denial of MFN status to products in Afghanistan--that was a \nripper; that kept us up for a couple of days--Federal Salary Act \namendments, child care services for Federal employees, Ethics in \nGovernment Act--that was a riotous occasion.\n  In 1987, the CR--and we were not in power here--we had all 13 \nappropriations bills tacked in there: Defense Acquisition Improvement \nAct, Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act, human rights in Romania, \nschool lunch and child nutrition amendments, Aviation Safety Commission \nAct, Metropolitan Washington airports--all of it hung on the CR by \nthose of the other faith.\n  So I just wanted to touch upon that lightly, and as far as I know \nwhat is being hung on this CR is one amendment, and we are debating it. \nAnd we should.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for all the reasons given by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska and a lot of other Senators, both on the floor and from \nremarks in other places, this CR is not the place to make major changes \nin terms of the restrictions that are placed on the use of non-Federal \nfunds by private organizations. It is a complicated area, and the \nchanges that have been made by the Senator from Wyoming from his \nprevious language are significant changes. We believe they will include \na multiple--not just a small percentage more of the organizations and \nentities out there--but a large percentage not covered by the previous \nlanguage which would be covered by the new proposed Simpson language.\n  But, I must say, when I am trying to understand the Senator's \nlanguage, I wonder if I could ask for the Senator from Wyoming to help \nme understand his language here. I would like to work through it with \nhim because it seems to me it is not only the wrong place to do this \nlegislating, but this is a complicated issue and it is very unclear as \nto what he is trying to do. So, if the Senator from Wyoming might help \nme through this, on page 1 of his amendment on line 11, at the last \nline it says that any grantee receiving more than $125,000----\n  Mr. SIMPSON. What page, Mr. President?\n  Mr. LEVIN. One. Any grantee receiving more than $125,000 should be \nsubject to the limitations on lobbying activity expenditures under \nsection 4911(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  When I look at 4911(c)(2)(B) of the Code, what I see are restrictions \nin the amount of lobbying activity for an organization to retain \neligibility under their 501(c)(3) status. And it looks as though you \nspend--for instance, if your exempt purposes expenditures are between \n$500 and $1,000 but not over $1 million, that you are allowed lobbying \nnontaxable expenditures of $100,000.\n  Just to give one example, so, under 4911, a 501(c)(3) that has exempt \npurposes expenditures between half a million and a million dollars can \nretain that 501(c)(3) status and still spend $100,000 on lobbying--plus \na certain percentage of the excess, but at least $100,000.\n  But, then, when I look at the Senator's language on page 16 of his \namendment, line 6, here--although previously we were told that a \n501(c)(3) can spend as much on lobbying as is allowed under 4911, \nsuddenly we are told on line 6 that the chief executive officer of this \nentity must certify that the grantee spent less than $25,000 on \nlobbying activities in the grantee's most recent taxable year.\n  So, on page 1 we are told follow the 4911 rules, which permit up to \n$225,000, in some cases, plus 5 percent of the excess. It is \ncomplicated but it is obviously more than $25,000. We are told on page \n1 of this complicated amendment that the 501(c)(3) which is being \ncovered here now, the other grantees which are being covered here now, \nare permitted to spend the amounts permitted under 4911. And then, lo \nand behold, a few pages later we are told the chief executive officer \nhas to certify that the grantee spent less than $25,000 on lobbying \nactivity.\n  My question of my friend from Wyoming is, which is it? Is it the 4911 \nlimit or is it the $25,000 limit?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan and I know each \nother too well. I enjoy the spirited energy that he conveys.\n  I want to say that what the Senator is speaking of here and bringing \nup is what I am intending to do. There is no mystery. You cannot \nmisread two sections. If they spend less than $25,000 they do not have \nto report. That is what this says. The word ``or'' is there on that \nline, ``or,'' line 8. They have options.\n  Page 16 just gives the exemption. Page 16 just gives the exemption. \nIt says ``or,'' and then it goes on to say if you spend more, you will \nestimate it. That is what it says.\n  So, to go back--I can go back into the code. We can do that, as I \nsay, into the night. I am perfectly prepared. I might have to run off \nand get some light snack or something, but I am ready to do that.\n  The section of the Internal Revenue Code on that section, at the \nbottom of section 4911(c) page 630(C) of the 1986 Code, subtitle (d), \nchapter 40 is quite clear. It talks about the exemptions and lobbying \nexpenditures and what they are. Expenditures for the purpose of \ninfluencing legislation: The nontaxable amount, the net purpose, the \nexempt purpose. All of those things are there.\n  It says, simply, in this bill, in sum, if you spent less than $25,000 \nyou just have to say so. If you spent more than that, you have to \nestimate it. That is sole purpose of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that clarification. I take it that \nthe records, of course, would have to be kept so that certification \ncould be made. But I think at least that clarification helps on that \none point.\n  I am wondering, both the Senator from Wyoming and Idaho said, at \nleast \n\n[[Page S 16870]]\nI believe that both have said, there is no question being raised about \nthe limit on private funds which will be spent for lobbying. Is that \ncorrect? Or is this in fact not restricting the limit of non-Federal \nfunds that can be spent for lobbying?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the Senator mentioned an individual? Was \nthat not your words?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Entity. No, the entity.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Because individuals are not covered in any way.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I am talking about the entity.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. There are no restrictions--no new restrictions of any \nnature. We are simply describing grantees. We are including the phrase \n``grantees.'' That is a word of, I think, some substance. A grantee, \nthat is somebody receiving taxpayers' money. And there are no new \nrestrictions, only--the only difference is that Federal grantees, those \nreceiving taxpayers' money, would be subject to the formula governing \n501(c)(3).\n  Mr. LEVIN. To clarify this further, we are adding a new class of \npeople covered by a restriction on the use of private funds for \nlobbying, and the unanswered question, so far that is, is how many \nadditional people--or entities to be more precise--how many additional \nentities would be covered by the restrictions than were previously \ncovered?\n  On that I gather we do not have an estimate, in terms of a percentage \nsuch as 50 percent more or 100 percent more or 2 times as many or \nwhatever; is that a fair conclusion? That we do not have an estimate as \nto the multiple or percentage increase in the number of entities \ncovered by the restrictions that previously were in the Simpson \nlanguage?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I would have no estimation of that. When \nwe started our work months ago, I recall that it took us quite a while \nto find out how many 501(c)(4)'s there were, and how many of them \nreally got into this lobbying game, and how many did not. But, we have \nnot said, here, in this amendment, that only non-Federal funds are \ncounted. We leave the formula to apply to Federal and non-Federal funds \nreceived, as is the current law.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As I listen to the debate, it appears that there are \nlarge organizations with millions of dollars of assets that make \nmillions of dollars a year and they are receiving substantial amounts \nof money from the Federal Government, and you are seeking to place some \nrequirements on them with regard to their lobbying activities. As I \nlisten to this, there is a question that perhaps has been answered or \naddressed before, which I would think anybody listening to this would \nraise, and that is, Why is the Federal Government subsidizing these \nlarge organizations to start with?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I am very pleased that question has \nbeen asked. That is the nub. Why? Why should an organization that \nreceives tremendous amounts of money in dues, tremendous amounts of \nmoney in unrelated business activities, a tremendous benefit by mailing \nthrough the Federal postal authority--and I asked for only one when I \nstarted. But this amendment and my work pertains to every single one of \nthese, whether from the Christian right to the evil left. I hope people \nare hearing this exactly because that is exactly what we are talking \nabout. And the Senator from Tennessee is absolutely correct.\n  What is the purpose of allowing that to occur when they receive money \nfrom the Federal Government, when in a sense they are awash in money \nand have an awesome power, which is called the unlimited lobbying \nexpense? They can raise as much as they want and they can spend as much \nas they want without any limitation whatsoever, and then take the \nFederal grant money and make it fungible, which gives them more ability \nto try to get more money out of the Federal Government.\n  I have a question that I might ask of the Senator from Michigan, \nsince it is question time. Does the Senator from Michigan, Madam \nPresident, believe that the existing limits on lobbying by 501(c)(3) \ncorporations are improperly restrictions of use of private funds?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in those cases, the people who contribute \nto those organizations get a tax deduction. So there is a true tax \nsubsidy. But what the Senator from Wyoming is doing is then saying that \nevery organization that gets a grant should be treated the same way, \nthat every organization that is doing our work--where we give them a \ngrant to deliver a meal, or to reduce the amount of drunk driving, or \nto clear up our blood supply, or to do the hundreds of other things \nthat we want people to do for us--should be treated in the same way.\n  These are people that are performing services that we want private \nentities to perform. I thought we were trying to get away from having \nFederal employees perform all these services. So we make grants to \nentities to perform these services for us. Those are grantees. They are \nnot spending that grant money to lobby. That is a violation of existing \nlaw. And the OMB has said they cannot find one violation; not one.\n  The problem with this proposal is that now we are treating those \nentities in the same manner as we previously treated entities for whom \na tax contribution was tax deductible where there really is at least \narguably a tax subsidy. So there is a very big difference.\n  But, if I may say to my friend from Wyoming, whether or not the \nSenator agrees with me, there surely is a major change in this \nlegislation from the legislation previously adopted by the Senate. To \nnow include all grantees is a significant substantive change. This is \nnot a slight change, and it has no place on the CR.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I still would ask the question. It has \nnot yet been answered. Does the Senator from Michigan believe that the \npresently existing limits on lobbying by 501(3)(c)'s are improper \nrestrictions of use of private funds? That is the question I am \nasking--not about children or vaccinations or things that I believe in, \ntoo. That is what I am asking.\n  Mr. LEVIN. For the funds which those organizations have spent with \ntax deductible funds, people who contributed those funds received a tax \ndeduction. That is a very significant difference and, it seems to me, \nrepresents a very different situation in terms of the restriction on \nlobbying because there was a true tax subsidy.\n  But, by definition, the Federal grantees that we are talking about \nare using private funds for lobbying purposes, and that is a very \ndifferent kind of an animal. I think the arguments that apply to it are \nvery different. But, again, whether or not this Senator is right in his \nconclusion, whether or not the Senator from Wyoming is right, or the \nSenator from Michigan is right, surely this represents a significant \nchange in policy. And that is to be argued, it seems to me, properly in \na legislative arena on a legislative bill and not on a continuing \nresolution.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I will not go further. The Senator and \nI will visit together and break bread and resolve this one. But there \nare existing limits on lobbying, on 501(c)(3) corporations, and \neveryone should hear that. And there have not then been improper \nrestrictions of the use of private funds. No one is alleging \nviolations. What is objectionable to me about the spending limits under \n501(h) is why should they not cover those who are administering public \nmoney? I am interested in people who are administering public money. \nThat is what I am interested in. And these people that give to the \n501(3)(c)'s are called taxpayers. And in the case of Federal grantees, \nthe taxpayer is contributing to them. They have no choice. Should they \nthen be forced to support the various activities of those organizations \nthat they do not concur with?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3049, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I send a modification of my amendment No. \n3049 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify the \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  So, the amendment (No. 3049), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language in amendment 3048, insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S 16871]]\n\n\n                                  III\n\n\n PROHIBITION ON SUBSIDIZING POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH TAXPAYER FUNDS\n\n       Sec. 301.

Madam President, I think the colloquy that has gone on \nthis afternoon between our colleagues from Wyoming and Michigan has \nbeen extremely valuable. It has established very clearly that 501(c)(3) \norganizations in this country that receive a very large share, the \nlion's share, of the Federal grant dollars comply with the Federal law, \nand the IRS, too. In fact, the Senator from Michigan said that OMB has \nreported no violations.\n  Madam President, the reason there are not any violations is because \nthere is a reporting requirement, and if they spend more than $25,000 \nworth of lobbying, they are in trouble. So they do not. They are \nlimited by law, and there is a reporting process. There is a mechanism \nto hold them accountable. In that accountability, they perform those \nkinds of activities that they choose to under the privilege that the \nCongress of the United States and the taxpayers have granted them--tax-\nexemption. That is very simple. That is very clear. That has been \nestablished here today. That is the law.\n  They are required to keep books, but any organization that handles \nmoney is required to keep books by either their board or by the IRS, \nand in all instances the IRS. And so that is nothing new.\n  There are no new accounting requirements. They have to keep their \nbooks. But now there is a requirement, and that is the requirement of \naccountability, on another group--the same requirement we put on 90-\nplus percent of those who accept the Federal grants. It is not \nprohibitive to the clean blood supply, to the vaccinations, to the \nfeeding. What is prohibitive is that if that group chooses to lobby, \nthey have limits. They must decide whether they are going to be tax \nexempt and carry out the mandate of their grants and the goal of their \norganization or whether they are going to aggressively get involved in \nlobbying. It is a matter of either/or, of choice. It is not prohibitive \nin that sense. It is a matter of choice, decisionmaking. If they want \nto lobby and they have an interest to lobby, they ought to go create \nanother organization with separate books so that the money does not \ncross spend, it is not fungible, so that the taxpayers do not find \nthemselves subsidizing.\n  That is what the debate is about. We are taking the law that \ncurrently governs 90-plus percent of these organizations and putting it \nto the others with the same requirements and then a formula. In fact, \nwe are even more liberal. We say that if you get above a certain \namount, you can spend a certain amount. And until that time there is a \nvery simple sliding formula that says here is the limitation--nothing \nmore and nothing less. It is a mirror in which to look at themselves \nand to decide if they need to decide that they may be doing something \nwrong and would want to change. Or if they want to be all grant and no \nlobby or no advocacy, then that is what they ought to be.\n  I suggest that those who are providing feeding, who are interested in \na clean blood supply and do that work in the private sector that the \nSenator from Michigan talks about that we have decided can be done \nbetter there, they are going to choose to do their job and not to \nlobby. But if there is a need for them to express an advocacy role, \nthey can form a 501(c)(3) to get it done. That is a separate \nbookkeeping system, and that is called accountability because we have \nextended them a very special form of treatment under the law--tax-\nexempt status. That means they are by definition subsidized by the \ntaxpayers of this country. Therefore, the taxpayers of this country \nhave the right to ask for accountability under the law, and that is \nwhat we ask for.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. \n\n[[Page S 16873]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  We are on the Simpson amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, let me speak briefly on this \namendment.\n  Let me make three central points, not as an expert on all of the \ntechnical detail but I think I speak for the State of Minnesota, or a \nvast majority of people in my State when I say, first of all, this \namendment really is an obvious effort to gag nonprofit organizations. I \ndo not think it makes any sense. Day after day, we have been hearing \nfrom a majority in the House and some of my other colleagues about the \nimportance of voluntarism and the value of the private sector in our \nsociety.\n  We talk about James Madison, and we talk about Thomas Jefferson, and \nI can think of the Alex de Tocqueville classic about America, the \nimportance of mediating institutions. That is what these nonprofits are \nall about. They are the key to an effective civil society. They are \nones who get people to participate in a democracy. They are ones who \nrepresent the interests of the middle class, of workers and poor \npeople.\n  By the way, all too often they are the only voices for the voiceless.\n  So it does seem to me that this provision--and I have not seen \nexactly all that is in this modification--would make it very difficult \nfor these groups to fully participate in the democratic purposes of \nthis society. And to the extent that is true, I think it is a loss.\n  Moreover, I think it is a bit deplorable that those who are talking \nabout these kinds of restrictions and are talking about the nonprofit \nsector, when it comes to others who feed the most from the public \ntrough, the defense contractors and the big businesses, if we want to \ntalk about people who are receiving hundreds of billions of dollars a \nyear, do not gag them at all.\n  I would not be in favor of that anyway, because I think it is a \nviolation of the first amendment to the Constitution, but it does seem \nto me that there is a sleight of the hand here that we ought to \nunderstand.\n  On the one hand, we go after these nonprofits that are all too often, \nas I said, the only voice for the voiceless, organizations that do \nwonderful work, that contribute greatly to the civil society, that do a \nlot of effective social service work and charity work and all of the \nrest. On the other hand, when it comes to big military contractors, big \ncompanies that receive all sorts of benefits, contracts, money from the \nFederal Government, when it comes to all sorts of large corporations \nwhich receive all of these various tax breaks, we do not have any such \nrestrictions on them.\n  It seems to me that this is a double code. It is the same double \ncode--those big contractors, they have the big bucks; they are the \nheavy hitters; they have the lobbyists. This is not lobbying reform. I \nhave been involved in lobbying reform and the gift ban. This is nothing \nmore than an effort to gag nonprofit organizations.\n  I must say to my colleagues that I find this even more troubling. I \nwas at a press conference today. The Office of Management and Budget \nreleased a study--Dr. Rivlin deserves a lot of credit for her \nintellectual honesty--that what we passed that we called welfare reform \nwill, in fact, on the House side, lead to over 2 million more children \nbeing impoverished in America; on the Senate side, a little over 1 \nmillion children will be impoverished as a result of legislation that \nwe passed that we called ``welfare reform.''\n  At the time that we do that we now want to gag these nonprofit \norganizations which are quite often the only voice for those citizens, \nincluding the children. It is a bit outrageous.\n  Finally, Madam President--and I will be relatively brief because I \nimagine we have a vote coming up soon--I think the definition of \npolitical advocacy is such a broad definition, and we are not talking \nabout lobbying, which is restricted. We are not talking about narrow \npartisan activity. We are saying that if an organization, a nonprofit \norganization wants to testify before the legislature, somebody wants to \nwrite an op-ed piece, somebody wants to do an educational forum, you \nname it, they may not be able to do that.\n  I think it is transparent what this is all about. I think it has \nalready had a chilling effect in this country. And this is an amendment \nthat ought to be voted down.\n  In any case, even if I was for it--and I am not--it is a gag order. \nIt is an absolutely outrageous double code, with no such effort focused \ntoward military contractors, big corporations. Such an effort should \nnot be focused on them anyway; I would not be in favor of that because \nof basic first amendment guarantees, but, in addition, it should not be \non this continuing resolution.\n  We are talking about whether or not the Government is going to \ncontinue to function, for God's sake. We are talking about whether or \nnot we can govern here in Washington. I think people are sick and tired \nof these games and these amendments that get put on this kind of \nlegislation.\n  Let me conclude by talking about another issue, since I think I have \na little bit more time, about which I am deeply troubled.\n  And that has to do with my concern about the low-income energy \nassistance program which, Madam President, I know is very important to \na State like Maine.\n  This program, the low-income energy assistance program--and I was \ntempted to do an amendment on this continuing resolution; I will not at \nthis time because I think this is very, very serious business--but this \nis a 6-month heating season program, it is not really a 1-year program. \nAnd it is extremely important that the cold weather States get this \nfunding and get this funding out to people.\n  It is true that some LIHEAP funds are used for cooling in places like \nnursing homes, but in the vast majority of the cases it is cold-weather \nStates. And this money is used to help low-income people pay for \nfurnace repairs and replacements, for fuel and propane tanks being \nfilled, and for emergency assistance to avoid utility shutoff.\n  Madam President, I will tell you what we are doing right now. By not \ngetting the money out to these communities, by having it essentially 30 \npercent of what it should be, we are basically forcing people to freeze \non an installment plan.\n  Madam President, as I said before, this is a stopgap budget bill. If \nwe continue to allocate these dollars, small in amount, for emergency \nheating assistance for elderly people, people with disabilities, people \nwith children in this fashion, we are going to have some citizens who \nare going to freeze to death in this country. And then we will be \nashamed. Then we will take the action.\n  But, my God, Madam President, I do not want to wait until that point \nin time. I want to make it clear to my colleagues that we cannot \ncontinue to fund programs like the low-income energy assistance program \non an ad hoc, partial basis without doing serious harm to millions of \nfamilies, some of the most vulnerable citizens in this country, who \ndepend upon this program for their very survival during the winter.\n  Madam President, I was considering an amendment to this bill to \nprovide additional LIHEAP funding for the States. But I am not going to \ndo it because we are on the brink of a Government shutdown. I think \nthat would be irresponsible. But I am not going to continue to let this \ngo on month after month, allowing people to freeze on the installment \nplan. Is that what we want? Do we want to have vulnerable elderly \npeople freeze, some perhaps even freeze to death, before we act to \nprovide adequate low-income energy assistance funding? I do not think \nso. And I do not think that is what people voted for last year.\n  I do not think we can let this happen. I think we are going to have \nto do something soon. And if we do not do something soon, that is \nexactly what is going to happen. It could happen in \n\n[[Page S 16874]]\nNorth Dakota, it could happen in Alaska, it could happen in Maine, it \ncould happen in Michigan, it could happen in Minnesota, it could happen \nin any number of the cold weather States in this country.\n  Madam President, this Low-Income Energy Assistance Program has been \ncut already by 25 percent this past year, and the House of \nRepresentatives urged its elimination altogether. The total cost of \nlow-income energy assistance for citizens across this country does not \nequal one B-2 bomber, and in the House of Representatives they want to \neliminate the program.\n  This program right now is down $1.2 billion from 10 years ago, and \nthe need is growing. I have just said to my colleagues that I am \nextremely worried about what is going to happen. What I am hearing in \nmy State is the funds are going to be depleted in the coming weeks.\n  What is going to happen during the rest of the winter in Maine or in \nMinnesota or in West Virginia, you name it? What happens in February? \nWhat happens in March or later if a cold snap occurs and people are \nheld up without fuel oil or propane or electricity to run their \nthermostats? What then are we going to do?\n  Madam President, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program in my State \nof Minnesota serves about 110,000 households, over 300,000 people. \nThese are poor people. These are elderly people, people with \ndisabilities, families with children. This year we are expecting to \nprovide a supplement of an average of only $200 for the whole winter. \nThe average fuel bill in Minnesota for the vulnerable elderly is \nbetween $1,800 and $2,000 a year. So people are carrying most of these \ncosts.\n  The continuing resolution which the House passed last night and upon \nwhich we are going to act today provides that only a small percentage \nof the funds requested by the States in the first quarter, the funds \nthat they need to run the program, are going to be there.\n  Madam President, I just simply have to say one more time that I am \nconcerned. We have this only at about 30 percent of the normal rate. \nMinnesota is planning cuts of about 50 percent in benefit levels and \nwill be unable to provide assistance to all eligible applicants under \nthe current circumstances. In addition, many programs had to turn away \nrecipients from the crisis program because of this erratic Federal \nfunding. As a result, there are 900,000 households who have empty fuel \ntanks or who need electric utility connections who have not been served \nunder LIHEAP, and the number is growing.\n  Madam President, one final point. There have been criticisms of this \nprogram, many of them coming from warm weather States. But let me just \nsay to my colleagues, this is an effective, highly targeted program \nthat serves 6 million low-income families and helps them pay their \nenergy bills. More than two-thirds of these LIHEAP households have \nannual incomes of less than $8,000 a year, and one-half of these \nhouseholds have annual incomes below $6,000 a year.\n  I just simply ask my colleagues this question, because I have seen \nthis happen before: Are we going to continue to not provide the \nfunding? Are we going to continue to do this on this ad hoc, sporadic \nbasis? What is going to happen?\n  I already know what is going to happen. Congress diddles, a few sad \nstories of vulnerable elderly people without heat appear, and then a \nfew more, constituents contact their Members of Congress as the cold \nworsens, and then a couple of people are found dead in their apartments \nin the upper Midwest, or in New England, because they were knocked off \nLIHEAP or were otherwise unable to get their electricity or fuel bills \npaid and got shut off, or because they were too ashamed, too weak, or \nunable to bring themselves to ask their families to pay for the bills.\n  And then Congress acts. That is the scenario. That is what is going \nto happen. We are not providing what is not an income supplement, but a \nsurvival supplement. People are not going to be able to afford to pay \ntheir heating bills, and people are going to go without. And they are \ngoing to be too ashamed to ask or they are going to be too ashamed to \nturn to their families if their families can provide them with the \nsupport, and then they are going to freeze to death. That is not how \nthis process should work. Americans deserve better.\n  That is not what we are about, letting the vulnerable elderly freeze \nto death on an isolated farmstead or in an urban high rise. We can do \nmuch better. And we should start now. We should not continue to provide \npitifully inadequate LIHEAP funding to bleed the program for months \nwhile Congress struggles to get its work done, to allow people to \nfreeze to death on the installment plan. We can do better. Americans \ninsist on it.\n  I do not think I should do this amendment today, but if this goes on \nto December--and I know what this is going to mean to people in my \nState and a whole lot of other States--I am going to bring this \namendment to the floor, and I am going to insist that we provide this \nfunding for this program because I will be darned if on my watch as a \nU.S. Senator from Minnesota, people are going to freeze to death in the \nUnited States of America.\n  What are we about? Where is our compassion? Where are our priorities? \nWhere are our values? When are we going to get real again? Madam \nPresident, that is where we are heading right now in this Nation, and \nwe have got to do better, and the sooner the better. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been called for on \nthe pending issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe it is important to explain the important \nprinciples underlying this effort.\n  I am pleased to have been working with my colleague--and my good \nfriend--the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], to try and craft a \nconsensus proposal in this area. This is one of the most important \nefforts going on in the 104th Congress. This is a truly critical issue. \nThis effort already is known by various names: ``Ending Welfare to \nLobbyist,'' ``Advocacy and Lobbyist Reform,'' ``Defunding Political \nAdvocacy,'' ``Prohibiting Grants for Political Activity,'' and a \n``Taxpayers Declaration of Independence from the Special Interests,'' \namong others.\n  It's been joked that the hype used in describing any given issue is \ninversely proportional to its true importance. That is not the case \nwith today's topic. In terms of forcing the Government to focus on its \ntrue and proper constitutional purposes, this effort may be second only \nin importance to passage of the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Both of those efforts remain work-in-progress at this \npoint.\n\n\n                        jeffersonian principles\n\n  Earlier this year, the Senate, by a single vote, put on hold the most \nimportant legislation to come before it in decades, the balanced budget \namendment. Speaking to that very idea 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson \nsaid, if ``it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \nconstitution * * * '' he wanted that to be an article ``taking from the \nfederal government the power of borrowing.''\n  As timely as today's newspaper, Jefferson anticipated the Simpson-\nCraig and Istook-Ehrlich-McIntosh amendments when he said:\n\n       To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of \n     ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\n\n  I want to make a distinction here: Sometimes, the Government uses tax \ndollars for actions that someone may disagree with. That's the nature \nof majority rule and the nature of decisionmaking in a republic. But \nit's a totally different thing to confiscate tax dollars from one \nperson and use them to subsidize the lobbying and political advocacy on \nbehalf of someone else's private-interest views.\n  I am not alone in believing that this practice flies in the face of \nthe first amendment. The Supreme Court in its Beck decision said as \nmuch when it prohibited unions from using agency fees from nonmembers \nto pay for political activities.\n\n[[Page S 16875]]\n\n\n\n                           general principles\n\n  Both the Simpson-Craig and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich initiatives \nare efforts to enact a badly-needed taxpayers declaration of \nindependence from the special interests. They both serve the same set \nof general principles:\n  Public money should be spent on the public interest, and not on the \npolitical agendas of special interests.\n  The Government should not give special interests money to pay for \nlobbying for more money.\n  Taxpayers should not be compelled to fund special interest lobbying \nthat is against their own interests. To force them to do so really does \namount to a violation of their first amendment rights.\n  Our efforts are about ensuring Government integrity and responsible \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars.\n  This is not an issue of left-versus-right: It's about rules that \nshould apply across the board.\n  Left, right, and center, service or social organizations, they'd \nsimply have to decide: Take the taxpayers money or lobby the taxpayers \nrepresentatives--but you can't do both. To do both is a conflict of \ninterest.\n  Our goal simply is to erect a solid wall between lobbying and \nadvocacy activities, on the one hand, and other activities funded in \nwhole or in part by the taxpayers, on the other hand.\n\n\n                           legislative status\n\n  Very briefly, here's what the action on this issue has been in recent \nweeks, and where it's headed:\n  Senate Action: On July 24, the Senate adopted, 59-37, the Simpson-\nCraig amendment to the lobbying reform bill, S. 1060. That amendment \nwould prohibit Federal funds going to nonprofit groups covered by \nInternal Revenue Code section 501(c)(4) that engage in lobbying \nactivities.\n  On August 5, the Senate adopted, by voice vote, the Simpson-Craig \namendment to Treasury-Postal appropriations H.R. 2020, which was \nmodified: Instead of all Federal funds, the prohibition extended only \nto awards, grants, loans; the effective date was set at January 1, \n1997; and groups with gross annual revenues less than $10 million were \nexempted.\n  While watered down, the August 5 amendment put the Senate on record \non a second vehicle in favor of the principle that fungible Government \nfunds should not be used directly or indirectly to subsidize interest \ngroup lobbying, and prompted consideration of this issue in the \nTreasury-Postal appropriations conference committee, an appropriate \nvenue because of its coverage of general Government activities.\n  Frankly, I would not have supported these modifications to our \namendment if I thought this were the final product. I saw it, and I \nbelieve Alan Simpson saw it, as our way to raise the issue on one of \nthe legislative vehicles most likely to become law this year.\n  House Action: On August 3, the House rejected, 187-232, an amendment \nto strike the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich language in the Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill, H.R. 2127. The reform language prohibits \nFederal grants to any groups including both nonprofit and for-profits, \nthat engage in lobbying or political advocacy; pass-through funding to \nrelated groups is also covered; groups are exempt if they spend less \nthan 5 percent of their first $20 million of non-Federal revenues and 1 \npercent of additional revenues on lobbying or advocacy.\n\n\n                             current status\n\n  House conferees sought to incorporate the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich \namendment into the Treasury-Postal conference report. Alan Simpson and \nI have been working with the House principals to try and forge the \nstrongest possible combination of the best of both of the Senate and \nHouse provisions.\n  Sixty Republicans House Members sent a letter to the Speaker saying \nthey will oppose the Treasury-Postal conference report unless the \nIstook-McIntosh-Ehrlich amendment is included.\n  In the Senate we sent a letter, with 25 cosignors, to urge the \nTreasury-Postal conferees to consider the full range of issues \naddressed by both versions and to blend the Simpson-Craig and Istook-\nMcIntosh-Ehrlich amendments into the strongest possible combination.\n  Twenty-five Senators last month wrote the Senate conferees on the \nTreasury-Postal appropriation bill urging they support the strongest \npossible language that reflects the best of both the Simpson-Craig and \nthe Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich amendments.\n  Unfortunately, that conference deadlocked. That's one reason we are \nhere today, debating this amendment. Another reason is that both the \nSenate and House have voted for these principles twice, by significant \nmajorities. We are just trying to work out the details of the precise \nlanguage.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and \n         General Government, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Three times in recent months, the Senate has voted for the \n     principle that federal grants should not be used, directly or \n     indirectly, to subsidize lobbying and political activity by \n     special interest groups. Versions of the Simpson-Craig \n     Amendment were added to the Lobbying Reform bill and the \n     Treasury-Postal Service-General Government Appropriations \n     bill. The House took a different approach to the same \n     problem, passing the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment. The \n     two bodies passed their respective amendments by solid, \n     bipartisan majorities.\n       We are writing to urge the conferees on the Treasury-Postal \n     Appropriations bill to consider the full range of concerns \n     addressed by both the House and Senate proposals. We urge you \n     to adopt in conference the strongest possible language that \n     reflects the best of both the Simpson-Craig and the Istook-\n     McIntosh-Ehrlich amendments. The Treasury-Postal bill, which \n     covers ``general government'' functions, is a most \n     appropriate vehicle to carry this reform.\n       The Senate approach applied a stronger funding ban to a \n     narrower range of recipients. It also reflected Senate \n     recognition that some groups exist for the purpose of \n     charitable pursuits and some groups are really veiled \n     lobbying and advocacy organizations. The House approach \n     applied to all organizations, non-profits and for-profits, \n     with a flexible approach that still allows federal grantees \n     to engage in significant lobbying and advocacy activities \n     with their non-federal funds. It also recognized that \n     regulating some types of organizations to the exclusion of \n     others may result in ``shell game'' reorganizations. Both \n     approaches recognized the problem of the fungibility of \n     federal dollars.\n       Like you, we have promised our constituents that we would \n     work to balance the budget and change the way Washington does \n     business. Continuing to subsidize lobbying and advocacy by \n     large, special interest organizations runs counter to this \n     purpose. It also runs counter to First Amendment principles \n     by forcing taxpayers to subsidize political activities with \n     which they disagree.\n       Therefore, we urge the conferees to combine the best of \n     both proposals into a strong, effective, workable reform that \n     would rein in public financing of lobbying and political \n     advocacy. Thank you in advance for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Larry E. Craig, Alan K. Simpson, Jesse Helms, Mitch \n           McConnell, Strom Thurmond, Slade Gorton, Trent Lott, \n           Kay Bailey Hutchison, Orrin G. Hatch, Spencer Abraham, \n           Bob Smith, Conrad Burns, Craig Thomas, Larry Pressler, \n           Don Nickles, Lauch Faircloth, Bill Frist, Paul D. \n           Coverdell, Dirk Kempthorne, James M. Inhofe, Frank H. \n           Murkowski, Rick Santorum, Phil Gramm, John McCain, Rod \n           Grams.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, many groups who claim to speak for \ngrassroots members or large groups of Americans actually use Federal \ndollars inappropriately to amplify the voices of a few.\n  Organizations which receive funding, in spite of major lobbying \nactivities, include:\n  The American Association of Retired Persons, who received more than \n$73 million in a 1-year period;\n  The Environmental Defense Fund, which has benefited from more than \n$500,000 in taxpayer funding;\n  The World Wildlife Fund, which received $2.6 million in Federal \nfunding between July 1993 and June 1994;\n  The National Council of Senior Citizens, which receives 96 percent of \nits funding from the Federal Government, to the tune of $71 million in \n1 year;\n  Families USA, which received $250,000 from the taxpayers between July \n1993 and June 1994, and tried to mobilize last-ditch support for \nPresident Clinton's health care plan last year through a nationwide bus \ntour;\n  The Child Welfare League of America, which received more than \n$250,000 in Federal funds and launched an ad campaign opposing the \nContract With \n\n[[Page S 16876]]\nAmerica's welfare reform bill, saying, ``More children will be killed. \nMore children will be raped.''\n  Our reforms would prevent Federal subsidies of lobbying by \nconservative groups, too. It would apply to groups like the National \nRifle Association and the Christian Coalition, too, if Congress and the \nbureaucrats ever were tempted to fund them.\n\n\n                          dollars are fungible\n\n  It is already supposed to be illegal to spend Federal funds directly \non lobbying the Federal Government.\n  However, organizations still can draw on a combined pool of vast \namounts of private and public money.\n  Having many pipelines into one pool still allows a group to use the \nentire pool in such a way that it maximizes its lobbying muscle.\n  Federal money can supplant other funding to other activities that \nstill support lobbying, such as overhead and travel.\n  This means the Federal Government is indirectly subsidizing millions \nof dollars of lobbying by special interest groups each year. All the \ngroups need to accomplish this is creative accounting.\n  Our amendments simply would not allow both activities to continue \nwithin the same organization.\n  We need to prevent Federal funding from indirectly subsidizing \nlobbying activities by being used to free up other funds, and, as \nrecognized in the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich amendment, prevent one \norganization, like a 501(c)(3), from being able to pass through, \nessentially to launder, the money through to another organization, like \na 501(c)(4).\n  Our amendments would not prohibit an organization from conducting \neducational or charitable operations under 501(c)(3) status and \nconducting lobbying through a related, but completely separate, \nindependently financed, 501(c)(4) organization.\n  The key here is to ensure the total separation of funds, with an \nimpenetrable wall between taxpayers' dollars and dollars for private-\ninterest lobbying and political advocacy.\n\n\n                          real lobbying reform\n\n  In July, the Senate recognized that this kind of amendment is about--\nreal lobbying reform, integrity in the grant, loan, and award process, \nand clean government, and good government.\n  Congress and the public have been correctly focused on lobbyist and \ngifts to legislators.\n  We also need to do something about Government's gifts to lobbyists.\n  There has been a growing phenomenon of more and more Federal tax \ndollars going to advocacy groups, which then allows them to use these \ntaxpayer dollars to argue their maybe very narrow point of view.\n  Federal grants to private grantees now totals an estimated $39 \nbillion, with no effective accountability. This contrasts with the way \nthat Congress has enacted a complex set of controls to make sure \ncontractors can not use contract proceeds for improper purposes.\n  This practice of sending billions of fungible dollars into the \ncoffers of lobbying groups undermines the people's confidence in their \ngovernment.\n\n\n                          Balancing the Budget\n\n  This reform is a good place to look for help in balancing the budget.\n  With nearly a $5 trillion debt, a $200 billion deficit, and the very \nreal concern that this year for the first time this Congress is going \nto establish increasingly narrow and tighter public priorities as to \nwhere taxpayer dollars get spent, it is high time we do the same in \nthis area.\n\n\n                              Free Speech\n\n  I opened with a discussion of Thomas Jefferson and the Constitution. \nOpponents of our reforms have tried to use the first amendment against \nus. Their arguments simply don't hold up.\n  We should never restrict the right of the citizen, or the group, or \nthe organization to be an advocate before their Government.\n  At the same time, the Government is under no obligation to promote, \nand should not be subsidizing, directly or indirectly, their activity \nas an advocacy group.\n  There is a difference between free speech and sponsorship. The \nAmerican people have a clear, intuitive understanding of that \ndifference. Unfortunately, too many Members of Congress, bureaucrats, \nlobbyists, and special interest groups have lost that understanding. \nThese proposals seek to restore that distinction. As a matter of \nfundamental rights and constitutional law, we want to protect free \nspeech. Lobbying and political advocacy are speech. But we are under no \nobligation at all to subsidize anyone's lobbying or political agenda.\n  No one reveres the personal liberties of the Bill of Rights more than \nthe two Senators standing before you today. One of the most impressive \naccomplishments of the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich team is that they had \ntheir proposal thoroughly reviewed by constitutional scholars. We are \ncomfortable that our reforms not only are consistent with the first \namendment--they would promote first amendment principles.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  I am optimistic that we will make progress, and ultimately enact \nlegislation, in this area. The time is right, the supporters are \ndedicated, and, most importantly of all, critical principles of good \ngovernment are at stake.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord some research information that shows that over 70 percent of the \nAmerican people agree with us on the Simpson-Craig amendment.\n  There being no objection, the information was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n    What the American People Have To Say About Welfare for Lobbyists\n\n       On September 26-30, 1995, the Luntz Research Companies \n     conducted a national study of 1,000 adults on a number of \n     important national issues, including public funding of \n     special interest groups that lobby the government. The \n     results were:\n       Tax dollars should not be provided to non-profit \n     organizations which, directly or indirectly, use these funds \n     to lobby federal state or local officials for their special \n     interest agenda.\n       Agree:  70 percent.\n       Disagree:  26 percent.\n       Don't Know:  4 percent.\n       Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for your \n     Member of Congress if he or she did not support a law to stop \n     federal funding of non-profit organizations which, directly \n     or indirectly, use these funds to lobby government officials \n     for their special interests.\n       More Likely:  31 percent.\n       Less Likely:  56 percent.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of a legal opinion obtained by our assistant \nmajority leader and the majority leader of the other body, from a \nconstitutional expert.\n  This explains why the House-passed Istook-Ehrlich-McIntosh amendment \nis constitutional.\n  Since the Simpson-Craig amendment is more lenient in its treatment of \ngrantees who lobby, it is even more obviously constitutional.\n  There being no objection, the information was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Timothy E. Flanigan, Esq.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1995.\n     Re Recent Changes to Proposed Limits on Political Advocacy by \n         Recipients of Federal Grants.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Whip, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard K. Armey,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott and Representative Armey: You have asked \n     that I supplement a letter dated July 19, 1995, in which I \n     addressed the constitutionality of proposed legislation, \n     sponsored by Representatives Istook, McIntosh, and Ehrlich, \n     that would impose limitations on political advocacy by \n     recipients of federal grants. (A similar proposal has been \n     advanced in the Senate by Senators Simpson and Craig.) In \n     particular, you have asked whether any of the various changes \n     made to the proposed legislation since my initial letter \n     would affect my conclusion that the legislation is \n     constitutional. These changes, which are currently reflected \n     in a proposed revision to H.R. 2020 (the ``bill''), include \n     clarifying the ability of affiliates of federal grantees to \n     engage in political activity, loosening the restrictions on \n     political activity by federal grant recipients within certain \n     dollar limits, and clarifying that the bill places no \n     restrictions on an individual's use of non-federal funds. The \n     changes merely reinforce the view expressed in my previous \n     letter that the proposal is constitutional.\n       Opponents of the proposal have leveled only three \n     constitutional arguments against the proposal: (1) that it \n     establishes unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of \n     federal grants; (2) that it violates the equal protection \n     component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by \n     discriminating against federal grantees vis-a-vis federal \n     contractors; and (3) that its disclosure provisions \n     violate a purported constitutional \n\n[[Page S 16877]]\n     right to engage in anonymous speech. Each of the arguments rests on a \n     selective and inaccurate reading of Supreme Court \n     decisions which, when fairly read, provide clear support \n     for the proposal.\n       First, as discussed in more detail in my letter of July 19, \n     the bill does not establish an unconstitutional condition \n     because it expressly permits political activity by affiliated \n     organizations that receive no federal funds. Indeed, the \n     current bill goes even further than the previous version to \n     make clear that affiliate organizations that do not receive \n     federal grants are not affected by the limitations on \n     political advocacy.\n       The Supreme Court has expressly upheld such a mechanism as \n     a method to avoid constitutional difficulties. In FCC v. \n     League of Women Voters, 68 U.S. 364 (1984) (Brennan J., \n     writing for the Court), the Court observed--and indeed \n     appeared to recommend to Congress--that Congress could \n     prohibit public broadcasting stations that received as little \n     as 1% of their funds from the federal government from \n     engaging in any editorializing so long as the statute allowed \n     those entities to create affiliates who were not barred. See \n     id. at 400.\\1\\ By expressly affording federal grantees that \n     option, therefore, the bill is valid under the Court's \n     unconstitutional conditions analysis.\n     \\1\\Footnotes follow at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Opponents of the bill have sought to avoid the effect of \n     League of Women Voters by taking out of context a single \n     sentence from the Court's opinion in Rust v. Sullivan, 111 \n     S.Ct. 1759 (1991). That sentence draws a general distinction \n     between restrictions directed against ``entities'' rather \n     than simply ``programs.'' Their references, however, derived \n     not from the Constitution but from the regulations challenged \n     in that case, which applied only to Title X programs. Thus \n     the Rust Court had no occasion to revisit its analysis of \n     prohibitions on ``entities'' in League of Women Voters. \n     Moreover, this narrow reading of Rust collapses completely \n     when the sentence is read together with the remainder of the \n     paragraph in which it appears. Barely four sentences later, \n     the Court specifically reaffirmed its conclusion in League of \n     Women Voters that a flat prohibition on certain speech \n     activities by recipients of federal funds ``would plainly be \n     valid'' if Congress permitted the recipients to establish \n     affiliates to engage in that activity with non-federal funds. \n     See Rust 111 S.Ct. at 1774 (quoting League of Women Voters, \n     468 U.S. at 400).\n       Rust also made clear that the Constitution by no means bars \n     restrictions on the use of non-federal funds. The Court \n     specifically rejected the argument that the application of \n     the Title X regulations to non-federal funds used in Title X \n     programs was unconstitutional because they penalized \n     privately funded speech. See Rust, 111 S.Ct. at 1775, n. 5. \n     The Court moved that a party wishing to engage in the \n     prohibited speech could ``simply decline the subsidy.''\n       The ``equal protection'' argument against the bill also \n     fails. The gravamen of this argument is that Congress may not \n     treat grantees differently from federal contractors without a \n     compelling reason for doing so. This argument, however, is \n     not supported by the relevant case law. Congress is simply \n     not constitutionally prohibited from controlling grants and \n     contracts through different regulatory schemes.\\2\\\n       The Constitution does not forbid Congress from making a \n     rationally based, content-neutral distinction between \n     contractors and grantees. Strict scrutiny would not, as some \n     opponents have claimed, apply to the distinction between \n     contractors and grantees. It is ``not at all like \n     distinctions based on race or national origin'' that are \n     subject to strict scrutiny under an equal protection \n     analysis. Regan v. Taxation With Representation, 461 U.S. \n     540, 548 (1983) (rejecting equal protection challenge to \n     limitations on political activities by organizations exempt \n     under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code). \n     Moreover, strict scrutiny does not apply merely because \n     the restrictions on recipients of federal grants might \n     affect the exercise of their First Amendment rights: ``[A] \n     legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a \n     fundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is \n     not subject to strict scrutiny.'' Id. at 549. Rather, the \n     distinction between contractors and grantees must only \n     rest on a rational basis. There is no reason that Congress \n     could not rationally determine that the nature of a \n     contract, involving a bargained-for exchange and \n     judicially enforceable rights, presents a less serious \n     risk of misuse of federal funds than a federal grant.\n       The third argument--that the bill's disclosure requirements \n     violate a generalized right to engage in anonymous political \n     activity--fails because no such right exists. The Court has \n     never articulated such a right and the case law relied on by \n     the bill's opponents merely serves to underscore the \n     constitutionality of the bill's modest disclosure \n     requirements.\n       The bill's disclosure provisions are significantly less \n     burdensome than others on lobbying and campaign activities \n     that have been upheld by the Supreme Court. For example, \n     Congress has for many years imposed extensive disclosure \n     requirements on those who lobby it. The Federal Regulation of \n     Lobbying Act, for example, requires of any person or \n     organization who solicits or accepts money to lobby Congress \n     to submit a detailed quarterly disclosure of the name and \n     address of any contributor of more than $500 and the name and \n     address of the recipient of every expenditure greater than \n     $10. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 264. The Supreme Court held that that \n     statute did not violate the First Amendment, stating, in an \n     opinion by Chief Justice Warren, that Congress ``is not \n     constitutionally forbidden to require the disclosure of \n     lobbying activities,'' United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. \n     612, 623 (1954).\n       The present bill is far less restrictive. It requires a \n     ``brief description of the taxpayer subsidized grantee's \n     political advocacy,'' together with good faith estimates of \n     the grantee's expenditures on political advocacy and \n     political advocacy threshold. See Sec. 702(a)(3)(B)(vi) and \n     (vii). Indeed, the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, which \n     the Court has upheld against First Amendment challenge, goes \n     well beyond the bill by applying to anyone who lobbies \n     Congress, regardless of whether they receive any public funds \n     at all.\n       The Supreme Court only last term reaffirmed that such \n     disclosure requirements do not violate the First Amendment. \n     In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm., 115 S.Ct. 1511 (1995), \n     the Court struck down a state law which prohibited anonymous \n     political pamphleteering. In reaching that conclusion, \n     however, the Court specifically distinguished and reaffirmed \n     its earlier holding (in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976)) \n     that upheld disclosure requirements for ``independent \n     expenditures,'' i.e., the use of private funds. McIntyre, 115 \n     S.Ct. at 1523. The Court emphasized that ``[d]isclosure of an \n     expenditure and its use, without more, reveals far less \n     information'' than the requirement before the Court in \n     McIntyre that political leaflets identify their author. See \n     McIntyre, 115 S.Ct. at 1523. While noting that the \n     information required to be disclosed in Buckley ``may be \n     information that the person prefers to keep secret, and \n     undoubtedly often gives away something about the spender's \n     political views,'' the Court reaffirmed that such disclosure \n     requirements are not barred by the First Amendment. Id.\n       For these reasons, I believe that the bill's limitation on \n     federal grantees' political advocacy and its accompanying \n     disclosure requirements would likely withstand constitutional \n     scrutiny.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Timothy E. Flanigan.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The Court stated:\n     ``Of course, if Congress were to adopt a revised version of \n     [the statute] that permitted noncommercial educational \n     broadcasting stations to establish `affiliate' organizations \n     which could then use the station's facilities to editorialize \n     with nonfederal funds, such a statutory mechanism would \n     plainly be valid under the reasoning of [Regan v. Taxation \n     With Representation, 461 U.S. 540 (1983)]. Under such a \n     statute, public broadcasting stations would be free, in the \n     same way that the charitable organization in Taxation With \n     Representation was free, to make known its views on matters \n     of public importance through its nonfederally funded, \n     editorializing affiliate without losing federal grants for \n     its noneditorializing broadcast activities.''\n     League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 400 (emphasis supplied). \n     The bill expressly adopts the same structure approved by the \n     Court in League of Women Voters. Organizations receiving \n     federal funds could create lobbying affiliates to engage \n     freely in political advocacy, but without federal funds.\n     \\2\\ It is important to note that the bill applies to all \n     grantees, corporate or non-profit. To the extent that \n     corporations receive grants, they would be subject to the \n     same restrictions as any ``public interest'' organization \n     receiving grants. Moreover, although the bill applies only to \n     federal grantees, federal contractors are already subject to \n     regulatory regimes restricting their lobbying activities. \n     See, e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 3.803 (requiring disclosure of lobbying activities), \n     Sec. 31.205-22 (restricting lobbying costs allocable to \n     federal contracts).\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, a few moments ago a Senator speaking said \nwe are trying to gag the nonprofits.\n  How clearly can I make myself to say no, no, no, it ain't true. This \nis the for-profits, too. These are the organizations that both lobby \nand receive grants and are for profit. They are included now. This is a \nmatter of reporting. This is a matter of choice. This is a matter of \nestablishing your priorities of what you are. This is not about \ngagging.\n  Are we gagging the 501(c)(3)'s? They do not believe so, because they \nare doing what they are supposed to do under the law. That is all we \nare establishing here is a priority and a criteria that we have already \nestablished in a variety of areas in the IRS Code of our country. There \nis absolutely nothing wrong with that approach.\n  If there is an organization that feels they are being gagged, I might \nsuggest that that organization is misusing the current law and find \nthemselves embarrassed because they got caught misusing the Federal \ndollar.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, imagine the 4-H Club being banned from \nreceiving any Federal grants because it spent too much money letting \npeople in the hard-to-reach areas of rural America know about changes \nto agricultural laws. Imagine Planned Parenthood being forced to spend \nmillions of dollars defending itself against suits filed by anyone \nideologically opposed to their mission. \n\n[[Page S 16878]]\n\n  Well, if House Republicans have their way, you have to imagine much \nlonger--you will be able to see it for yourself.\n  The authors of the so-called Contract With America would have you \nbelieve that they want to get government out of people's lives. \nApparently that commitment does not extend to people who disagree with \nthem. The Istook language is a thinly veiled attempt to gag non-profit \norganizations, to bind them up in bureaucratic red tape and prevent \nthem from letting Congress or the public know about the impacts of \nFederal legislation.\n  It is no wonder that the American people hold such a low opinion of \nCongress. Today, more than 5 weeks into the fiscal year, only 2 of the \n13 appropriation bills needed to run the Government have been signed \ninto law. But instead of making a serious attempt to pass a continuing \nresolution that will keep Federal workers at their desks, House \nRepublicans have chosen to send to the Senate a resolution sprinkled \nwith items from their ideological wish list.\n  There are 800,000 Federal employees who have bills to pay and \nfamilies to support, who will not be paid starting Tuesday if a \ncontinuing resolution is not passed. The Istook amendment has no place \nin the continuing resolution, it has no place in law. I urge my \ncolleagues to strike the Istook language and send the President a \ncontinuing resolution that he can sign.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I join in support of the motion to \nstrike the so-called Istook amendment from the continuing resolution. I \nwill not speak long because, as a Congress, we have spent far too much \ntime on this already and there is so much more we need to accomplish.\n  The Istook amendment is in my view nothing more than a solution in \nsearch of a problem.\n  Who could argue with this solution's ostensible justification--\nprohibiting Federal grantees from using tax dollars to lobby the \nGovernment. No one, I suspect. My evidence: this practice is already \nillegal, and has been for a long time.\n  If charities or other nonprofits are violating that law and all the \nregulations that govern how they account for and spend Federal grants \nthey may receive--and I have not heard persuasive evidence that they \nare--no new law and its accompanying regulatory burdens and bureaucracy \nshould be adopted before examining whether better enforcement of the \nexisting laws and regulations wouldn't address the problem. I though \nthat we had evolved as a Congress where our first response to a problem \nor a perceived problem was not slapping yet another layer of laws and \nbureaucracy on top of an already complicated regulatory structure. \nUsing Government funds to lobby is already illegal and charities are \nalready limited in what they can spend overall on lobbying and still \nretain their charitable tax status.\n  In my view, this proposal has a curious old government feel to it--\ndespite the revolutionary credentials of this amendment's proponents.\n  Similarly, the Istook provision has a Federal bias that I thought was \nno longer fashionable. It extends the Federal Government's regulatory \nreach into the affairs of local, private organizations, even affecting \nthe way they may spend their own, privately raised dollars. For \nexample, it defines political advocacy so broadly that local charities \nwill have to measure and document the time and resources they spend \ntrying to influence the decisions of local administrative bodies \nbecause they may be affiliated with national charities. Under the \nIstook provision, national charities and nonprofits must include the \npolitical advocacy expenses of any of its local affiliates in \ncalculating whether it has exceeded its threshold limit.\n  At year's end, will the Hartford, CT, chapter of the Boys & Girls \nClubs have to calculate whether the time and resources it would like to \nspend seeking permission from the local zoning board to expand its \nbuilding tip the national Boys & Girls Club operations over the Istook \nthreshold edge and put all Boys & Girls Clubs grants at risk?\n  I have to assume that the supporters of this amendment did not intend \nthat effect. But they have cobbled together such a complicated, layered \nregulatory scheme regulating so-called political advocacy at all levels \nof government, that absurd consequences are inevitable.\n  For example, the amendment limits the ability of Federal grantees to \npurchase or secure any goods or services from any other organization \nwhose expenditures for political advocacy for the previous Federal \nfiscal year exceeded the greater of $25,000 or 15 percent of the other \norganization's total expenditures. So not only will the charities and \nnonprofits that are subject to this provision have to keep detailed \nrecords concerning how much they spend on their own broadly defined \npolitical advocacy, but they will have to make sure that the local \nstationery or computer stores from which they are buying their supplies \nare documenting their expenditures for political advocacy.\n  In most cases, of course, those businesses won't likely be spending \nanywhere near 15-percent of their revenues on traditional lobbying, but \nit is not inconceivable that in a particular year, a small business \nmight spend that much in a combination of litigation challenging a \nState or Federal law or seeking a zoning variance or pursuing other \nlocal or State administrative challenges. Under Istook, all those \nactivities are considered political advocacy and would have to be \nincluded in the calculus of whether that small business has reached the \n15-percent threshold.\n  And, regardless of whether that 15-percent threshold is reached, the \nsmall businesses and others will still have to keep records if they \nwant to sell computers, furniture, or other products and services to \nFederal grantees like the A.S.P.C.A., the American Foundation for the \nBlind, CARE, World Vision or the American Lung Association, and MADD.\n  In summary, this solution will only succeed in wasting the time, \nresources, and energy of everyone that must comply with it and every \ngovernment agency that must implement it. It will enrich the lawyers \nand accountants who inevitably will be hired to decipher its byzantine \nregulatory structure. And, it will do all this, while not incidentally, \nimpinging upon the constitutional rights of millions of citizens across \nthe country to make their views known to their Federal, State, and \nlocal officials.\n  To quote from the executive director of the Litchfield, CT chapter of \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, which has received small NHTSA grants to \nconduct lifesaving highway safety programs, MADD has spent the last 15 \nyears trying to make drinking and driving socially unacceptable by the \nAmerican public and this outcry from the public has resulted in more \neffective laws, stronger enforcement and lives saved. I cannot believe \nthat the Senate would want to silence the voices of these drunk driving \ncrash victims and concerned citizens whose sole purpose is to save \nlives just because the organization they support with their donations \nreceives a small grant from the Federal Government to do good work.\n  Don't we have enough real problems to deal with without manufacturing \nartificial ones? Do we really want to adopt a convoluted new law on a \ncontinuing resolution that will do little other than get in the way of \nthe people who, on a day-to-day basis, are doing some of the most \nimportant work in our society--the Red Cross, the American Cancer \nSociety, the Boy Scouts of America, Catholic Charities. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the motion to strike.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I am pleased to see that Senator Simpson \nhas proposed to remove the so-called Istook amendment from this bill.\n  This is a bad idea. It is unconstitutional, and raises a host of \nimportant questions for which we have heard no adequate answers. It is \nclear to me right now that it must be stripped from this continuing \nresolution.\n  I fully agree with my friend and colleague from the Judiciary \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, that there is no way \nthis proposal will pass the Senate, and there is no reason for this \nproposal to be under debate here today.\n  We have not had a single hearing in the Senate on the impact of this \nradical rewriting of the laws covering the speech and freedom of \nassociation of \n\n[[Page S 16879]]\nthousands of charitable, non-profit organizations--not to mention the \nmillions of other organizations that would be caught in its net.\n  It adds new, unexamined restrictions on the activities of this \ncountry's most valuable and honored local and national charitable \norganizations.\n  From my own State of Delaware, I have heard from the YMCA, from the \nBoys' and Girls' Clubs, from the Delaware Nature Society, from Delaware \nEaster Seals, the Delaware Chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, \nfrom Mothers Against Drunk Driving, from virtually all of the non-\nprofit organizations that serve my State.\n  Madam President, all of them have told me that this proposal would \nstrike at the heart of their most critical functions--to administer, at \nthe local level, grants to keep our kids off drugs, or to educate the \npublic about life-threatening diseases.\n  The Istook provision threatens these groups with legal action if they \nrun afoul of an Orwellian web of restrictions, spending rules, \nreporting requirements--limits on whom they can associate with, and \nwhat they can say.\n  Madam President, this proposal would create a thought police of \nprivate citizens--who, for a 25 percent share of the treble damages \nlevied against, say, the Mothers Against Drunk Driving, would have the \nincentive to drag them into court to prove that they did not purchase--\nwith their own funds--office supplies from a business that spent 16, \ninstead of 15, percent of its own funds for political advocacy the \nprevious year.\n  This proposal extends the long arm of Federal Government restrictions \nto the very local charitable organizations we are told should really be \ndoing the jobs now done by Federal bureaucrats.\n  What hypocrisy, Madam President! On the one hand, we are told that \ndecentralized, local, community-based groups should take up the burden \nof supporting those hit hardest by cuts in Federal assistance programs.\n  But on the other hand, it is those very groups that this proposal \nwould threaten if they trip over any number of arcane reporting \nrequirements or ambiguous limits on ``political advocacy.''\n  And let us not kid our selves, Madam President--this is intended to \ntrip them up. That is why they removed Veterans from the coverage of \nthe bill--because enough of us complained about it.\n  That is a clear admission that the bill will hurt non-profits. The \nproblem is that they have only protected one group--not all of the \nothers equally deserving of protection, instead of the vindictive \nharassment of this proposal.\n  The groups still affected by this proposal are those who have been \nchosen to fulfill public policy goals through grants to engage in \noutreach, education, and other activities.\n  Those grants purchase a service--from the Boys' and Girls' Clubs, \nfrom the YMCA, from the Easter Seal Society--to promote public policy \ngoals. Those goals include healthier, drug free kids, cleaner air--\ngoals that are indeed well-served by local, decentralized groups.\n  Take one example of how this could work. Imagine a local non-profit \ngroup in Dover, DE, like the Big Brothers and Big Sisters--a group that \nreceives Federal grant funds and engages in the activities restricted \nunder this proposal--advocating and encouraging others to advocate for \npolicies that help children.\n  Anyone looking for a 25 percent share of the treble damages--three \ntimes the amount of the grant--would have the incentive to find some \nshortcoming in the reporting, some illegal association, some proscribed \nexpression on an issue of public policy, that would expose the group to \nlitigation.\n  The burden of proof would be on them to prove that they were in \ncompliance.\n  Imagine what well-funded corporate interests could do with a few \nwell-placed lawsuits that kept those pesky non-profits tied up in court \nand in legal costs instead of engaging in government-restricted \n``political advocacy.''\n  Today's Wall Street Journal chronicles the fight between Beer \nWholesalers and Mothers Against Drunk Driving, focusing on the impact \nof the Istook proposal on non-profit groups. I am sure we can imagine \nmany other ways this provision could be used to chill the advocacy work \nof groups that some people might find inconvenient.\n  Madam President, the American people certainly want reform in the way \nwe do business around here. But this is not what they want--a tool in \nthe hands of powerful special interests to silence non-profit \ncharities.\n  This is a nightmare, a page out of the play book of every petty, \nsmall-minded despot who tried to stamp out inconvenient opinions.\n  It puts every organization of any kind--every business that receives \nanything of value from the Federal Government--on notice that they not \nonly are under restrictions on their own political activities, but must \nmonitor the activities of those they do business with.\n  It recruits a thought police with a financial incentive to seek out \nevery misstep by every local chapter of every national charity.\n  Madam President, this proposal has no business on this bill. It has \nno business on the floor of the Senate today or any other day.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, again, colleagues are trying to figure \nout how to vote on this thing. This is significant change in law. It is \nsignificantly more than what was passed, and I supported the Senator \nfrom Wyoming when he had an amendment earlier. This is 17 pages long. \nThis is not a little modification. This is 17 pages long. It is not \nclear to me at all what the impact of this is going to be. I know it \nexpands considerably from what this body voted on before.\n  But what I object to most of all is that we are being told that a \ncontinuing resolution to allow the appropriations process to go forward \nis not going to pass in the House of Representatives unless the Senate \nagrees to this provision. That is what we are being told.\n  Last week, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming--and I supported \nhim--raised a point of order against an attempt to lift the earnings \ncap on Social Security income and reference it to a committee. That \nshould be referenced to a committee. In this particular case, we are \nsaying no, this is so important, we have to attach it to the continuing \nresolution.\n  We are being held up, Madam President, by a small group of people, \nand I urge colleagues, I know there will be a lot of them coming down \nhere and saying, ``Well, I guess I have to vote for the Simpson \namendment, it probably is all right.'' It probably is not all right. \nThere are 17 pages in there.\n  I know there are more 501(c)(4)'s because we lowered the floor from \n$10 to $3 million, and the language in here looks to me to be pretty \nambiguous in a couple of areas. What we are basically doing is changing \nthe Internal Revenue Service Code. This is a change in the law as \nrelates to the Internal Revenue Service Code, and all these \norganizations are going to have to ask themselves the question: How am \nI going to make sure I am in compliance?\n  In order to demonstrate they are in compliance, they are going to \nhave to do things they currently do not do. The Senator from Wyoming \ncame down and targeted a few 501(c)(4)'s that are a problem. Using \npublic money to lobby is illegal now, so if there is a problem, if I \nhave a 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) that is lobbying in an illegal fashion, \nlet us file a charge against them, for gosh sakes. That is typically \nthe conservative approach.\n  For gosh sakes, let us not just change the law to apply to everybody \nif I have a few bad apples out there. Let us target it and make sure we \nmake those organizations that are receiving public money, if they are \nusing the public money to lobby, let us file a criminal or civil charge \nagainst them.\n  No, that is not what we do. We have a couple of people over in the \nHouse of Representatives who were opposed by some 501(c)(3) or \n501(c)(4) and they are on a vendetta, and they say, ``I don't care if I \nshut the Government down.'' That is their position. They said it \npublicly. Mr. Istook said: I do not care if the Government shuts down. \nI do not care what happens to the country. I want to get my revenge. I \nwant to get my little pound of flesh here.\n  The next thing I want to say is this is a substantive thing. All of \nus are out there at the community level and trying to figure out what \ndo I do about \n\n[[Page S 16880]]\nchild support problems; what do I do out there with programs dealing \nwith domestic violence; what do I do with child care, and so forth?\n  Guess what? We hold a meeting out there and who do we meet with? We \nmeet with 501(c)(3)'s and 501(c)(4)'s. We are asking them to take on \nmore responsibility as we cut back and try to balance our budget. That \nis what we are doing.\n  The very moment that occurs, we are passing legislation that--as I \nsaid, I do not know what the impact is going to be, but I know from the \nIRS evaluation that they are going to request a lot more information \nthan they are currently requesting from hundreds--I am not going to say \nit is every 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4), but it is dramatically more than \nwhat this body voted on in the Treasury-Postal appropriations.\n  Make no mistake, the reason we are taking it up here is the group \nthat supported it over in the House could not even get a majority in \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. They are willing to shut it \ndown. They are willing to say, ``I know I don't have a majority. I know \nI don't have the votes to get this thing done. I don't care. But I'm \ngoing to threaten and I am going to use the threat, if possible, to try \nto get this thing done,'' even though, as I said, most of us have not \neven had the chance to evaluate what this is going to do.\n  I supported the effort of the Senator from Wyoming to put \nrestrictions on 501(c)(4)'s, a $10 million limitation. This drops that \ndown to $3 million. It has some language in there.\n  I am not saying every 501(c)(3) is going to be affected, but it \ncertainly appears to me that a number of them, if not a large number of \nthem, are. The IRS is going to at least have to ask the question, if \nthat is the case.\n  I believe that we should vote no on this amendment. The Senator from \nWyoming and the Senator from Idaho have made a good-faith effort to try \nto produce something that would be a compromise with this minority in \nthe House, 70 of whom have written a letter saying, ``We're not going \nto vote for a continuing resolution unless we get this done.''\n  One more thing. The American people want us to reform our lobbying \nlaws and campaign finance reform laws. Madam President, this is very \nsignificant. I know some disagree. Some on my side said this really is \nnot lobbying reform. I see it as at least tangentially lobbying reform. \nThe House has not passed lobbying reform. These very Members that are \noffering this language, why do they not force their leadership to pass \nlobbying reform? This body passed lobbying reform. This body passed \nlegislation.\n  I ask them, you are out there talking about lobbyists interfering \nwith the process, you are out there talking about the special interests \ndoing this or that and the other thing, why do you not enact the Senate \nlegislation, let us conference that and change the law having to do \nwith lobbying?\n  Let us do the same thing with campaign finance reform. I endorsed the \nproposal of Senator McCain, Senator Thompson, and Senator Simpson last \nweek. We have to change the law so people feel more power and greater \nopportunity to participate in democracy. Far too many people believe \nthat the special interests control the process around here, but very \nfew of us honestly would say, we understand special interests around \nhere, but who are the dominant special interests?\n  Come to mind the dominant special interests, the YMCA? Come to mind, \nwhen you are trying to think of the dominant special interest hanging \nout in the rotunda out here that have the greatest money influence, the \nRed Cross? Did they spend a lot of money on the telecom bill? I do not \nthink so. I do not see any full-page ads from the Red Cross saying, \n``Support disaster relief appropriations.'' They have a relatively \nsmall amount of impact.\n  If you really want to clean this process up, pass lobbying reform \nalong the lines of what the Senate did. Pass campaign finance reform in \na bipartisan way. It is long overdue that this body does it. For far \ntoo long, we have acted as if we are more concerned about covering our \nrear ends and keeping our jobs than we are in seeing that democracy \nfunctions in a fashion and the taxpaying citizens feels they have an \nopportunity to influence what we do.\n  This amendment should be rejected and we should, furthermore, as we \nreject it say to the House of Representatives, ``When it is time to do \na continuing resolution, we are going to do a continuing resolution. We \nare going to keep the Government going, and we are not going to kowtow \nto a relatively small number of people who want to change our laws.''\n  Moreover, for those who look at the detail of the legislation, once \nyou get beyond that, we have to say this just goes too far. It goes too \nfar. It goes too far. Where have I heard that before? I hear it almost \nevery time I go home.\n  This is not in the Contract With America. This was not asked for when \nthe so-called mandate was given last November. I hope that my \ncolleagues, for a whole range of reasons, will reject this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I intend to vote against this amendment. \nThe Senator from Nebraska, I think, makes a persuasive and compelling \ncase. I want to stand up and discuss a little bit the process that has \nbrought us to this point.\n  How many deadlines have been missed? How many dates have been \nignored? How many circumstances that are required of us in law have \nbeen essentially disregarded with respect to the budget process, the \nreconciliation process?\n  We now have a continuing resolution on the floor of the Senate. Why \ndo we have that? It is because the Congress has not done its business. \nThe fact is, we did not meet budget deadlines; we did not meet the \nreconciliation deadline; we did not meet appropriations bills \ndeadlines.\n  Now, the Republicans control the Congress. They won the last \nelection. They have an agenda called the Contract With America. Some of \nit has made some sense. I voted for some of it. Some of it is totally \ngoofy, totally off the wall, and is never going to get passed and never \nshould be passed. But because they have a lot of new people who brag \nabout the little experience they have in legislating, and because we \nnow find ourselves with a contract that includes proposals that make no \nsense--you know, to go sell our lakes so that we can get some short-\nterm money in to reduce the deficit.\n  I do not understand some of this thinking. Sell the dams and lakes so \nwe can jack up electric power rates and sell them to the private \nutility companies. Sell the fishing lakes. This makes no sense at all. \nThere are a whole series of proposals that make no sense. But because \nthat is the agenda, and we have those folks bragging about how little \nexperience they have legislating, we now find ourselves with this \nrecord.\n  One party controls all of Congress and presumably has the votes to do \nwhat it wants to do. Well, on April 1, the Senate Budget Committee is \nrequired, by law, to report a budget resolution to the Senate. That was \n45 days late. It did not get here on April 1. Nobody was stopping them \nfrom doing their work. It just did not get here. So 45 days later it \ngot to the Senate.\n  On April 15, the law says that the Congress should complete action on \nits budget resolution. Well, 75 days later that happened. It did not \nhappen on April 15; it happened on June 29.\n  The House Appropriations Committee is to report its bills out by June \n10. Well, that did not happen on June 10; it happened on October 26--\n138 days later.\n  The law says that on June 15, the Congress should complete action on \nthe budget reconciliation. Well, that is 5 months and still counting. \nWe have not completed action on that. That is why we are here today on \nthe floor of the Senate on a Thursday talking about a continuing \nresolution, which has now been amended by some people who want to talk \nabout lobbying reform on a CR that is necessary because the majority \nparty has not been able to do its work for 5 months to get a \nreconciliation bill, as required by law, on the floor by June 15.\n  I do not understand this notion of efficiency or effectiveness from a \nparty that is supposed to do something by June 15, and now, as a result \nof not doing it, requires us to debate a CR, and then they bring to us \nsome last-minute 15- or 20-page amendment on lobbying reform--a \nposition they say is required because the new people in the \n\n[[Page S 16881]]\nHouse will not accept anything less, despite the fact that the House \nhas not passed lobbying reform.\n  Forgive me, my school was a small one--a high school class of nine--\nand I thought I graduated near the top, but I just do not understand \nwhat we are talking about here. Congress is to pass all appropriations \nbills by September 30.\n  The fact is, in times past, when the Democrats controlled the \nCongress, we did not always get all these bills passed by September 30. \nBut you cannot find a much worse record than you will find this year. \nYou cannot find a record that is much worse than what happened this \nyear on appropriations bills. Virtually none of them have gotten \nthrough this process.\n  First of all, we are talking about 5 months--we missed, by 5 months, \nthe requirements in law for the reconciliation process. And because of \nthat, we have to do a continuing resolution and also a debt extension.\n  Now we find ourselves here, on the eve of all of this, doing a tap \ndance with a bunch of folks who brag that they can shut the Government \ndown, they can cause a default. They might want to brag about that, but \nI do not know who they would want to brag to. It is not much of an \naccomplishment in my book.\n  The American people ought to expect us to decide to do what we should \ndo by law--pass these bills, meet and do the compromises that are \nnecessary. You can think of, over a couple of hundred years, some \npretty difficult circumstances that created wide divisions between \npeople in this Chamber and in the House of Representatives, wide \ndivisions between the parties, and the requirements of a democracy, \neven though it is not very efficient, is that somehow, in some way, at \nsome appropriate point you come together and compromise and reach a \nconclusion. Presumably, you do it with the best interest of the country \nin mind.\n  We have a circumstance now where we are told that, well, we cannot \nreach a conclusion. We have a Contract With America, they say, and this \ncontract with America says the center pole of our tent is a big tax \ncut. It is true, we are in debt up to our neck. It is also true that \nevery dollar of the tax cut will be borrowed during the next 7 years. \nIt is also true that we will add hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars to the Federal debt. But we need a tax cut. If we do not get \nthis tax cut, half of which will go to families earning over $100,000 a \nyear or more, then we are prepared to shut the Government down. We are \nprepared to decide that we will not meet our debt obligations. The \nAmerican Government will default on its debts. That is what they say.\n\n  I hope that Members of the House and the Senate, on both sides of the \npolitical aisle, will decide that this is not the time to offer \namendments. Let us pass the continuing resolution. Let us do what we \nare required to do--provide a bridge by which we then seriously \nnegotiate away the differences in the reconciliation package, pass the \nreconciliation bill, tell the American people that we understand what \nconcerns them. We are spending more than we are taking in, and we are \ncharging the bill to the kids in the future, and we have to stop that. \nSo they have not thoughtfully tried to compromise our way through this \nprocess. And we are reducing the budget deficit, we are going to \nbalance the budget, and we are going to do it the right way.\n  But it ought not be a source of pride for anyone to decide that they \ncan, by themselves--or a group of like-minded people--decide to shut \nthis Government down in the coming day or two.\n  I guess my hope is that we can decide in the next few hours here, in \nthe next couple of days as well, that this kind of amendment does not \nbelong on this. The Senator from Idaho knows this does not belong on \nthis CR. He knows that. Everybody on that side of the aisle knows that. \nThis is not a place to stick these amendments.\n  The Senator from Minnesota stood here and spoke about people freezing \nin the winter. I can think of 100 people who would like to offer an \namendment to a CR because they have something that just gnaws at them, \nwhich they know is wrong and they want to fix. You know that a \nPresident would have to sign a CR at some point to keep the Government \nopen. So everybody in this Chamber could stand up and insist that, ``On \nmy watch, I intend to do this, and I can care less whether it is \ninefficient or dilatory.'' Everybody has that right.\n  The fact is, that is not the right way to do it. This amendment does \nnot belong here. This is a continuing resolution, a short-term \ncontinuing resolution, a bridge to get from here to there, a bridge \nthat creates a time during which, hopefully, both parties can come \ntogether and resolve these differences.\n  I do not think there ought to be a tax cut. Further, I do not happen \nto think we ought to add $7 billion to military spending or to build \nstar wars, and I do not think we ought to buy 20 new B-2 bombers at $32 \nbillion each. I do not think we ought to kick 55,000 kids off of Head \nStart, or that we ought to take disabled veterans and say, ``We do not \nthink you should have health care.''\n  I think what we ought to do is decide where we disagree and see if we \ncan think through this clearly and patiently, over a period of days, \nand reach a solution. I know there is a lot of politics involved--\nprobably on all of our parts here--when we talk about these things. But \nin the final analysis, a default is not about politics; it is about the \nfailure of all of us to do what we ought to do. A shutdown of \nGovernment services is not about politics. That is about failure.\n  Shame on everyone in this Chamber and in the House Chamber if this \nGovernment defaults. Shame on everybody in politics if there is a \ndefault on the debt obligations, or if there is a shutdown of \nGovernment. It ought not happen, it should not happen, and every single \nperson serving in Congress ought to work to prevent it from happening.\n  We can, through some basic level of cooperation, decide to start at \nthis moment, especially on a continuing resolution--yes, even on a \nshort-term bridge with respect to the debt--get from here to there so \nwe can negotiate away these differences and reach an acceptable \ncompromise that is good for this country. That is what the American \npeople require of us. That is what the American people expect of us.\n\n  Now, I am sure the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Wyoming, \nboth of whom I have great respect for, they are both good legislators, \nI am sure they feel they are offering this amendment because there is \nleverage on another side, and this is the right public policy anyway so \nwe should respond to it.\n  The fact is, I can think of, as I said, 100 different people who want \nto offer something that they think will advance their interests or the \ninterests of the country on this very legislation, but it ought not be \nadvanced on this legislation.\n  We ought to pass this short-term CR and we ought to pass a short-term \ndebt extension. We ought to get the leaders of both political parties \nin the House and the Senate together, pronto, to sit down and address \nthese questions in a thoughtful way and come to a conclusion that the \nAmerican people expect.\n  Madam President, I will have more to say on the CR later. I wanted to \nmake the point that I made when I started. We have been subject to a \nlot of criticism--we Democrats. I understand that. Part of it, \nincidentally, is well deserved.\n  I understand we were in charge for some long while. There were times \nwhen we did not do the right things. We overspent, we were too \nprogrammatic; every national ache we put a quarter in the vending \nmachine, and go on to address another problem before we determine if \nthat program worked.\n  I understand it is our fault and I accept that. But we have made life \na lot better for a lot of Americans.\n  I say to those who are now running the Congress and who are now \nresponsible for meeting these deadlines, this is not much of a record. \nWe find ourselves toward the end of the year and we have a circumstance \nwhere a reconciliation bill that was supposed to have been passed over \n5 months ago is nowhere near being passed--not even out of conference; \na CR that is necessary to get us over the hump is now on the floor of \nthe Senate and being tortured with amendments.\n  That is no way to run a railroad and no way to run a Senate. I hope \nwe can meet deadlines and meet our responsibilities, solve problems and \nadvance \n\n[[Page S 16882]]\nthe interests of this country, and I hope we can start doing that in \nthe next couple of days. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I will be brief. I think the Senator from \nOhio wants to speak.\n  I have been listening to my colleague, and what I am hearing, does \nthat meet the straight-face test? Well, it did not. I tried it on and \nit did not work because continuing resolutions under some other party's \ncontrol--let me talk about 1986, after the Senate had been regained.\n  Continuing resolution: Export-Import Bank, denial of MFN status for \nproducts to Afghanistan, Federal Salary Act amendments, child care \nservices, Federal employees, Ethics in Government Act, all on a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota and I prefer a clean continuing \nresolution but it has not happened very often in the Congress of the \nUnited States. So it really does not mean a great deal to come to the \nfloor and argue that when in 1987 we brought a continuing resolution \nover it contained all 13 appropriations bills. That is reality. That is \nreal.\n  It contained a Defense Acquisition Improvement Act, it contained \nPaperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act, human rights for Romania, \nschool lunch and child nutrition amendments, Aviation Safety Commission \nAct, metropolitan Washington airport--all things, very important, that \ngot stuck on a continuing resolution.\n  In 1988--as I think back, I think his party was in control of the \nSenate; he might well have been here at that time--contained all 13 \nappropriations bills once again. Cancellation of fiscal year 1987 \nsequestration order. Special House and Senate procedures for \nconsidering funding requests, and so on and so forth. In 1991, \nextension of certain Medicare hospital payments provisions.\n  The point is made, Madam President, the point is made that continuing \nresolutions have been and remain vehicles to move legislation on in \nthis Congress.\n  What is important for our colleagues tonight as I think we are very \nclose to voting on these amendments, Madam President, is to remember if \nyou want to strike the Istook amendment you vote for the Simpson-Craig \namendment. Several of our colleagues have said that is what they want \nto do. But they want to retain the essence of the language that they \nvoted for some weeks ago. That is exactly what the amendments of the \nSenator from Wyoming and my amendments do.\n  If you want to pass Istook and fail to pass our amendments, what will \nthe House do to the CR? I am not sure. I do not understand what might \nhappen. I do understand what could happen.\n  That is, if we take the simple amendments that bring us back to where \nwe were, the majority of the Senators, a unanimous vote of the Senators \nwith some modifications now, placed us some weeks ago with a \nsubstantial assurance if we do that we will pass the CR as we have it \nbefore us, that is how we ought to vote. That vote means that you vote \nfor the Simpson-Craig amendments.\n  Madam President, we are well behind on the work of the Congress. \nAgain, I think of the straight-face test on those arguments. The \nSenator from North Dakota knows about 60 votes. He knows it well. He \nknows what has happened here, on the floor and in committee, and the \nvery clear obstructionist tactics that have occurred on occasion on \nthis floor that put us where we are today--needing to use a continuing \nresolution.\n  The majority leader and the Speaker of the House for 25 hours were \nwith the President of the United States just the last week and the \nPresident never once wanted to discuss the very critical nature of the \nbudget, the debt limit, and the continuing resolution in that unique \nopportunity.\n  Now, I wish the President would come to the table, but he stays in \nthe White House and all he talks about is veto, veto, veto.\n  Well, the Senator from North Dakota talks about the urgency of this \nCR. How urgent is it if the President is now saying, ``I will veto \nit''? It does not seem to be very urgent. It appears this President \nwishes to play the political game. He, too, has a responsibility for \nrunning the Government of this country.\n  I say, Mr. President, come out of the White House, get away from your \nveto game, come to the table. We are trying to move substantive \nlegislation to deal with the priorities of this Congress and the \nresponsibilities of managing this Government.\n  I hope we could pass the CR. I hope we could pass it with the \nSimpson-Craig amendments. Mr. President, I hope you sign it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I will yield in a moment to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, but I ask my distinguished colleagues who made the \nremarks about the trip and the President not being willing to discuss \nthings, it is my understanding when that chart was made from people \nthat were there, sitting with Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, that \nthe President was back half a dozen times or so, had lengthy \ndiscussions with him about things and was told that they still did not \nhave their side together on some of these issues and did not want to \ndiscuss them.\n  I was told that by a person who was present, right there, at the \ntime. I think as far as the President not coming out of the White \nHouse, that is not true.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator allow me to respond very briefly?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I can only state what the majority leader told me as it \nrelates to him having been there. That is not secondhand. That is \nfirsthand.\n  Mr. GLENN. The firsthand was a person sitting beside him at the same \ntime.\n  I yield to the Senator without losing my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I heard this and read it in the newspaper and I have \ntalked to someone who was there with the President.\n  I do not know that we need to discuss it at great length, but the \nfact is the story the Senator from Idaho recounts is not true. The \nSenator from Idaho was not there, but we have heard from people who \nwere and I do not know that we need to discuss that much further.\n  I can only charitably describe the Senator from Idaho's argument that \nbecause something was done in 1986 to the CR, ``I am justified in \noffering amendments now,'' I can only characterize that argument as \npursuing business as usual. It is the same response I got on the issue \nof Social Security, the trust fund and so on. Business as usual is not \nwhat the American people expect.\n  I already admitted that we did not always move this agenda the way we \nshould have. You look a long while before you find us 5 months late on \na reconciliation bill, and it is a little specious to suggest that the \nreason the reconciliation bill is not on the floor of the Senate is \nbecause Democrats offered 30 amendments. Everybody knows that is not \nthe case. Everybody knows that is not the case. The reason the \nreconciliation bill did not get here is because the majority party \ncould not get its work done.\n\n  It is one thing to want to drive the train. It is another thing to \ndrive it on time. The circumstance we find ourselves in now is a \nreconciliation bill that was supposed to be here and done by June 15, \nwas not done, was not here, and it was not our fault. It was the people \nwho were running this place who could not get agreement among their own \ntroops.\n  I guess the point I want to make is, I think the defense I heard is, \n``We are for business as usual.'' That is what the Senator from Idaho \nis saying. Business as usual is not good enough, not good enough for \nthe American people and not good enough for us. And I hope business as \nusual, one of these days, is dead and buried, and reform and change is \nthe notion of the day. That would include, in my judgment, all of us \ndeciding to pass a clean CR, create a bridge during which, in the next \nseveral days, we can resolve these issues on behalf of the American \npeople and move forward.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I believe Senator Jeffords wished to give his statement. I \nyield to him without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S 16883]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nCampbell's motion to strike from the continuing resolution the language \nrestricting political advocacy with private funds. I am opposed to the \ninclusion of this language in the continuing resolution, and in any \nbill. This provision is nothing more than a political slogan in search \nof a problem.\n  There is probably not a Member of Congress that has not been on the \nreceiving end of criticism from a group or groups that receive Federal \nfunds. It is irritating at times, but it is hardly cause for closing \ndown the Government.\n  Nor is it sufficient justification for forcing organizations to \nchoose between seeking grants to do work on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment and saying how they think that Government, or any government \nfor that matter, can be improved.\n  It seems to me that we should invite such criticism rather than \ndiscourage it. Instead, this provision is designed to dampen debate \nfrom some of the parties that are in the best position to add to it.\n  Apart from being questionable public policy, I think this provision \nis of questionable legality. Everybody has a lawyer's opinion to \nbuttress his or her position, but it seems strange to me how this \nprovision can withstand judicial scrutiny. It must have seemed strange \nto its proponents as well, because they felt constrained to include \nsection 306, which states that ``Nothing in this title shall be deemed \nto abridge any rights guaranteed under the First Amendment.''\n  I doubt this is a novel approach, but I cannot off the top of my head \nthink of a similar situation where we have attempted to anticipate and \ndecide a near certain legal challenge. I have my doubts how much \ndeference the courts will give this provision.\n  The Supreme Court has long held that it is an important first \namendment right for individuals to be able to freely talk to their \nelected representatives. While the Federal Government is allowed to \nplace restrictions on the use of the Federal money it grants, the \nSupreme Court has expressed concerns in the past with the Federal \nGovernment placing restrictions on the use of purely private money to \ntalk to their elected representatives.\n  The provision before us would change dramatically how private funds \ncould be used by Federal grantees. Under current law, tax exempt groups \ndo face limits on the amount of lobbying they may conduct. But those \nlimits would undergo a wholesale transformation. Not just lobbying of \nCongress would be restricted, but so, too, would be lobbying of city \ncouncils, State agencies, and State legislatures. As a result, if your \nState chamber of commerce has an employee or two that lobbies in the \nState house, the executive branch or enters into judicial or agency \nproceedings, it might well be barred from seeking Federal funds to \npromote economic development or tourism.\n  Further, the imposition of these restrictions will create a whole new \npractice for lawyers. This language provides incentives for lawyers to \nsue organizations by rewarding them with a substantial share of \nrecovered dollars. Organizations could be sued for up to 10 years, \nfurther clogging up the American courts. In a time when the Congress is \ntrying to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits, creating this new \nboon for lawyers is counter productive.\n  There are many small organizations in my State of Vermont that \nreceive Federal funds that would be unable to effectively communicate \nwith their local officials because of the limits that these \nrestrictions will place on them. These restrictions will keep my \nconstituents from discussing such local issues as the school board, \nproperty taxes, and paving roads with their local or State \nrepresentatives. I would like to include for the Record a brief \ndescription of some programs in my State of Vermont that will be \naffected by these restrictions if they are enacted.\n  Mr. President, let me again reiterate my strong opposition to the \ninclusion of this language in the continuing resolution, and strongly \nurge my colleagues to support Senator Campbell's motion to strike.\n  I ask unanimous consent a brief description of the programs be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Vermont\n\n       Addison County Parent Child Center uses a part of their \n     federal grant money to maintain a program for young fathers \n     who have been disenfranchised from the education system and \n     from business. Many of these young men have had problems in \n     the judicial system as well. This program teaches them not \n     only parenting skills, but includes a job training component. \n     The Center serves over 150 families in Addison County.\n       The Center also helps these families learn to have a voice \n     in their local and state governments. As a part of their \n     family empowerment program, they take these low income young \n     families with them to the state legislature to teach them \n     about their government and how their voices can be heard.\n       Vermont Development Disabilities Council is funded by a \n     federal grant authorized under the Developmental Disabilities \n     Act (P.L. 103-230). A significant portion of the grant \n     dollars are used to teach parents how to protect their rights \n     and improve the availability of services. Federal money is \n     also used to fund the publication of a newspaper. The \n     Independent, which reports on issues of concern to the \n     disabled and the elderly.\n       The Council has also worked to change Vermont building \n     access standards to comply with those of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act. Currently, the state of Vermont uses \n     antiquated building access codes that provide less than \n     adequate access for the disabled and the elderly.\n       The Vermont Public Transportation Association receives \n     federal money in part through Medicaid and the Federal \n     Highway State Fund, a large portion of which they use to \n     provide public transportation for people to and from doctors' \n     offices and hospitals. Many of these people are elderly and \n     disabled. The Association has 1,300 volunteer drivers who \n     make over 420,000 one way trips a year transporting people to \n     hospitals which, in some cases, are as far as 50 miles away.\n       The Association advocates on behalf of the elderly and \n     disabled in these rural communities on a variety of \n     transportation issues.\n       The American Heart Association in Willston, Vermont \n     receives federal money through the State Department of \n     Health, some of which they use to form community based anti-\n     smoking coalitions for youth. Their federal dollars are used \n     to teach children not to smoke. They also advocate on behalf \n     of these children in order to pass legislation that would \n     keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to those in \nopposition to the Istook amendment which the House has added to this \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Advocates, if I can use that term, of this provision have clothed it \nin rather attractive language. It has been presented as ending \n``Welfare for Lobbyists,'' as they call it. If this were truly the \ncase, in fact, if this were a commercial product, I reckon that the FTC \nwould be investigating it for false claims. It is a real misnomer.\n  For one truly expert in this area, turn to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Michigan [Mr. Levin]. He and I spent many years on \nlegislation to achieve real lobbying reform, which we finally passed \nthis summer. That measure truly brings sunshine and accountability into \nthe netherworld of lobbying by special interest groups. The public \nfinally will be able to know who is paying what to whom to lobby \nCongress and the administration on which issue. Whether it is a dubious \nproject or a special tax loophole.\n  That is real and substantive lobbying reform. I find it curious that \nmany of the proponents of the Istook amendment--and their outside \nallies--have been so strangely silent--almost invisible--about pushing \nthis bill on the House side. If they had spent half as much time on \ntrue lobbying reform legislation as this assault on nonprofit and \ncharitable organizations, dare I say this reform would have already \nbeen signed into law by the President. So while I do not doubt their \nsincerity, I do question their motives.\n  One Member whose motives and sincerity I do not question is the \nsenior Senator from Wyoming. I know that he has attempted to explore \nsome of these issues through the committee hearing process, as it \nshould be done. I also know that he has worked hard in trying to \nnegotiate an acceptable compromise.\n  The amendment offered by Mr. Istook will have a profound and chilling \neffect on the ability of nonprofit and charitable organizations to \ncontinue advocating on the behalf of people and issues. It will have a \ndevastating effect on the whole nonprofit sector, particularly small \ncommunity-based organizations.\n\n[[Page S 16884]]\n\n  It will impose severe burdens and mounds of paperwork on nonprofit \ngroups. This, at a time when we are asking them to provide more public \nservices while we provide less money. ``Try to privatize things,'' so \nwe are told here, yet we are making it more difficult to do exactly \nthat. Again, I find it very ironic that many of the ardent proponents \nin this ill-conceived endeavor have been leaders in the effort to cut \nout regulatory red tape and reduce the costs of paperwork on businesses \nand industry. But for these nonprofits we will be creating more rules, \nmore bureaucracy, and more court litigation. We will just drown them in \na sea of paperwork and audits.\n\n  This legislation is also unnecessary. It restricts the amount of \nprivately raised funds a Federal grantee can use to do advocacy and \nlobbying. But current law already metes out harsh penalties if such \nFederal funds are used by nonprofits and charitable groups to pay for \nsuch lobbying activities. And my understanding is that there is no \norchestrated pattern of such organizations misusing Federal funds to \nlobby.\n  So if we peel away this veneer, it is not quite what you do with the \nmoney, it is what you say. And just maybe, who you say it to, which, in \nturn, raises a constitutional issue. For the Supreme Court has ruled it \nviolates the first amendment to condition the receipt of Federal funds \non relinquishing protected rights of speech. This amendment will have a \nchilling effect on the right of citizens--individuals and associations \nalike--to petition their Government.\n  I also have concerns with the definition used for ``political \nadvocacy.''\n  It is so broad that almost any public role assumed by a nonprofit or \ncharitable group on an issue or matter before Federal, State, or local \ngovernments would be covered. Moreover, individuals receiving some form \nof public assistance--such as WIC, disaster relief funds, NIH research \ngrants, LIHEAP grants, you name it--could also be regulated.\n  Now if a Federal grantee spends more than the specified threshold on \nadvocacy, it will be barred from receiving Federal grants. Grantees \nwill also be limited in who they associate or do business with. They \nwill need certification from all of their vendors that they--the \nsuppliers--are within the specified limits on how they use their own \nmoney for political advocacy.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that one of the original \nrequirements which has since been changed in the amendment as now \nproposed would have sent some of the complaints over to GAO for further \ninvestigation. That in its original form points out some of the \nweaknesses in some of our budget cutting here today because you talk \nabout the potential of sheer frivolous lawsuits, and one of the things \nthey were going to do with the original version of this as the main \nenforcement mechanism was going to be through what could be called a \nbounty hunter provision where any citizen could have taken their \ncomplaints regarding the use of such funds by these organizations \ndirectly to an agency inspector general, or the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  While I want to point out in the original version of this we have \nalready cut GAO by 25 percent in 2 years, at the same time we are going \nto assign them an additional tax. I know this has now been cut out. I \nwanted to point that out--that this is what we are doing in one piece \nof legislation after another; requiring some of these agencies to do \nmore at the same time we cut their budgets.\n  We have been dealing in complex, substantive, constitutional, \nphilosophical, and policy terms. But where is the impact going to be \nfelt the most? The impact will be on real people; people with real \nproblems, people who need help, who need society's help the most. These \nare the people most vulnerable in today's world, and who will depend so \nmuch on the nonprofit groups for essential services as Federal funding \ngets slashed.\n\n  I have received many letters from Ohioans on the Istook amendment. \nThese are people helping the homeless, caring for the sick, providing \nshelter to abused women and children, and treating the mentally \nimpaired. Listen to their voices. Hear their pleas, at least while \nthey're allowed to make them known to us. They are on the front-lines--\nwe need their input, we need their help.\n  Mr. President, their pleas are just heartrending, some of them. They \nare trying their level best to give people help, and this would cut \nback on their ability to do exactly that. Here is what they are saying:\n\n                 Ohioans Speak Out on Istook Amendment\n\n       The Columbus YWCA Interfaith Hospitality Network has a \n     volunteer base of over 7,000 individuals and 100 religious \n     congregations attempting through grassroots efforts to \n     provide comfort and short-term hospitality to homeless \n     families. During 1994 we served over 2000 individuals of \n     which over 1200 were children. We are concerned about our \n     guests and their futures, and want assurance that our voices, \n     and theirs, will always have the opportunity to be heard.--\n     YWCA, Columbus.\n       Faith Mission is dedicated to providing life saving and \n     live improving services to homeless women, children and men \n     and anyone in need. People come to our door, at times, with \n     nothing but the clothes on their back and are in desperate \n     need of not only basic life support, (food, clothes), but \n     also services to help them regain self-sufficiency and move \n     on to become contributing citizens to their community. If \n     this bill passed, Faith Mission would be restricted from \n     effectively providing these services, like job referral, \n     medical services, mental health care referrals and support \n     groups from chemical dependency and domestic violence.--Faith \n     Mission, Columbus, Ohio.\n       Berea Children's Home and Family Services provides healing \n     and nurturing care to over 8,000 children and families who \n     reside in Ohio. These abused and neglected children have no \n     public voice of their own. In addition to the therapy they \n     receive from our residential treatment and in-home therapy \n     programs, they look to us to also be their advocates. We will \n     be unable to adequately serve these victimized children if \n     the Istook Amendment is introduced in a Senate bill and \n     eventually approved by Congress.--Berea Children's Home and \n     Family Services, Berea, Ohio.\n       Through the last several decades, an effective partnership \n     has been built between government and private, non-profit \n     organizations to address many of the social problems of the \n     day. One of the major reasons this has worked has been the \n     ability of non-profits to inform legislators about what \n     programs work and advise them about more effective ways to \n     address problems. With the severe budget cuts to social \n     programs currently being considered and passed, churches \n     and non-profit organizations are being asked to do more \n     with less.

We would not be able to discuss with \n     legislators the need for funding of important service \n     programs to pregnant and parenting teenagers, the deaf and \n     battered women.--Family Services, Akron, Ohio.\n       If these unprecedented restrictions go through, \n     organizations like ours will be forced to choose between \n     providing services to people in need and providing a voice \n     for the people we represent. Vital community services will be \n     jeopardized and government will be cut off from the insights \n     of the very organizations that are closest people government \n     is trying to serve.--Caracole, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio.\n       I fear that publicly funded agencies, which deal with \n     issues of drug abuse, domestic violence, sex abuse, etc., \n     will find themselves in positions where they will have to \n     forfeit their ability to impact on future legislation or \n     public interest litigation, because they received any federal \n     funds, regardless of amount.--Mental Health Services East, \n     Inc., Cincinnati.\n       The Achievement Center for Children provides a \n     comprehensive array of services for children with physical \n     disabilities and their families.

Their issues and concerns need to be heard and \n     understood.--Achievement Center for Children, Cuyahoga \n     County.\n       Vital Community services could be lost because \n     organizations would not be able to share their knowledge of \n     people in need and types of services needed with legislators \n     and others in the position to provide assistance. the Istook \n     Amendment would impose restrictions only on federal grants \n     which go primarily to non-profit organizations. It would not \n     impose restrictions on federal contracts which go primarily \n     to for-profit organizations. These corporations would \n     continue to be able to lobby the government.--Alcohol, Drug \n     Addiction, and Mental Health Service Board, Lima, Ohio.\n       Every Woman's House realizes that the commitment by \n     Congress to addressing the issue of domestic violence is \n     meaningless if vital programs, such as those offered by our \n     agency, are not funded.

And, now, through the Istook \n     Amendment, that same Congress is trying to silence the very \n     groups that society will need to depend upon to survive.''--\n     Cleveland Institute of Art.\n\n  To be fair, I have received a few letters from Ohioans. I am always \nglad to have the benefit of their views, too, although in this \nparticular case we do disagree.\n  But I was struck by the fact that the vast majority of those \nsupporting the Istook amendment indicated they were involved in the \nbeer wholesale or retail business. Their letters were almost identical \nand so many contained the following phrase:\n\n       Moreover, the Center for Substances abuse Prevention \n     (CSAP), working with their Neo-Prohibitionist allies, \n     regularly promotes political activism, pushes anti-beer \n     wholesaler legislation at the federal, state, and local \n     level, and they pursue these activities with taxpayer \n     dollars.\n\n  Mr. President, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention is under the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Yes, it is federally funded. \nBut what does it do? It supports hundreds of nonprofit groups, \nfinancing after-school and summer activities for youths, counseling for \npregnant women, drug-free workplace programs, education efforts and \ngood-health workshops. It also offers training, manages a clearing \nhouse for prevention information, and develops anti-drug education and \npromotion campaigns.\n  I happen to think this is a worthy goal, and one that most Americans \nheartily support. The ravages of drug and alcohol rip apart our \nfamilies, break up marriages, and destroy lives. Real lives and real \npeople.\n  Whatever we can do to prevent such abuse and educate people--\nparticularly our young adults--should be encouraged. The Federal \nGovernment does have a legitimate role in this area. The key is to make \nsure alcohol products are used responsibly. I don't consider myself a \nprohibitionist and would oppose efforts to do just that. But in this \nparticular case, what concerns me is the fact that some in the beer and \nalcohol industry fear that by promoting efforts aimed at moderation and \nresponsibility, the Federal Government is a threat to their livelihood. \nTheir ultimate fear is that first comes moderation, next comes \nprohibition. So the real interest here is how much they sell, the \nbottom line, and their overall profits. It is not about policy.\n  I also have received a letter from the Mothers Against Drunk Driving \n[MADD]. That organization receives a small Federal grant from the \nDepartment of Transportation to conduct workshops on highway safety and \nimpaired driving. They also get a grant from the Department of Justice \nfor serves and assistance to victims of drunk drivers.\n  Again, I would bet most Americans would applaud their efforts. But \nfor some, apparently, the message is too much. They don't want to hear \nit. Why? Because MADD has been involved in State initiatives to curb \ndrunken driving and tighten blood alcohol content levels for drivers. \nYou would think this would be in the public interest--getting drunk \ndrivers off the road and imposing harsh penalties. But MADD has \nattracted the ire of the beer and liquor industry. Let me quote from \nMADD's letter:\n\n       MADD takes pride in the role we have played to combat drunk \n     driving and serve its victims and we resent the suggestion \n     that we have been the recipient of ``welfare for lobbyists''. \n     Most of these so-called lobbyists have paid for the right for \n     their voices to be heard with their blood and tears or the \n     lives of their loved ones.\n\n  Mr. President, I like free and fair debate. Let us make policy \ndecisions on the merits and the public's interest. But what galls me \neven further is the fact not only were these industry groups--along \nwith the Heritage Foundation and the Christian Coalition--spearheading \nthe Istook effort, they were in the back rooms to write it. Talk about \nlobbying reform. According to an article in the November 8, 1995, Wall \nStreet Journal, during one negotiating session the able senior Senator \nfrom Wyoming noticed these parties in the room and told them, \nappropriately, to get out, or at least words to that effect.\n  I notice that these groups have worked with some of the primary House \nleaders who have been all too happy to attach individual, specific \ninterest riders to appropriations measures. Is this how the game is \ngong to be played? Where is the real reform here? Who is doing whose \nbidding?\n  Mr. President, This amendment is ill-conceived, constitutionally \nimpaired, and just plain un-American. It will stifle the efforts of \nthose on the frontlines who are trying to deal with so many of the \ntragic problems in today's society. We cannot run from those problems, \nwe cannot pretend they do not exist, though I suppose there are some \nwho who would like that. Let us help those who are helping those most \nin need by defeating this hostile, chilling, and burdensome amendment.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3049\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have reached some agreement to \nexpedite things. I know many of my colleagues have a lot of things to \ndo, and we would like to finish fairly early this evening if we can. I \nask amendments 3037 and 3047, 3046, and 3045 be laid aside to recur at \nthe hour of 6:45.\n  I put the question on the motion to reconsider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to reconsider the vote.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. The vote then on 3049, following the vote on a Medicare \nprovision at 6:45; that vote would occur at 6:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Immediately following that vote between now and 6:45, the \ndebate occur on an amendment to strike the Medicare provision offered \nby the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and that the votes occur \nback to back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to my colleagues, we hope we can expedite this. That \nwould mean we might be able to finish action on the CR by 7 o'clock. By \nthat time, hopefully, the debt ceiling will be here. We have to deal \nwith that yet tonight, and therefore we can be expected to be in \nsession until we finish that.\n  It may be there will only be a couple of amendments. In any event, we \nwould like to finish that this evening.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Just to clarify one technical point. As I understand it, \nwe have an agreement there would be no intervening action on my \namendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further, does the Senator understand the time will be \ndivided equally?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3050\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provision for the determination of the Medicare \n                        part B premium for 1996)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3050.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On p. 36:\n       Strike section 401.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time would either side have in the debate on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). There is 35 minutes until the \nvote is ordered. That will be divided equally--17\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there are a number of problems with this \ncontinuing resolution. We have been dealing in the last couple of hours \nwith one of the more egregious problems having to do with the Istook \namendment.\n  But something more critical and more important and deeply troubling \nto us is the fact that there is a premium hike for Medicare \nbeneficiaries incorporated in this continuing resolution.\n  I want to take just a couple of minutes to explain what it is we are \nreferring to and talk briefly about why it is so important that we deal \nwith this problem.\n  In 1974, Congress recognized that seniors should not be subjected to \nMedicare premiums whose growth outpaced the growth of Social Security \nincome. As a result, back then we voted to limit the percentage \nincrease in part B premiums to no more than the percentage increase in \nSocial Security benefits.\n  Then, in 1982, Congress voted to suspend the COLA limitations and \ninstead limit premium increases to 25 percent of Part B program costs. \nCongress voted to continue to limit the premiums to 25 percent of Part \nB costs in 1984 and again in 1987.\n  In 1990, Congress intended to cap the part B premium at 25 percent by \nsetting in law specific dollar amounts for the premium for each year \nfrom 1991 through 1995. This was done to protect seniors from \npotentially higher than anticipated rates of health care cost growth. \nHowever, the projections upon which these dollar amounts were based \nhave now been calculated as too high. Thus, the 1995 premium covers \nslightly more than 31 percent of program costs despite congressional \nintent to limit the beneficiary burden to 25 percent.\n  Consequently, in the law that we passed in 1993, Congress reset the \npremium at a percentage equal to 25 percent of program costs for 1996 \nto 1998.\n  That will change if this legislation passes.\n  Next year, if nothing happens, part B premiums return to covering 25 \npercent of Part B costs. Clearly, the 31.5 percent premium that \nbeneficiaries had to absorb this year is due to an unintended glitch in \nthe law.\n  There was no design to put it at 31 percent. The design was to \nstipulate a dollar amount so that we did not have to stipulate a \npercentage. The Republican majority is now attempting to lock in that \nglitch, by statute, for all perpetuity. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays the monthly premiums, which are currently $42.50, will go to \n$53.50 under this continuing resolution. This is an increase of more \nthan 25 percent in the dollar amount of the premium.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very clear that this is going to be \nextraordinarily difficult for many seniors. Seniors' average income \ntoday is under $18,000. Forty percent of seniors have incomes under \n$10,000. Seniors now spend more than 20 percent of their income on \nhealth care. Rural seniors--who are typically older, poorer, and \nsicker--will be disproportionately hurt by this policy. And, because \nthe money for these premiums is taken directly out of Social Security \nchecks, this premium increase also amounts to a Social Security cut.\n  Mr. President, this is not the place, regardless of whether or not \none would view this to be the right thing to do, to consider such a \nproposal. This is not the time to debate whether or not we are willing \nto increase premiums by $11 a month for every participating senior \nacross this country and to lock-in an inadvertent percentage increase. \nToday the questions are: Is this the right vehicle? Is this the right \ntime? Should we be doing it outside the context of Medicare reform? \nOutside of a debate on deductibles and other issues that relate to what \nseniors are going to be asked to absorb?\n  There is absolutely no reason why this needs to be in a short-term \ncontinuing resolution. It is unrelated to continued Government \nfinancing. It has no impact on the hospital insurance trust fund. It \ndoes not protect and preserve Medicare, as some of our Republican \ncolleagues claim they want to do. It has nothing to do with attacking \nfraud and abuse. It does not provide seniors with more choices. It does \nnot cut Medicare costs. It simply shifts costs directly from the \nFederal budget onto the backs of seniors. That is wrong. There is no \nreason why seniors should be singled out. It leaves all other parts of \nMedicare untouched.\n  Why? To create the pool of resources necessary to fund the Republican \ntax break package for the wealthy, provided the Republican majority has \ntheir way. This is going to hurt seniors.\n  We do not need to do that. This ought not be done in this bill. This \nis the wrong time, the wrong place, the wrong approach, and the wrong \neffort directed entirely at those who can least afford it.\n  So, Mr. President, for all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to \njoin with us in support of this amendment. I am \n\n[[Page S 16887]]\npleased that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and Senator \nfrom West Virginia have agreed to cosponsor this legislation. They have \nbeen in the forefront of this legislative effort from the very \nbeginning. I applaud them for their cooperation, their help, and their \ndedication to ensuring that seniors are protected from unfair policies.\n  With that, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the minority leader, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will just take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a no-brainer. We are giving every \nSenator a chance to separate him and herself from a truly dumb idea \nconcocted in the other body. Before us is a continuing resolution--the \nlegislation that pays the bills for the Federal Government to function \nstarting on Tuesday--now being used as a freight train for baggage that \ndoes not belong on this train. With this amendment, we are saying throw \nthe Medicare premium increase over the side before it is too late. With \nthis amendment, vote for tossing out the provision to increase the \nmonthly premiums that 30 million senior citizens pay to receive \nMedicare's part B coverage, otherwise known as physician care and \nservices.\n  No matter what you think seniors should pay for the Medicare, the \ncontinuing resolution is not the bill to hitch onto. If you want \nseniors to pay 100 or 2 percent of the costs of their Medicare, this \nbill is not the time, the place, or the vehicle for setting the price \ntag of Medicare premiums.\n  In fact, I am incredulous that anyone would want to increase Medicare \npremiums ahead of doing a single thing to improve, save, or reform \nMedicare.\n  The Members on the other side of the aisle told Americans they should \nbe in the majority of Congress. They won the elections last November to \ndo that.\n  But Mr. President, being in charge also means being responsible. \nBeing in charge means making sure that on Tuesday, the Federal \nGovernment can open national parks, enforce law and order, answer the \nphones when veterans are calling about their benefits or try to visit a \nVA hospital, process student loans and passport requests, and perform \nthousands of other responsibilities that Members of Congress are \nsupposed to be here watching over. Being in charge does not mean \nthrowing the kitchen sink onto the basic piece of legislation to fund \nthe Government. And it sure does not mean throwing in a Medicare price \nincrease for senior citizens, hoping it just slips through. Can someone \nexplain the sudden rush to raise Medicare premiums?\n  The cost of seniors' Medicare premiums should be determined when \nCongress decides Medicare's overall future. Vote for this amendment to \ntake this issue off of the CR, and put it back where it belongs--in the \ndiscussion of Medicare's future, what is a fair share of costs for \nseniors to bear, and whether Medicare should be cut to save Medicare or \ncut to pay for tax breaks for the rich. That all still needs to be \nsettled, and it is going to take some more work, I assure everyone \nlistening.\n  Instead, here we are faced with an absolutely critical bill for \nCongress to get enacted in the next 48 hours, with an 11th-hour \naddition designed to make sure senior citizens pay more for their \nMedicare beginning in January 1996. How ridiculous can you get?\n  Let me be very clear: Unless you vote to strip this bill of the \nMedicare baggage, you will vote to send senior citizens on Medicare a \ntotal annual bill for their part B premium of $642--$1,284 a year for \ncouples--starting in January 1996. The provision misplaced into this \nbill will charge seniors an extra $11 more a month, an extra $132 more \na year, in order to keep getting Medicare coverage for physician care. \nThis bill is not the place to approve a Medicare price increase for \nseniors.\n  We already know why so many Republicans want to increase the cost of \nMedicare premiums for 37 million seniors. In fact, we already know why \nthe Republican budget calls for $270 billion in Medicare cuts. It is \nsimple. The same Republican budget spends $245 billion on new tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest Americans and all kinds of corporations. \nRaiding Medicare is the idea, ignoring the fact that only $89 billion \nis needed to keep the trust fund solvent for 10 years.\n  It is that simple and it is that wrong. This is not about preserving \nand protecting Medicare. And the provision in this continuing \nresolution is not about making sure the U.S. Federal Government will \nstill function on Tuesday. This provision is a premium hike designed to \ncollect more from Medicare beneficiaries in January, money to pay for \ntax breaks for someone else.\n  The provision in this bill will put a new burden on seniors who \nalready spend more than one-fifth of their income on insurance, \nprescription drugs, long-term care services and other health care needs \nnot covered by Medicare. It is wrong to burden seniors with more costs \nso that there will be money to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  This Medicare premium provision does expose a basic truth. Cutting \nMedicare by $270 billion--that is $181 billion more than the Medicare \ntrustees call for to protect the Medicare trust fund--is not needed to \npreserve the Medicare program. How do you preserve today's Medicare \nprogram by insisting that seniors pay higher premiums than would occur \nunder current law?\n  You do not. This is not about preserving anything, improving \nanything, or protecting anything. This is about targeting seniors as a \nfinancing source for the Republicans' budget that is going to hurt \nseniors, not help them in the least.\n  Increasing costs for Medicare beneficiaries as part of a bill to keep \nthe Federal Government up and running does not make any sense at all. \nIt is a rifle shot aimed at the millions of seniors who rely on \nMedicare.\n  It should be struck from this bill and I ask my colleagues to vote \nfor our amendment to get it out of this absolutely vital bill that must \nbe passed now, must be clean of debris completely, totally, and \nimmediately.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes ten seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes thirty seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Does the Senator desire some time at this point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the bottom line on this particular \nproposal is that it is a $51 billion tax increase on seniors, and 83 \npercent of that tax increase will effectively go on people who are \nmaking $25,000 or less.\n  So you are taking $50 billion out of the pockets and the pocketbooks \nof senior citizens. That does not surprise me about the Republican \nproposal. Since we know that the tax increase in the Republican budget \nwill hurt those who make less than $30,000 a year--51 percent of all \nAmericans--their taxes will be increased. This is going right along \nwith it. They will be taking effectively $51 billion out of our \nseniors.\n  What does that mean for the average family? It means that they will \nhave a reduced Social Security check.\n  This chart indicates how these premiums are going to be taken out of \nthe Social Security COLA in this next year and the hardship it is going \nto have, particularly on the lowest percentile. Those that make $5,300 \na year will find out that with a $136 Medicare premium increase, they \nwill only have $3 of that COLA left to them. And so it goes right down \nthrough the rest of the middle income.\n  This premium increase will reduce the COLA's for those senior \ncitizens at the lowest level by 98 percent, by 66 percent for those \nreceiving the average benefit and over half for those that are getting \n$10,000 a year. And we have to ask ourselves why? The reason for it, as \nthe minority leader and Senator Rockefeller pointed out, is to pay for \nthe $245 billion tax break for wealthy individuals.\n  If you did not have that tax break, Mr. President, you would not need \nto have this tax increase for those on Social Security. That is the \nbottom line. \n\n[[Page S 16888]]\n\n  If you are going to have the $245 billion in tax breaks for wealthy \npeople, you have to get $51 billion in this particular continuing \nresolution, and the way that you do it is to wipe out the Social \nSecurity COLA for those at the lowest level. I think it is unjustified. \nSenator Daschle had offered the amendment to ensure the integrity of \nthe Medicare trust fund. That was rejected by all the Republicans \nexcept one. That would have ensured the integrity of Medicare and the \nSocial Security System and it would have meant not one dime increase in \npremiums, not one dime increase in deductibles. We ought not permit \nthis back-door attempt of the Republicans to add this kind of an \nadditional tax on the senior citizens of this country.\n  Earlier today I spoke of my intention to join with my colleagues in \nintroducing this amendment. The Republican proposal to increase the \nMedicare part B premium included in the continuing resolution is \nunacceptable on any vehicle--and it is particularly unacceptable on a \ncontinuing resolution designed simply to keep the Government operating.\n  This proposal is a part of the broader Republican assault on \nMedicare--a proposal that will devastate senior citizens, working \nfamilies, and children in every community in America. It extends an \nopen hand to powerful special interests and gives the back of the hand \nto hard-working Americans. It makes a mockery of the family values the \nRepublican majority pretends to represent.\n  The Republican assault on Medicare is a frontal attack on the \nNation's elderly. Medicare is part of Social Security. It is a contract \nbetween the Government and the people that says, ``Pay into the trust \nfund during your working years, contribute to the growth of your \ncountry by working hard, supporting your family, and educating your \nchildren, and we will guarantee good health care in your retirement \nyears.''\n  It is wrong for Republicans to break that contract. It is wrong for \nRepublicans to propose deep cuts in Medicare in excess of anything \nneeded to protect the trust fund. And it is doubly wrong for \nRepublicans to propose those deep cuts in Medicare in order to pay for \ntax breaks for the wealthy. You don't need a degree in higher \nmathematics to know what is going on. The $270 billion in Medicare \ncuts; $245 billion in new tax breaks disproportionately targeted at the \nwealthiest individuals and companies in America.\n  The cuts in Medicare are harsh and they are extreme--$280 billion \nover the next 7 years. Premiums will double. Deductibles will double. \nSenior citizens will be squeezed hard to give up their own doctors and \njoin private insurance plans.\n  The fundamental unfairness of this proposal is plain. Senior \ncitizens' median income is only $17,750. Forty percent of all senior \ncitizens have incomes less than $10,000 a year. Because of gaps in \nMedicare, senior citizens already pay to much for the health care they \nneed, especially prescription drugs and long-term care. But under the \nRepublican budget, elderly Americans will pay $71 billion more out of \ntheir own pockets over the next 7 years--an average of almost $4,000 \nfor each elderly couple.\n  The Medicare trustees have stated clearly that $89 billion is all \nthat's needed to protect the trust fund for the next 10 years--$89 \nbillion, not $280 billion.\n  Our Democratic alternative provides that amount of savings. We don't \nneed to raise premiums an additional dime. We don't need to raise \ndeductibles a dime. We need to give senior citizens real choices, not \nforce them to give up their own doctor.\n  The Republican Medicare plan also deserves to be rejected because of \nthe lavish giveaways to special interest groups in the House and Senate \nproposals.\n  The insurance industry got what it wanted--the chance to get their \nhands on Medicare and make billions of dollars in additional profits.\n  The American Medical Association got what it wanted--no reduction in \nfees to doctors, and strict limits on malpractice awards.\n  The list goes on and on. The clinical laboratory industry got what it \nwanted--their labs no longer have to meet strict Federal standards to \nguarantee the accuracy of results. The nursing home industry got what \nit wanted--Federal standards to prevent abuse of patients in nursing \nhomes will be eliminated. The pharmaceutical industry got what it \nwanted--the right to charge higher prices for their drugs.\n  Because of this unjust Republican plan, millions of elderly Americans \nwill be forced to go without the health care they need. Millions more \nwill have to choose between medical care and food on the table, \nadequate heat in the winter, or paying the rent.\n  Senior citizens have earned their Medicare benefits. They've paid for \nthem, and they deserve them.\n  It is bad enough that the Republicans have proposed this unjust plan. \nIt is worse that they have taken the single largest cost increase for \nsenior citizens--the increase in the Medicare part B premium--and \nattached it to this continuing resolution.\n  Cuts in payments to doctors are not included in the continuing \nresolution. Cuts in payments to hospitals are not included in the \ncontinuing resolution. The only Medicare cut in this bill is a proposal \nto impose a new tax on the elderly and disabled.\n  The Republican strategy is clear. Try to rush through their \nunacceptable proposals--because they know that they cannot stand the \nlight of day. Try to force the President to sign them into law--with \nthe threat of shutting down the Government if he refuses to go along.\n  The part B premium increase is especially objectionable, because it \nbreaks the national commitment to senior citizens in Social Security. \nEvery American should know about it. Every senior citizen should reject \nit.\n  Medicare is part of Social Security. The Medicare premium is deducted \ndirectly from a senior citizen's Social Security check. Every increase \nin the Medicare premium means a reduction in Social Security benefits.\n  The Republican plan proposes an increase in the part B premium and a \nreduction in Social Security which is unprecedented in size. Premiums \nare already scheduled to go up under current law, from $553 a year \ntoday to $730 by 2002. Under the Republican plan, the premium will go \nup much higher--to $1,068 a year.\n  As a result, over the life of the Republican plan, all senior \ncitizens will have a minimum of $1,240 more deducted from their Social \nSecurity checks. Every elderly couple will pay $2,480 more.\n  The impact of this program is devastating for moderate- and low-\nincome seniors. It is instructive to compare the premium increase next \nyear--the portion of the Republican plan tucked into the continuing \nresolution--to the Social Security cost-of-living increase that \nmaintains the purchasing power of the Social Security check. One-\nquarter of all seniors have Social Security benefits of $5,364 a year \nor less. The COLA for a senior at this benefit level will be $139 next \nyear.\n  The average senior has a Social Security benefit of $7,874. The COLA \nfor someone at this benefit level is $205.\n  But under the Republican plan the premium next year will be $126 \nhigher than under current law. Average-income seniors will be robbed of \nalmost two-thirds of their COLA. Low-income seniors will be robbed of a \nwhopping 90 percent of their COLA.\n  Senior citizens have earned their Social Security and Medicare \nthrough a lifetime of hard work. They built this country and made it \ngreat. Because of their achievements, America has survived war and \ndepression. Tonight is the eve of Veterans Day, when we honor those who \nsacrificed for our country. Many of those veterans depend on Medicare. \nIt is wrong to take away their benefits, and it is especially wrong to \ndo so to pay for an underserved tax break for the wealthiest \nindividuals and corporations in America.\n  The Republicans' attack on Medicare will make life harder, sicker, \nand shorter for millions of elderly Americans. They deserve better from \nCongress. This cruel and unjust Republican plan to turn the Medicare \ntrust fund into a slush fund for tax breaks for the wealthy deserves to \nbe defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. \n\n[[Page S 16889]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there are two horses the Democrats like to \nride. One is Social Security, and the other is Medicare.\n  They like to ride both of them at the top of their lungs, as has been \nindicated here this evening.\n  Let us talk about Medicare, which is the subject before us. There are \na lot of deceptive statements being made here this evening in \nconnection with Medicare. One is that you are increasing the premiums. \nFirst, let us make clear what we are talking about. Under Medicare, \nthere is part A. There is a trust fund and that pays for the \nhospitalization. Part B is an insurance program. It is a voluntary \ninsurance program that senior citizens can take if they so choose, and \nabout 99-plus percent choose the part B insurance program.\n  What does the part B insurance program do? It covers the cost after \nthe deductible for physicians. That is what part B is.\n  Let us look at a little bit of history. When part B was set up under \nMedicare in the early 1960's, the thought and, indeed, the plan was \nthat the beneficiary, the insured, would pay 50 percent of the premium \nand the Federal Government would pay the other 50 percent of the \npremium.\n  However, due to the fact that it was set in dollars and medical \ninflation came along, what started out as a dollar premium that equaled \n50 percent soon slid down, down, down and became less than 25 percent, \nsomething like 18 percent. So then we changed the law, and we provided \nthat it be 25 percent as a minimum. But over the past several years \nthat rose, and it currently is at 31.5 percent. That is what it is now. \nAnd so this idea that by staying at 31.5 percent we are increasing the \npremium is absolute, total nonsense.\n  It is important to remember this. The Federal Government is now \npaying, for the total part B premiums, as its share, namely the 69 \npercent that it pays, with the insured paying 31.5 percent, $42 billion \na year, and we believe that the 31.5 percent premium that is currently \nbeing paid is a fair premium. It is not 50 percent, as the authors of \nthe legislation originally provided, and it is not 40 percent, but it \nis 31.5 percent. That is what the Republicans have provided.\n  The argument is, well, do not do it on this bill. Do it on something \nelse. The problem is that unless we provide on this bill that it be at \n31.5 percent, due to the mechanics of the machinery for Social Security \nand the withholding, and so forth and so on, because this is a premium \nthat is deducted from the benefit of the Social Security recipients--in \nother words, when they choose to have the insurance, they provide that \nthe premium be deducted from their Social Security income, and in order \nto keep it at this particular figure, 31.5 percent, it is required that \nlegislation be enacted. That is why we are here this evening.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator indicate what it will revert back to if \nthis legislation is not passed?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It will revert to the 25 percent that we have long since \nbypassed. It is now at 31.5 percent. Who set it at 31.5 percent?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. But the Senator does confirm it reverts back to 25 \npercent.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. A Democratic Congress--a Democratic House of \nRepresentatives, a Democratic Senate--provided that it be at the 31.5 \npercent. And to say this is an increase when that is what is being paid \nnow is just plain not so.\n  Now, Mr. President, you could say, well, it ought to go to 25 \npercent. Well, why not have it go to 10 percent or, indeed, more \nattractive and more appealing I suppose is no charge. Have the Federal \nGovernment pay it all. But we believe that when we look at these \nprograms, when we look at the cost of $42 billion, for the beneficiary \nto continue paying at the same percentage he or she is currently paying \nis fair.\n  Now, they do not say, well, it is unfair to pay 31.5 percent. Is that \nthe viewpoint of the Senator from Massachusetts, I wonder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will answer in 30 seconds. What is completely unfair \nis to raise $51 billion, according to CBO, from low-income people in \norder to pay for a tax break for the wealthiest individuals. That is \nwhat is unfair. I wish the Senator had addressed the issue of the tax \nbreak for the wealthy. The Senator has not even referred to it. This \nprovision raises $51 billion, I say to the Senator, here it is, right \nhere in the chart. And you are using that $51 billion as part of your \n$245 billion tax break for the wealthy. The Senator has not even talked \nabout that in his explanation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would ask that I have 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President that is what you call a syllogism. Does he \nbelieve that the premium should not be 31.5 percent? Suddenly we get \ntalking about tax breaks for the rich. There is no tax break for the \nrich provided in this legislation. What we are saying is----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me finish.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to answer the question.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We are on my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to answer the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has the floor. \nDoes he yield the floor?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I know I am against sturdy competition, particularly in \nthe volume level, but I would like to finish.\n  We believe that a beneficiary paying 31.5 percent is fair. As you \nknow, under the current law, when an individual is unable to pay the \npremium, then Medicaid can step in. That is the current law of the \nland. Medicaid is there to cover the deductibles. Medicare is there to \npay the part B premium. But we believe that it is fair for the \nbeneficiary to pay 31.5 percent with the Federal Government paying \n68.5. That is a pretty good deal.\n  So that is what this is all about this evening. It has nothing to do \nwith the rich. You can read the language, and there is no tax cut for \nthe rich. I do not know where they get that from. It has nothing to do \nwith that. It is whether it is fair to say to the beneficiaries you are \ngetting a very good deal here.\n  And you cannot beat it for paying not the entire premium. Indeed, \nthere is no means testing here. There is no suggestion, as we have \nproposed and subsequently presumably it will come along in later days, \nthat the more affluent pay more. That is not included here. I would be \nhappy if it were. But that is not in this particular program.\n  So, because of the mechanics that have to take place, it is important \nthat this legislation be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I have just 30 seconds to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to make it clear that I do think the raising to \n31 percent, which this proposal does, is unfair. And I want to tell you \nwhy. Because it was a guarantee to the seniors, ``Work hard, pay your \ntaxes, and you are going to have affordable health care.'' Under the \nRepublican proposal, you will be adding some $2,400 to the cost of \nhealth care to every senior citizen in this country. You are going to \nbe denying them access to health care. And you are doing it to have the \ntax breaks for the wealthy.\n  And that, I say to the Senator, is unfair. And at the 31 percent, the \npremium will emasculate the cost-of-living adjustment under Social \nSecurity. The Republicans said, ``We aren't going to touch Social \nSecurity,'' and yet they are effectively wiping out the COLA for the \npoorest of our elderly people.\n  I yield the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to the senior citizens of the \nUnited States, ``The Federal Government is paying for your insurance, \neverything except hospitalization which you paid for in trust from your \nsalary. We have decided to pay a premium for your health insurance. And \nwe pay it for nobody else in America.'' \n\n[[Page S 16890]]\n\n  There are families with a husband and wife, and four kids, making \n$22,000 a year, working hard, trying to get ahead. We do not pay any \nhealth insurance premium for them, but because we want to take care of \nour seniors, we pay for theirs. How much do we pay, and how much does \nthe senior pay? At this point in time, the senior citizen pays 31.5 \npercent and the taxpayers of America, because we want to take care of \nseniors, pay 68.5 percent.\n  That is the fact. All this amendment says is that it is going to stay \nat 31.5 percent. It is not going down to 25 percent or 20 percent or 10 \npercent. We say to the seniors, ``Is it not fair that you pay 31.5 \npercent''--that is what it has been for awhile--``while the taxpayers \npay all the rest, while we try to get a balanced budget for the United \nStates, so that our children and grandchildren will have a chance at \nmaking a decent living and increasing their standard of living?''\n  By the way, we do not pay the health insurance premium for a husband \nand wife and four children. They may have insurance; they may not. We \ndo not pay it from the taxpayers of America. So what we did is say, \n``Let's get a balanced budget on this score. Let's just leave the \npremium at 31.5 percent, with the taxpayers paying all the rest.'' When \nwe were finished with all of this, we found we had an economic \ndividend. That dividend said you have a surplus in the budget of the \nUnited States. All we said to the seniors of the United States is, ``We \nwould like to give that money back to the taxpayers.'' Ninety percent \nof that economic dividend is going back to the taxpayers of America who \nearn $100,000 or less a year.\n  Everything I have said is fact. Now, you can turn it around however \nyou would like, but I do not believe there are going to be very many \nsenior citizens who are going to be angry at us when we say, ``We will \nkeep on paying 68.5 percent of the cost of your insurance, but we would \nlike to give the American people a tax break, with most of it going to \nmen and women who have children, by way of a tax credit and a little \ntiny bit so that we can have the economy grow.''\n  What is the matter with that? It seems to me that is the best thing \nwe can do for seniors and by far the best thing we can do for their \nchildren and grandchildren. And that is the way it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This \nlegislation sets the part B monthly premium for 1996 at 31.5 percent of \npart B costs, the exact same percentage of cost beneficiaries cover \ntoday through their premiums. I might point out that the Senate has \nalready approved this change in the budget reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, if we do not make a change in the part B premium, the \npercentage of part B spending that beneficiaries cover through their \npremiums will drop on January 1. And as I said, beneficiaries now pay \nfor 31.5 percent of part B spending through premiums, and as of January \n1 of this next year it would drop to 25 percent. If we do not pass this \nlegislation by next week, the Social Security Administration tells us \nit cannot change the premium for another 4 months because of the time \nit needs to reprogram its computers.\n  This part B premium change is a downpayment on restoring fiscal \nsecurity to part B. I might point out that part B is strictly voluntary \non the part of our senior citizens as to whether or not they enroll in \nit. A lot of attention has been focused on the need to restore solvency \nto the part A trust fund. But part B spending is also a major problem.\n  The Medicare trustees, trustees appointed by President Clinton, in \ntheir 1995 report on the part B trust fund, pointed out that part B \ncosts have increased 53 percent in the last 5 years and costs grew 19 \npercent faster than the economy as a whole. In my view, it simply does \nnot make sense to let the part B premium go down when, in fact, part B \ncosts are exploding.\n  Let us remember where the rest of part B spending comes from. It \ncomes from taxes, taxes paid for by the American people. And even under \nthe reconciliation bill, the taxpayer subsidy of part B will be almost \n70 percent of part B costs. The public trustees--again, the same \ntrustees appointed by President Clinton--of the Medicare program termed \nthe part B subsidy a major contributor to the fiscal problems of the \nNation. In other words, this subsidy is a direct contribution to our \ndeficit.\n  Some will undoubtedly claim that this premium change will burden \nAmerican seniors. We do not think so. The premium change, as I said, \nsimply continues the current level of beneficiary cost-sharing among 36 \nother Medicare beneficiaries. We think this is fair. We urge the \nMembers of this Chamber to defeat this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, reserving the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, would the Senator from Delaware yield for \na question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Not right now. First I want to yield time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 44 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I do not know how much has been covered \nhere, but if ever we are going to get anything done with regard to \nthese programs, this is it. I do not want anyone to forget in this body \nthat when this remarkable program was put together--and, remember, it \nis voluntary--it was never part of any contract. This is voluntary.\n  This is an income transfer; 69 percent of the premiums on part B are \npaid by the people who maintain this building and 29 percent are paid \nby the beneficiaries regardless of their net worth or their income. \nThis is absurd.\n  If we cannot even means test part B premiums, which are simply \nvoluntary, we will never get anything done, period. But here is the \nkey. Remember when this program started, I say to my colleagues--do not \nmiss this--under the 1965 law, this was to be a split of 50-50. \nEveryone in this body knows it, 50 percent was to be paid by the \nGovernment, the taxpayers, and 50 percent by the beneficiary. Everybody \nwho is in this debate knows that.\n  How did it then get to 25 percent? It got to 25 percent by people who \nknew they could get reelected by simply coming to the floor and saying, \n``Oh, you shouldn't have to pay 50 percent of that premium; you should \npay 45 percent.''\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, can we have order in the Chamber? It seems \nwe have some visitors. We need decorum here.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank my friend from Kentucky. ``No, no, you should \nnot have to pay 50 percent, you are beleaguered, tortured.''\n  Bosh, it is a voluntary program. It is $46.10 a month; $46.10 a month \nto people who are floating in a golden parachute. This is absolutely \nbizarre, when the thing was originally 50-50 and now we have it to 25-\n75 and now we want to say 31 is too much? Ask the people who are called \n``Joe Six-Pack'' how they feel about paying 70 percent of the premium \nfor somebody who is loaded. This is crazy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In the Finance Committee, you offered an amendment which \nwould have the effect of causing high-income Medicare beneficiaries to \npay a larger percentage of the cost to the program; is that correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That was adopted by the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It was a very fine bipartisan vote of 15-5.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would this proposal of setting the percentage at 31.5 \npercent obviate your amendment which would have set a higher percentage \nfor high-income Medicare beneficiaries?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Obviously, it would. If we cannot maintain the current \nlevel of 31.5 percent, we are in deep trouble, to go back to 25, to \nstrike everything we are trying to do in means testing.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What I am saying is, if we retain the provisions in the \ncontinuing resolution, it appears to mandate that we set the computers \nat 31.5 percent for all beneficiaries, the rationale being if we do not \nact now, it will be too late to adjust those computers. \n\n[[Page S 16891]]\n\n  Would that not have the effect of eliminating the opportunity to do \nwhat your amendment calls for, which is to have a different percentage \nfor high-income beneficiaries?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I do not know how better to explain the situation. If \nyou are going to change this formula, obviously the means testing or \naffluence testing, as I call it, of part B premiums cannot be done \nproperly if you are going to give more of a break to people regardless \nof their net worth or income.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Wyoming has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader.\n  The Republicans are asking seniors to pay more than Congress intended \nbecause they want seniors to pay more. They think they should pay more, \nand this, I warn my colleagues, is the beginning of the Republican plan \nto ask seniors to pay more for their health care coverage.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof both our Democratic Senators. The Senator from Florida and the \nSenator from West Virginia have made a point I was going to make in \nresponse to the Senator from Wyoming. The fact remains that seniors pay \nmore for their health care than any other group of people in the \ncountry. That is not disputable. They pay more than anyone else. Yet, \nthis amendment requires them to pay even more than they pay today. That \nis what this issue is about and no one ought to be misled about that.\n  I want to make two final points, reiterating what I said earlier \nabout the importance of this legislation and confirming what the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island said earlier.\n  Current law dictates that 1996 premiums will revert back to the 25 \npercent level. The continuing resolution seeks to change this and lock-\nin the premium at 31 percent. We have debated this, we have discussed \nit, we have analyzed it, we have consulted and we have concluded over a \nlong period of time that 25 percent is the figure that we ought to \nlock-in for seniors to pay their fair share, given the fact that they \nalready pay more in out-of-pocket costs and in higher deductibles than \nany other segment of the population.\n  Mr. President, we made a commitment 30 years ago that seniors would \nget health care, and it would be affordable. That commitment is now \njeopardized if this amendment is not adopted. I hope Senators on both \nsides of the aisle will recognize that and support it as this \nlegislation comes before us tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n     Vote on Amendment No. 3049, As Modified, Upon Reconsideration\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on amendment No. 3049, as \nmodified, offered by the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig]. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

In light of the vote, I now ask that the amendment 3048 be \nagreed to, and amendments 3047, 3046 and 3045 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish \nSenators would just stop and look around. I wish Senators would just \ntake a look at what is going on on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I will not object, but I want to retain the floor \nbriefly on a reservation of objection.\n  I wish Senators would just look around this Chamber. If you have not \nlooked around, do it. I do not mean to be discourteous to our \ncolleagues from the House. They have the privilege of the floor. I \nwould defend their privilege, their right to the privilege, as long as \nit is in that book. And it is in there--the book on Senate Rules. But \nit is a little disconcerting to see them down in the well, buttonholing \nMembers of the Senate. I resent that. I resent that. If there is ever a \ntime when they want my vote, where they would like to see me vote a \ncertain way, such conduct would turn me the other way.\n  All the while I have been speaking, a House Member has been standing \nover there laughing and grinning. I do not mean to be discourteous to \nHouse Members, but to me that comes with very poor grace.\n  I have been in this Senate now 37 years. I used to be a Member of the \nHouse. Not once have I ever gone over there and attempted to buttonhole \nMembers of the other body during a vote.\n  I hope that the Chair will insist on better order in the Senate. That \nmight go for some of our own Members, as well.\n  I try to sit in this chair here most of the time. I know that we all \nare prone to forget and chat with colleagues as they come in on the \nfloor because we have not seen them. They have been in committee \nmeetings and so on. If that Chair will make that gavel heard, here is a \nSenator who would sit down. I respect that Chair and I respect that \ngavel.\n  I hope that House Members will show a little respect for this body \nand for the privilege of the floor which they have been accorded. And I \nhope that we Senators will help the Chair to insist on that.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I remove my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3050\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think most of our colleagues are here and \nhave been notified, if we might have consent that this be a 10-minute \nvote, and then, following that, there will be a rollcall vote on final \npassage of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from Kansas \nto lay on the table the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota.

The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3051\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I have two technical amendments that \nhave to be offered, and they have been cleared on the other side of the \naisle by Senator Byrd. They relate to a technical amendment for the \nU.S. Information Agency and in relation to the DC amendment. So I send \nthese to the desk and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3051.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In Sec. 101. (a) after Educational Exchange Act of 1948, \n     insert: ``section 313 of the Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236),''.\n       On page 10 at line 19, after the period insert the \n     following: ``Included in the apportionment for the Federal \n     Payment to the District of Columbia shall be an additional \n     $15,000,000 above the amount otherwise made available by this \n     joint resolution, for purposes of certain capital \n     construction loan repayments pursuant to Public Law 85-451, \n     as amended.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 3051) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution is open to further \namendment.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to H.R. 2586, the debt limit; that there be two amendments in \norder, the \n\n[[Page S 16893]]\nfirst to strike the Department of Commerce elimination, to be offered \nby the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], and the second, a clean \ndebt limit to be offered by Senator Moynihan, or his designee, and that \nfollowing the disposition of those amendments, the bill be advanced to \nthird reading and final passage, to occur all without any further \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I wonder if the majority leader would have any interest in \nentering into a time agreement to give our colleagues some indication \nof what the schedule might hold. I know there is very little \ndisagreement on the first amendment. And while there may be \ndisagreement on the second amendment, it is not our intention to debate \nit for a great deal of time. So we might be able to enter into a time \nagreement on that one and stack the three votes to accommodate Senators \ntonight.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. On the first amendment to strike the Department of Commerce \nelimination, I will just ask that there be a motion to strike and a \nvoice vote, without debate. That will not take any time. I do not think \nthe second will take long. I have talked to the Senators from New York \nand Delaware.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest 20 minutes, 10 minutes per side.\n  Mr. DOLE. On the Moynihan amendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I have \nseen a lot of remarkable things occur, and when they occur in our \nfavor, I do not want to object. But the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan is the one that wants to get rid of this Department.\n  Mr. DOLE. He still does, but not tonight.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is why, if he is going to make a motion, I want to \nmake sure we are not playing games.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is coming out.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will join him in the motion to strike then. We have \nunlimited time right now, is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. We hope that if we proceed on this basis, it will be a very \nquick disposal of that provision in this particular bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You are going to voice vote it?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That would suit this Senator, if we can have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. On a side?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well, at least for me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How about 20 minutes on a side for both amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Twenty minutes equally divided on each amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. As I \nunderstand it, then, after the one motion to strike the Commerce \nDepartment provision, which will take very little time, there will be \none other motion to strike everything else, so that those of us--at \nleast myself--would not have an opportunity to express my support for \nincluding a balanced budget within a 7-year timeframe and a prohibition \nagainst delving into any Social Security and pension funds, and limited \nto that, I would have to accept the other provision added by the House. \nIn other words, it is either all or nothing after we delete the \nCommerce Department provision.\n  Mr. DOLE. Then it goes back to the House, and there will probably be \nsome negotiations. Some would say there would be progress. I hope the \nSenator from Maine can support progress.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am told that we have a request for an additional 10 \nminutes on our side on the Commerce Department, so that would require \n20 minutes on our side on Commerce.\n  We would be satisfied with 10 minutes on the second amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. So there would be 10 minutes additional time for Senator \nByrd on the Commerce Department?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, is it then in order that we would have \nthree votes stacked--two amendments and final passage?\n  Mr. DOLE. Part of the agreement is we dispose of the first amendment \nby voice vote. The other two would be rollcalls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be 50 minutes on the agreement. The \nyeas and nays have not yet been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Moynihan amendment and \non final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the first vote at 8:50 be a \nregular 15-minute vote; final passage will be a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2586) to provide for a temporary increase in \n     the public debt limit, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3052.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike title II.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, the section of the bill which I am \nmoving to strike is quite an important section and quite an important \npolicy issue to me and to a number of Members of this body. It pertains \nto the Department of Commerce. It pertains to efforts a number of us \nhave launched this year in separate legislation to basically eliminate \nthe umbrella we call Department of Commerce and reassign a number of \nthe programs and functions of that Department to other areas of \nGovernment, but dramatically reduce the overhead and the bureaucracy by \neliminating the umbrella called the Department of Commerce.\n  Obviously, I am a strong advocate of this legislation in that I am \nthe chief sponsor of the freestanding bill which was introduced earlier \nthis year. I support very much the effort to dismantle the Department \nand reassign its relevant functions.\n  It had been my hope--and it remains my hope--to find the right time \nand the right vehicle to pursue this objective. Indeed, in the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the bill, which was initially my bill, \nhas gone through hearings, and it has been marked up and reported out \nof committee with favorable report to the full Senate.\n  It is my hope that at another time--hopefully very soon--we will have \nthe opportunity to look either at the package that came out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as a freestanding bill or some \ncombination of that package and the one that was included in the bill \nthat I am seeking to strike tonight.\n  Madam President, the simple fact is that this is not the right time \nand this is not the right vehicle for us to consider this important \nquestion of the Department of Commerce. There are many compelling \narguments, some of which I will make during our brief time tonight to \ndiscuss this issue. But I think the purpose of giving concentration of \nfocus of the Senate on this very vitally important issue tonight is not \nthe right time. For that reason, I send this motion to the desk.\n  I yield the floor. I retain the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, there is a saying that a man's opinion \nis still a man's opinion. I wonder. My \n\n[[Page S 16894]]\ncolleague from Michigan has a motion to strike title II, which I agree \nwith. But in all candor, I believe his sincerity and that it is still \nhis intent that we abolish or repeal the Department of Commerce. I, \nthough, want to see that title II is stricken from this bill and any \nother measure.\n  I have never seen legislation and Congress itself reach such a \nludicrous position of trying to rid itself of one of the most formative \ndepartments. I never say that lightly. Under article I, section 8, the \nfirst designated duty to the National Congress is to collect taxes, the \nsecond one is to borrow money, and the third one is to regulate \ncommerce.\n  You will not find the Department of Agriculture, you will not find \nthe Department of Energy, you will not find Housing in these measures \nin the National Government's Constitution. You find commerce.\n  Here, right in the midst of what you might call the economic war, we \nwant to dismantle the front line entity that is really waging the \nbattle to rebuild the economic strength of the United States of \nAmerica, and Secretary Ronald Brown is doing an outstanding job. To \ndismantle or strike or eliminate this particular Department at this \nhour would be like in the middle of the Cold War getting rid of the \nPentagon.\n  Madam President, you just could not understand the history of the \nUnited States if you did not go back into the original debates with \nrespect to the Declaration and the Constitution itself and the exchange \ntaking place soon after between the Founding Fathers and the former \nmother country, and especially with what corresponded at that \nparticular time with Secretary Alexander Hamilton. The British said, \nnow that you have became a little fledgling nation, you trade with us \nwhat you produce best and we trade back with you what we produce best. \nThat nonsense that you continually hear to this day--``free trade, free \ntrade.''\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote his views on that suggestion in a booklet \ncalled Report on Manufactures. It is over in the Library of Congress. \nAnd without reading that, I only say that it can be summed up in two \nwords: ``Bug off.''\n  Hamilton told the British that we are not going to sit and remain \nyour colony, shipping back our natural resources, our grain, our iron, \nour foodstuffs, and bringing in the manufactured products. It carries \nme immediately to Akio Morito, the founder of Sony, some years ago \nbefore his death, in Chicago where he was lecturing about emerging \nnations. He said emerging nations must build up a strong manufacturing \nsector, and that power that loses its manufacturing power ceases to be \na world power.\n  That is the position we are in at this particular moment. At this \nparticular moment, we have come from having at the end of World War II \n50 percent of our work force in manufacturing down to, 10 years ago, 26 \npercent, and now today at 13 percent. We are going out of business.\n  The thrust of eliminating the Department of Commerce is nothing more \nthan the thrust that America go the way of England --specifically, a \ndelightful Parliament, debating each other with scandal sheets and \neverything else to read but losing, generally speaking, its influence.\n  And we do. If we lose our economic power, we lose our international \nforeign policy power, if you please. No one cares today any longer \nabout the 7th Fleet or the threat of a nuclear attack. Money talks in \nthe global competition and in global politics.\n  Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to these proposals to \ndismantle the Department of Commerce [DOC].\n  To begin with, I strongly object to the process being used. A major \npiece of authorizing legislation does not belong on the debt limit \nbill. Moreover, the version before us now has been available to \nSenators only since this morning. The House Republican leadership \nrewrote the bill and only published it last night--38 densely-packed \npages of the Record that no one here has had time to review. Finally, \nno version of the DOC dismantling legislation has ever been presented \nto the Senate for full and regular debate. In short, adding this \ndismantling proposal to the debt limit bill is the worst possible way \nto consider major legislation.\n  Second, I strongly disagree with the substance of this proposal. It \nis astounding that in the middle of the global economic fight some of \nour colleagues propose to abolish the Federal agency that promotes \nexports, enforces our trade laws, works with industry to create new \njob-creating breakthrough technologies, and otherwise does so much to \npromote economic growth. I know that many of our Republican colleagues \ndo not like the current Secretary of Commerce, since he helped the \nPresident win the White House in 1992. And I know that some Republicans \nwant a trophy, and have therefore gone after the Cabinet department \nwith the smallest budget.\n  But to abolish the Commerce Department in the middle of the economic \nfight is like abolishing the Pentagon at the height of the cold war. \nThis is the last department we should abolish in this post-cold war \nworld. The proposal is utter nonsense, and it is nonsense that will \nhurt every American company and worker.\n  The bottom line is that in today's global economy almost every \nAmerican job is at risk. Nearly every company, and nearly every worker, \nfaces growing foreign competition. Millions of jobs depend on exports, \nand millions in the future will depend on whether the United States \nstays at the cutting edge of new technologies. These are bread-and-\nbutter issues to American families, and we need to strengthen--not \nweaken--American exports and competitiveness.\n  According to the November 6, 1995, issue of Business Week, a new \nreport compiled by the U.S. intelligence community for the Trade Policy \nCoordinating Committee, chronicles the bare knuckles brand of \ncapitalism employed by our competitors. Here are some examples:\n  The French Government warned an African government that it would \nwithdraw government guarantees on outstanding loans if Acatel did not \nwin a $20 million telecommunications switching equipment contract.\n  A Japanese company won a $30 million supercomputer order from Brazil \nafter the Bank of Japan said it would credit the purchase against \nBrazilian debt to Tokyo.\n  Officials at Airbus Industries threatened to block Turkey and Malta \nfrom entry into the European Union unless they purchase Airbus jets \nrather than jets from Boeing or McDonnell-Douglas.\n  In the face of this brutal competition, some of our colleagues in the \nHouse want U.S. business to walk down this dark alley unarmed and \nunaided.\n  We need a Cabinet department, and a Cabinet Secretary, whose job is \nto fight for exports, fight to keep America's lead in technology, and \nprovide important support services to business. The proposal before us, \nhowever, is a giant step backwards.\n  We also should note that this proposal does not reduce bureaucracy. \nIt creates bureaucracy. House and Senate Republicans have discovered \nthat many of DOC's functions are important after all, so while they \nabolish the Department they create several new independent agencies. Of \ncourse, each new agency has to have its own budget office, personnel \noffice, congressional relations office, and inspector general. The \nresult is more bureaucracy. It would be much cheaper and more effective \nto keep these functions where they are, in the Commerce Department.\n  Finally, major government reorganizations should not be done \npiecemeal. This House-passed proposal is ad hoc box-shuffling, with no \ngreat attention to either today's national priorities or the functions \nof other departments and agencies. Just blowing up one department \nwithout attention to all the others is a poor and backward way to \nreorganize our Federal Government.\n\n\n                            some background\n\n  Madam President, before we consider abolishing the department that \ndoes the most to promote American jobs and profits, we should remind \nourselves of some important history.\n  For 45 years we were engaged in a life and death struggle against the \nforces of totalitarianism. Through steadfast commitment and sacrifice \nwe emerged triumphant. During the cold war we willingly subordinated \nour economic interests to sustain the western alliance. Now, in the \npost cold war era we must channel the same energy and \n\n[[Page S 16895]]\ncommitment into rebuilding our economic strength. With the fall of the \nBerlin Wall and the collapse of Communism, this nation has entered into \na new era of competition, one in which the exercise of power and \ninfluence will be determined by economic strength.\n  Madam President, our strength as a Nation is analogous to a three \nlegged stool. One leg is our military strength, which remains \npreeminent. One leg is our values as a Nation. From feeding the hungry \nin Somalia to supporting democracy in Haiti, our values as a nation \nremain strong. When we look at our economic strength, however, that leg \nis fractured. A recent OECD report discovered that the United States \nhas the worst income distribution in the industrialized world. Three-\nquarters of our citizens in the age group of 18 to 25 cannot find a job \nthat pays more than the official poverty level. We have one of the \nlowest savings rates in the industrialized world. In private sector \ncapital spending, the United States lags behind our competitors.\n  We have fallen behind in key technologies including flat panel \ndisplays, laser diodes, and ceramic packages for the semiconductor \nindustry. We have a $9.9 billion trade deficit in computers and \nperipherals and $3.7 deficit in telecommunications equipment. Over the \nlast decade we have posted nearly $1.4 trillion worth of trade \ndeficits. The reason for this is clear. For too long we have been held \nback by slavish adherence to an outmoded 19th Century view of \ncapitalism. This view was appropriate for David Ricardo's British \nEmpire but has no place in an era of ``high tech'' competition where \ngovernment provides the comparative advantage for industry. This \n``hands off'' notion of economic development flies in the face of our \nown history. From Alexander Hamilton's Report on Manufactures, to Henry \nClay's ``American System'' of manufacturing, to Lincoln's development \nof the American rail system, to NASA's technological breakthroughs, the \ngovernment has played a crucial role working with industry to stimulate \neconomic development.\n  While some in Congress foolishly propose dismantling DOC, our \neconomic competition around the world does not share our shortsighted \ndesire to tear down government. The dynamic economies in Asia have \nevolved into economic powerhouses by developing close links between \nbusiness and government with one goal in mind, to become export super \npowers. The invisible hand of the market did not develop Korea's world \nclass semiconductor industry. Instead, the iron fist of decrees laid \ndown by Korea's Ministry of Trade kept out foreign competition unless \nthey licensed their technology to Korean companies. That iron fist was \ncomplemented by the largesse of Korea's Treasury which provided \nsubsidies in the form of below market loans and closed the markets to \nUnited States computer chips while Korean manufacturers dumped chips \ninto the United States market below the cost of production.\n  Europe is nurturing the information technology industry courtesy of \nbillions in subsidies from the European Community for massive research \nprojects like JESSI, ESPRIT, and EUREKA. The law of comparative \nadvantage no longer applies in America's top export industry where \nAirbus captured 30 percent of the market by flaunting international \ntrade rules, and China forced Boeing to build planes in the Guan Zhao \nprovince rather than Seattle, Washington.\n  This is the competition we face. In today's new world economy, it \nmakes absolutely no sense to eliminate the one cabinet department that \nlooks out for the business community and for one of our Nation's most \nimportant functions--interstate and foreign commerce. We need to \nstrengthen the Department of Commerce, not blow it up into ineffective \nfragments. Strong U.S. Government backing for U.S. companies and \nworkers in trade, technology, and other areas is vital if the United \nStates and our constituents are to prosper. The facts show that the \nDepartment of Commerce is working, fighting for American business. \nToday, in fact, DOC is more successful at promoting exports and other \nactivities than we have seen in decades. Its various units support and \nbenefit each other, making the Department's total much more than the \nsum of its parts. It would be a grave mistake to break up this winning \nteam of business and Government working together. If we retreat now, we \nwill lose exports, we will lose much of our technological edge, and we \nmost assuredly will lose jobs.\n\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution says that Congress shall \nhave the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the \nseveral States. Our Founding Fathers knew the importance of a Federal \nrole in support of commerce. In the first days of our Republic, \nAlexander Hamilton wrote his famous Report on Manufactures and called \nfor Government policies to assist U.S. industry. Theodore Roosevelt \ncreated the Commerce Department, and in the 1920's, Secretary of \nCommerce Herbert Hoover turned the Department into an export \npowerhouse.\n\n\n                     commerce department successes\n\n  Today, the Commerce Department provides the needed tools for helping \nAmericans to succeed in the new global, high-technology world. Consider \na few of its successes:\n  The Department's export promotion efforts have been a huge success, \nhelping American companies over the past 2 years to sell over $24 \nbillion in American goods and services, and creating or saving over \n300,000 jobs. Its export control program will allow billions more in \nexport sales while successfully preventing the sale of sensitive \ntechnologies to unfriendly governments. Yet the House-passed \ndismantling bill would downgrade these export efforts, eliminating the \nCabinet officer responsible for export promotion and burying these \nfunctions under an official whose main responsibility is trade \nnegotiations, not exports.\n  In technology, the central economic battleground of the future, DOC \nsupports industry's own efforts. DOC-supported manufacturing extension \ncenters, begun under the Reagan Administration, have helped over 15,000 \nsmall firms to improve their operations and profits, leading the firms \nthemselves to calculate that each $1 of DOC investment leads to $8 in \ncompany revenues or savings. The House-passed DOC dismantling \nlegislation abolishes the centers program.\n  The Advanced Technology Program, started under the Bush \nadministration and still new, is already helping dozens of companies, \nmost of them small businesses, to develop new breakthrough technologies \nthat the private capital markets will not finance because they are not \nguaranteed to make short-term profits. New developments will reduce the \ncosts of computer chips, lead to cheap compact color TV displays, and \ncreate machines that can safely hold human bone marrow cells outside \nthe body and use that bone marrow to create new blood cells. The House-\npassed bill would terminate the ATP.\n  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \nlaboratories have existed since Theodore Roosevelt established them in \n1901. They help the FBI and the Nation's law enforcement crime labs \nensure accuracy in drug analyses and DNA fingerprinting. They help \nindustry with a wide range of new measurement techniques which help \nmany companies improve precision and quality and cut costs. Yet the \nHouse-passed language would reduce the NIST labs to first 75 percent, \nand then 65 percent, of their fiscal year 1995 funding.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] is \nsteadily improving the warning time and accuracy of weather and climate \nforecasts, with economic and safety benefits ranging from improved \nflood forecasts to safer airline flights.\n  NOAA also assists the Nation's $50-billion-a-year commercial fishing \nindustry and $70 billion-a-year marine recreational fishing industry by \nmonitoring fishery harvests and collecting management information. Yet \nthe House DOC dismantling language would reduce NOAA's budget \ndrastically--first to 75 percent of its fiscal year 1995 appropriation, \nand then to 65 percent the second year after enactment and in all \nsubsequent years. These draconian reductions will affect weather and \nfisheries services throughout the country.\n  The Economic Development Administration is one of the few Federal \nprograms that give rural areas a chance to share in economic growth.\n\n  The Bureau of Economic Analysis is now substantially improving \neconomic and trade statistics, to give both business and government a \nmore accurate \n\n[[Page S 16896]]\npicture of where America stands in the new world economy.\n\n\n                      a department that is working\n\n  Madam President, contrary to what some may believe, these various \nparts of the Department work closely together and reinforce each other. \nNIST, for example, works with the International Trade Administration \n[ITA] and U.S. industry to monitor new product standards in other \ncountries. They identify when foreign product standards are used not to \nprotect local safety but as nontariff barriers against American \nproducts. Similarly, the Patent and Trademark Office advises ITA when \nforeign governments appear to use their patent policies in ways which \nhurt U.S. technology companies.\n  There are other examples. NIST and ITA's United States and Foreign \nCommercial Service are working closely with several friendly countries, \nincluding Saudi Arabia, to ensure that their new product standards are \ncompatible with American goods and services.\n  NIST and NOAA, in turn, are developing new measurement techniques for \nhelping the fishing industry to locate fish stocks. The Census Bureau \nregularly provides important information on the state of U.S. \nmanufacturing to companies and the trade and technology units of the \nDepartment.\n  The National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] \nperforms a critical role in forcing government users to become more \nefficient in their use of spectrum radio frequency and overseeing the \ngovernmental uses of the spectrum. NTIA has played a critical role in \nidentifying frequency bands for reallocation to the private sector, \nwhich ultimately led to auctions that brought in over $9 billion to the \nU.S. Treasury.\n  In this era of economic competition, the Commerce Department is the \narsenal of business. It is the Commerce Department through the ITA that \nrings up sales for U.S. business--from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas \nairplanes in Saudi Arabia to Raytheon radars in Brazil. It is the \nCommerce Department that enforces the trade laws that enabled the steel \nand semiconductor industries to beat back predatory trade practices.\n  In the critical technologies that are the battleground of the 21st \nCentury, it is the Commerce Department that is leading the way in \ndeveloping and commercializing new and emerging technologies. While the \nCommerce Department is at the cutting edge of technological \ndevelopment, its Export Administration is walking the fine line between \npromoting U.S. exports and keeping our critical technology out of the \nhands of terrorists. Finally, it is the Commerce Department's economic \nstatistics that provide the date which drive America's financial \nmarkets.\n  This Department is not only working. Its units are working \neffectively together and with American business to save and create \njobs.\n\n\n                          a piecemeal approach\n\n  Madam President, finally we should oppose this proposal not only \nbecause it does not belong on the debt limit extension and because it \nis substantively wrongheaded. We should also oppose it because it is a \npiecemeal approach to government reorganization, a proposal written \nwithout apparent attention to the rest of the government's operations.\n  In the 1950's, I had the privilege sitting on one of President \nHoover's commissions on government reorganization. Believe me, there is \na right way--a comprehensive, thoughtful way--to consider government \nreorganization. And the proposal before us is not the result of a \ncomprehensive, thoughtful process. It is far too piecemeal.\n\n\n                             industry views\n\n  Madam President, these objections to the House language are not just \nmy views or the those of other Senators. They also are the views of a \nvery large portion of the American business community. For example, I \nhave letters from the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nChamber of Commerce, and a major ad hoc industry coalition consisting \nof over 60 major corporations and trade associations. Let me quote from \nthe NAM letter:\n\n       We feel equally strongly that the goal of such a reduction \n     [in the size of government] should be a government that can \n     deal effectively with the demands of the 21st century global \n     economy. We agree with Peter Drucker's observation that the \n     government should be giving ``primacy to the country's \n     competitive position in an increasingly competitive world \n     economy.''\n       The Congress will not be able to meet this challenge if it \n     tries to do so in a piecemeal fashion, taking on one agency \n     or program at a time with the hope that everything will fit \n     together in the end.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of these remarks these \nthree letters be printed in the Record, as well as a copy of the \nBusiness Week article I cited earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n\n                        what are our priorities?\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the choice before the Senate is \nactually very simple and stark. It is a matter of priorities. Either we \nback our companies and workers, or we do not. Either the United States \ngets into the global economic fight, or we do not.\n  DOC supporters believe that our Government, like every other major \ngovernment in the world, should take prudent steps to support its \nindustries and workers--to help win at exports, technology, and other \nareas. This Department is fighting every day for American business, and \nit is succeeding. We should not break up the cooperative effort of \nbusiness and government that has developed in recent years.\n  Opponents of the Commerce Department would leave American business \nout there with no backing, no assistance, and fewer economic prospects. \nIt makes one wonder whether or not export jobs and high-tech jobs are a \npriority with these opponents.\n  In the final analysis, does anyone really believe that the American \npeople want the Government to do less to promote American exports and \nexport-related jobs? Does anyone really think that the American people \nwant less effort to enforce our laws against unfair trade practices? \nDoes anyone really believe that the American people want none of the \nGovernment's $72 billion annual research budget used to help create new \nbreakthrough technologies that will create the industries and jobs of \nthe future? Does anyone really believe that the American people want to \ncall a halt to modernizing our weather stations, or completing economic \ndevelopment projects in hard-hit rural communities across the land? Of \ncourse not. It is time that we get past trophy-hunting and start \nthinking about the economic interests of our people.\n  I urge our colleagues to strip this provision from the debt limit \nlegislation now before us, and I urge them, as well, to drop the entire \nidea of killing the Commerce Department.\n  We should want to win in the global economy, not quit the field. If \nSenators and Representatives feel they must kill a cabinet department, \nlet them pick one whose elimination will not leave our companies and \nworkers more vulnerable to economic competition. Let them not break \nfaith with the millions of Americans who want Government to promote \ntheir economic interests in this harsh new world economy, not abandon \nthem. As for myself, I will continue to oppose this foolish and \ndestructive proposal.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     U.S. Senate, 141 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: The effort to bring the federal budget into \n     balance by reducing the size of government is one that the \n     NAM strongly supports. We feel equally strongly that the goal \n     of such a reduction should be a government that can deal \n     effectively with the demands of the 21st century global \n     economy. We agree with Peter Drucker's observation that the \n     government should be giving ``primacy to the country's \n     competitive position in an increasingly competitive world \n     economy.''\n       The Congress will not be able to meet this challenge if it \n     tries to do so in a piecemeal fashion, taking on one agency \n     or program at a time with the hope that everything will fit \n     together in the end. A coalition of companies and \n     associations sent the entire Congress a letter on November 7 \n     making this same point. The NAM is in broad agreement with \n     the views expressed in this letter. A piecemeal approach to \n     restructuring will yield fewer satisfactory results--and less \n     budget savings--than a comprehensive approach that maps out \n     where we're going from the start.\n       This is why the NAM supports the establishment of a \n     bipartisan commission to recommend how to restructure the \n     government, particularly in those areas dealing with our \n     international economic interests and responsibilities. The \n     key to the success of such a \n\n[[Page S 16897]]\n     commission is to make sure that something happens once its work is \n     finished. There must be event-forcing mechanisms to ensure \n     that its recommendations are acted upon. Accordingly, the NAM \n     believes that the Congress should explore ways to provide a \n     government reform commission with powers similar to those \n     provided to commissions dealing with the closing of military \n     bases.\n       Combined with the significant steps already taken in 1995 \n     to reduce departmental and agency budgets, the establishment \n     of such a commission would underline the continuing \n     commitment of this Congress to downsize the government and \n     increase its effectiveness. The efforts to accomplish this \n     goal come at a time when the global economy and our role in \n     it are increasing. In restructuring the federal government, \n     we need a long-term plan to be implemented over the next \n     several years that reconciles these complex and conflicting \n     trends. The NAM believes that a bipartisan commission could \n     develop such a plan and that this could be done in such a \n     fashion to ensure that the work of the commission is acted \n     upon and not just buried. We urge you to support this \n     recommendation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jerry J. Jassnowski.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Ad Hoc Industry Coalition,\n\n                                                 November 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: We would like to convey our strong \n     support for a thorough and comprehensive review of the \n     federal government's organization and functions. We consider \n     this an essential step in the development of a successful \n     strategy to reduce the federal budget deficit and increase \n     the overall effectiveness of government.\n       We are greatly concerned, however, by present congressional \n     efforts to effect budgetary savings through the dismantlement \n     of a single department. Our concerns about this approach rest \n     primarily on two factors. First, adverse competitive effects \n     are likely to arise from the splintering and/or elimination \n     of several important functions presently performed by the \n     Commerce Department. Second, such a piecemeal approach to \n     restructuring will likely encounter more serious hurdles--and \n     ultimately yield less cost savings--than a more comprehensive \n     approach to such an important task.\n       We are not writing to defend the status quo. The many \n     changes that have occurred in the international economy in \n     recent years justify a review of the structure and functions \n     of the federal government to ensure that the United States is \n     well-prepared to compete in the 21st century. There are \n     undoubtedly various activities now performed by the U.S. \n     government that require streamlining, consolidation and, in \n     some instances, elimination. At the same time, there may be \n     other functions in which increased activity may be justified.\n       These matters have an impact on the ability of the United \n     States to create jobs, sustain its economic growth, and \n     participate effectively in the international marketplace. It \n     is, therefore, vital that any moves to restructure or \n     reorganize the federal government be undertaken only after a \n     thorough and careful analysis of all of the functions \n     performed by government. A hastily crafted or piecemeal \n     approach to such an important task is bound to yield a sub-\n     optimal result and could even have unintended adverse \n     effects.\n       Questions regarding the role of the federal government in \n     sustaining our nation's economic growth and international \n     competitiveness demand a comprehensive review through a \n     process that is open to all who have a stake in the outcome, \n     and such matters involve more than a single department's \n     functions. Accordingly, we urge you to refrain from \n     moving forward in the present manner and to work instead \n     toward the establishment of a non-partisan commission \n     whose task would be to develop within a specified \n     timeframe recommendations on how to restructure the \n     Federal Government overall to best support the Nation's \n     competitive and strategic needs in the coming decades.\n       Together with present steps to trim existing agencies' \n     budgets, such a review process would clearly reflect a \n     seriousness of intent to tackle Federal Government spending \n     while also ensuring that all who have a stake in the outcome \n     have the opportunity to be heard in the course of a \n     thoughtful and rational debate.\n       We stand ready to work with you toward this end. We believe \n     there is much to be gained from such an approach. In the \n     meantime, we appreciate your consideration of our views and \n     would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you \n     further in the coming days.\n           Sincerely,\n       ABB Inc., Aerospace Industries Association, Aetna Life and \n     Casualty Company, AlliedSignal Inc., American Iron and Steel \n     Institute, American Textile Manufacturers Institute, ARCO, \n     Armstrong World Industries, Inc., AT, Bedell Associates, \n     Bethlehem Steel Corporation, The Boeing Company, Burlington \n     Industries, Inc., Computer & Communication Industry \n     Association, Corning, Incorporated, Cray Research, Inc., \n     Dresser Industries, Inc., Economic Strategies Institute, \n     Enron Corp., ENSERCH Corporation, FED Corporation.\n       Floral Trade Council, Florida Partnership of the Americas, \n     Fluor Corporation, Footwear Industries of America, General \n     Electric Company, Guilford Mills, Inc./Guilford \n     International, Honeywell, Inc., Hughes Electronics \n     Corporation, IBM Corporation, Institute of Electrical & \n     Electronics Engineers--United States Activities, Institute \n     for Interconnection and Packaging Electronics, International \n     Business-Government Counsellors, Inc., Litton Industries, \n     Inc., Loral Corporation, LTV Steel Company, McDermott \n     Incorporated, Mission Energy Company, Motorola, Inc., Nelson \n     Communications Group.\n       NPES The Association for Suppliers of Printing and \n     Publishing Technologies, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, \n     Oracle Corporation, Pro Trade Group, Raytheon Company, \n     Rockwell International Corp., Samsonite Corporation, \n     Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute, Small \n     Business Exporters Association, Software Publishers \n     Association, Springs Industries, Stone & Webster Engineering \n     Co., Stratus Computer Inc., Summa Four, Inc., Tandem \n     Computers Inc., Tenneco Inc., Textron Inc., The Timken \n     Company, Torrington Company, United Technologies Corporation, \n     U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, USX Corporation, Varian \n     Associates, Inc., Western Atlas, Inc., Westinghouse Electric \n     Co.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Statement of U.S. Chamber of Commerce on International Commerce and \n                          Trade Reorganization\n\n       The U.S. Chamber reaffirms that enactment of legislation to \n     achieve a balanced federal budget by 2002 is among the most \n     important tasks facing the 104th Congress. All actions to \n     restructure or reorganize U.S. agencies and programs, \n     including those relating to U.S. competitiveness in \n     international commerce and trade, must be taken in a manner \n     that is consistent with the U.S. Chamber's balanced-budget \n     objective.\n       The U.S. government should approach the task of \n     restructuring the international commerce and trade sector by \n     considering what its objectives are before determining how \n     best to proceed. Any reorganization of such government \n     functions should only be initiated after a careful and \n     thorough analysis that includes consideration of inputs from \n     involved officials and potentially affected private parties.\n       The U.S. Chamber believes that the U.S. government should \n     avoid a piecemeal approach to restructuring and should \n     consider instead the full range of issues relating to any \n     reorganization. Such a comprehensive approach will facilitate \n     achievement of greater streamlining and reduction in overhead \n     costs through the consolidation or elimination of duplicative \n     functions than would occur under an approach that addresses \n     selected portions of U.S. government activity affecting \n     international commerce and trade.\n       To this end, Chamber supports the bipartisan establishment \n     of a process to (1) examine comprehensively the matter of \n     restructuring and reorganizing all of the international \n     commerce and trade functions of the U.S. government, and (2) \n     within a specific time frame, make recommendations on how to \n     proceed in a manner that ensures the enhanced effectiveness \n     of U.S. government functions critical to U.S. competitiveness \n     in the international marketplace while contributing to the \n     achievement of U.S. budget-balancing objectives.\n       To determine what, if any, consolidation, streamlining and/\n     or elimination of programs/functions is appropriate, this \n     process should adhere to the following objectives:\n       Approach this task with no preconceived notion about the \n     outcome, but rather, should weigh all available information \n     in making its recommendations.\n       Maintain a strong voice for U.S. commercial interests at \n     all levels within the U.S. government alongside those of \n     labor, human services, foreign policy, national security and \n     other critical elements of our society and government. The \n     U.S. government cannot afford to relegate commercial \n     interests to secondary status.\n       Recognize and give high visibility to both the role of \n     advocacy of U.S. commercial interests within the U.S. \n     government and abroad and the coordination/balancing of U.S. \n     policy among the several affected U.S. government agencies \n     within and without the international commerce and trade \n     sector.\n       Require a cost-benefit analysis and justification of all \n     U.S. government international commerce and trade functions. \n     This should include an analysis of whether the programs/\n     functions can be made available by the private sector.\n       Avoid consolidation of programs into government entities \n     whose missions are not dedicated primarily to the advancement \n     of U.S. commercial interests at home and abroad.\n       Harmonize Congressional oversight to correspond to the \n     international trade and competitiveness-related functions.\n       Maintain a strong relationship among all entities engaged \n     in international trade and competitiveness-related functions \n     and strengthen private-sector consultative mechanisms.\n       Maintain and improve the independent credit management \n     integrity of all financial service functions within the U.S. \n     international commerce and trade sector.\n       Recognize the importance of the strong enforcement and \n     implementation of trade agreements and laws.\n       Background.--The U.S. Chamber, since 1983, has advocated a \n     focused, cost-effective, coherent U.S. government \n     international trade policy and infrastructure. Such a policy \n     and \n\n[[Page S 16898]]\n     infrastructure does not now exist. U.S. government international \n     commerce and trade functions are presently administered and/\n     or supported by more than fourteen agencies driven by often \n     conflicting policy objectives and, while costing more than \n     $3.5 billion per year, without a singularly focused budget \n     discipline.\n       The national interest requires the attainment of a ``level \n     playing field'' for the commercial interests of the U.S. in \n     global markets. That interest can best be served while \n     addressing the national interest of balancing the federal \n     budget if the President and the senior advisors and officials \n     of that office are supported by a cost effective, focused \n     infrastructure. Such an infrastructure must put the U.S. \n     government in a position to:\n       Negotiate and enforce trade agreements that require the \n     reduction or elimination of unfair foreign trade barriers and \n     distortions;\n       Use access to the U.S. market as leverage to obtain access \n     to foreign markets; and\n       Enforce U.S. trade laws to remedy the adverse effects of \n     foreign dumping, subsidization and other unfair trade \n     practices;\n       Provide appropriate export development services and \n     advocacy to counter foreign government-supported competitors;\n       Limit the imposition of export and other trade controls to \n     those absolutely necessary to achieve legitimate U.S. \n     national security objectives.\n       The President and Congress, with the support of the private \n     sector, should articulate an international trade policy and \n     create a responsive supporting infrastructure that will.\n       Provide support services that are critical to a competitive \n     U.S. commercial position internationally, but are not \n     available from the private sector;\n       Subject federal export-oriented programs and/or activities \n     to quantifiable cost-benefit evaluation featuring the U.S. \n     employment consequences, the dollar-value of exported U.S. \n     goods and services, and the ``value-added'' content of \n     exported U.S. goods and services.\n       Maintain the capacity, where appropriate, to effectively \n     match subsidization and other forms of assistance offered by \n     our major trade competitors on a selective basis;\n       Provide assistance to capital projects in other countries \n     that have enduring value to the host country and are \n     distinguished by substantial U.S. company participation.\n       More specifically, a successful U.S. commerce and trade \n     infrastructure should incorporate programs and activities \n     that:\n       Recognize the importance of a strong voice for commercial \n     interests in the development of U.S. policies. The commercial \n     interests of the U.S. must not be relegated to secondary \n     status. The nation cannot afford to reduce the effectiveness \n     of U.S. international trade programs that are a linchpin of \n     the competitiveness of U.S. industry.\n       Recognize the crucial role that only the U.S. government \n     can play in providing in-country support to American \n     exporters of goods and services. U.S. government support in \n     the form of foreign market information-gathering and official \n     advocacy in necessary if U.S. exporters are to enjoy a level \n     playing field in competing for a share of these emerging \n     growth markets.\n       Provide competitive financial services, e.g., financing and \n     insurance that are not otherwise available but are required \n     to help U.S. companies remain competitive and penetrate \n     foreign markets. To maintain a broadly competitive position, \n     the United States must preserve or expand the contribution of \n     those federal agencies that help U.S. exporters compete and \n     prosper.\n       Recognize that as part of the U.S. government's strategic \n     plan to selectively match the subsidization assistance \n     offered by our major competitors, the U.S. government should \n     be prepared to fund project-related feasibility studies and \n     planning activities.\n       Recognize that the U.S. government must be prepared to take \n     meaningful actions to provide American companies an \n     opportunity to compete fairly in the global marketplace. \n     Negotiation and enforcement of trade agreements to remove \n     trade barriers and open markets, and enforcement of U.S. \n     trade laws against dumping, subsidization, intellectual \n     property violations and other unfair trade practices are \n     necessary complements to a successful export promotion and \n     job growth strategy.\n       Recognize that to the extent that there is a requirement \n     for U.S. export controls, such controls should not deter the \n     export of U.S. products when other nations are freely \n     marketing competitive products.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   A World of Greased Palms--Inside the Dirty War for Global Business\n\n       Intrigue fairly leaps off the pages of the classified U.S. \n     government report. A German electronics giant pays bribes to \n     win export sales. France demands 20% of Vietnam's \n     telecommunications market in exchange for aid. A European \n     aerospace company threatens to block European Union \n     membership for Turkey and Malta unless their national \n     airlines purchase its planes.\n       It's all part of a nasty, multibillion-dollar war being \n     waged over global markets. A secret Commerce Dept. study, \n     newly prepared with the help of U.S. intelligence agencies, \n     catalogs scores of incidents of bribery, aid with strings \n     attached, and other improper inducements by America's trading \n     partners. In the case of strings-attached foreign aid, the \n     deals may violate international trade pacts. And the cost of \n     such practices to the U.S. economy appears enormous. In 1994 \n     alone, U.S. intelligence tracked 100 deals worth a total of \n     $45 billion in which overseas outfits used bribes to undercut \n     U.S. rivals, the study says. The result: Foreign companies \n     won 80% of the deals.\n\n\n                             sanctimonious?\n\n       Among the main culprits are some of America's staunchest \n     political allies: France, Germany, and Japan. The \n     corporations involved aren't cited by name in the study, \n     which has been in the works for months and key parts of which \n     were reviewed by Business Week. But government sources \n     identify premier European hightech companies--including \n     Germany's Siemens, France's Alcatel Alsthom, and the European \n     airframe consortium Airbus Industrie--as among the major \n     practitioners. Foreign governments and companies, of course, \n     gripe that the Clinton Administration has been doing lots of \n     aggressive advocacy of its own to win deals for U.S. \n     business. ``Each time we win a deal, it's because of dirty \n     tricks,'' says an Airbus official with bitter sarcasm. ``Each \n     time Boeing wins, it's because of a better product.''\n       Indeed, many officials overseas view the U.S.'s holier-\n     than-thou attitude about shady business practices as naive \n     and hypocritical. As word of the report's contents gradually \n     leaks (some 50 copies recently were distributed to Congress \n     and key agencies), U.S. trading partners may be angered to \n     learn how closely American spies are tracking their dealings. \n     Indeed, the growing role of the CIA and its sister shops in \n     commercial information-gathering already is controversial, \n     with critics contending that the spies are inappropriately \n     trying to justify $28 billion budget in the post-cold-war \n     era. But former CIA General Counsel Elizabeth J. Rindskopf \n     says the CIA is simply responding to demands from other U.S. \n     government agencies for information to help level the global \n     playing field.\n       There's more to it than that. ``As the importance of \n     geopolitical struggle has declined, conflict has found a new \n     home,'' says Edward N. Luttwak, senior fellow at the Center \n     for Strategic & International Studies. ``Commercially, the \n     atmosphere has become envenomed.'' Economic trends tell the \n     tale: The U.S. is more dependent than ever on exports to fuel \n     its economic growth. Europe and Japan are saddled by slow \n     growth.\n       Heightened global competition adds to the temptation to \n     seek advantages through questionable tactics--particularly in \n     key sectors such as aerospace, where demand is weak, \n     ``Companies and governments are more willing to resort to \n     unconventional methods to make a sale because any sale is \n     precious,'' says Joel Johnson, international vice-president \n     for Aerospace Industries Assn. of America.\n       During the next decade, the pervasiveness of such practices \n     spells trouble for U.S. companies girding to compete for an \n     estimated $1 trillion worth of overseas infrastructure \n     projects. American business already is handicapped by the \n     U.S.'s comparatively puny spending on export promotion. The \n     Commerce report, which also reviews legitimate competitive \n     practices such as trade missions and financial aid to \n     exporters, revels a stark gap. In 1994, for every $1,000 of \n     gross domestic product, France spent more than 17 cents on \n     export-promotion programs; Japan, more than 12 cents. In \n     contrast, the U.S. spent 3 cents.\n       Even so, Republican trade hawks on Capitol Hill want to \n     slash funds for Commerce's trade programs. Commerce officials \n     hope the competitive-practices report will help derail those \n     moves. It's certainly a timely showcase for Commerce \n     Secretary Ronald H. Brown to reemphasize his role as roving \n     advocate for American business. ``The findings are \n     alarming,'' Brown told BUSINESS WEEK. ``There is no question \n     that we have been dramatically outgunned by our global \n     competitors, and many of those competitors use, to be kind, \n     unsavory practices.''\n\n\n                              Wads of Cash\n\n       But to some European executives, the Clinton Administration \n     doesn't shy away from questionable arm-twisting. An Airbus \n     official calls President Clinton's 1993 phone call to King \n     Fahd of Saudi Arabia to lobby for Boeing Co. and McDonnell \n     Douglas Corp. a ``blatant'' disregard for the rules. ``The \n     power of the American government is far greater than any \n     European government,'' the official says. Too bad, retorts \n     one U.S. official: ``If we're going to provide a security \n     umbrella for a country, it's reasonable to expect our \n     companies to get treated fairly.''\n       Certainly, not all U.S. companies have clean hands. In \n     October, a former vice-president at Lockheed Martin Corp. was \n     sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $125,000 fine for \n     bribing a member of the Egyptian Parliament to win an order \n     for three C-130 cargo planes. The case is surprising because \n     Lockheed was at the center of a bribery scandal in Japan \n     nearly 20 years ago and has signed a consent decree to \n     refrain from such practices. That paved the way for the 1977 \n     Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from \n     paying bribes to win business.\n       Some U.S. companies find creative ways to skirt the law. To \n     secure a mining venture in a developing nation, an American \n     company recently flew officials from the country to the U.S., \n     put them up in a fancy hotel for a week, and gave them a wad \n     of cash for a shopping spree. A U.S. intelligence source says \n     the trip is problematic: ``What's the difference between \n     giving an official shopping money and handing him an envelope \n     of cash in his office?''\n       But U.S. and other trade experts have little doubt that \n     overseas companies are more \n\n[[Page S 16899]]\n     likely to offer bribes because their cultures and legal systems permit \n     it. In France, foreign payments to middlemen are considered \n     legitimate business tax deductions. Germany has similar \n     rules, though officials in Bonn say they might junk them if \n     there were an international accord to outlaw bribery.\n       Even so, there's little U.S. support for easing antibribery \n     laws. Instead, many American executives are urging the \n     Administration to mount an aggressive campaign to get \n     foreigners to play more by U.S. rules. For starters, open up \n     to public scrutiny the contracting process for projects \n     funded by multilateral development banks, says Calman J. \n     Cohen, vice-president of the Emergency Committee for American \n     Trade, a group of 60 chief executives of America's leading \n     exporters.\n       U.S. officials vow to fight for reform. And foreign trading \n     partners may find that a good idea. As long as everyone--\n     including the U.S.--promises to play by the rules.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing \nopposition to including this provision to eliminate the Commerce \nDepartment on this measure.\n  Regardless of the position one takes on the issue of eliminating the \nCommerce Department, I do not believe it is proper for it to be \nincluded in the measure before us today.\n  Personally, I have strong concerns about one section of this proposal \nto eliminate Commerce--that is the section which reorganizes the trade \nfunctions.\n  I take a second seat to no one in my desire to cut government \nspending and eliminate the budget deficit. Removing this huge burden \nfrom the backs of our children and grandchildren should be our top \npriority.\n  I believe that one way to reduce the deficit is to eliminate and \ndownsize agencies--and there are several agencies which I have \nsuggested for elimination.\n  Certainly, the Commerce Department can stand some severe downsizing \nand reorganization. No one can argue that it is a well-thought-out, \nstreamlined agency. That does not, however, mean we ought to do that \ntrimming with a meat-axe.\n  Instead, we must do it carefully--in a way that ensures we do not \ndestroy programs critical to our national or economic security. I am \nconcerned that the proposal before us today will have just such an \nimpact--that is, it will harm our economic security and it will cost \njobs.\n  Exports are absolutely critical to our Nation's economic health and \nsecurity, and they will become even more so in the global economy of \nthe 21st century. If we are to maintain our place as the world's \nleading economy, we will have to increase our share of the world \nmarket. The competition will be tough and other companies will come to \nthe field armed with a wide array of tools provided by their \ngovernments--from high-level sales assistance to concessional \nfinancing, and even in some cases, outright bribes.\n  American firms need at least a helping hand if they are to remain \nable to compete in this rough atmosphere. Providing that edge is the \njob of our trade promotion and finance agencies, led by the \nInternational Trade Administration of the Commerce Department.\n\n  Generally, I would be the last one to argue that government ought to \nbe playing a more active role in any aspect of business. As chairman of \nthe Senate Small Business Committee, I hear daily from business owners \nwho have suffered at the hands of government bureaucracy and \noverregulation. The fact is, however, that if smaller firms are to \nenter and be successful in the global marketplace, they will, in many \ncases, need the support and encouragement of the government. Companies \nentering the international marketplace are vying with foreign \ncompetitors who have the active assistance and involvement of a wide \nrange of government agencies and officials. Without the support of \nagencies such as the U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service, the Export-\nImport Bank, OPIC, and TDA, American firms would often be left behind.\n  I would note, however, that it is not only small firms that need this \nassistance. Even huge companies cannot compete if their foreign \ncompetitors are getting special assistance from their home governments \nin terms of financing and marketing help.\n  In many parts of the world, customers are used to dealing with \ngovernment officials and private firms need the added help of a senior \nofficial--such as the Secretary of Commerce--to win sales.\n  And it is important to remember that the support of government is \ncritical in other areas, as well--ensuring a level playing field in \ntrade with other countries, for example, as we saw earlier this year \nwith the Japanese auto parts talks; and in the type of hands-on, high-\nlevel marketing we have seen by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and \nPresident Clinton. Government can also play a role by ensuring that our \nlaws and regulations do not impede exports. For example, in the \nInternational Finance Subcommittee which I chair, we are working on a \nrewrite of the Export Administration Act, a step which is badly needed \nto eliminate outdated and unnecessary controls and ensure that controls \nare doing the job they were intended to do--keeping critical technology \nout of the hands of our enemies, rather than keeping U.S. firms from \nbeing competitive.\n  Certainly, government cannot--and should not--do it all. But it is \nclear these agencies can provide the extra little bit needed to turn a \nnear loss into a win.\n  Unfortunately, the debate in Washington this year has not focused \non the importance of exports or the importance of ensuring that \nAmerican firms remain competitive. Instead the debate has turned to the \nneed to eliminate ``corporate welfare,'' and unfortunately--and I \nbelieve wrongly--these programs have been labeled corporate welfare.\n\n  Members can criticize these programs, but the fact is they are \nresponsible for creating and saving thousands of good-paying American \njobs that would otherwise go to Paris, Ottawa, London, or Osaka. I \ndon't want to see that happen, and I am certain most other Senators do \nnot either.\n  This is not just an abstract argument I am making--we are talking \nhere about real contracts and real jobs.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary Brown testified before my subcommittee \nin a closed session to present a classified report detailing some of \nthe activities that other countries are using to win deals for their \ncompanies. The report noted activities that are widely accepted such as \nhigh-level marketing. However, it also detailed questionable and \nillegal activities such as threats of aid cutoffs and outright bribes.\n  It is a fascinating report, and I urge my colleagues to go to S-407 \nand read it before voting to weaken our trade promotion and finance \nagencies which I would note, are funded at the lowest level of any \nmajor trading nation.\n  The proposal before us today is significantly better than proposals \nthat were offered earlier this year, at least with regard to the trade \nportions.\n  Instead of eliminating huge parts of the trade promotion and finance \nstaff, it eliminates only a portion, and consolidates them into a \nsingle agency--the new Office of the Trade Representative.\n  This new organization would bring together the existing Office of the \nTrade Representative, the Trade and Development Agency and the Commerce \nDepartment's International Trade Administration and Bureau of Export \nAdministration. It would be headed by the U.S. Trade Representative, \nwho would be designated a Cabinet officer by this administration. It \nwould not, however, be a department.\n  There are a number of problems I see with this proposal. First, it \nbrings together under one roof our good cop and bad cop on trade. I \nbelieve it will be very difficult for the head of this agency to do \nboth jobs--to travel to a country and beat up on them at one meeting \nfor not buying enough U.S. automobiles and then turn around and \noffering to sell them American built airplanes. It just does not seem \nlike it will work as well as the current system where Mickey Kantor \nnegotiates and enforces, and Ron Brown sells.\n\n  Second, this proposal would downgrade the status of many of our trade \nofficial which will have significant consequences in other countries \nwhere rank and face are important.\n  Third, this provision mandates spending cuts that would have a \ndevastating impact on our export agencies. Already this year, I had to \nfight off an attack on the funding for these trade agencies--cuts that \nwould have brought 600 layoffs out of the International Trade \nAdministration alone \n\n[[Page S 16900]]\nand which would have forced us to close nearly half of all domestic \noffices, and which would have left us without Commercial Officers in \nmany parts of the world. There was overwhelming support for restoring \nthe money when the bill was considered on the floor.\n  I would note that the funding cuts would also hit the Bureau of \nExport Administration--the agency charged with enforcing our export \ncontrol laws on high-tech exports. That is a problem for two reasons. \nFirst it will mean U.S. firms selling computers, telecommunications \nequipment, machine tools and other high-tech products will likely have \nto wait longer for licensing--likely losing sales as a result. Just as \nimportant, however, it is likely to result in poorer enforcement of the \nexport laws designed to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. That is precisely the wrong way to go at a time when we \nare seeing the growth of groups such as the AUM sect in Japan.\n  Perhaps we ought to be considering reorganization of our trade \nagencies. If we do, however, I think it should be with a clear \nunderstanding of what we are doing. And, I for one, am not convinced \nthat we have that understanding.\n  Thus, I urge my colleagues to reject this provision and to allow the \nSenate to get on with the pressing business at hand.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I oppose the attachment of the House \nCommerce dismantling bill to the debt limit bill. This is not the way \nto consider how to organize trade and technology functions. The \nPresident has requested a clean debt limit bill without extraneous, \nunrelated bills attached to it. Clearly the inclusion of the Commerce \ndismantling legislation weighs down the debt limit bill and should not \nbe considered as part of it.\n  This is a backdoor attempt to make economic growth the victim of our \nbudget axe. Trade, telecommunications, technology, weather services. \nThat is what is at risk. The House's intent to eliminate this \ndepartment is just not rational. In our enthusiasm to make cuts to \nbalance the budget we are losing sight of the reason we want to balance \nthe budget in the first place--to make our economy stronger. The irony \nis that by cutting the trade and technology programs we are cutting \nprograms that are already making our economy stronger. We will be \ndefeating our own purpose.\n  I am particularly concerned about keeping the technology and trade \nfunctions integrated in the Department of Commerce. Within the \nDepartment of Commerce there are programs that work with the private \nsector to foster new ideas that may underpin the next generation of \nproducts. This is one of the few places where there are information \nchannels that ensure that the ideas generated in our world class \nresearch institutions find their way into the marketplace. Previous \nadministrations had the foresight to realize that we are entering a new \nera, an era where economic battles are as fiercely fought as any \nprevious military actions. New kinds of technology programs were begun \nwith bipartisan support to make sure that the United States was well \narmed for these economic battles. I do not want to see us lose our \ntechnology edge in the marketplace, because this edge translates \ndirectly into jobs for our work force, new markets for American \nbusiness, improvements in our balance of trade, and from this economic \nsuccess, needed revenues for our treasury. The home of technology is \nwith our trade programs where they will have the most impact and do the \nmost good for our economy. The Technology Administration is a critical \ncomponent of the Department of Commerce and we need to make sure its \nkey functions are maintained. Yet the pending legislation would scatter \nCommerce agencies and slash technology spending.\n  Making changes in technology and trade functions at this juncture in \ntime must be done extremely carefully. New markets are emerging in \ndeveloping countries. Conservative estimates suggest that 60 percent of \nthe growth in world trade will be with these developing countries over \nthe next two decades. The United States has a large share of imports in \nbig emerging markets currently, in significant part because of the \nefforts of the Department of Commerce. While we are making changes in \nthe Department of Commerce, our foreign competitors are increasing \ntheir investment in their economies. Competing advanced economies are \njust waiting for us to make a move that will weaken our economic \ncapacity. We cannot afford to dismantle successful programs that are \nmaking and keeping the United States competitive. We should be sure \nthat changes we make will be improving the Government's efficiency and \nimproving the taxpayer's return on investment.\n  The kind of technology programs that I am advocating are not \ncorporate welfare. I find the term in this context not only inaccurate, \nbut offensive. American industry is not looking for a handout. Quite \nthe contrary. These programs are providing incentives to elicit support \nfrom the private sector for programs that are the responsibility of the \ngovernment. Times are tough and the government needs to cut back, so we \nare looking for the handout from private industry, not the other way \naround. Let me explain.\n\n  Our goal should be, not to try and categorize research, but to make \ninvestments that are appropriate, and that strengthen our economy. I \nbelieve that there is an important and legitimate role for government \nto play in technology research. The National Association of \nManufactures has spoken out strongly in favor of the kind of technology \nprograms that are run by the Department of Commerce. I would like to \nread some quotes from their statement about Federal technology \nprograms:\n\n       The NAM is concerned that the magnitude and distribution of \n     the R spending cuts proposed thus far would erode U.S. \n     technological leadership.\n       A successful national R policy requires a diverse \n     portfolio of programs that includes long- and short-term \n     science and technology programs, as well as the necessary \n     infrastructure to support them. The character of research \n     activities has changed substantially in the past decade, \n     making hard and fast distinctions between basic and applied \n     research or between research and development increasingly \n     artificial. R agendas today are driven by time horizons not \n     definitions. In short, rigid delineations between basic and \n     applied research are not the basis on which private sector \n     R strategies are executed, not should they be the basis for \n     Federal R policy decisions.\n       The NAM believes the disproportionate large cuts proposed \n     in newer R programs are a mistake. R programs of more \n     recent vintage enjoy considerable industry support for one \n     simple fact: They are more relevant to today's technology \n     challenges. For example, ``bridge'' programs that focus on \n     the problem of technology assimilation often yield greater \n     payoff to a wider public than programs aimed at technology \n     creation. Newer programs address current R challenges for \n     more effectively than older programs and should not fall \n     victim to the ``last hired, first fired'' prioritization.\n       In particular, partnership and bridge programs should not \n     only not be singled out for elimination, but should receive a \n     relatively greater share of what Federal R spending \n     remains. These programs currently account for approximately 5 \n     percent of Federal R spending. The NAM suggests that 15 \n     percent may be a more appropriate level . . .\n       Given the critical importance of R, far too much is being \n     cut on the basis of far too little understanding of the \n     implications. The world has changed considerably in the past \n     several years, and R is not different. Crafting a Federal \n     R policy must take stock of these changes; to date this has \n     not happened.\n       As the major funder and performer of the R in the U.S., \n     industry believes its voice should be heard in setting the \n     national R agenda. The Congress and the Administration \n     should draw on industry's experience and expertise in \n     determining policy choices. For example, as a guide to \n     prioritizing Fedeal R programs, the NAM would favor those \n     programs that embody the following attributes: Industry-led; \n     cost-shared; relevant to today's R challenges; partnership/\n     consortia; deployment-oriented; and dual use.\n       We believe these criteria provide the basis for creation of \n     a template for prioritizing federal R spending.\n       In sum, the NAM remains firmly committed to a balanced \n     federal budget. But we also firmly believe that the action \n     taken thus far in downsizing and altering the direction of \n     U.S. R spending is tantamount to fighting hunger by eating \n     the seed corn. We urge the Congress to consider carefully the \n     impact of R on U.S. economic vitality and to move forward \n     in crafting an R agenda that will sustain U.S. \n     technological leadership far into the future.\n\n  I would like to describe two programs in which I have taken a \nparticular interest, the Advanced Technology Program [ATP] and the \nManufacturing Extension Program [MEP], both eliminated by the pending \nbill. \n\n[[Page S 16901]]\n\n\n\n                                  atp\n\n  Dr. Alan Bromley, President Bush's Science Advisor in 1991, \ndetermined a list of 20 technologies that are critical to develop for \nthe United States to remain a world economic power. There has been very \nlittle disagreement among analysts and industry about the list. No one \ncompany benefits from these technologies, rather a variety of \nindustries would benefit with advances in any one of these areas. These \nare the kinds of areas that form the focus areas of the ATP. The focus \nareas are determined by industry, not by bureaucrats, to be key areas \nwhere research breakthroughs will advance the economy as a whole not \nsingle companies.\n  There is no doubt that industry benefits from partnering with the \nGovernment. The nature of the marketplace has changed, and \ntechnological advances are a crucial component in maintaining our \nstature in the new world marketplace. Product life cycles are getting \nmore and more compressed, so that the development of new products must \noccur at a more and more rapid pace. The market demands products \nfaster, at higher quality and in wider varieties--and the product must \nbe delivered just in time. Innovative technological advances enhance \nspeed, quality, and distribution, to deliver to customers the product \nthey want, when they want it. Ironically, the competitive market \ndemands that companies stay lean and mean, diminishing the resources \nthat are available for R programs that foster the kind of innovation \nnecessary to stay competitive. Because of all of these pressures, \nindustrial R is now focused on short-term product development at the \nexpense of long-term research to generate future generations of \nproducts.\n  The conclusion is clear. This short-term focus will lead to \ntechnological inferiority in the future. Our economy will suffer. Some \nof my colleagues in Congress believe that basic research will provide \nthe kind of innovation necessary to generate new generations of high \ntech products. On the contrary, we have seen historically that basic \nresearch performed in a vacuum, that is without communication with \nindustry, is unlikely to lead to products.\n  In this country, we have the best basic research anywhere in the \nworld. There is no contest. Yet, we continue to watch our creative \nbasic research capitalized by other nations. We must improve our \nability to get our brilliant ideas to market. Basic research focuses on \na time horizon of 10 to 20 years. Product development focuses on a time \nhorizon of less than 5 years, and sometimes much shorter than that. It \nis the intermediate timescale, the 5 to 15 year timeframe that is \ncritical to develop a research idea into a product concept.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure that our private sector does \nnot fall behind in the global economy. Diminishing our technological \npreparedness is tantamount to unilateral disarmament, in an \nincreasingly competitive global marketplace. Government/industry \npartnerships stimulate just the kind of innovative research that can \nkeep our technological industry at the leading edge. These partnerships \nhelp fill the gap between short term product development, and basic \nresearch.\n\n  American companies no longer survive by thinking only about the \nnational marketplace. They must think globally. Familiar competitors \nlike Japan and Germany, continue to compete aggressively in global \nmarkets. New challenges are coming from India, China, Malaysia, \nThailand, some of the leading Latin American nations and more. We \ncannot afford to let jobs and profits gradually move overseas to these \nchallengers, by resting on our laurels, complacent in our successes. \nOther countries, seeing the success of the ATP, are starting to imitate \nit, just as we are considering doing away with it. Our competitors must \nbe chuckling at their good fortune, and our short-sightedness. We \nsimply cannot afford to eliminate ATP, as the bill proposes.\n\n\n                                  MEP\n\n  The state of manufacturing in this country is mixed. On the one hand \nour manufacturing productivity is increasing, but on the other hand we \nare losing manufacturing jobs by the millions. Manufacturing which once \nwas the life blood of our economy is bleeding jobs overseas. We need to \nprovide the infrastructure that insures that our manufacturing industry \nflourishes.\n  As I look at our manufacturing competitors, I am struck by how little \nwe do to support this critical component of our economy. In the United \nStates we are sued to being the leaders in technologies of all kinds. \nHistorically, English words have crept into foreign languages, because \nwe were the inventors of new scientific concepts, technology, and \nproducts. Now when you describe the state-of-the-art manufacturing \npractices you use words like kanban and pokaoke. These are Japanese \nwords that are known to production workers all over the United States. \nKanban is a word which describes an efficient method of inventory \nmanagement, and pokaoke is a method of making part of a production \nprocess immune from error or mistake proof thereby increasing the \nquality of the end product. We have learned these techniques from the \nJapanese, in order to compete with them.\n  In a global economy, there is no choice, a company must become state-\nof-the-art or it will go under. We must recognize that our policies \nmust change with the marketplace and adapt our manufacturing strategy \nto complete in this new global marketplace. The Manufacturing Extension \nProgram [MEP] is a big step forward in reforming the role of Government \nin manufacturing. This forward looking program was begun under \nPresident Reagan, and has received growing support from Congress since \n1989.\n  The focus of the MEP program is one that historically has been \naccepted as a proper role of government: education. The MEP strives to \neducate small and mid-sized manufacturers in the best practices that \nare available for their manufacturing processes. With the MEP we have \nthe opportunity to play a constructive role in keeping our companies \ncompetitive in a fiercely competitive, rapidly changing field. When \nmanufacturing practices change so rapidly, it is the small and mid-\nsized companies that suffer. They cannot afford to invest the necessary \ntime and capital to explore all new trends to determine which practices \nto adopt and then to train their workers, invest in new equipment, and \nrestructure their factories to accommodate the changes. The MEP's act \nas a library of manufacturing practices, staying current on the latest \ninnovations, and educating companies on how to get the best results. At \nthe heart of the MEP is a team of teachers, engineers, and experts with \nstrong private sector experience ready to reach small firms and their \nworkers about the latest manufacturing advances.\n\n  Another benefit of the MEP is that is brings its clients into contact \nwith other manufacturers, universities, national labs and any other \ninstitutions where they might find solutions to the problems. \nFacilitating these contacts incorporates small manufacturers into a \nmanufacturing network, and this networking among manufacturers is a \npowerful competitive advantage. With close connections, suppliers begin \nworking with customers at early stages of design and engineering. When \nsuppliers and customers work together on product design suppliers can \nprovide the input that makes manufacturing more efficient, customers \ncan communicate their specifications and timetables more effectively, \nand long-term productive relationships are forged. These supplier/\ncustomer networks are common practice in other countries, and lead to \nmore efficient and therefore more competitive, design and production \npractices.\n  The MEP is our important tool in keeping our small manufacturers \ncompetitive. We are staying competitive in markets that have become \nhotbeds of global competition, and we are beginning to capture some new \nmarkets. More importantly, companies that have made use of MEP are \ngenerating new jobs rather than laying off workers or moving jobs \noverseas. These companies are growing and contributing to real growth \nin the U.S. economy. For each Federal dollar invested in a small or \nmid-size manufacturer through the MEP, there has been $8 of economic \ngrowth. This is a program that is paying for itself by growing our \neconomy.\n  Each MEP is funded after a competitive selection process, and \ncurrently there are 44 manufacturing technology centers in 32 States. \nOne requirement \n\n[[Page S 16902]]\nfor the centers is that the States supply matching funds, ensuring that \ncenters are going where there is a locally supported need. In summary, \nthe MEP provides the arsenal of equipment, training, and expertise that \nour small and mid-sized manufacturers need to keep them in the new \nglobal economic battlefield.\n  The ATP and the MEP are critical technology investments. They are \nboth run under the auspices of the National Institutes of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST. This legislation would completely cut these programs. \nIn addition to these NIST programs, NIST itself is at risk. NIST would \nbe renamed to its previous title, National Bureau of Standards and \nmerge with NOAA. The research programs at NIST would be drastically \ncut. I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention, a recent letter \nsent by 25 American nobel prize winners in physics and the presidents \nof 18 scientific societies. As the New York Times put it ``Budget \ncutters see fat where scientists see a national treasure''. These \nscientists are shocked and appalled that we could think of making major \ncuts in NIST and its programs. According to the scientists ``It is \nunthinkable that a modern nation could expect to remain competitive \nwithout these services'' and they continue ``We recognize that your \neffort to balance the budget is forcing tough choices regarding the \nDepartment of Commerce, however the laboratories operated by NIST and \nfunded by the Department of Commerce are a vital scientific resource \nfor the Nation and should be preserved in the process of downsizing the \nFederal Government.'' These scientists are the leaders of the \nscientific community and we should not ignore their advice.\n  The rush to obliterate the Department of Commerce is senseless. In an \nattempt to streamline government function, the House proposal takes one \nagency and creates three: OUSTR [Office of US Trade Representative], \nthe Patent and Trademark Office, which becomes a separate government-\nowned corporation, and NSOAA [National Science, Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration]. This dismantlement effort in the end is box shuffling. \nIt will scatter a consolidated agency among a long series of other \nagencies and cost money to enact, not save money. Creating such chaos \nonly to achieve fragmented programs is irresponsible. Investments in \nthe trade and technology functions in Department of Commerce are \ninvestments in our future economic health, in high wage jobs for our \nworkers, in the American dream. To dissolve or reorganize it should not \nbe taken lightly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this debt ceiling legislation also includes \nan entirely new regulatory reform overhaul, language which we have not \nseen before it was sent over from the House today. The effort to force \na comprehensive and complex proposal through on a debt ceiling bill is \nirresponsible.\n  We have been working on regulatory language for months in the Senate. \nAs much as I am a strong proponent of regulatory reform, I cannot \nunderstand how we can be asked to legislate language dropped upon us \nunder the time pressure of a bill which is necessary to protect the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. Such an effort is \nunprecedented and unwarranted. Its inclusion in the debt limit \nlegislation threatens this necessary bill and does not advance the \ncause of regulatory reform.\n  No responsible Member of Congress should be playing Russian roulette \nwith the full faith and credit of the United States, but that's exactly \nwhat's going on here today.\n  By sending us a bill loaded with proposals that the House knows the \nPresident will find unacceptable, it is asking the Senate to join it in \nforcing the President to play the game of Russian roulette. The House \nhas handed the Senate a loaded gun and dared us to send it on to the \nPresident.\n  It is Russian roulette with five bullets in the six chambers.\n  We should not do it. We should unload the bullets and send a clean \nbill to the President that does nothing more than provide the debt \nlimit increase needed to meet this country's financial obligations.\n  The bill sent to us by the House makes default more likely. It risks \nnot only our credit around the world, but also people here at home. \nThis is a game that could blow up in our faces, with tighter credit, \nhigher rates for business, higher mortgage and car loan rates for \nconsumers. No responsible legislator should play this game with the \nAmerican economy.\n  Besides playing with the full faith and credit of the United States, \nthe bill includes legislative bullets that are unrelated to debt \nmanagement. The debt ceiling legislation is merely used as a means to \nwall these provisions off from thoughtful debate and amendment. These \nmeasures are unprecedented and extreme proposals to change the way we \nissue Federal regulations, promote business through the Commerce \nDepartment, and limit access to the courts.\n  Mr. President, I support the motion to strike from the debt ceiling \nbill the provisions that would dismantle the Department of Commerce.\n  Dismantling cost-effective programs that support U.S. trade and \nindustry defies common sense. It is foolhardy. It is bad for the \ncountry and bad for my home State of Michigan.\n  The Department of Commerce is the Federal agency that is in the \ntrenches, on a day-to-day basis, fighting for American business and \nAmerican jobs in the global trade wars.\n  These trade wars are ones we can't afford to lose. Trade means \ngrowth, profits and jobs. U.S. exports, 90 percent of which are \nmanufactured goods, provide many of the high-wage jobs American \nfamilies need to survive.\n  The Commerce Department advances U.S. trade by helping U.S. firms \nmeet export requirements, find new market lower manufacturing costs and \ndevelop new technologies. Its programs provide practical, cost \neffective and proven ways to increase U.S. trade. Slashing these \nprograms strikes at the heart of American competitiveness.\n  The bill's proponents claim that ending this agency would shrink \ngovernment and save money. In reality, this bill would replace one \nagency with two, cut trade programs by 25 percent eliminate successful \nindustry programs, and dictate a raft of bureaucratic box-shuffling \nthat would cost money rather than save it.\n  The Commerce Department is a Federal agency whose mission isn't to \nregulate business, but to assist American firms build exports, profits \nand American jobs. This bill threatens each and every one of the \nDepartment's trade and industry programs.\n  When legislation to dismantle the Department of Commerce was first \nreferred to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I sit, \nI went to businesses across my State of Michigan to ask how they felt \nabout it. The business community let me know in no uncertain terms how \nfoolhardy they think dismantlement is.\n  Michigan is the third largest exporting State behind California and \nTexas. Last year, $35 billion in exports supported 100's of 1000's of \nMichigan jobs. Ninety-eight percent of Michigan's exports were \nmanufactured goods. Literally thousands of Michigan companies use \nDepartment of Commerce trade and industry programs to increase their \nexports, improve their operations and grow their businesses.\n  These trade and industry programs don't proved handouts, but cost-\neffective support for some of the hardest working companies in our \nState--companies providing the high-wage jobs Michigan families need.\n  The chorus of praise for these programs from the Michigan business \ncommunity include terms not often applied to government programs. Here \nare a few samples taken from letters.\n  ``I cannot begin to comprehend the thought processes behind the \nabolishment of the one governmental agency that is so in tune and \ninvolved with the United States taking its rightful place in the * * * \nglobal economy,'' wrote Second Chance Body Armor of Central Lake, MI.\n  ``[O]pponents to the Department of Commerce must have their heads in \nthe sand * * *'' wrote Electro-Wire Products of Dearborn, MI.\n  ``(Abolition) would not save any tax dollars and would result in less \neffective enforcement of U.S. unfair trade laws,'' wrote Medusa Cement \nof Charlevoix, MI.\n  ``[Dismantling programs to develop U.S. and international industry \nstandards] is misguided and completely detrimental to the future of the \nentire manufacturing sector,'' wrote Redco Corporation of Troy, MI. \n\n[[Page S 16903]]\n\n  Letters supporting Department of Commerce programs have flowed in \nfrom a wide variety of businesses and organizations, including \nthe World Trade Club of the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce; Ann \nArbor Area Chamber of Commerce; The Right Place Program in Grand \nRapids; Michigan Quality Council in Rochester; Perceptron in Farmington \nHills; Whirlpool Corp. in St. Joseph; Masco in Taylor; and more.\n\n  That's just a few from Michigan. The Department of Commerce has \nthousands of letters from businesses across the country opposing \ndismantlement of its trade and industry programs.\n  Right now, the United States is dead last among its major trading \npartners in spending to build exports. Germany, for example, spends \ntwice as much as we do. Japan currently invests 35 percent more than \nthe United States on a per capita basis in civilian technology and \nplans to double the country's R spending by 2000. But this bill would \nslash U.S. spending on exports, manufacturing, and technology \ndevelopment by significant amounts.\n  The bill would slash 25 percent from all trade programs, for example, \nendangering enforcement of unfair trade laws, export assistance for \nsmall business, and trade negotiations. Export assistance offices in \nfour Michigan cities that help thousands of Michigan companies break \ninto foreign markets and build exports, might be lost.\n  The bill would eliminate altogether the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program that helps small- and mid-sized manufacturers get \nlean and mean enough to compete globally. It would close centers like \nthe Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center which helps 1,000 small- \nand mid-sized Michigan manufacturers each year. Earlier this year, when \nasked to eliminate funding for this program, the House and Senate \nrefused on a bipartisan basis to do so.\n  The bill would eliminate the Advanced Technology Program which \nencourages research into state-of-the-art, cross-cutting technologies \ncritical to future exports. Since 1990, this program has pumped over \n$73 million into Michigan firms, promising competitiveness gains, new \nmarkets, and new high-wage jobs. Under this bill, that investment in \nour future would be seriously diminished.\n  The bill would also play havoc with the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, a little known but key agency in the fight to \nlower trade barriers to U.S. goods by negotiating international \nindustry standards and winning acceptance of U.S. standards. The bill \nwould transfer it to a new agency, give it new responsibilities and \nthen cut its budget by 25 percent. The end result would be nothing less \nthan a serious blow to the technical infrastructure supporting U.S. \nindustry, research, trade, and competitiveness.\n  We've spent weeks here on the Senate floor talking about the need for \ncost-effective Federal programs. Well, here's an agency that has them, \nand we're being asked to cut them by a fourth or eliminate them \naltogether.\n  The export assistance offices targeted for 25-percent cuts, for \nexample, cost $27 million annually. Studies show that for every dollar \nspent, new exports generate $10 in new tax revenue. In 1994, this $27 \nmillion investment generated $25 billion in new U.S. exports and $2.5 \nbillion in new tax revenues. Not to mention the jobs and income \ngenerated for U.S. workers.\n  The Manufacturing Extension Partnership targeted for elimination cost \n$71 million in fiscal year 1994. A study of just 500 manufacturing \ncompanies that used the program to modernize their operations found \nthat these companies had experienced $167 million in new sales, \ninvestments, and cost savings and generated 3,400 new jobs. Taxpayers \nare getting an 8 to 1 return on every dollar spent on this program.\n  The Advanced Technology Program, also targeted for extinction, has \nbeen in operation for only a few years, but initial data shows the \nprogram is accelerating technology development, encouraging productive \npartnerships between American firms, and producing new jobs at 90 \npercent of the small firms surveyed. Why eliminate this effective spur \nto American competitiveness?\n  The Commerce Department trade and industry programs represent a small \npercentage of the Department's entire budget, yet produce enviable \nresults and the praise of business and community members alike. These \nare exactly the low-cost, high customer satisfaction programs that we \nwant from government. So why are these the programs on the chopping \nblock?\n  Dismantling these programs is not the only problem with the bill \nprovisions in this area. There are many more, including abolishing the \nEconomic Development Administration, eliminating a whole host of marine \nand Great Lakes research programs, fundamentally changing the Patent \nand Trademark Office, eliminating important telecommunications and \nbroadcasting programs, alerting a key NAFTA implementation office; the \nlist goes on.\n  The bill impacts a very large number of programs and agencies. It \nproposes, in effect, a fundamental restructuring of our trade agencies, \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, key statistics \nagencies, and others. I don't disagree with all of the changes being \nproposed. The problem is that these changes would be made without the \nbenefit of an overall government reorganization plan, a plan that is a \nkey part of the Senate bill that passed the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on this topic. Making the fundamental changes called for in \nthis bill before an overall reorganization plan has been devised is \nputting the cart before the horse. It's a mistake.\n  The final point I would like to make is to repeat what I have said \nelsewhere. The proposal to dismantle the Commerce Department has no \nbusiness on the debt ceiling bill. It has nothing to do with ensuring \nthat the United States is able to meet its financial obligations, and \nit is being presented in a context that shortcircuits both debate and \namendment.\n  For reasons of both policy and process, I urge my colleagues to \nreject this bill's unthinking and short-sighted demolition of trade and \nindustry programs important to American business, American workers, and \nAmerican jobs.\n  Mr. President, the habeas corpus provisions added to this bill in the \nHouse of Representatives have no place in a continuing resolution \neither.\n  Under current law, an unconstitutional State court decision may be \noverturned in Federal court. For a violation of the Federal \nConstitution, there is a Federal court remedy. Under the bill before \nus, that would no longer be true.\n  Under this bill, the Federal courts would be powerless to prevent \nunconstitutional State court actions unless the Supreme Court has \nalready ruled on the specific type of violation at issue--even if every \nsingle Federal Circuit Court of Appeals had already ruled that such \nactions violate the plain words of the Constitution.\n  Under this bill, the Federal courts would be powerless to grant a \nconstitutional claim that was wrongly denied by a State court, as long \nas the State court acted in a ``reasonable'' manner. This standard \nestablishes a whole new concept--the ``reasonable'' violation of the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Under this bill, the Federal courts would be powerless even to help \nthose who were found guilty because the prosecution withheld evidence \nproving their innocence. In its simplest terms, this bill would render \nFederal courts powerless to defend the U.S. Constitution and to protect \nthe innocent from imprisonment or even execution.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes fifty-two seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 2 minutes 50 seconds to my distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my good friend, the Senator from South \nCarolina, who has fought for these issues for a long time.\n  I am very glad that the Senator from Michigan does not want to \neliminate the Department of Commerce because, as the Senator from South \nCarolina says, it seems to me that is the closest thing to unilateral \ndisarmament as this country could accomplish. There is an enormous \nbattle going on right now, and we are not winning. Just exactly at the \ntime that the United States is reducing our defense civilian research \nand development, the Japanese--whose \n\n[[Page S 16904]]\neconomy is not in particularly good shape--are doubling their \nnondefense research and development. Either we are going to be training \nthe next generation of engineers who will manufacture products which \nwill in fact be the kind of products that give high wages--in fact, if \nyou look at 1992 and the high-technology products, those wages in the \nmanufacture of those products were $41,000, and other wages that did \nnot relate to that were closer to the upper 20's. So are we going to be \nproducing the next generation of engineers, or is it going to be the \nJapanese?\n  One of the arbiters of that--not the entire arbiter of that, but \none--is the work done by the Department of Commerce. The concept of \neliminating the Department of Commerce is just so fundamentally \nshocking to me, because it works every day with small businesses and \nlarge businesses in very creative ways.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment to clean off what I call the \ngraffiti that has been scrawled onto the debt ceiling measure before \nus. In the other body, something called Department of Commerce \nDismantling legislation was tossed onto this debt limit bill. This is \nan embarrassing way to deal with something as profoundly important as \nthe full faith and credit of the United States of America. The \namendment to erase the Commerce Department Dismantling part from this \nbill should be adopted; and I truly hope it will be delivered with the \nkind of strong, bipartisan signal that I am convinced exists among us.\n  Everyone in the Senate knows that Americans want us to insist on a \nmore effective, better-managed, better-organized federal government. I \nwould not even try tonight to recite how I believe both the \nAdministration and many of us here in the Senate have pursued that goal \nin the past several years.\n  But Americans are not asking us to insult them. If you look at what \nthe Commerce Department Dismantling bill would actually end up costing \nus--and how much it would end up hurting us--this idea is one to stop, \nand stop now.\n  Actually, the elimination of the Department of Commerce is a terrific \nway to strengthen our foreign competitors and weaken the United States \neconomically. The supporters of such a move may not intend to do that--\nbut the effect would be the same. The Department of Commerce is the \nagency that day-in and day-out is working with America's businesses--\nfrom the smallest in size to our major corporations--to research the \nlatest technologies, export our products to every conceivable market, \nenforce our laws against unfair and destructive trade practices that \nhurt American workers and businesses, and perform a series of other \nmissions that we cannot afford to abandon for a single minute.\n  Look at what happened in the other body when they took the Department \nof Commerce into their operating room. They did not simply wipe out an \nagency. They were forced to take division after division and actually \ncreate new agencies with new addresses and new bureaucracies to make \nsure the work still gets done. The legislation in this debt limit bill \nwould waste taxpayers' money and many years' effort on taking apart \nmany parts of the Commerce Department only to transplant them someplace \nelse.\n  The dismantling legislation does try to eliminate completely a few \naspects of the Commerce Department's work. Among the major targets are \nthe programs that invest in technology and represent a significant part \nof this country's commitment to research and development.\n  Mr. President, this is exactly the wrong time to back away from R, \nespecially in the emerging technologies that determine whether this is \nthe country that will make the new type of computer chip or whether it \nwill be Japan * * * whether ours will be the country to stay ahead in \ntelecommunications or whether we just hand our competitive edge and \nmarkets over to Europe. Will we continue to manufacture the products \nthat pay our people higher wages and support a middle-class, or will we \ntrade places with other countries scrambling to claim our place in an \nincreasingly competitive world--and watch wages in America go down and \ndown?\n  A report just released by the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisors rang some clear warning bells about this country's economic \nfuture. They are warnings, they are not a death notice--yet. The \nCouncil looks at the budget cuts being proposed this year in Federal \nnon-defense research, amounting to a 30-percent cut by the year 2002, \nand flashes a glaring red light to alert us of the danger we face. As \nwe speak, Japan is planning to double its government support of non-\ndefense R We simply cannot retreat from investing in science, in \ntechnology, in innovation, and expect to produce the prosperity and \nstandard of living that supports the American way and the American \ndream. It is just not possible.\n  This country has such a proud, long history of innovation and \noptimism about the future through our commitment to education, to \nresearch, and to knowledge. When we think of ourselves as a nation, we \nthink of ourselves as intellectual pioneers and entrepreneurs. We think \nof Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers, the space \nprogram, and, now, the new pioneers like Bill Gates. American support \nof technology and research has led to the success of the airplane, the \njet engine, computers, and even the Internet.\n  This is what the Department of Commerce is about--it operates a \nseries of programs that do everything from working as a partner with \nindustry to developing new path-breaking technologies, to running a \nseries of manufacturing extension centers that exist to help small- and \nmedium-sized businesses in every single State learn how to take \nadvantage of technology. These are the programs that generate jobs, \nexports, and opportunity in West Virginia and in every other State of \nthe Union.\n  The Commerce Department is the missionary agency for exporters, \nsmall, medium, and large. Anyone who has worked with the U.S. & Foreign \nCommercial Service knows how hard they fight for the best interests of \nAmerican firms abroad. They have done yeoman's work on trade missions I \nhave led for West Virginia companies in Japan and Taiwan. It is my \nstrong belief that we were so effective in those missions, in large \npart, because FCS officers put business first. The dismantling \nlegislation would eliminate their presence in this country and merge \nthe foreign offices with the United States Trade Representative's \noffice. USTR does not want or need to be burdened with having to \nnegotiate on the one hand and promote and enforce on the other.\n  This dismantling is not about better government. It is not about \nimproving our trade promotion. It is not about making the enforcement \nof our trade laws work more efficiently. And it is certainly not about \nmaking it easier for our trade negotiators to do their jobs.\n  If this were about better government, we would not be burdening the \nU.S. Trade Representative with a big and unfamiliar bureaucracy. If \nthis were about better government we would not be creating a bunch of \nnew agencies. If this were about better government, we would not be \nasking our trade agency to balance trade negotiation, trade law \nenforcement, and trade promotion. If this were about better government, \nwe would not be relegating our Nation's trade agenda to a lower level, \ntaking it out of the Cabinet, and moving the business of American \nbusiness off the Nation's agenda.\n  Again, abolishing the Department of Commerce is an excellent way to \nstrengthen our foreign competitors and weaken the United States \neconomically. I find it hard even to conceive how the proponents \nconcocted such a notion.\n  At a time when our country has to compete with more than 120 other \nnations for markets and jobs, where is the logic in eliminating the \nsingle agency dedicated, day-in and day-out, to outdoing our \ncompetitors in exports and trade?\n  At a time when technology is the proven key to America's economic \ngrowth, to success in selling products in foreign markets, and to \ndefining our national belief in progress and innovation, where is the \nsense in killing off our already-modest support for American \ntechnology? The Department of Commerce provides a set of useful and \nnecessary tools to help small and medium-sized businesses get a better \nhandle on technology and to invest in longer-term R aimed at making \n\n[[Page S 16905]]\nmajor technological advances and ensuring that the U.S.--not our \ncompetitors--will have the high-wage jobs and high-tech industries.\n  When we are fortunate to have one agency focused on American business \nand industry, with a voice in the Cabinet, a direct link to the \nPresident, and proven clout in the world, how does one come up with the \nidea of getting rid of it?\n  If I believed in conspiracies, I would find myself thinking that this \nback door effort, this attempt to attach a lame piece of legislation to \nthe debt ceiling--a piece of legislation that could not get through the \nCongress on its own--was some kind of foreign plot to steal American \njobs, break our trade laws, and force a technological and economic \nsurrender. That is what this bill is--surrender on the field of \neconomic and technological competition--and that is why proponents know \nthat if they tried to ride this broken down horse of legislation \nthrough on its own, the Senate in its good sense would put it out of \nits misery.\n  I say to my colleagues, resist the temptation to flash in front of \nthe American people an easy symbol of your commitment to deficit \nreduction and shrinking government. Resist making a vague ideological \npoint at the expense of your Nation's best interests. Think of what you \nwould feel about abolishing the Department of Defense at the height of \nthe cold war. This legislation before you is the same lunacy--\nsuggesting economic disarmament at the very time when the United States \nshould be beefing up our arsenal of trade enforcement, export \npromotion, technology investment, and local economic development.\n  So I am glad that the Senator from Michigan is going to wait until \nanother day to try to do this. I will be here at that time to try to \ndefeat that effort. But I am glad it is not taking place this evening.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield a minute to my distinguished chairman, Senator \nMoynihan.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, almost as an aside but a serious one, \nI note that a part of the provision that we are about to strike would \ncombine the Bureau of the Census with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nAnd as the Senator from South Carolina knows, in article I, section 2 \nof the Constitution, we provide for a decennial census and that has \nbeen our great strength and source of data for this country. But there \nhas come a time when consolidating makes sense. The Canadians have done \nthis, with Statistics Canada, at considerable success, something I \nthink in time we ought to do. I simply make that observation.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield myself such time as I need.\n  I appreciate some of the points that have been made. We have had \nthese discussions in the context of committee debates and so on on this \nissue, but I think it is important to make two points.\n  First, my position with respect to the Department of Commerce has not \nchanged. As the prime sponsor of this legislation, I remain committed \nto it. Tonight is just not the night I think this debate should occur.\n  There are a lot of arguments made which suggest that somehow the \nDepartment of Commerce makes the engine of this country's free \nenterprise system function. I have talked to business people in my \nState and business people across the country. They do not share that \nopinion. In fact, a recent poll that was conducted by the Chamber of \nCommerce of Detroit, MI, which is a very bipartisan organization, \nindicated 47 percent of those polled supported eliminating the \nDepartment of Commerce, only 6 percent were opposed, and the rest just \ndid not have an opinion.\n  The fact is that the Department of Commerce as currently comprised is \nnot a Department that deals exclusively with, or for that matter in \nlarge measure with, commerce and creating jobs and opportunities. In \nfact, the largest operation within the Department is NOAA, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It is, indeed, the largest \nsubunit of the Department of Commerce, and while it has some connection \nwith activities relating to commerce, not much of it does. In addition, \na large part of the Department of Commerce is what I guess we would \nterm duplicative of other aspects of the Federal Government.\n  In fact, a GAO study recently indicated that the Department of \nCommerce shares its mission with at least 71 Federal Departments, \nAgencies, and offices. Indeed, that overlap is what we should be trying \nto eliminate in Washington, and the purpose of the bill which I have \nintroduced is designed to eliminate that duplication, to save the \ntaxpayers' money while retaining those parts of the Department of \nCommerce that make the most sense.\n  Indeed, as former Secretary of Commerce Bob Mosbacher has indicated, \n``The Department is nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in \neverything that you don't know what to do with.''\n  Indeed, that is what the Department of Commerce has become. It was \nnot intended to be that type of a department, but that is what we find. \nWe find trade functions in the same place as the weather bureau. And \nwhile many Americans, I think with justification, complain about what \nis going on here in Washington, as I tell people what the various \nfunctions of the Department of Commerce are, they scratch their heads \nin total puzzlement: Why would you be putting all these different, \ndiverse, unconnected, and unrelated activities under one roof? The \nanswer is that the Department has survived simply as the catchall of \nthings that do not seem to fit in other places.\n\n  The legislation which I will be bringing back to the floor finds the \nright place for the different functions of Commerce that ought to be \nretained and eliminates those that do not.\n  Let me just speak about one special area because I know it is one of \nconcern to people on both sides of the aisle, and that is the trade \nresponsibilities of the Department of Commerce or more broadly the \ntrade activities of the Federal Government.\n  Much has been made of the role that Commerce plays with regard to \ntrade. Indeed, it does play a role. But interestingly enough, only 8 \npercent of the total Federal spending on trade promotion in this \ncountry is actually directed by the Department of Commerce. The other \n92 percent falls under other Agencies of Government and other \nDepartments. So, in fact, as with many other things in the Commerce \nDepartment, Commerce is not in charge of trade. It just plays one of a \nnumber of governmental roles with respect to trade.\n  Our legislation is designed to try to bring these trade functions \ntogether under one roof where there can be coherence and strategy, \npeople pulling together to try to help our country be more effective. \nIndeed, I would say to those who would say we have to have the \nDepartment of Commerce because of the great trade deficit, if that is \nthe case, why are we running these huge deficits?\n  One of the goals I have is to bring these trade functions together \nmore coherently so that we can try to address trade issues not just in \nthe competition sense, not just in the ways the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's office does, but also in the strategic sense as I \nthink can better be done where the trade functions are comprised in one \narea of Government rather than across many, many different areas.\n  Finally, the people in my State think all the bureaucracies in \nWashington are too large, but they especially find it puzzling as to \nwhy we have to have the Commerce Department with 37,000 employees \nmaking an average salary of, I think it is about $42,000 a year. That \nis more than the average salary of the families in Michigan; 37,000 \npeople represents more people than live in cities such as Traverse \nCity, MI; Port Huron, MI, Jackson--almost all the cities of Michigan. \nIt is a huge bureaucracy that is a very well-paid bureaucracy, and \nwhile many of the people there are doing good jobs, some of these \nfunctions are no longer needed and many would run more efficiently and \neffectively and help produce in fact more positive results if they were \nbetter assigned than is currently the case. \n\n[[Page S 16906]]\n\n  Later we will get to these issues in more detail, and I look forward \nto that debate at a future point.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to \ndismantling of the Commerce Department as part of the debt limit.\n  First of all, as a matter of process, the debt limit should be kept \nclean, and strictly limited to its purpose--to provide the Federal \nGovernment legal authority for a specified period so that it can meet \nits debt obligations. We should not be considering Commerce \ndismantlement as part of the debt limit. Nor should it be part of some \n``catch-all'' bill like the continuing resolution or reconciliation \nbill.\n  In taking this action, I believe that the republican majority is \nengaging in a high-stakes poker game where the fate of our economy and \nthe Federal Government's ability to pay its debts is being wagered in \nan effort to win the prize of shutting down the Commerce Department. \nThis is precisely the type of political brinkmanship that leaves the \nAmerican people with such a sour taste about Congress and about \ngovernment. It is completely and utterly irresponsible to use the \nthreat of a Federal default to force the shuttering of a Cabinet \nDepartment. This proposal represents a total perversion of the \nlegislative process.\n  I also object to it on substantive grounds as well.\n  We live in a economically inter-dependent world--a world in which \ntrade and technology--the two primary missions of the Commerce \nDepartment--are playing an increasingly important role. I am a strong \nsupporter of the current Commerce Department for those reasons. We need \na strong advocate for U.S. business at the Cabinet table, and I believe \nthat Secretary Brown has been very effective in playing that role. \nDuring the 2 days of hearings before the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, he was praised by both Republicans and Democrats alike for his \nperformance. The Majority even notes in the Committee report that \nSecretary Brown ``has received high marks for his active promotion of \nAmerican exports.'' Under his leadership, the Commerce Department has \nbeen transformed from a bureaucratic backwater into an export promotion \ndynamo. For example, the Wall Street Journal reported just over a month \nago how he and the Department made an all-out effort to secure a $1.4 \nbillion contract in Brazil for a consortium of U.S. companies. If you \nask the executives in those companies, they will tell you that they \nwould have lost that contract to foreign competition if it had not been \nfor the personal efforts of the Secretary.\n  The Department spends about $250 million a year in trade promotion, \nwhich in 1994 yielded $20 billion in exports for U.S. companies. That \namount supports about 300,000 U.S. jobs. The Department's International \nTrade Administration has done an outstanding job back in our home \nStates--it has a network of 73 U.S. offices and 130 offices overseas--\nand ITA estimates that for every taxpayer dollar it spends on export \npromotion, $10.40 is returned to the Federal treasury through tax \nrevenues generated by exports. Also, the Department has very capably \nassisted the USTR in our Uruguay Round and NAFTA trade negotiations on \nissues ranging from auto parts, to textiles, to international copywrite \nlaw. Not surprisingly, these efforts, combined with a sound Clinton \nadministration economic policy, have helped lead to a 17 percent \nincrease in U.S. exports for the first 5 months of this year.\n  We are entering the information age, spurred by rapid changes in \ninformation technology. It is an exciting time. The private sector is \nleading the way into the information economy. And that is as it should \nbe. But are our colleagues aware that the Federal Government \nestablished the first computer information network? It was developed by \nthe Department of Defense and was called the ARPAnet. The ARPAnet was \nthe predecessor to today's Internet. In so many other areas of \ntechnological advancements that we readily take for granted, the \nFederal Government took the initial role of funding the R for \ntechnologies that later ended up powering our economy and improving our \nway of life. The Commerce Department is playing a key part in this \ndevelopment. NIST's Advanced Technology Program has been funding R in \na cooperative partnership with the private sector to develop the \ntechnologies of tomorrow. The National Telecommunications Information \nAdministration has been providing grants to develop the National \nInformation Infrastructure, the so-called Information Superhighway. And \nthe Technology Administration is coordinating interagency R on \nbuilding the automobile of the 21st century. But this measure rejects \nthe approach in investing in the technologies of the future by cutting \nand terminating a number of technology programs. These cuts and \nterminations reflect 19th century ``know nothing'' or Luddite thinking, \nnot 21st century wisdom and foresight. They disregard the fact that our \nmost competitive industries, from computers to agriculture to \naerospace, were developed with Federal R assistance. And they fail to \nrecognize that Japan, our foremost competitor, is planning to double \nits non-defense R spending by 2000 and will surpass the U.S. in total \nnondefense R spending by 1997. I can imagine that Tokyo's leaders are \nraising toasts of sake as they watch us on CSPAN today.\n\n  This is not to say that the Commerce Department could not be \nreorganized so as to strengthen its mission and improve its \neffectiveness. I have sponsored legislation in the past to reorganize \nthe trade and technology functions of the Federal Government, to bring \nthem together under one roof in a Department of Industry and \nTechnology. However, I did not propose destruction of the Department \nand the scattering of its component parts.\n  I am an advocate of looking at the need to restructure and reorganize \nthe entire Federal Government, and to do it carefully and in an \nintegrated way, not just on a piecemeal basis. That is why I favor the \nestablishment of a bi-partisan commission to design the government of \nthe 21st Century. The basic structure of the Federal Government really \nhas not changed much over the last 25 years. And I do not believe its \ncurrent structure reflects the changes that our economy and society has \nundergone recently. So it needs to be examined and a bi-partisan, \nexpert commission is really the best approach to take. Two years ago \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs supported the creation of such a \ncommission to submit legislative recommendations on restructuring the \nFederal Government that Congress would have to consider on a ``fast-\ntrack'' basis. I still support this approach, and I offered an \namendment in markup to establish such a commission as a substitute to \nthe Commerce dismantling bill. Unfortunately, that amendment lost on a \nparty-line vote.\n  If this legislation were about reorganizing the Commerce Department, \nor about implementing a rational downsizing plan for the Department, \nthen I believe that we could work together with the majority to produce \ngood legislation. But this legislation is not about reorganizing the \nFederal Government's trade and technology programs to better coordinate \nthem and improve their efficiency. Nor is this legislation about a \nrational downsizing of the Department. That is underway now. \nThe Department is reducing its 35,000 person workforce in line with the \nPresident's plan to reduce the overall Federal workforce by 272,000 \npositions by 1999. Under the leadership of the National Performance \nReview, the Department is examining the privatization of the National \nTechnical Information Service, parts of NOAA, as well as other \nprograms. It is phasing out the Travel and Tourism Administration and \nmodernizing Census collection.\n\n  What this debate is about is the elimination of a Cabinet Department \nfor purely symbolic and political reasons. It is about tacking a hide \non the wall, putting a trophy on the mantle.\n  Further, this proposal applies a blowtorch to $1 billion worth of \nFederal agencies and programs in the Department, melts them down and \nterminates them. Agencies that survive will be hobbled by a large cut.\n\n[[Page S 16907]]\n\n  Most of that cut will fall on NOAA, at $1.9 billion the largest \nremaining agency and the home of the National Weather Service. And we \nare considering these draconian cuts at a time when the Florida coast \ncontinues to be battered by hurricanes. That is just plain foolish. The \nHouse Bill also ends many of the Great Lakes programs important to the \nmidwest. Further, both House and Senate Appropriations Committees have \nrejected such deep cuts in NOAA's budget. Those Committees also \npreserved the Economic Development Administration, recognizing its \nvalue to economically-distressed regions of the Nation, especially \nthose that have been negatively impacted by base closing. Yet this \nmeasure terminates the EDA.\n  This measure transfers some of the Federal Government's trade \nagencies into the U.S. Trade Administration, consolidations that I have \nsupported in past legislation. But unfortunately these agencies are \nbeing transferred into an administration and not a Cabinet Department. \nWhen our companies are fighting for large government contracts overseas \nand are competing against a Team Japan, or a Team Germany, I think it \nmakes a difference when the respective foreign government gets the call \nfrom a U.S. Cabinet Secretary, as opposed to a lower ranking \nadministrator.\n  In the Committee report on the Senate bill, the majority discusses \nhow downsizing and streamlining has been taking place in the private \nsector. I believe that an examination of the restructuring undertaken \nby the private sector is relevant in this context. Independent studies \nof private sector restructuring efforts show that their success is a \nhit or miss proposition and depends on several factors. A 1993 survey \nof over 500 U.S. companies by the Wyatt Company revealed that only 60 \npercent of the companies actually were able to reduce costs in their \nrestructuring efforts. Both the Wyatt Survey and a similar one \nconducted by the American Management Association concluded that \nsuccessful restructuring efforts must be planned carefully with a clear \nvision of their goals and objectives, and that proper attention be \ngiven to maintaining employee morale and productivity. Otherwise, the \ncosts of reorganization may outweigh its benefits.\n  I believe that government reorganization is a complicated task that \ncannot be successfully accomplished without serious study and \ndeliberation, especially if it is going to achieve the dual goal of \nimproving government efficiency and reducing costs. That means Commerce \nreorganization should follow, not precede the recommendations of a \nbipartisan commission. We should not be reorganizing the Commerce \nDepartment first and then forming a government commission to \nrestructure the rest of government, as has been proposed. That does not \nmake any sense. My hope is that the majority will abandon its narrow \nfocus on the Commerce Department and focus instead on the more \nimportant issue of reorganizing and streamlining the Federal Government \nto improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Until then, I will \ncontinue to oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio, the former \nchairman of our Governmental Affairs. He lead the sober consideration \nof this particular issue in the committee, and we are all indebted to \nhim.\n  Specifically, the Department of Commerce gives the businessman \nCabinet-level status and voice at the Cabinet table.\n  What the Senator wants to do with this academic percentage argument \nand otherwise is say, yes, Labor should have a voice. No one has \nintimated we should do away with the Department of Labor. The farmer, \nhe should have it. No one has intimated we should do away with the \nDepartment of Agriculture. But the businessman in the global \ncompetition should lose his voice and leadership.\n  I do not know where the Senator got the 8 percent, but I can tell you \n90 percent of the job creation has come through Secretary Ronald Brown. \nHe has traveled tirelessly the world around getting different deals for \nthe manufacturing jobs here in the United States of America. I wish I \njust had more time to go down the list--the International Trade \nAdministration, which was recommended and instituted by President \nNixon; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is nothing \nmore than the extension of the Environmental Science Services \nAdministration.\n  I believe the Chair is indicating that my time is up. But I have been \nhandling the financing part for 25 years on the Appropriations \nCommittee. We have cut back because the pressure has been brought in \nState, Justice, Commerce for a great endeavor in law enforcement, and \nas a consequence we have been cutting back on State's budget and \nparticularly in the Department of Commerce.\n  Do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let us voice vote.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, could I inquire how much time we have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 2 minutes, 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield as much time as he may need to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. First, Madam President, I congratulate my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan for the leadership he has demonstrated in \nhelping develop this most important piece of legislation to dismantle \nthe Commerce Department. This basic legislation is important, and I \nthink it is also workable.\n  During my tenure as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I \nheld hearings to determine the best way to prepare the Federal \nGovernment for the 21st century, the best way to streamline and make it \nmore efficient and effective. Our hearings came to two certain \nconclusions: First, that the Federal Government is obsolete in its \npresent form, a 50-year old relic that is structurally incapable of \nmeeting the needs of the 21st century. And it is so rife with \nduplication and fragmentation that, according to the GAO, some six \nagencies perform each major mission.\n\n  Our second conclusion was that the Commerce Department is a microcosm \nof almost everything that is wrong with the Federal Government as a \nwhole. There is no better place to begin eliminating wasteful \nbureaucracy and restructuring core missions to meet the needs of the \n21st century.\n  This proposal contains restructuring actions with broad bipartisan \nsupport. The bill transfers the Census Bureau and the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis to the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, as a first step toward creating a single Government \nstatistics agency. It unifies critical trade functions within a single \nCabinet-level agency, the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative.\n  For almost two decades now, I have personally advocated the \nelimination of Commerce and the creation of a trade agency. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has passed similar bills to achieve this \nsame purpose in previous sessions of Congress.\n  This provision also creates a bipartisan ``Citizens Commission on the \n21st Century Government'' to move from Commerce to the bigger picture \nof what the government of the future should look like and how it should \nperform. The Commission is directed to reexamine missions and functions \nof the Federal Government in the 21st Century, and fundamentally \nrestructure the bureaucracy to improve productivity and service \ndelivery. The Commission will produce its first report by July 31, \n1996, for fast-track consideration before the end of the 104th \nCongress. This time frame is ambitious, but it must be kept to meet the \npublic's mandate for change.\n  The issues to be addressed by the Commission will require bold, \nbipartisan action. The Governmental Affairs Committee has reported \nrestructuring commission bills in previous sessions of Congress. The \nlast one, sponsored by Senators Glenn, Lieberman and myself, passed the \nCommittee nearly unanimously in 1993.\n  It preserve important funding authorities of the Economic Development \nAdministration and the Minority Business Development Agency by \ntransferring them to other agencies which perform very similar \nfunctions.\n\n[[Page S 16908]]\n\n  This will allow us to meet our budget targets while eliminating \nwasteful bureaucracy. It will also allow the best programs from EDA and \nMBDA the chance to compete for continued life within new agencies.\n  What we have before us this evening is an excellent starting point \nfor the comprehensive, government-wide restructuring the public \ndemands. Today's government is characterized by huge, hierarchical \nbureaucracies. As we heard from GAO, during our hearings, there is \nwholesale duplication, overlap, and fragmentation in functions and \nspending.\n  In a nutshell, the taxpayers are paying for one agency to set a \npolicy or perform a function, another agency to contradict that agency, \nplus several other agencies who receive funding to perform some related \nrole. As a result, an extensive patchwork of coordinating committees \nhas been created to prevent the bureaucracy from grinding to a halt.\n  The Commerce Department has been described as a loosely knitted \n``holding company'' of agencies pursuing unrelated missions. Its \nmanagement systems and controls are on GAO's high risk list.\n  It directly serves only a small number of favored American firms and \nindustries. Many in the business community have serious doubts that it \nadds sufficient value to justify its continued existence. Almost all of \nthe experts agree: Commerce should be restructured to eliminate \nwholesale duplication and fragmentation and bring coherence to the \nmanagement of its important functions.\n  Let me be clear about one thing, with this provision we are not on a \nwarpath to arbitrarily terminate agencies. We are not out to collect \nscalps to mount in a trophy case.\n  Nor are we engaged in a superficial shell game which merely redraws \nboxes on an organization chart. Our objective is to reduce costs and \nimprove services throughout our government\n  Commerce has no single mission or function as an exclusive province. \nThe GAO found that it shares its four major functions with 70 other \nfederal organizations. We must change this organization structure, if \nwe are to give the taxpayers efficient and effective performance of the \nfunctions now being performed by Commerce.\n  Sadly, the Commerce Department is typical of the waste and \ninefficiency that pervades our government. That is why it makes an \nideal starting point in the government wide restructuring that is \nnecessary to prepare America for the next century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question occurs \non agreeing to amendment No. 3052.\n  The amendment (No. 3052) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3053\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a temporary increase in the public debt limit)\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3053.\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. TEMPORARY INCREASE IN PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT.\n\n       During the period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act and ending on the later of--\n       (1) December 12, 1995, or\n       (2) the 30th day after the date on which a budget \n     reconciliation bill is presented to the President for his \n     signature,\n\n     the public debt limit set forth in subsection (b) of section \n     3101 of title 31, United States Code, shall be temporarily \n     increased to $4,967,000,000,000, or, if greater, the amount \n     reasonably necessary to meet all current spending \n     requirements of the United States (and to ensure full \n     investment of amounts credited to trust funds or similar \n     accounts as required by law) through such period.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I ask that the measure be read in its \nentirety to define and illustrate its brevity and its purpose, which is \nto send to the President a clean extension of the debt ceiling.\n  There can be no question in my mind that we put in jeopardy the \ninterests of the United States if we restrict the ability of the \nTreasury to redeem its debts. One of the greatest assets we have is \nthat the U.S. Treasury bond is the firmest, most solid debt instrument \nin the world.\n  I have a letter from Alan Greenspan, our distinguished, revered \nChairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \nsaying, ``Our word is among our most valuable assets.'' It is essential \nthat we honor our obligations in order to make our securities the \nkeystone of world financial affairs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Chairman Greenspan's letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Federal Reserve System,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You have asked me about the effects of a \n     default on U.S. Treasury obligations should the Treasury run \n     out of cash as a consequence of the debt ceiling not being \n     raised in a timely manner.\n       As I stated before your Committee in September, I do not \n     think the issue of default should be on the table. Without \n     question, the federal government must take steps to assure \n     that its budget will be in balance by early the next century. \n     The vitality of our economy depends on accomplishing this \n     goal. If, for some unforeseen reason, the political process \n     fails and agreement is not reached, it would signal that the \n     United States is not capable of putting its house in order \n     and would have serious adverse consequences for financial \n     markets and economic growth.\n       Nonetheless, there are many avenues to an agreement, and \n     the full faith and credit of the United States need not be \n     part of the process. The United States has always honored its \n     obligations. Our word is among our most valuable assets. It \n     is an essential element in making our securities the keystone \n     of world financial markets. A failure to make timely payment \n     of interest and principal on our obligations for the first \n     time would put a cloud over securities that would dissipate \n     for many years. Investors would be wondering when we would \n     next allow our credit worthiness to become embroiled in \n     controversy. Breaking our word would have serious long-term \n     consequences. There are much better ways to bring our budget \n     credibly into balance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan Greenspan,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I also ask unanimous consent that an excerpt from a \nreport by the Congressional Budget Office stating that the debt ceiling \nis an extraneous issue as regards Federal spending in a day when \nentitlement spending comprises two-thirds of our outlays, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               The Economic and Budget Outlook: An Update\n\n                 (From the Congressional Budget Office)\n\n       * * * At one time, the debt ceiling may have been an \n     effective control on the budget when most spending was \n     subject to annual appropriations. But discretionary spending \n     is now a much lower proportion of total spending, amounting \n     to only 36 percent in 1995. Under the recently adopted budget \n     resolution, discretionary outlays will continue to fall \n     further to 27.5 percent by 2002. The rise in mandatory \n     spending and growth of the trust fund surplus has turned the \n     statutory limit on federal debt into an anachronism. Through \n     its regular budget process, the Congress already has ample \n     opportunity to vote on overall revenues, outlays, and \n     deficits. Voting separately on the debt is ineffective as a \n     means of controlling deficits because the decisions that \n     necessitate borrowing are made elsewhere. By the time the \n     debt ceiling comes up for a vote, it is too late to balk at \n     paying the government's bills without incurring drastic \n     consequences.\n       As a result, because raising the debt ceiling is considered \n     to be ``must pass'' legislation, the debt limit is frequently \n     used as a device to force action to obtain some other \n     legislative goal. For example, in 1990, the Congress voted \n     seven times on the debt limit between August 9 and November 5 \n     as the budget summit meetings progressed and the Congress \n     considered the resulting budget resolution and reconciliation \n     bill.\n\n\n        what are the consequences of not raising the debt limit?\n\n       Financial markets find the debt limit a periodic source of \n     anxiety. The government has never defaulted on its principal \n     and interest payments, nor has it failed to honor its other \n     checks. However, even a temporary default--that is, a few \n     days' delay in the government's ability to meet its \n     obligations--\n\n[[Page S 16909]]\n     could have serious repercussions in the financial markets. Those \n     repercussions include a permanent increase in federal \n     borrowing costs relative to yields on other securities as \n     investors realize that Treasury instruments are not immune to \n     default.\n       Failing to raise the debt ceiling would not bring the \n     government to a screeching halt the way that not passing \n     appropriation bills would. Employees would not be sent home, \n     and checks would continue to be issued. If the Treasury was \n     low on cash, however, there could be delays in honoring \n     checks and disruptions in the normal flow of government \n     services. Carried to its ultimate conclusion, defaulting on \n     payments would have much graver economic consequences--such \n     as loss of confidence in government and a higher risk premium \n     on Treasury borrowing--than failing to enact discretionary \n     appropriations by the start of a fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Finally, Madam President, I call attention to one of \nthe many extraordinary measures we are adding to this bill--the repeal \nof habeas corpus. The great writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, \n``produce the body before the court,'' is the foundation of our legal \nsystem of liberties.\n  I have commented that if I had to live in a country which had habeas \ncorpus but not free elections, or vice versa. I would take habeas \ncorpus every time. It is article I, section 9, of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, \nunless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may \nrequire it.\n  Nothing in our circumstances requires the suspension of habeas \ncorpus, which is in effect what this provision would do. To require a \nFederal court to defer to a State court judgment unless the State \ncourt's decision is ``unreasonably wrong'' will effectively preclude \nFederal review in these matters. This it seems to me is appalling. It \nwould transform our State courts--not the Federal courts established \nunder article III of the Constitution--into the ultimate arbiters of \nconstitutionality. Very few Senators share that view. We had a vote in \nthis regard last summer. There were eight of us who voted against the \nComprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995, which contained an \nalmost identical habeas corpus provision.\n  In addition to the other extraneous matter that has been added to \nthis legislation, we also have before us a provision to radically alter \nthe ancient writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. One would have hoped \nit would be self-evident that the U.S. Congress should not pass a major \nrevision to the Great Writ of Liberty in the form of an amendment to a \nbill to temporarily extend the Government's borrowing authority.\n  Five months ago, I was one of eight Senators to vote against the \nComprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995. I voted against that \nbill because it contained the same habeas corpus provision that is \nattached to the legislation before us. For unrelated reasons, the \nterrorism bill was never enacted, and so we are again presented with \nthis undesirable proposal.\n  Fortunately, one does not need to be a lawyer to understand why this \nhabeas corpus provision is such an awful idea. Article I, section 9 of \nthe U.S. Constitution provides that:\n\n       The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  For well over a century--since the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867--we have \nhonored the right of State prisoners to challenge in Federal District \nCourt the constitutionality of their imprisonment. The habeas corpus \namendment before us departs from that tradition by requiring our \nFederal courts to defer to State court judgments unless a State court's \napplication of Federal law is unreasonable. Under this new standard of \nreview, our Federal courts will be powerless to correct State court \ndecisions--even if a State court decision is wrong. The new standard \nwill require deference by the Federal courts unless a State court's \ndecision is unreasonably wrong. This is a standard that will \neffectively preclude Federal review.\n  Senators need not take my word for this, for I have it on the best \navailable legal advice. Last summer, prior to the Senate's \nconsideration of the terrorism legislation, I received a letter from \nthe Emergency Committee to Save Habeas Corpus, a group of 100 of the \nNation's most distinguished attorneys, scholars, and civic leaders. The \nco-chairs of the Emergency Committee are four former Attorneys General \nof the United States, two Republicans and two Democrats. They are \nBenjamin Civiletti, Edward H. Levi, Nicholas DeB. Katzenbach, and \nElliott L. Richardson. They strongly oppose this proposal and have \nlabeled it ``extreme.''\n  This proposal will in many cases transform the State courts--not the \nFederal courts established under Article III of the U.S. Constitution--\ninto the arbiters of Federal constitutionality. It will eviscerate the \nwrit of habeas corpus, and that is something this Senator in good \nconscience must again oppose. I need hardly add that the debt limit \nlegislation is obviously the wrong vehicle for such a proposal.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nEmergency Committee to Save Habeas Corpus, and the list of its members, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Emergency Committee\n\n\n                                        To Save Habeas Corpus,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan:\n       We understand that the Senate may act next week on the \n     habeas corpus provisions in Senator Dole's terrorism \n     legislation. Among these provisions is a requirement that \n     federal courts must defer to state courts incorrectly \n     applying federal constitutional law, unless it can be said \n     that the state ruling was ``unreasonably'' incorrect. This is \n     a variation of past proposals to strip the federal courts of \n     the power to enforce the Constitution when the state court's \n     interpretation of it, though clearly wrong, had been issued \n     after a ``full and fair'' hearing.\n       The Emergency Committee was formed in 1991 to fight this \n     extreme proposal. Our membership consists of both supporters \n     and opponents of the death penalty, Republicans and \n     Democrats, united in the belief that the federal habeas \n     corpus process can be dramatically streamlined without \n     jeopardizing its constitutional core. At a time when \n     proposals to curtail civil liberties in the name of national \n     security are being widely viewed with suspicion, we believe \n     it is vital to ensure that habeas corpus--the means by which \n     all civil liberties are enforced--is not substantively \n     diminished.\n       The habeas corpus reform bill President Clinton proposed in \n     1993, drafted in close cooperation with the nation's district \n     attorneys and state attorneys general, appropriately \n     recognizes this point. It would codify the long-standing \n     principle of independent federal review of constitutional \n     questions, and specifically reject the ``full and fair'' \n     deference standard.\n       Independent federal review of state court judgments has \n     existed since the founding of the Republic, whether through \n     writ of error or writ of habeas corpus. It has a proud \n     history of guarding against injustices born of racial \n     prejudice and intolerance, of saving the innocent from \n     imprisonment or execution, and in the process, ensuring the \n     rights of all law-abiding citizens. Independent federal \n     review was endorsed by the committee chaired by Justice \n     Powell on which all subsequent reform proposals have been \n     based, and the Supreme Court itself specifically considered \n     but declined to require deference to the states, in Wright v. \n     West in 1992.\n       We must emphasize that this issue of deference to state \n     rulings has absolutely no bearing on the swift processing of \n     terrorism offenses in the federal system. For federal \n     inmates, the pending habeas reform legislation proposes \n     dramatic procedural reforms but appropriately avoids any \n     curtailment of the federal courts' power to decide federal \n     constitutional issues. This same framework of reform will \n     produce equally dramatic results in state cases. Cutting back \n     the enforcement of constitutional liberties for people \n     unlawfully held in state custody is neither necessary to \n     habeas reform nor relevant to terrorism.\n       We are confident that the worthwhile goal of streamlining \n     the review of criminal cases can be accomplished without \n     diminishing constitutional liberties. Please support the \n     continuation of independent federal review of federal \n     constitutional claims through habeas corpus.\n           Sincerely,\n     Benjamin Civiletti.\n     Edward H. Levi.\n     Nicholas DeB. Katzenbach.\n     Elliot L. Richardson.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the tally \non the vote to repeal habeas corpus indicating the eight Senators who \nvoted ``no'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Democrats: Feingold, Moseley-Braun, Moynihan, Pell, Simon, \n     and Wellstone.\n       Republicans: Hatfield and Packwood.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to \nour gallant and distinguished sometime \n\n[[Page S 16910]]\nchairman of the Committee on Government Operations, the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my distinguished colleague from New York. I will \nbe brief because I know the hour is late, but I cannot help but comment \non one part of this debt limit bill that came over to us, and that is \non regulatory reform.\n  I am somewhat dismayed, Madam President, to report that the debt \nlimit bill passed by the House contains an amendment by Representative \nWalker that, if enacted, could end up removing the protections for the \nAmerican people on health and safety and the environment that have been \npainstakingly built up over decades. The amendment takes up 13 pages in \nthe Congressional Record, new proposals, many of them, sprung on us, \nbeing introduced over there, just came out in the Record today, not \ntime enough to really analyze these things, and purports to be a \nregulatory reform bill. It is not regulatory reform. It is regulatory \ndismantlement. It is regulatory elimination.\n  The amendment does contain all the buzzwords associated with reg \nreform like cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, judicial review and \nthe like. But this amendment is not meant to reform anything. It is, in \nfact, an extremist approach to regulation. And I do not use that word \nlightly. It is an extremist approach to regulation that would overturn \nexisting environmental law and tie up in endless litigation the \nagencies whose missions are to ensure we have clean air, clean water, \nand safe food.\n  Madam President, the documented deaths of innocent children and \nadults from E. coli poisoning that would have been prevented if there \nhad been tough standards and regulation provides stark and deadly \nevidence of what the stakes are with respect to this issue.\n  I am in favor of regulatory reform, fought for it, fought for it in \ncommittee, fought for it here on the floor, as all my colleagues will \nremember. And I worked hard in committee and on the floor to get a \nreasonable regulatory reform bill before the Senate. We passed a \nreasonable bill out of the Governmental Affairs Committee with more \nRepublican support than Democrats because it was a unanimous vote of \nour 8-7 committee. And on the floor we almost passed it. It got 48 \nvotes.\n  But this amendment, the Walker amendment, is not reform. The Walker \namendment borrows from the original House bill that many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle could not stomach either. \nThey did not like it either. It also borrows from the Dole-Johnston \nbill that we debated for weeks, which is a seriously flawed bill \nitself. The Walker amendment contains, for instance, a supermandate \nthat the proponents of the Dole-Johnston bill said they were opposed \nto. That provision would override existing health, safety, and \nenvironmental laws by prohibiting the issuance of health-based \nstandards that may not meet harsh cost tests.\n  The Walker amendment would make it difficult to issue health-hazard \nassessments and would create new defenses for lawyers to use to prevent \nenforcement over Federal health and safety laws.\n  The Walker amendment would repeal the difficult Delaney clause \nwithout providing any appropriate substitute.\n  Finally, the Walker amendment contains judicial review provisions \nthat are applicable to the detailed procedural steps of the amendment \nthat amount to a lawyer's dream. The lawyers' full-employment bill is \nwhat this Walker bill should be called. And anyone concerned about tort \nreform would find the judicial review procedures in this amendment \ntruly a nightmare.\n  Madam President, when the Dole-Johnston bill was being debated both \nprivately and on the floor, it was frequently claimed that if the \nSenate passed a moderate reg reform bill, the House would go along with \nit in conference. Well, the Walker amendment certainly gives lie to \nthat idea. It gives us a measure of the validity of that claim. The \nHouse in this case took a not-so-moderate Senate bill which is \nseriously flawed in many respects and could not resist turning it into \nan extremist proposition. I use that word not ill-advisedly. It is an \nextremist proposition that is riddled with special interest provisions \nharmful to the American people.\n  Madam President, I repeat, I want reg reform, but not at the expense \nof the health and the safety of the American people or of the \nenvironment. There is no justification for the Walker amendment, \nparticularly on this particular debt limit bill that is so important. \nIf it survives in the Senate, the President will just have to veto the \ndebt limit bill on this ground alone, and we will fight that battle \nanother day.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I believe we have used up our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 43 seconds.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We will withhold and reserve that for purposes of \nrebuttal.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I have just had an opportunity to \nlook at the amendment of the good Senator from New York. This is \nessentially to make moot the entire exercise. He makes moot the \nshifting of the date to December 12. The language reads, ``or * * * the \n30th day after the date on which a budget reconciliation bill is \npresented to the President for his signature * * * ''\n  And then he makes moot the cap in the extension of the debt limit \nwhich reads, ``$4,967,000,000,000,'' but then it says--here is another \none of these famous words--``or, if greater, the amount reasonably \nnecessary to meet all current spending requirements of the United \nStates.''\n  You have, in effect, made moot the concept that we would extend it to \nthe 12th, and then we would set a fixed amount and then it would snap \nback. This is totally unacceptable.\n  It then proceeds to say bring in the Social Security trust fund, as \nif this making moot what we are trying to achieve here is necessary to \nprotect the fund.\n  The extension or the resolution that has come to us from the House \nspecifically sets a date, specifically sets an amount and specifically \nsays that you may not use the trust funds to deal with this issue--\nprotecting.\n  This is just a totally unacceptable amendment, and I encourage all of \nour colleagues to oppose it. I think given the circumstances that we \nare faced with that the date should be specific and the amount should \nbe specific and we should not be moving to this clever technique of \nadding ``or,'' ``except.''\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the cooperation between the \nSenate and the House and the President over this issue. The President \nhas alluded to the fact we have not cooperated. I just have to say the \nPresident has not been here long enough to cooperate. He is getting \nready to leave the country right in the midst of this to go to Japan, \nand then he comes back and turns around and goes to Europe.\n  This administration is going to have to come to the table and deal \nwith the Congress on balancing the budget, on welfare reform, on the \ntax policy and on the Medicare questions. I just think he has failed to \ndo so, and I do not believe the amendment of the Senator from New York \nhelps to bring that real collaboration together.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I yield such time as I may use.\n  The temporary debt increase we propose this evening will allow the \nTreasury to make benefit and interest payments for another month. It \nwill allow the Government to meet its obligations and that, I believe, \nis the right decision. For that reason, I must oppose the Moynihan \namendment.\n  I oppose the Moynihan amendment because, first, it would strike \nprovisions that would protect the Social Security, Medicare and other \ntrust funds. Not only would it strike those provisions, but it provides \ndiscretion, as my distinguished colleague from Georgia pointed out, it \nprovides discretion to the administration to exceed even the temporary \ndebt limit for amounts reasonably necessary to meet current spending \nrequirements. \n\n[[Page S 16911]]\n\n  To sum it up, there is really no dollar limitation under this \ntemporary increase as provided under the Moynihan amendment, nor is it \nclear as to what period of time it would cover.\n  Madam President, beyond this, I want to emphasize our legislation \nwould protect the integrity of trust funds, like Social Security and \nMedicare, by requiring the Treasury to automatically invest FICA \nreceipts.\n  Further, it would only allow the disinvestment of these trust funds \nfor benefits paid. In other words, the Treasury will not be allowed to \nuse these protected funds to discharge other financial obligations of \nthe Government. In the past, Treasury has allowed these trust funds to \nbe underinvested. This will no longer happen, and our legislation will \nensure that Social Security benefits are paid on time. This is \nimportant. The right decision is to keep the obligations Government has \nmade. The right decision is to protect the integrity of these trust \nfunds.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury will not be allowed to sell or redeem \nsecurities, obligations or other assets of the trust funds and special \naccounts during this period. The only exception will be when it is \nnecessary to pay benefits and administrative expenses of the cash \nbenefit programs, and these programs not only include Social Security, \nbut Federal Civil Service and military requirements, as well as \nunemployment insurance.\n  Again, these are important contracts Government has made with the \npeople. As an added measure of security for those who depend on these \nprograms, this legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \nreport to Congress and the GAO 3 days before making a sale or \nredemption of securities from the trust funds or special accounts \nduring this period of debt limitation, and it would also require the \nGAO to monitor compliance with these provisions and report its \nfindings.\n  Madam President, we must pass this legislation. We must increase the \ndebt limit on a temporary basis. This is the only way to let the \nFederal Government continue its smooth operation. It is the only way we \ncan follow through with our historic work of getting a balanced budget \nwithout disrupting financial markets.\n  I point out, there are other provisions included in this legislation, \nbut time does not permit me to speak about each of these at this time. \nHowever, because of the importance of these provisions, especially \nthose that restrict the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to \nunderinvest or to disinvest trust funds, I oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from New York.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I inquire, after this time has expired, is there \nany time left on other amendments, or are we finished for the evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time will have expired but for the 1 \nminute 40 seconds left for the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wanted to talk about the comments of \nthe Secretary of the Treasury today. They bear on what we are talking \nabout here. The Secretary is doing his dead level best to make the \nmarkets respond adversely to what is going on in Washington, even \nthough there is no reason for them to do that. I was glad to read in \nthe papers this morning that many of the bond people--those who sell \nbonds, and the like, in New York City are up to him; they decided that \nis what he is trying to do--to scare the market into reacting \nadversely, so that, in turn, he will scare the Republicans so they will \nnot react so tough on the President in terms of insisting that we get a \nbalanced budget and some negotiations out of this President. That is \nwhat this is all about.\n  So now they are going to veto this bill, and the principal reason \nmust be that we are saying you cannot disinvest funds in the Social \nSecurity trust fund and in the civil service retirement fund and use \nthat to pay our debt as it comes due. If it is not that, why else were \nthey going to veto the bill that the Finance Committee reported out? \nThe only thing on it of substance was that.\n  So it seems to me that in saying, ``We are going to veto it because \nit ties our hands,'' they are acknowledging there is no problem with \ndefault. If we do not tie his hands, he has all those other moneys to \nuse to pay the debt, so there will not be a default. So who is he \nkidding? He is not kidding us. We want them to get serious about \nnegotiating for a balanced budget. That is what he ought to be doing. \nInstead of planning to close the Government, he ought to be planning \nwith us how to keep it open.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, to conclude the discussion on this \nsuccinct and, I hope persuasive proposal, I plead with my fellow \nSenators to understand what my friend of so many years, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, has just said. The President will veto this \nmeasure. He has to do it for the reasons set forth by the Senator from \nOhio about regulatory reform, the repeal of habeas corpus, a horrendous \nmeasure, and so on. He will veto it, and then we will have a crisis and \nput in jeopardy the credit worthiness of the United States. The great \nasset that Alexander Hamilton secured for us in the end of the 18th \ncentury will have been squandered for no purpose whatever.\n  Can we not simply get on with our reconciliation bill, work out these \nissues there instead of on the debt ceiling? Or do we need a crisis in \nmid-week? Surely, Madam President, we do not.\n  I plead with the Senate, do not create a crisis. Let us govern as the \norderly body that we have been for two centuries. It is far beyond the \nrealm of the imagination what we might do.\n  I understand the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I move to table the Moynihan amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 3053.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the pending bill \nto increase the debt limit.\n\n[[Page S 16912]]\n\n  I think it is fair to say this session of Congress has been as \npartisan as any in history. We have had a lot of disagreement, and \nthere have been a lot of games. Fortunately, in this Chamber, there \nhave been occasional demonstrations of rational bipartisan consensus. I \nam pleased when that happens, because it means we are taking care of \nthe peoples' business.\n  Well, if there is one issue that should be above partisanship, it the \nFederal debt limit. This issue goes to the very core of our economy.\n  A couple years ago, I was a housewife and a mother living on the west \ncoast, so I have a pretty good sense of how most people view issues \nlike this. Most of my friends and family know this is a pretty \ncomplicated issue. They may not know how to completely explain it, but \nthey do know it makes our economy work. And because of that, we have a \nresponsibility as elected officials to deal with this issue clearly and \ndecisively.\n  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I have listened to the \ncomplex issues that affect the ups and downs of our economy. The debt \nlimit issue affects the Treasury Department's ability to buy and sell \nbonds, to pay interest, and to manage the economy in the most positive \ndirection possible.\n  Nearly everything that happens on Wall Street, or in the real estate \nmarkets, is pegged to Government bond rates. Nearly every low-risk \ninvestment portfolio, every adjustable rate mortgage, every savings \nplan in the country is tied to Government bonds and interest paid on \nthose bonds.\n  Every single person in this country--from the average working family, \nto the top-flight stock broker--has an interest in seeing this issue \nheld above partisan bickering, and protected from the kind of political \nshenanigans we have seen all year long.\n  We should be considering a straight, clean debt limit extension to \nkeep the economy going, and to allow the Treasury Department to meet \nits obligations to bond holders. But unfortunately, we are not.\n  We are considering a Christmas tree, Mr. President. This bill is \nloaded down with provisions that have nothing to do with Treasury \nbonds. Everyone on this floor is aware of it.\n  This bill has reg reform provisions, something the Senate has \ndefeated three times before. It eliminates the Commerce Department, \nwhen export promotion is more important than ever. And it changes the \nlaw to loosen up death penalty guidelines.\n  What does any of this have to do with Treasury bonds and the economy? \nNothing.\n  This bill is simply another in a long line designed solely to score \npartisan political points. It makes a mockery of commonsense; at best, \nit amounts to political extortion, wit an increasingly healthy economy \nheld hostage. At worst, it is reckless endangerment of the national \neconomy and the household budget.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to put aside hot-button political \nagendas, and start focusing on solving the Nation's problems.\n  This Senate passed a bill to balance the budget almost 3 weeks ago. \nAnd nothing has happened since then. We have had no debate. No \nconferees have been appointed. No progress has been made. Why? So the \nmajority can back us up against the debt limit, and play an elaborate \npolitical game with the President, with the economy at stake.\n  What happens if we pass this bill? With so much unnecessary baggage \nattached, this bill will be vetoed. And rightly so, in my opinion. And \nunless we can get our act together by Monday, the Government will \ndefault on its loans for the first time in history.\n  At the end of the day, the people will feel worse about Congress than \never, and with good reason. All because partisan politicians could not \nget together to solve problems, but had to play politics instead. It's \na pretty sad scenario.\n  I have heard my colleagues say the Senate is the saucer that cools \nthe cup. Well, we need a little cooling off. We need a clean debt limit \nextension, and then we need to return to the budget debate. In short, \nwe need to take care of the peoples' business. But with this bill, we \nare not even close. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to address an issue of \ntremendous importance to our Nation. It does not involve the arcane \ndetails of the Federal budget, but does touch directly the lives of \nevery one of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, it is the issue of personal safety. It is the issue of \nreducing crime on our streets by imposing swift and appropriately \nstrong punishment on those who prey on our streets.\n  Last June, I spoke to my colleagues in support of the habeas corpus \nprovisions included in the anti-terrorism bill. I think it is \nunfortunate that I must say again, five months later, that habeas \ncorpus reform is still needed, now, just as much as it was then, in the \nimmediate aftermath of the tragic and reprehensible bombing in Oklahoma \nCity.\n  Habeas corpus reform is still needed because our streets are still \nunsafe and those who commit the most heinous crimes still abuse the \ncourt system to prevent their sentences from being carried out.\n  It is needed because swift punishment--including the death penalty \nwhere appropriate--is critical in our efforts to ensure the personal \nsafety of all of our citizens.\n  It is needed because the deterrent effect of the death penalty is \nweakened when it cannot be imposed swiftly after a verdict has been \nreached in a fair trial.\n  Mr. President, habeas corpus reform is needed because since the death \npenalty was reinstated in California in 1978, more prisoners on death \nrow have died of natural causes than have been executed.\n  Let no one doubt the magnitude of this problem. For example, in \nCalifornia there are currently 428 convicted criminals on death row--\nthat is 18 more than when I last spoke to the Senate on the immediate \nneed for habeas reform.\n  This problem is not unique to California, however. According to the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, during the year ending June \n30, 1995, there were 14,637 prisoner petitions for habeas corpus review \nin U.S. district courts alone. 156 of these cases were death penalty \ncases.\n  On June 7, on the same day the Senate overwhelmingly passed habeas \ncorpus reform as part of the anti-terrorism bill, the longest serving \nmember of California's death row population, Andrew E. Robertson, \nmarked the 17th anniversary of his incarceration. Five months later, he \nstill avoids punishment. Mr. President, that is unconscionable.\n  Another case deserves scrutiny as well. Seventeen years ago, Keith \nDaniel Williams was convicted of fatally shooting Miguel and Salvadore \nVargas and Lourdes Meza in Merced, CA while stealing a $1,500 check \nthat he and his friends had used to buy a car from Miguel Vargas.\n  Williams was found guilty of planning the killings and, after \nshooting the two men, raping Lourdes Meza in the back of the car before \nshooting her and leaving her naked body in a field.\n  This vicious killer told a psychiatrist that after one of his \naccomplices broke down when Williams had ordered him to shoot the \nwoman, Williams intended to kill him, too, but decided not to when, and \nI quote, ``the dude started sniveling and crying.''\n  Keith Daniel Williams admitted killing these three innocent people, \nbut 18 years of courtroom maneuverings have kept this cold-blooded \nmurderer from receiving the punishment he deserves for his horrible \ncrimes.\n  Just last spring, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Williams \nwas not denied a fair trial by the actions of his lawyer--who failed to \nhire a psychiatrist, obtain Williams' medical records or present any \nfavorable evidence at the penalty phase.\n  Following this decision, his lawyer said he would seek a rehearing \nbefore an 11-judge panel and, if that failed to stop the execution, \nappeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. According to California's Deputy \nAttorney General, those appeals could take a year to 18 months, even if \nno new hearings are granted.\n  A newspaper article on this case published 7-months ago was titled, \n``Triple Killer a Step Closer to Execution''. Mr. President, that final \nstep may take another year. That is just plain wrong.\n  Sadly, there are many other cases similar to the one I just described \nand their crimes are among the most horrific imaginable. I will not \nburden my \n\n[[Page S 16913]]\ncolleagues with the gruesome details, but I do believe the Senate, and \nthe American people, need to know of the abuse of the legal system by \nindividuals convicted in courts of law for the most vile and violent \ncrimes and I think it necessary to mention one more example.\n  Bernard Hamilton murdered a woman--the mother of two boys, one of \nwhom was only 3 weeks old--in San Diego in May 1979. His victim \ndisappeared on her way to class. She was last seen in her van in the \nparking lot of the school she attended.\n  Her body was later found with the head and hands removed; they have \nnever been recovered. The body was clothed only in bra, underpants, and \nsocks.\n  Bernard Hamilton was arrested in Oklahoma in possession of his \nvictim's van and had been using her credit cards. He was convicted of \nfirst degree murder for this brutal crime.\n  After his first State habeas petition was denied he went to Federal \ncourt and last year two judges on the 9th Circuit ordered the sentence \nvacated on a claim that was rejected by six Justices on the California \nSupreme Court and one dissenting judge on the 9th Circuit.\n  This cold-blooded killer is now in the midst of a new penalty trial--\nmore than 16 years after the murder.\n  To add insult to injury, Hamilton represented himself at his penalty \nretrial and blamed the victim's husband, who never recovered \nemotionally from the death of his wife before his own death last year.\n  For the victims of the kind of violent crimes I've just described, \njustice will not fully have been done until those responsible have been \ntried, convicted and the death penalty imposed and swiftly carried out.\n  I am very pleased to say that the habeas provision included in the \nbill currently under consideration by the Senate is designed to do just \nthat. The habeas corpus provision is identical to those included in the \nanti-terrorism bill passed the Senate by a vote of 91 to 8 last June, \nand one I believe which strikes an appropriate balance between the need \nto assure due process to those convicted of both capital and non-\ncapital crimes and the need of any rational judicial system to bring \ncases to closure.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, that is particularly important not only the \nintegrity of our judicial system, but for the victims of capital cases.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, this bill provides habeas \npetitioners with ``one bite at the apple.'' It assures that no one \nconvicted of a capital crime will be barred from seeking habeas relief \nin Federal court, and appropriately limits second and subsequent habeas \nappeals to narrow and suitable circumstances.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, the bill requires States which provide \nfor counsel that habeas appeals must be filed within 6 months of when a \nState prisoner's conviction becomes final, or in States where standard \nfor the adequacy of counsel are not adopted, such appeals must be filed \nwithin 1 year.\n  Third, Mr. President, time limits are also imposed upon courts. The \nbill requires that Federal courts must act promptly on habeas appeals \nand establishes a mechanism by which courts of appeals will screen \nhabeas petitions before they are permitted to go to a Federal District \nCourt for resolution.\n  Finally, Mr. President, unlike the crime bill proposals that I and \nthe Nation's law enforcement officials opposed two years ago, this bill \ndoes not dictate to the States precisely what counsel competency \nstandards are adopted. Rather, it properly provides states with an \nincentive to formulate their own plans by making expedited time tables \nI have just described available for states to do so.\n  Mr. President, the time for habeas corpus reform is long overdue. Too \nmany of our streets are dangerous, too many of our citizens are scared, \ntoo many of our courts are clogged with endless, meritless prisoner \nappeals. I urge my colleagues to support the habeas corpus reform \nprovisions in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The question is on the \nengrossment of the amendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], and \nthe Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Labor, HHS and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, I wanted to take a minute to \nupdate the Senate on the status of the Labor, HHS and Education \nappropriations bill, H.R. 2127 as it relates to the continuing \nresolution and the implications of the Senate's inaction on the bill \nfor programs of the Departments of Labor, HHS and Education.\n  As Senators know, the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1996 is still on the calendar. Efforts to bring it up \nin the Senate have been met with a filibuster due to the ``striker \nreplacement'' provision. I opposed that provision being added to the \nbill in committee, because of the view that controversial legislative \nriders do not belong on an appropriation bill, but should be considered \nthrough the authorization process. In the case of the Labor, HHS and \nEducation Appropriations bill, the legislative riders included by the \nHouse have stalled action on this important bill in the Senate, and \nindefinitely postponed funding for education, health, job training, and \nsocial service programs in this fiscal year.\n  While the continuing resolution will ensure that some funding will be \navailable for these programs, it is only on a short-term basis and at a \nminimal level. For example, a central difference between the House \npassed and the committee reported bills involves funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. LIHEAP provides funds \nto states to help low income households meet their fuel bills during \nthe winter months when costs soar due to cold weather. A high \npercentage of the program's beneficiaries are elderly and disabled \npeople who need help in paying their fuel bills.\n  Mr. President, it is already getting very cold in many parts of the \nNation, with a major Canadian cold front making early November feel \nlike winter in much of the midwest and northeast. Under the terms of \nthe continuing resolution, less than $200 million will have been made \navailable to the States. This is far short of the $600 million \nrequested by the States to get through the first quarter of the fiscal \nyear. This comports with the historic average of 60 percent of the \nannual appropriation for LIHEAP being allocated to the States in the \nfirst quarter.\n  Many States have begun receiving requests for assistance, and under \nnormal circumstances would begin distributing funds to participants at \nthis time. However, because of the present stalemate in the Senate on \nthe Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations bill, States have no idea \nhow to plan for this winter's program, and hundreds of thousands of low \nincome families are left wondering how they will be able to meet their \nwinter heating bills. Low income households, as well as Governors \nand local officials across the country are waiting to learn whether, \nand how much, funding will be appropriated for this winter's LIHEAP \nprogram.\n\n  Funding for education programs also are held hostage to the stalemate \non H.R. 2127. Education program funding levels recommended by the House \nfall almost $3.6 billion below the fiscal year 1995. The Senate bill, \nas reported by the Appropriations Committee on September 15, includes \nfunding for education programs which is $1.6 billion above the House \npassed levels. Under the terms of the CR, however, the lower levels of \nthe House bill become the funding levels for the upcoming period of the \nCR. Absent action on the Senate bill, and a conference with the House, \nfuture funding levels for these education programs likely will continue \nat House passed levels.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the terms of the CR maintain funding for \nmedical research supported by the National Institutes of Health at the \n1995 level of $11.3 billion. But, there is clear consensus between the \nCongress and the President that medical research is a priority, \ndeserving of increased funding in fiscal year 1996. Despite a 7-percent \nreduction in the subcommittee's allocation, the President's budget, the \nHouse passed bill, and the Senate reported bill, nonetheless \nrecommended increases for NIH of no less than $300 million. Without \nSenate action on the Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill, \nmedical research funding will be frozen indefinitely, thereby stalling \nnew discoveries for understanding the causes and cures of diseases.\n  I will support this continuing resolution because it provides \ncritical short-term funding for Federal activities. But I also want to \nmake clear, it is time for the Senate to act on the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education appropriations bill. Let us stop the \nfilibuster, agree to bring up the bill, debate it, and let the Senate \nwork its will. The critical programs in this bill deserve the attention \nand debate of the Senate. The American people are waiting for the \nCongress to complete its work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16914-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16914-S16916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EPA ENFORCEMENT NEEDS SCRUTINY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have supported policies to protect our \ncountry's environment, and I have backed the Environmental Protection \nAgency's efforts to enforce environmental laws. It is not a coincidence \nthat we now use twice as much energy in America than we did 20 years \nago and yet we have both cleaner air and cleaner water. That results \nfrom the determination by our country and the Congress to place \nlimitations on those who are dumping pollutants into our rivers, \nstreams, and lakes, and into our air.\n  This is a success story. We have made real progress in our fight to \nclean up our environment.\n  I am proud of my support for those efforts. But, Mr. President, I \nhave come to the floor of the Senate today to discuss a couple of cases \ndealing with environmental protection that concern me. There are \noccasions, I am certain, where enforcement actions taken by those who \nare given police powers to make sure our environment is protected, \nbecome unfair, unreasonable and, in some cases, downright punitive.\n  Two such legal actions have been filed against two North Dakota \nmanufacturing companies and I want to discuss them today. Because they \ninvolve an important matter of public policy, I want to offer my \nopinions on them.\n  Both of these examples are enforcement proceedings involving the EPA \nand now also entail filings in court. As a result, I am unable to \npursue the matter further directly with the Agency. I regret that \nbecause I would like the opportunity to sit down in person and review \nin detail, with officials at EPA and with the officials in the two \nNorth Dakota companies, EPA's justifications for taking the kind of \naction it has taken against these firms.\n  So my alternative is to discuss these cases on the floor of the \nSenate and use information that is on public file in the two court \nactions and information that \n\n[[Page S 16915]]\nhas been provided me by the companies as well as information that was \nprovided to my staff from the Environmental Protection Agency prior to \nthe final enforcement action being taken. I will use that information \ntoday to discuss the actions that have been taken against these two \ncompanies and ask whether this represents fair enforcement of our \nenvironmental protection regulations and whether it represents the \nroutine kind of enforcement actions that the EPA has been taking \nagainst other companies around our country.\n  If these cases are judged by the EPA to be fair, and if these are \nrepresentative of the enforcement actions taken around the country \nagainst other companies, then I understand much, much better the anger \nthat exists in America against the bureaucracy because I think the \naction taken in these two cases is just plain unfair and punitive \nbeyond reason.\n  Mr. President, let me describe the two EPA cases in North Dakota as I \nunderstand them. Once again, this description comes from the \ninformation filed in court actions against the two companies which is \npublic information, information provided my office by the two \ncompanies, as well as information offered by the EPA during the process \nof its development of an enforcement action against the companies.\n  First, there is the Sheyenne Tooling and Manufacturing Co. which \nproduces farm implements and steel parts in Cooperstown, ND. The second \ncase is the Melroe Division of the Clark Equipment Co. which produces \nthe Bobcat skidsteer utility loader in Gwinner, ND.\n  Both cases are remarkably similar. They began several years ago--in \n1992 for Melroe and 1993 for Sheyenne Tooling--when EPA sent the two \nfirms compliance orders instructing them to sample and test their \nwastewater. That testing has been a Clean Water Act requirement since \n1986. When the sampling turns up excess contaminants, the wastewater \nmust be pretreated before it is discharged into a sewer system. \nUnfortunately, neither firm was aware of those aspects of the law. \nThere was an assumption that the treatment requirements were being \nhandled by the city sewage plants into which the wastewater flowed.\n  The companies had received no communications from EPA on the \nrequirements and no problems in that area had been pointed out during \nregular visits from the State Health Department. Though neither company \nwas aware of the requirements, when they learned of them, they took \nsteps to comply immediately.\n  Upon the notification by EPA that they had the responsibility to \nsample and test their wastewater, both companies immediately tested. \nWhen that testing determined that there were occasions when the \nwastewater did not meet EPA standards, both firms then acted quickly to \ntake steps so that their discharges were brought within permissible \nlimits. In every way, they worked cooperatively, promptly, and \nsuccessfully to fix the problem.\n  Months later, however, EPA stunned them by demanding the payment of \nhuge penalties--$1.9 million in the case of Melroe and $320,000 from \nSheyenne Tooling. EPA said the fines were punishment for the companies' \nfailure to sample, test, and treat their wastewater ever since the \nimplementation deadline of 1986.\n  When the firms resisted fines of that amount, the Justice Department \nfiled suit in Federal court to demand the money. Expensive and \nexhausting court actions now face both firms. The court action against \nSheyenne Tooling only began in April, but in the action against Melroe, \nwhich has been going on for 18 months, the Justice Department has \nalready secured 1,000 pages of depositions and required Melroe to turn \nover more than 5,000 documents.\n  In the case of Sheyenne Tooling, a small firm of just 60 employees, \nits problem was with an excess of zinc in its wastewater. Its zinc \nelectroplating department is an insignificant part of the company, \naccounting for only 2 or 3 percent of its sales and an even smaller \nshare of its profits.\n  As a result, it offered to eliminate its plating operation. However, \nEPA discouraged that and suggested ways to bring the operation into \ncompliance. EPA did not tell the firm that for every day it continued \nout of compliance it could be fined $25,000. If Sheyenne Tooling had \nknown that, it would have ended its zinc plating immediately. Instead, \nhowever, it spent $12,000 for equipment and took care of the problem.\n  Despite its forthright and good faith work to correct the situation, \nSheyenne Tooling has ended up faced with this $320,000 penalty. The \nfine is of such a size that it will devastate the company, a major blow \nto the employees and to Cooperstown, a rural community of only 1,300 \npeople.\n  In the situation at Melroe, the firm is said to have discharged \nexcess amounts of lead, copper and, most significantly, zinc. A key \npart of the problem as it worked toward a solution was that it had \ntrouble even identifying the source of the zinc. It suspected a paint, \nbut the paint's ingredients label did not list that metal and, when the \npaint manufacturer was quizzed about the matter, it initially denied \nzinc was in the paint. Eventually, it was determined that the paint did \nindeed contain the metal and the supplier was required by Melroe to \nreformulate it to eliminate the zinc.\n  Melroe had several wastewater streams that flowed into the city sewer \nsystem. In one of the two key streams, the only problems were from the \nquestionable paint. The other stream discharged just 17 gallons of \nwastewater a day. An important point to note is that manufacturers are \nallowed to combine their wastestreams before allowing them to flow into \nthe public sewers.\n  If Melroe had done that, the combined volume of water would have been \nsuch that the metal contaminants would have been diluted enough so that \nMelroe would not have had any excessive discharges of pollutants except \nfor the sporadic and unusual zinc paint phenomenon.\n  In addition to switching, as I have already noted, to a paint that \nwas definitely zinc free, Melroe also installed almost $200,000 worth \nof equipment which completely eliminated all its problems. Despite \nthat, EPA sought the $1.9 million fine. Melroe has offered to pay a \n$200,000 penalty, but EPA remains determined to hold out for a \nsubstantially larger amount.\n  EPA believes that these punishing penalties are necessary to deter \npotential offenders and to recoup any possible savings the firms might \nhave accrued by not performing the sampling and pretreatment in earlier \nyears. It argues, in addition, that there was a risk of environmental \nharm, even though no harmful impacts have been documented.\n  In similar cases I am aware of in North Dakota, EPA sought penalties \nof $60,000, $40,000, $25,000 and $15,000 and generally settled for \nless. I am at a loss to understand why it now wants penalties of $1.9 \nmillion and $320,000 in the two cases I am discussing.\n  Mr. President, those are the facts about these two cases as I know \nthem. As I indicated, because of the enforcement action initiated by \nthe EPA and now the court action by the Justice Department to collect \ncivil penalties against these two companies, I am constrained from \nintervention with EPA.\n  But I want the record to show that I think this represents terrible \njudgment, inappropriate sanctions, and an unreasonable punishment for \nthese companies.\n  I have no sympathy for a rogue company that, knowing the rules, \nviolates those rules and pollutes the air and the water. I have no \nsympathy for companies that refuse to cooperate with the EPA. I have no \nsympathy with repeat offenders whose record demonstrates a disregard \nfor our environment. They should be punished.\n  But I have no fondness for a Government agency that goes to companies \nthat have an excellent record and that willingly cooperate in every \nrespect and who demonstrate a desire to do the right thing and then say \nto them: ``You're guilty of an oversight and you are going to pay \ndearly for it.'' That kind of heavy-handed, bureaucratic misjudgment is \nwhat is causing a relentless anger in the American people that is \ndirected at their Federal Government.\n  I have spent most of my 15 years in Congress taking on the big \neconomic interests. I have fought to shut down the S junk bond \nscandal, opposed the corporate raiders on Wall Street, fought the drug \ncompanies for pricing \n\n[[Page S 16916]]\nabuses, taken on foreign corporations for tax avoidance, and opposed \ntax subsidies for oil companies. So I find myself in an unaccustomed \nrole today bringing to the floor a case of two corporations, one large \nand one small, who I think have been wronged by the EPA.\n  Originally, when I reviewed the complaint of these two companies, \nboth of which have an excellent reputation, both of which the North \nDakota Health Department considers cooperative and responsible firms, I \nconcluded that they were treated unfairly.\n  But because my hands are tied in an enforcement matter such as this, \nthere has not been much I could do beyond simply commiserating with \nthem and telling them that I thought they were treated unfairly. But, \nif we legislators who created the EPA, and who wrote these \nenvironmental protection laws, are unwilling to stand up and ask the \npolicy questions that we should be asking in circumstances like this, \nthen we deserve all the ill will that is directed toward the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Unless we are prepared to point out the cases of bureaucratic excess \nand unfair consequences and then try to do something about them, we \nshould not be surprised by a citizenry that is justifiably angry.\n  I hope those in the Federal Government who read these examples will \nunderstand that they hold the power to enforce the laws of this country \nin an appropriate, fair, even-handed manner, but they also have the \nresponsibility to rein in those who would use that power in ways that \nare not fair and not even-handed. That is what we expect and that is \nwhat the American people demand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16914-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ACDA DIRECTOR HOLUM GOES TRICK-OR-TREATING\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suppose that I am supposed to be \ndiscouraged, or at least surprised, that the Director of the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency overspoke himself--again--on Halloween \nby calling me an isolationist and by falsely asserting that I am \nholding both the Chemical Weapons Convention and this country's \nnational security hostage. Perhaps he was playing trick-or-treat, and \nif he had stopped by our house, Dot Helms would have placed several \npieces of candy in his bag.\n  Seriously Mr. President, I had assumed that Mr. Holum had better \ncontrol of himself than that--but I suppose he is so concerned about \nlosing his place on the Federal bureaucratic totem pole that he is \nsuffering a case of nervous jitters.\n  His holding hostage outburst on Halloween is ludicrous on its fact. \nThe Chemical Weapons Convention was first submitted as a treaty in the \n103d Congress, and Congress refused to ratify it at that time because a \nnumber of questions on issues such as verification and cost had gone \nunanswered. They are still unanswered, and any reasonable prudent \nAmerican is likely to agree that the convention's approval must wait \nuntil the Senate can be certain what it will cost and the degree of \nrisk in premature approval of it.\n  Mr. President, I also find very sad Director Holum's strange \nassertion that the effort to consolidate ACDA's functions within the \nDepartment of State is what he called an isolationist attack on arms \ncontrol. That one, as the saying goes, is off the wall--and Mr. Holum \nknows it.\n  The first suggestion about abolishing ACDA was proposed by the \nClinton administration in 1993; the State Department even drafted a \ncomprehensive plan to absorb ACDA personnel and funds. Unfortunately, \nthat proposal by Secretary of State Christopher was debated and \ndefeated--not on its merits, but by the same kind of bureaucratic \nobstructionism that has impeded S. 908, the Foreign Relations \nRevitalization Act of 1995, every step of the way.\n  So it comes as little surprise, Mr. President, that the plan to \nreorganize arms control has stirred up a hornet's nest. In testimony \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee, one of ACDA's previous \nDirectors, Dr. Fred Ikle, endorsed the plan to abolish ACDA, but warned \nthat:\n\n       Any effort to trim, or to abolish, a bureaucratic entity \n     hurts the pride and prestige of the affected officials, \n     jeopardize job security, and mobilizes throngs of \n     contractors, captive professional organizations, and other \n     beneficiaries of the threatened agency.\n\n  When you get right down to it, at the heart of all these \nprotestations regarding the plan to eliminate ACDA are, in fact, no \nmore than a host of self-serving, bureaucratic interests. While nearly \nevery aspect of government is being downsized and streamlined, ACDA's \nbudget request for fiscal year 1996 was increased by 44 percent over \nthe 1995 fiscal year budget. Director Holum's ACDA crowd, you see, \nproposes to spend fare more of the taxpayer's money and to hire more \npeople. They even tried to commandeer one of the Department of \nDefense's radar systems in Alaska.\n  Mr. President, when faced with possible elimination, there's nothing \nthe ACDA crowd will not do or say. It is incredible that anyone will \ntry to argue, with a straight face, that arms control will suffer if \nACDA is eliminated. Nonsense, there are today more than 3,100 arms \ncontrol experts working in more than 25 offices scattered throughout \nthe Federal Government. ACDA employs about 250 of the 3,100, only 8 \npercent of the total number of arms control experts in the Federal \nGovernment. Even the Commerce Department has more people assigned to \nnonproliferation and arms control. Simply put, arms control is big \nbusiness, and ACDA is small potatoes, and almost irrelevant. That \nprompted ACDA Director Holum's outburst on Halloween.\n  The truth of the matter is that the State Department and the National \nSecurity Council are responsible for arms control policy coordination \nand negotiation, not ACDA. One of ACDA's inspectors general put it best \na few years ago, stating that:\n\n       Once arms control became important presidential business . \n     . . Secretaries of State and Defense and national security \n     advisers became the dominant figures in arms control.\n\n  Implementation and verification of arms control are conducted by the \nDepartment of Defense and the intelligence community. Since 1989 it has \nbeen the on-site inspection agency, not ACDA, that had performed on-\nthe-ground verification for all major arms control agreements. Of all \nthe personnel involved in START inspections so far, fewer than 1 \npercent were supplies by ACDA. In short, abolishing ACDA will not hurt \nthe conduct of this Nation's arms control one iota. It is not an \nobvious anachronism--and it is time to bid farewell.\n  By incorporating ACDA's handful of experts in a new, more efficient \nState Department, Congress can give arms control a comprehensive \npurview. After all the effectiveness and desirability of arms control \ndepend upon its consideration in the broader foreign policy context. \nJust as importantly, doing this will save U.S. citizens at least $250 \nmillion over the next 10 years. Consolidation makes good business sense \nand will reduce waste, duplication, and silly bureaucratic turf \nbattles.\n  Finally, any plan that has been endorsed by five former Secretaries \nof State, from Henry Kissinger to James Baker, can hardly be labeled \nisolationist. Director Holum should dispense with is schoolboy name-\ncalling. Let the issue of consolidation be debated on its merits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16916-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16916-S16918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    WREATH LAYING CEREMONY AT THE NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS \n                                MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in recent months, there have been some \ndisturbing accounts from throughout the Nation about police officers \nconducting themselves in an inappropriate manner while performing their \nduties. Regrettably, some members of the media, and people who wish to \nmalign the efforts of law enforcement officers, choose to believe that \nthe actions of a handful of rogue individuals are representative of the \nentire law enforcement community. That is simply not the case.\n  As we all know, the job that lawmen and women do is not easy, as a \nmatter of fact, it is one that is extremely dangerous, as well as \nphysically and mentally demanding. It is a job that requires ordinary \nmen and women to commit extraordinary acts on an almost daily basis. In \nmany cases, the situations to which they are dispatched result in \ninjury to officers, and in increasingly frequent cases, the lives of \nofficers are lost.\n  While law enforcement officers across America labor tirelessly and \n\n[[Page S 16917]]\n  largely without thanks, the National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial, \nappropriately located at Judiciary Square, guarantees that those who \nfall in the line of duty will never be forgotten. Each year, the names \nof the men and women killed while doing their jobs--keeping us safe--\nare added to the Memorial. This past October 19th, the names of the 157 \nofficers who were killed last year were placed on the grey Canadian \nMarble walls which form this solemn Memorial.\n  As I have done many times in years past, I attended the wreathlaying \nceremony held at the Memorial when the names of those killed over the \npast year were added to the rolls of their fallen comrades. During that \nceremony, the Chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial, Craig Floyd, and Sharon Felton, the widow of a police officer \nand a trustee of Concerns of Police Survivors [COPS], made some remarks \nthat I thought were particularly poignant, in that they paid tribute to \nthose police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice, while also \nreminding everyone in the audience of the challenges and difficulties \nfacing an officer in this day and age. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of Mr. Floyd's and Ms. Felton's remarks be placed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks, so that my colleagues will have the opportunity \nto read and consider what they said that day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is sometimes easy to forget just what \nan enormous task we ask of those who work in law enforcement. It is \nvery easy, from the comfort of an office or a living room, to second \nguess the decision a police officer was required to make in a split \nsecond. I hope that people will take a moment to read and think about \nwhat Mr. Floyd and Ms. Felton said last month, and to reflect on the \nfact that being a police officer is not only difficult, it can be \ndeadly.\n\n               Exhibit 1.--Wreathlaying Ceremony Remarks\n\n                  (By Craig W. Floyd, NLEOMF Chairman)\n\n       Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining \n     us as we commemorate the fourth anniversary of the National \n     Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n       My name is Craig Floyd and I am the chairman of the \n     National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. On behalf of \n     our board of directors, I want to welcome all of you here \n     today.\n       Nearly a year ago, three law enforcement officers were \n     murdered at D.C. Police headquarters, just one block from \n     this hallowed ground. It was a horrible tragedy that will not \n     soon be forgotten.\n       Shortly afterwards, Tony Daniels, who was then in charge of \n     the FBI's Washington metropolitan field office, reflected on \n     the shooting in a poignant commentary that was printed in the \n     Washington Post. He said:\n       ``There is no easy way to absorb the events of November 22, \n     1994. For all of us, I'm sure, the most difficult part of \n     dealing with this tragedy is trying to find a reason for its \n     occurrence--trying to make some sense out of a senseless act \n     . . . We will never know what causes people to do the things \n     they do; we are only left with the aftermath. Yet it is an \n     inescapable fact that the law enforcement community lives in \n     the shadow of death.''\n       Sadly, those words echoed over and over again this past \n     year as we buried one police officer after another. Already \n     this year, we know of 127 law enforcement officers across \n     this country who have been killed in the line of duty. That \n     represents an 11 percent increase over last year's figure for \n     the same period.\n       On average, one police officer is killed somewhere in \n     America every 52 hours. One out of every nine officers is \n     assaulted and one out of every 25 officers is injured in the \n     line of duty. Across this country, there are nearly 700,000 \n     law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line \n     daily for the protection and safety of others. This memorial \n     is a richly deserved tribute to that extraordinary level of \n     police service and sacrifice.\n       When this memorial was dedicated 4 years ago, these marble \n     walls that embrace us here today contained the names of \n     12,561 fallen police officers. Since that time, we have added \n     nearly 1,300 more.\n       We could have simply allowed those fallen heroes to be \n     buried and then forgotten. But, this nation valued the \n     service and sacrifice of those officers far too much to cast \n     their memories to the winds of time.\n       We knew that, if given the chance, the voices of those \n     fallen heroes need not be silenced by death. . . . Their \n     deeds might even have more meaning. . . . And their lives \n     would become the example for others. This monument gives them \n     that chance to be heard, to be understood, to inspire.\n       Each time a single corrupt or bigoted police officer is \n     exposed, come here and listen to the condemnation expressed \n     by thousands of fallen police heroes.\n       Each time the resolve of our law enforcement officers is \n     challenged, come here and understand just how much our \n     officers are willing to sacrifice for the well being of \n     others.\n       Each time the constant criticism and second-guessing causes \n     our police officers to think twice about the profession they \n     have chosen, come here and be reminded that you are following \n     in the footsteps of some of the bravest and finest \n     individuals ever to walk the face of this earth.\n\n\n                         Intro to wreathlaying\n\n       In a moment, a wreath will be placed here at the memorial \n     to commemorate the fourth anniversary of this monument, and \n     to honor the nearly 14,000 law enforcement officers who have \n     died in the line of duty.\n       But, before we do that I want to take a moment to recognize \n     all of the police survivors who have honored us with their \n     presence here today. While we cannot undo their loss, we can \n     remind them that they have not been forgotten. Their welfare \n     is important to us all.\n       At this time, I would like to ask all of the survivors of a \n     fallen officer here today to please rise and be recognized.\n       Since the last time we met to commemorate the anniversary \n     of this monument one year ago, nine law enforcement officers \n     have been killed in the Washington, D.C. Area. That matches \n     the highest number of local police fatalities ever recorded \n     in a 12-month period.\n       Three of them died in a single incident. Last November 22, \n     Metropolitan Police Sergeant Henry Joseph Daly, and FBI \n     Special Agents Martha Dixon Martinez and Michael John Miller \n     were savagely murdered in an unprovoked ambush at D.C. Police \n     headquarters.\n       On February 7, off-duty D.C. Police officer James McGee \n     attempted to stop a robbery in progress. In a few terror-\n     filled seconds, Officer McGee was accidentally shot and \n     killed in a tragic case of mistaken identity.\n       On April 26, Prince George's County Police Corporal John \n     Novabilski was assassinated by a crazed killer while sitting \n     in his marked patrol car.\n       Less than 2 months later, that same killer murdered FBI \n     Special Agent William Christian. Agent Christian, who was \n     also gunned down while sitting in his car, was on a stakeout \n     to arrest the man who killed him.\n       On August 22, Loudoun County Deputy Sheriff Charles Barton \n     was killed in an aircraft accident on the way to pick up a \n     wanted felon. He was the first officer to be killed while on \n     duty in the history of the Loudoun County Sheriff's \n     Department.\n       And, of course, the two latest fatalities occurred this \n     month. D.C. Police Officer Scott Lewis was gunned down on \n     October 6 in an unprovoked attack while aiding a burglary \n     victim.\n       Maryland state trooper Edward A. Plank was shot and killed \n     just three days ago after stopping a motorist for a traffic \n     violation.\n       We have asked the immediate family members of these fallen \n     officers, along with their agency escorts, to assist us with \n     the presentation of the wreath. They have graciously accepted \n     our invitation and will serve as representatives of all \n     police survivors and law enforcers across the Nation.\n       Leading our procession, we are very pleased to have the \n     Assistant Attorney General of the United States Andrew Fois, \n     who will be joined by members of the U.S. Park Police honor \n     guard.\n\n\n                            Closing remarks\n\n       I would like to close today's ceremony with a poem. It was \n     written by a 16-year-old girl named Megan Hogan. Her father \n     was a Minnesota police officer who was shot and killed six \n     years ago. Megan's poem offers comfort to all of us here \n     today:\n\n       My father is now at rest\n       For a safer place he remains\n       A world of goodness and beauty\n       A world without worry or pain.\n       No fear will he encounter\n       For a better place he'll be\n       A place where the sick are healed\n       And a place where the blinded eyes can see.\n       My world has forever changed\n       My life is not the same\n       But close within my heart\n       His precious face remains.\n       I give him my tears\n       And my prayers I send above\n       I cherish all our memories\n       Filled with happiness and love.\n       He'll have someone to depend on\n       His helping hand is there to lend\n       For the Father shall be watching\n       And in heaven he'll have a friend.\n       The battle is faced head on\n       Many obstacles yet to overcome\n       But in the end, together\n       This battle will be won!\n       For the next six hours, a rotating police honor guard will \n     stand vigil here at the memorial as a special salute to \n     America's fallen officers. A reception will be held \n     immediately following today's ceremony at the memorial \n     visitors center at 605 E Street --two blocks to the right. \n     Everyone is invited to attend.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's ceremony. \n     Thank you all for coming. May God bless you and all of our \n     Nation's police officers.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Wreathlaying Ceremony, NLEOM, October 19, 1995--Speech by Sharon AJ \n           Felton, Widow/1989 Northern Seaboard Trustee, COPS\n\n       Friends, officers, fellow survivors, special guests--Good \n     afternoon. I am honored to \n\n[[Page S 16918]]\n     stand before you today and participate in this wreathlaying ceremony to \n     commemorate the fourth anniversary of the National Law \n     Enforcement Officer's Memorial.\n       I once had the honor of watching a young man's dream come \n     true as he graduated the police academy in Petersburg, VA, on \n     December 7, 1986. He had dreamed of being a police officer \n     since the age of five, and his academy graduation was one of \n     the happiest days of his life.\n       Just a few years later, I watch that same young man leave \n     the safety of his home to back up a fellow deputy with a \n     routine burglary call. Just a few minutes later, less than a \n     mile from his home, that young 23 year-old officer died in \n     the line of duty. His name was Thomas Felton, Jr., a Sussex \n     County Virginia deputy sheriff. And he was my husband.\n       Tom did not die as most cops expect to die. There was no \n     hail of gunfire--no dramatic rescue--not even a highspeed car \n     chase. There was only Tom, his patrol car, a freight train, \n     and a terrible twist of fate that brought them all to the \n     same place at 6:37 am on April 29, 1989. He died in an \n     accident. He died in the line of duty.\n       What became evident in the days to follow his death, was \n     just how many lives Tom had touched as hundreds of friends, \n     family, and fellow officers came to honor his life. \n     Reflecting on his life, they used words like Honesty, \n     Respect, Love, and Honor. And they called him a Hero--not \n     because of the way he died--but because of the way he lived. \n     And they were proud to have known him--as I was.\n       Today, we are here to honor other officers who have made \n     the same sacrifice in the line of duty--and we use words such \n     as Honesty, Respect, Love, and Honor. Yes, we are here \n     because each of these officers has given his or her life in \n     the line of duty, but I am here to tell you that there are \n     living words, describing the way they each lived, not the way \n     they each died.\n       Today, we live in a world where ``COP'' has become a bad \n     word--where law enforcement is unappreciated and where police \n     officers are chastised because of the actions or beliefs of a \n     few who disgrace the badge. I submit to you that these rogue \n     cops are not a true representation of America's law \n     enforcement officers. They are the exception, not the rule.\n       I ask you today to look at the names engraved in the panels \n     that make up this memorial. Look deep into the names that \n     line this Pathway of Remembrance. These men and women \n     exemplify the true attributes of America's law enforcement \n     officer--Honesty, Respect, Love, and Honor. These are the \n     best of the best--the noblest of the noble--and Yes--law \n     enforcement Is Still a Noble Profession!\n       We are here today to honor these men and women--who placed \n     themselves along the Thin Blue Line that separate us from \n     total chaos and lawlessness. We are here to mourn their \n     deaths, and in doing so, we celebrate their lives.\n       This memorial was built for those officers whose names are \n     engraved here. It is for those officers whose names are yet \n     been added, such as DC Metro Officer Scott Lewis and Lynn, \n     MASS Police Officer Gary Twyman who dies just last week. And \n     it is for Maryland State Trooper Edward Plank, Jr. who died \n     just two days ago.\n       It is for those officers who still walk that Thin Blue Line \n     each day in America. And it is for you, the survivors--the \n     families and friends who have also made the ultimate \n     sacrifice--you are the Names Beyond the Wall.\n       For some of you here today, your grief is very new. Maybe \n     your officer died last year, last month, last week. Just \n     being here may be a struggle for you and the pain may seem to \n     be too much to bear. For others who are further into your \n     grief, the sight of seeing your officer's name may again \n     reopen some of those old wounds as memories flood your minds. \n     Our reactions to this memorial are as different as our \n     losses, but we are still the same. We are survivors. Our \n     officers died and we are left to tell their stories.\n       This is our place--a place where we come to grieve, to cry, \n     to laugh, to heal, to grow. We bring flowers--we bring \n     letters--we make rubbings of those precious names so we can \n     take a piece of this memorial home with us. We come to \n     remember--and we use words such as Honesty, Respect, Love, \n     and Honor. And we call them Heroes--not because of manners in \n     which they each died, but because of the manners in which \n     they each lived. And we are each better for having known \n     them.\n       In closing, I would like to share a poem with you entitled \n     ``The Names Beyond the Wall.''\n\n                       The Names Beyond the Wall\n\n     All for God and Country, they walked the Thin Blue Line.\n     With honor and with valor they lost their fight with time.\n     We are their survivors--the names beyond the Wall\n     Our loved ones lost their lives, but we have lost it all.\n     We are mothers; we are fathers. Brothers, sisters, children, \n           too.\n     We are wives and we are husbands. We are partners wearing \n           blue.\n     A gunman killed his brother--A drunk driver killed his wife\n     A child will miss her Daddy for the rest of her life.\n     A father's little girl has died--a car crash in the rain.\n     A widow cries for days now gone--a collision with a train.\n     A mother lost her son--a daughter lost her dad.\n     Just another day in America when good has lost to bad.\n     Forever and a day was stolen from our grip\n     And now we must forward on a long and lonely trip.\n     With pride they wore their badge. With glory, gave their \n           lives.\n     Now names engraved upon this wall are all that's left behind.\n     Our pride was for their service our joy now turned to tears\n     the heartache that we suffer will last for many years.\n     We are their survivors--the names beyond the Wall\n     Our loved ones lost their lives, but we have lost it all.\n     We are mothers; we are fathers. Brothers, sisters, children, \n           too.\n     We are wives and we are husbands. We are partners wearing \n           blue.\n     All for God and Country, they walked the Thin Blue Line.\n     With honor and with valor they lost their fight with time.\n       Good bless you all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16916-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, for centuries, the Middle East has been \na region plagued with strife, a land where days of violence are often \nmore common than moments of peace, and a place where tragedy is almost \nroutine. This past weekend, when a young Jewish extremist assassinated \nthe Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, he committed an act that \nmanaged to shock a region and a world that long ago became almost \nnumbed to the seemingly eternal struggle between Jews and Arabs and the \ndeath and loss that animosity creates.\n  By any standard, Yitzhak Rabin served his nation admirably. He was a \npatriot and a warrior who fought against the Axis powers during World \nWar II, fought for the freedom of Israel, and fought against those who \nsought to destroy that nation in the years after its creation. He rose \nto high positions in the Israeli government, serving as Chief of Staff \nof the Army, Ambassador to the United States, Minister of Labor, \nMinister of Defense, and was in his second term as Prime Minister at \nthe time of his death. Those accomplishments alone would have been more \nthan sufficient to earn him the accolades of his fellow countrymen, but \nthe journey he led his nation on for peace was one which justifiably \nearned him the gratitude of the world.\n  It surely could not have been easy for a man who dedicated much of \nhis life to defending his homeland to sit down with the man who had \nspent much of his life vowing to overthrow Israel. Nor could it have \nbeen easy for Yasir Arafat to sit down with a man who represented the \ngovernment that the P.L.O. blamed for oppressing the Palestinian \npeople. Yet, these two old adversaries recognized that the time for \npeace in the Middle East had arrived, and that it was necessary for \nthem to set aside their differences and to forge an agreement that \nwould allow their two peoples to co-exist. It was a courageous decision \nby both men, and one for which they were strongly criticized, but as \nPrime Minister Rabin pointed out, you do not have to make peace with \nyour friends.\n  I suppose that it is not surprising that a man who was a soldier, \nwould die a violent death, but it is surprising that he would die at \nthe hands of one of his own citizens, and it is perversely ironic that \nhis death would come at a \n\n[[Page S 16919]]\npeace rally. While the death of the Prime Minister is nothing less than \na tragedy that people throughout the world deeply mourn, his passing is \nan event that must not stand as an obstacle to the peace process. \nYitzhak Rabin was a man who was willing to give his life so that the \nMiddle East would be a stable and peaceful land. It is a legacy that \nall would do well to try and honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16918-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16919-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16919-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 1994--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 92\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 701 of the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978 (Public Law 95-454; 5 U.S.C. 7104(e)), I have the pleasure of \ntransmitting to you the Sixteenth Annual Report of the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority for Fiscal Year 1994.\n  The report includes information on the cases heard and decisions \nrendered by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the General Counsel \nof the Authority, and the Federal Service Impasses Panel.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 and the \nAgricultural Act of 1949 to permit the harvesting of energy crops on \nconservation reserve land and conservation use acreage for the purpose \nof generating electric power and other energy products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 THE ENERGY CROP PRODUCTION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill which will \nprovide a broad range of natural resource and energy related benefits \nto our country. This bill provides support for the development of \nprocesses which utilize renewable resources for generation of \nelectricity and other energy products. It lessens our county's \ndependence on imported oil, supports development of new markets for \nfarmers producing energy crops utilized in this process, and provides \npositive environmental benefits to the soil, water, and air components \nof our Nation's natural resources. This bill provides the Secretary of \nAgriculture authority to permit the production and harvesting of energy \ncrops for the purpose of generating electricity and other energy \nproducts on land enrolled in the various acreage reduction programs as \nwell as specifically designated demonstration project areas containing \nland enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  The future of utilizing renewable resources such as energy crops as a \nfuel for producing electric power and other energy products is bright. \nHowever, as in any emerging technology, support is often needed to \ndevelop its full potential. The 1992 Energy Policy Act authorized a \nRenewable Energy Production Program in support of this concept. The \nbill I am introducing today complements this effort by not only \npermitting the production of energy crops on land enrolled in various \ngovernment programs, but also providing an cost-share incentive to \nestablish these energy crops.\n  One relatively new scientific finding is the benefit of energy crops \nwith regard to carbon sequestration. Colorado State and Washington \nState Universities have developed protocols to assess the impact of \nland enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program specifically on \ncarbon sequestration. Their initial findings indicate that America's \ngrazed land and Conservation Reserve Program lands offer an extremely \nimportant environmental benefit of extracting carbon from the air in an \namount equivalent to America's forests. Encouraging the production of \nenergy crops as I am suggesting in this bill will help sustain and \nexpand this natural process enhancing air quality.\n  With regard to land enrolled in the various acreage reduction \nprograms, this legislation would: (1) authorize the Secretary to permit \nproduction and harvesting of energy crops in accordance with a \nconservation plan, and (2) provide a cost share component for the \nestablishment of these crops.\n  With regard to land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program, \nthis bill would: (1) provide the Secretary of Agriculture authority to \npermit production and harvesting of energy crops in designated \ndemonstration project areas not exceeding an aggregate of one million \nacres based on competitive joint industry/landowner proposals, (2) \nprovide a cost share component for the establishment of energy crops, \n(3) provide for a process by which landowners could identify the level \nof reduction in their annual CRP rental payments in exchange for the \nopportunity to participate in this program, and (4) an opportunity for \nConservation Reserve Program participants, utilizing these provisions, \nto extend their contracts.\n  I am proud to be introducing this bill today and welcome other \nSenators to cosponsor this beneficial environmental and energy \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Crop Production Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that energy crops--\n       (1) provide many of the soil and water conservation and \n     wildlife habitat benefits associated with cover already \n     planted on land enrolled in the conservation reserve program;\n       (2) can be harvested using best management practices \n     without compromising the conservation benefits being achieved \n     by the conservation reserve program;\n       (3) can maintain and enhance farm income while allowing \n     land to remain in the conservation reserve program at a \n     reduced cost to the Federal government;\n       (4) can supply a significant proportion of the energy needs \n     of the United States using domestic resources that are \n     renewable, sustainable, and environmentally beneficial; and\n       (5) can effectively trap carbon from the atmosphere and \n     provide air quality benefits.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the amount of an overpayment otherwise payable to any person shall \nbe reduced by the amount of past-due, legally enforceable State tax \nobligations of such person; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  STATE TAX REFUND OFFSET LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to today to introduce legislation to \nenhance the tax administration cooperation between the Federal \nGovernment and the States. In particular, this bill would provide for \nmore efficient cooperation between the U.S. Treasury and the various \nState tax agencies in the collection of unpaid taxes. Representative \nAndrew Jacobs has introduced similar legislation in the House as H.R \n757.\n  Mr. President let me explain how the law currently stands on this \nissue, why the bill is needed, and what this bill do.\n  Currently, the Federal Government maintains a program that allows for \na Federal tax refund to be withheld from a taxpayer if he or she has a \npast due Federal debt. Debts that are eligible for offset under this \nprogram include prior year tax debts, child support, student loans, VA \nhousing payments, and others. The refund is used to offset the past due \ndebt. Many States have similar programs to apply State tax refunds \nagainst other States debts of a taxpayer.\n  Under current law, the Internal Review Service [IRS] has the \nauthority to levy or to seize State income tax refunds to satisfy \nFederal tax debts of taxpayers in the 41 States that have a broad-based \nindividual income tax. Further, the IRS has the authority to enter into \nreciprocal agreements with State taxing authorities to more efficiently \ncollect tax revenues. One are of cooperative agreement between the IRS \nand the States in the authority under current law to offset taxpayers' \nFederal tax debts with a State tax refund. In other words, pursuant to \nthese agreements, if a taxpayer owes a tax liability to the Federal \nGovernment and, at the same time, is due a refund from the State taxing \nauthority, that State can withhold the refund allow it to be offset \nagainst the past due Federal debt. Currently, there are 31 States and \nthe District of Columbia that have voluntarily agreed to sign \ncooperative agreements to allow the IRS to satisfy Federal liabilities \nwith State refunds. In 1993, the States offset about $61 million in \ndebts on behalf of the IRS under these agreements.\n  Curiously, there is no authority under current law that allows the \nIRS to enter into additional agreements that would provide for a \nprogram to offset State tax debts with Federal tax refunds. Yet, \nallowing such agreements would save both the Federal Government and the \nStates millions of dollars in lost tax revenue each year.\n  Mr. President, under this bill the Treasury would be granted the \nauthority to enter into agreements with State tax agencies to offset \nState tax debts with Federal tax refunds. The effect of this \nlegislation would be better tax compliance and the payment of \ndelinquent tax debts. The bill provides that taxpayers who are due a \nFederal tax refund and also have a past due legally enforceable debt to \na State taxing authority would have 60 days notice to satisfy the past \ndue State debt before the IRS is authorized to release the Federal \nrefund to satisfy the State tax debt.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that there have been no formal hearings in \nthe Senate on this issue. I also understand that the chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance may have some technical concerns with the \nadministration of this legislation. This is understandable. Technical \nagreements between the Federal Government and the various States can be \ncomplex. I am open to comments and suggestions on the implementation of \nthis new authority. I look forward to working with the Senate Finance \nCommittee on this issue. However, I want to get a bill introduced in \nthe Senate to begin the formal discussions on how we can best satisfy \nthe problems that arise when a taxpayer is due a Federal tax refund \nwhile at the same time owing a State taxing authority delinquent taxes.\n  I want to inform my colleagues that I am aware that the opportunity \nmay arise for States to offset so-called source taxes under the \nprovisions of this bill. I am supportive of legislation to eliminate \nsource taxes. It is not my intention to allow the proposed refund \noffset program to be used for the purposes of collecting these source \ntaxes. To my understanding, the State of California has conceded on \nthis issue and is also a strong supporter of this bill. If the source \ntax language is dropped from the budget reconciliation bill not pending \nbefore the Congress, then I am willing to modify the bill to prevent \nStates from this offset program for the collection of sources taxes.\n  Mr. President, we are entering a more advanced era of computer \ntechnology. We should help facilitate the most efficient methods of \ncollecting and administering Federal and State tax revenues. Allowing \nthe Treasury to enter into reciprocal agreements with State moves us \ncloser to this goal. The Nation's Governors have asked for this and I \nthink we should help them in this area. The Federation of Tax \nAdministrators estimates that this program would allow the States to \nrecover between $150 and $200 million in tax debts. in addition, the \nJoint Committee has scored H.R. 757 to raise $8 million in additional \ntax revenues over 5 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16921-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16922-S16923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 939\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Frist] was added as a cosponsor of S. 939, a bill to amend title \n18, United States Code, to ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nIllinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1028, a \nbill to provide increased access to health care benefits, to provide \nincreased portability of health care benefits, to provide increased \nsecurity of health care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of \nindividuals and small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the names of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Johnston] and the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1166, a bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, \nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act, to improve the registration of \npesticides, to provide minor use crop protection, to improve pesticide \ntolerances to safeguard infants and children, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Reid] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1228, a bill to impose \nsanctions on foreign persons exporting petroleum products, natural gas, \nor related technology to Iran.\n\n\n                                S. 1340\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Bingaman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1340, a bill to \nrequire the President to appoint a Commission on Concentration in the \nLivestock Industry.\n\n[[Page S 16923]]\n\n\n\n                                S. 1377\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Leahy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1377, a bill to provide \nauthority for the assessment of cane sugar produced in the Everglades \nAgricultural Area of Florida, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1399\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dorgan, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Daschle] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1399, a bill to \namend title 49, United States Code, to ensure funding for essential air \nservice programs and rural air safety programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 146\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnston, the names of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye], the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], the Senator from \nNew York [Mr. D'Amato], the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], \nthe Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig], the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] and the Senator from \nRhode Island [Mr. Pell] were added as cosponsors of Senate Resolution \n146, a resolution designating the week beginning November 19, 1995, and \nthe week beginning on November 24, 1996, as ``National Family Week,'' \nand for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16922-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SENATE RESOLUTION 193--RELATIVE TO THE HOLOCAUST\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Murkowski, \nMr. McConnell, Mr. Specter, Mr. Pell, Mr. Simon, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Abraham, \nand Mr. Moynihan) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate Veterans \nDay 1995, I would like to express my heartfelt respect, thanks, and \nadmiration to each and every American veteran for the sacrifice they \nmade, and the pain they have endured to ensure that the flame of \nfreedom will never be extinguished.\n  Seventy-seven years ago, at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day, \nof the eleventh month, an armistice was signed between the Allies and \nthe Central Powers. As the guns of both the victors and the vanquished \nfell silent, ``the war to end all wars'' slipped into history.\n  For the next 20 years, ``Armistice Day'' was celebrated with parades \nand speeches, simple ceremonies, and sacred observances. For many \nyears, American Legion posts across America sponsored special \ncommemorations of Armistice Day during which buglers played ``Taps'' at \n11 o'clock at the main intersections of their towns, and for 2 minutes \nall traffic and daily transactions ceased, as citizens stopped to honor \nthose who had fallen in defense of liberty.\n  Mr. President, no one who lived through the horror of World War I \nbelieved that such a massive and brutal conflict could ever again \noccur. Unfortunately, the second World War proved to be even more \nterrible than the first, with twice and many dead and vastly more \nmaterial destruction. The intervening years, it seemed, were not the \nbeginning of an era of lasting peace, as so many had hoped, but merely \na brief interlude of tranquility that would be shattered many times in \nthe decades ahead.\n  Today, we celebrate Veterans Day--a day that honors not only the dead \nof World War I, but all those who have served their country in combat. \nThis Saturday, at Arlington National Cemetery where sentries from the \nOld Guard still maintain a constant vigil at the Tomb of the Unknowns, \nwe will pay tribute to the more than 1 million men and women who have \ndied in all U.S. wars in the service of their country.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has undergone many transformations since \nthe heros of the first Armistice Day marched off to war. The agony \ndidn't end with World War II, the Korean conflict, or even Vietnam, \nwhich for the first time, brought another kind of pain to veterans. But \nthankfully, we now recognize the sacrifice of those men and women, and \nperhaps we even appreciate it more because recognition was so long in \ncoming.\n  When a 21-year-old Army corporal named Tom Root returned from Vietnam \nin 1972, he hid in an airport bathroom, wishing he could change into \ncivilian clothes and so avoid having to run a gauntlet of anti-war \nprotesters. When he and his Illinois National Guard unit returned home \nfrom Desert Storm almost a decade later, the parade that received them \nwas 13 miles long.\n  Mr. President, although we are today at war with no nation, America's \nyoung men and women are still being called upon to help preserve peace \nand freedom in far-off places around the world--which should remind us \nthat although the price of war is high, the price of freedom is even \nhigher, because it never ends.\n  Those men and women--and all the men and women who served --cannot be \nhonored enough. We must do everything in our power to ensure that they \nare never forgotten or abandoned--especially not on the field of \nbattle. And we must do everything we can to ensure that the most sacred \nand visible symbol of America freedom under which so many fought and \ndied--the American flag--is never, under any circumstances, dishonored \nor desecrated.\n  Mr. President, throughout history, we have been captivated by images \nthat seem to sum up all the stress or emotion or pathos of a particular \nevent--George Washington's winter encampment at Valley Forge, Gen. \nRobert E. Lee's final ride to Appomattox along a path lined by ranks of \nUnion troops standing at attention, Winston Churchill bracing Britons \nto their task.\n  Just a few weeks ago, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of V-J \nDay. One of the most poignant scenes of World War II, one that will \nlive forever in the hearts and minds of Americans, is the image of a \nhandful of Marines braced against a whipping Pacific wind, raising the \nAmerican flag over Iwo Jima. That symbol of freedom--that flies over \nthe U.S. Capitol in Washington, that adorns the flagpoles of our \nschools and communities, that graces the windows and doorways of our \nhomes, that is draped in silent tribute over the coffins of our dead--\ndeserves our protection. It should--and I hope it will--be clearly and \nexplicitly protected by law.\n  We must keep America's promises to the men and women who so nobly and \nunselfishly risked their lives to answer to their country's call, and \nwe must forever honor those who, in the words of one soldier-poet, \n``tasted death in youth that Liberty might grow old.''\n  Mr. President, 2,000 years ago, a Greek historian commemorated the \nwar of his generation and paid tribute to veterans who perished and \nveterans who came home. I think his is a fitting tribute to all \nveterans, and I offer it now, in grateful appreciation, to all those \nwho served our country in war and in peace. He said:\n\n       I speak not of that in which their remains are laid but of \n     that in which their glory survives, and is proclaimed always \n     and on every fitting occasion both in word and deed.\n       For the whole earth is the sepulcher of famous men. Not \n     only are they commemorated by columns and inscriptions in \n     their own country, but in foreign lands there dwells also an \n     unwritten memorial to them, graven not on stone, but in the \n     hearts of men.\n\n  May the Almighty God who watches over us all, bless America and \nprotect all who place themselves in harm's way so that we may enjoy the \nblessings and benefits of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16928-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16928-S16929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ABORTION BAN BILL\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate \nhas voted to commit this bill to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, the pending bill is proposing a major change in \ncriminal law. For the first time, this body may pass a law making a \nmedical procedure a crime.\n  If this legislation becomes law, doctors in this country could be \nthrown behind bars for performing medical procedures that they feel are \nnecessary to protect the life and health of the mother.\n  The bill also creates a new cause of action for people to sue doctors \nwho perform a certain medical procedure.\n  Mr. President, we should not make a decision on a bill with these \nfar-reaching implications until we have a hearing.\n  There are just too many questions about this bill that have not been \nanswered by expert witnesses. Let me mention a few of them:\n  Is this bill Constitutional?\n  Does it violate the principles that the Supreme Court established in \nRoe versus Wade?\n  Why is the Federal Government criminalizing a medical procedure when \nmedical procedures are typically regulated by the States?\n  What is the rationale behind the 2-year prison sentence for \nphysicians who perform this procedure?\n  Will this bill result in hundreds or thousands of new civil lawsuits \nthat will overwhelm our legal system?\n  What does the term ``partial birth abortion'' mean? I understand that \nno \n\n[[Page S 16929]]\nsuch term exists in the medical lexicon. Is Congress just inventing a \nnew medical term to advance a political end?\n  Which Federal law enforcement agency will enforce this law? Will FBI \nagents be snooping around physicians' offices? Will the FBI put hidden \ncameras into examining rooms?\n  Mr. President, the Senate has not asked any expert witnesses to \nanswer these questions. And before we vote on this legislation, I think \nwe should have the opportunity to ask these questions.\n  We also should hear from individuals, groups and organizations that \nwill be affected by this bill.\n  Have we heard testimony in the Senate from any of the following?\n  The Justice Department?\n  The FBI?\n  Constitutional experts?\n  The trial and criminal bar?\n  Doctors?\n  Patients?\n  Families?\n  This is the only question that we all can categorically answer. The \nanswer is no! We have not heard testimony in the Senate from any of \nthese parties.\n  How can the Senate debate such a complicated bill without the input \nof such persons?\n  Mr. President, the Senate should be more deliberate and responsible! \nWe should not ram this bill through without proper consideration.\n  It would be wrong and irresponsible for the Senate to act before we \nhave a hearing on the provisions in this legislation. This is a new \nproposal that has not been before the Congress in the past.\n  Before we should be asked to vote, we should have testimony and a \ncommittee report on our desks.\n  Mr. President, I have great respect for the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We do not agree on many issues but I believe that he is \nfair. Now since the Senate has voted to commit this bill to the \nJudiciairy Committee, I trust that he will put together a fair hearing \non this bill so that the Senate can make an informed decision.\n  Once again, I am pleased that the Senate has voted to send this bill \nback where it belongs--to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16928-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16929-S16930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ELECTRONICS IS BRINGING GAMBLING INTO HOMES, RESTAURANTS, AND PLANES\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the attached article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 16, 1995]\n\nFeeling Lucky: Electronics Is Bringing Gambling Into Homes, Restaurants \n                               and Planes\n\n                        (By William M. Bulkeley)\n\n       Think you can avoid gambling? Don't bet on it.\n       Gambling once involved clandestine dealing with unsavory \n     bookmakers, or trips to the horse track or Las Vegas. But \n     electronics is making it ubiquitous. Innovators are using \n     technology to extend the frontiers of gambling--often to the \n     frustration of regulators.\n       On-line casinos and sports books are springing up on the \n     Internet. With central computers in Caribbean tax havens, and \n     play-money bets mingled with real wagers, sponsors think they \n     can evade U.S. laws barring gambling by wire. ``Gamble from \n     home in comfort on a Sunday morning in your PJs,'' suggests a \n     page on the Internet On-line Offshore Casinos, one of the on-\n     line betting parlors.\n       Get bored flying? This fall, British Airways will \n     experiment with a seat-back electronic system that can be \n     used for gambling on flights outside the U.S. Betting limits, \n     naturally, will be higher in first class.\n\n\n                               charge it\n\n       By the end of the year, the Coeur d'Alene Indian tribe in \n     Idaho plans to run a national lottery with weekly $50 million \n     jackpots that will allow players to use credit cards and dial \n     in their number picks over toll-free 800-lines. Graff Pay-\n     Per-View Inc., a publicly held New York-based movie and \n     adult-television programmer, is working on a system to let \n     people participate--by phone or computer--in high stakes \n     bingo games on Indian reservations. It says regulators have \n     approved the idea of ``proxy'' bingo from home, so long as \n     the game is actually played on a reservation. Graff says it \n     has also acquired a company that does television broadcasts \n     of race-track action ``to facilitate Graff's initiative to \n     bring wagering into the home.''\n       Connecticut and New York recently started permitting \n     telephone betting on horse races from all over the country. \n     The horse-racing industry has been able to transmit gambling \n     information across state lines for years.\n       Experts say electronic technology will accelerate increases \n     in gambling revenues, which have been climbing for years; \n     John Malone, president of cable-television giant Tele-\n     Communications Inc. has called gambling one of the \n     ``killer applications'' for interactive networks that \n     might justify the cost of building the information \n     highway.\n\n\n                             Risky Business\n\n       But there will be losers, too. Expanded electronic gambling \n     means tougher competition for existing lotteries casinos, \n     riverboats, racetracks, Indian gambling parlors and charity \n     bingo.\n       Some electronic wagering--especially the kind operated by \n     foreigners that relies on telephone lines and high-speed data \n     transmission--is difficult to monitor and may prove \n     impossible to control. There are no assurances that \n     electronic winners will actually see their jackpots.\n       And experts say electronic gaming is far more dangerous \n     than old-style betting to the 1% to 3% of the population \n     prone to gambling addiction. Widely dispersed electronic-\n     betting machines, for example, tempt teenagers already fond \n     of video games.\n       ``Electronics as a vehicle of administration for gambling \n     activities changes the experience to make it more dependence \n     producing, ``says Howard Shaffer, director of the division on \n     addictions at Harvard Medical School. ``As smoking crack \n     cocaine changed the cocaine experience, I think electronics \n     is going to change the way gambling is experienced.''\n\n\n                              new outlets\n\n       Operators, however, like technology because it works. State \n     lotteries, for example, are starting to add electronic keno, \n     a game in which a player selects up to 12 of 80 possible \n     numbers and watches to see if they are flashed on a screen. \n     Games happen every five minutes and tempt captive audiences. \n     ``Keno brought the lottery product to a distribution outlet \n     that was underused--bars, bowling alleys and restaurants. \n     It's helped states realize 30% to 100% revenue growth,'' says \n     a spokesman for Gtech Corp., a fast-growing West Greenwich, \n     R.I., company that runs 70% of the world's on-line lotteries. \n     The New York State Lottery will start using Gtech's keno \n     system at 2,250 outlets next month.\n       Gtech has developed communications systems in outposts from \n     Scotland's Sheltland Islands to the Strait of Magellan in \n     Chile. Bettors can now pick numbers for national lotteries \n     and receive confirmation of their bets via satellite in less \n     than four seconds. Long before places such as Lithuania get \n     reliable national phone service, they will have networks \n     linking urban and rural stores by satellite and microwave to \n     central lottery computers.\n       Salomon Brothers, in a report on the gaming industry, says \n     Americans lost $41.9 billion gambling legally in 1993, with \n     30% in casinos and the rest in lotteries. Lotteries now exist \n     in states with 89% of the nation's population, so growth is \n     largely based on introducing new games that get people to \n     play more often.\n       Still, saturation isn't imminent. Salomon analyst Bruce \n     Turner says that if Americans gambled at the same rate as \n     Australiians--who spend 2.5% of their disposable income on \n     gaming vs. 0.8 here--the U.S. gambling market would be more \n     than $100 billion.\n       The U.S. is now in a growth phase of a cyclical pattern of \n     gambling expansion and restriction, contends I. Nelson Rose, \n     a Whittier College law professor and gambling expert. Between \n     1910 and 1930, the only legal gambling in the U.S. was at \n     racetracks in Kentucky and Maryland. Gambling began to spread \n     during the Depression when Nevada relegalized it and many \n     states allowed race tracks. In 1964, New Hampshire approved \n     the first state lottery. Today, there is legal gambling in \n     every state except Utah and Hawaii.\n       The biggest wild card is gambling on the Internet because \n     it is so difficult to regulate and it offers all types of \n     wagering to anyone who has access to a computer. Players \n     either send money into an account from which they then bet, \n     or charge their bets on a credit card. They take it on faith \n     that they will be paid if they win.\n       The Justice Department says such online gambling is illegal \n     in the U.S. The department says it will act when it believes \n     a violation of the law has occurred.\n\n\n                             virtual casino\n\n       Sports International Ltd., which already operates an 800-\n     line telephone betting service from its headquarters in \n     Antigua, has opened an on-line sports book on the World Wide \n     Web segment of the Internet. Players can bet a minimum of $10 \n     picking the World Series or Super Bowl winners. Recent on-\n     line odds quote the New York Yankees at 9-to-5 and the \n     division-leading Boston Red Sox at 4-to-1 to win the American \n     League crown.\n       Michael Simone, president of publicly held Sports \n     International, says it plans to develop other games. ``The \n     cost of managing, and operating the proposed virtual casino \n     is almost nonexistent when compared to a live casino,'' he \n     says.\n       Last month, Toronto entrepreneur Warren Eugene began taking \n     blackjack bets via computer, in what he calls the ``Caribbean \n     Casino.'' To play, people must register with E-Cash, a Dutch \n     firm that handles financial transactions on the Internet. \n     Starting with little more than a vision and a colorful \n     Internet home page, Mr. Eugene claims nearly 1,000 people \n     have already deposited money to play.\n       With his computer in the Caribbean tax haven of the Turks \n     and Calcos Islands, he \n\n[[Page S 16930]]\n     says he offers a tempting option to gamblers. ``They're going to bet \n     with a bookie. They might as well bet with us and keep the \n     money offshore.''\n\n\n                            charges of fraud\n\n       Since U.S. law bars interstate wire transmission of most \n     gambling information for business, Minnesota Attorney General \n     Hubert H. Humphrey III has already filed suit against Kerry \n     Rogers, one of the principals of WagerNet, of Las Vegas. The \n     company is negotiating with the government of Belize for a \n     license for an on-line sports book. The Minnesota suit \n     accuses Mr. Rogers of consumer fraud by representing that the \n     ``proposed sports bookmaking service is lawful.'' Minnesota \n     has even posted its suit on the World Wide Web.\n       Under racketeering statutes, an American operating an \n     offshore casino might be subject to seizure of his assets, \n     says Mr. Rose, the law professor in California. However, \n     foreign nationals operating offshore casinos are probably \n     beyond the reach of U.S. laws. Individual bettors are hard to \n     track, and are almost never pursued by prosecutors, he says.\n       On-line operators also face a credibility problem. ``In \n     Vegas, you have a gaming commission that comes in and checks \n     the returns. You won't have that in Antigua or Belize,'' says \n     Earl Gilbrech, a Fountain Hills, Ariz., consultant who works \n     with several Caribbean gaming operators. ``Some guy in Idaho \n     isn't going to tell his local newspaper if he wins $22,000. \n     But you'll hear all these people'' complaining on-line when \n     they lose.\n\n\n                              High Rollers\n\n       Major casino operators pooh-pooh Intenet gaming, saying \n     they prefer to concentrate on resorts that draw high-rolling \n     sociable gamblers. But British Airways thinks electronic \n     gambling can draw goodtime tourists away from rivals. The \n     company says it plans to spend as much as $130 million to put \n     interactive screens on seat backs in 85 long-haul planes if a \n     trial--planned for one Boeing 747 on routes around the \n     world--works out. Screens will let fliers choose from more \n     than 100 movies, play Nintendo games or play blackjack and \n     roulette. Bets will be charged on credit cards.\n       The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't allow gaming on \n     flights that begin or end in the U.S., so if the airline \n     installs the devices widely, it will turn off gaming \n     functions on U.S. flights. Some localities have tougher \n     rules: Under laws prohibiting gaming devices, North Carolina \n     could try to stop even the gambling-disarmed planes from \n     landing, says one British Airways lawyer.\n       One big caveat is whether the technology works. In 1993, \n     Northwest Airlines tried a system called WorldLink that \n     included video games and a shopping channel. But it pulled \n     the system in 1994 because at any given time about 10% of the \n     screens didn't work, infuriating passengers.\n\n\n                           Invading the Home\n\n       Technology's biggest impact may be in bringing betting into \n     the home--the place International Gaming and Wagering \n     Business, a trade publication, calls ``gaming's new \n     frontier.''\n       The planned National Indian Lottery would let players pick \n     numbers by phone 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Players \n     would have to preregister with a credit card and get a \n     personal identification number to play.\n       When the Coeur d'Alene tribe announced its plans last \n     winter it got approval from Idaho and from the National \n     Indian Gaming Commission, but drew a firestorm of opposition \n     from other states. Some have threatened to prosecute phone \n     companies under gambling statutes if they let customers reach \n     the lottery's 800 number. The tribe dismisses the challenges \n     as ``fear of competition'' and expects to start its lottery \n     by year's end.\n\n\n                       Ponies in the Living Room\n\n       The horse-racing industry is embracing technology as its \n     best shot at survival. For years, simulcasting of out-of-\n     state races has let gamblers at tracks place bets during the \n     long intervals between post-times. Several states now permit \n     bettors to establish accounts with a track and then place \n     bets from home while watching races on TV.\n       IWN Corp., a partially owned subsidiary of NTN \n     Communications Inc., Carlsbad, Calif., has been working with \n     California tracks on a personal-computer-based system that \n     could both receive data on horses in races and let players \n     bet. Dan Downs, president of NTN and a former racing-industry \n     executive, says he expects the system will be tested in \n     Connecticut toward the end of this year.\n       This month, Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, \n     will start testing a television-based home-wagering system \n     developed by ODS Technologies Inc., Tulsa, Okla. Rather than \n     having to actually go to the track, people will be able to \n     watch races on their television sets and use a five-button \n     remote control to place bets--which will be transmitted over \n     telephone lines--right from their own living room.\n       ``The racing industry is dying,'' says an ODS spokesman. \n     ``We want to bring it right into the home and expose it to a \n     wider customer base.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16929-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RICHARD SEWELL\n\n Mr. GRAHAM.

In 1966, he served as staff coordinator for the ad \nhoc ethics committee and helped Bennett draft legislation which \nresulted in a permanent House Ethics Committee.\n  Dick left Bennett's staff in 1971 to become director of public \naffairs for the National Association of Food Chains. In 1972, he \nassisted Senator Henry M. Jackson in his campaign for the Democratic \nPresidential nomination, serving as the campaign's executive director \nin Florida.\n  In 1973, Dick became the director of Federal Government affairs for \nFlorida Power & Light Co. He remained the utility company's chief \nWashington representative until his retirement due to illness, in 1994. \nHe was active in energy, environment, and tax issues pending before \nCongress and Federal agencies, and was the author of numerous published \narticles on the subject.\n  In 1986-87, Dick directed FPL's campaign to establish a national \naward to recognize quality performance by American corporations. Partly \nthrough those efforts, Congress enacted the Malcolm Baldrige National \nQuality Improvement Act in 1987, under which companies compete annually \nfor the Malcolm Baldrige Award.\n  A lifelong loyal Floridian, Dick was a former president of both the \nFlorida State Society in Washington and the University of Florida \nAlumni Club. In 1979, he received the university's Distinguished \nAlumnus Award.\n  Dick was a past president of the Washington Business-Government \nRelations Council and the Washington Representatives Research Group. He \nserved on the board of directors of the Public Affairs Council and as a \ncharter member of the board of governors and treasurer of the Bryce \nHarlow Foundation. In addition, Dick was a former president of the \nBurro Club, an organization of Democratic congressional aides.\n  After graduating from public high school in Orlando, he studied \njournalism at the University of Florida. He received his degree in \n1959. From 1957 to 1959, Dick was the sports editor of the Orlando \nEvening Star. After college, he joined the sports staff of the Atlanta \nConstitution. He later moved to Jacksonville, FL, where he opened his \nown public relations firm.\n  Dick is survived by his wife, Peggy; their two children, Jane and \nMichael; his mother, Bertie Sewell; and his brother, Walter Sewell. He \nwill be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16930-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16930-S16931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GEORGE M. WHITE, ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Architect of the Capitol, \nGeorge M. White, will retire on November 21, 1995, after 25 years of \nservice.\n  At a recent dinner honoring Mr. White, Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan offered eloquent remarks on the history of the position of \nArchitect of the Capitol, and of the stamp that George White has made \non the Capitol complex.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my distinguished colleague's remarks made \nat a dinner at the National Building Museum on behalf of Mr. White be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\nRemarks of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan at Dinner Honoring George M. \nWhite, Architect of the Capitol--National Building Museum, Washington, \n                          DC, November 1, 1995\n\n       To begin at the beginning, from the time of George \n     Washington, until just now, the Architect of the Capitol was \n     simply picked by the President and presented to the Congress. \n     George White's predecessor died in 1970. President Nixon \n     asked if I had any thoughts as to a successor. As it \n     happened, I did, for it had been a full century since a \n     President had chosen an architect to be Architect. This was \n     beginning to show. The result was George Malcolm White.\n       I am aware that the Capitol as we know it is a felicitous \n     accretion of separate elements. Some infer from that that \n     succeeding generations are free to add to the building at \n     their pleasure. I think not. The various parts were \n     designated in the course of one-half century's work by a \n     string of extraordinary \n\n[[Page S 16931]]\n     minds, both Architects and Presidents. Thus, Jefferson and Latrobe \n     argued at length as to whether the column capitals in the \n     House of Representatives chamber should be modeled after \n     those in the Theater of Marcellus in Rome or the Choragic \n     Monument to Lysicrates in Athens. Latrobe won; although \n     Jefferson had the better case. This tradition had waned. Then \n     George White renewed it.\n       Like his early predecessors, he is a polymath, with degrees \n     in engineering, in business administration, and in law as \n     well as in architecture. He is registered in and has \n     practiced in all these fields. Beginning in 1988, I had the \n     honor of chairing the Judiciary Office Building Commission, a \n     body which was careful to stay out of George's way as he used \n     his master-planning skills to propose, his legal skills to \n     enact, his business skills to finance, and his architectural \n     and engineering skills to design and construct what is \n     properly judged the finest new government building in a \n     generation, the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building \n     at One Columbus Circle.\n       While the Capitol grounds and several of the buildings in \n     the Capitol complex bear his stamp, George White has made the \n     Capitol itself the focus of his life's work. He added balance \n     and proportion where he found it lacking and improved what \n     was existing when it needed his care. Who else could \n     recognize stone shock in the West Front and repair it to a \n     state better than before the British burned it? From the \n     foundations of the East Steps of the House, to the Minton \n     tiles on the floors, to the murals and frescoes on the \n     walls--indeed, to the crown of the Statue of Freedom atop the \n     Dome which he climbed and made new with great style and at no \n     little peril--all is better than he found it. We perhaps do \n     not yet understand how indebted we are! If you wanted to see \n     his works, look about you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16930-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE OCCASION OF THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF SENATOR BILL PROXMIRE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a long-time \nfriend and an esteemed colleague. A true populist, his record of \noutstanding achievements demonstrates what is possible when the highest \ncalibers of independence, integrity, and dedication are brought \ntogether in a loyal servant of State and country. Senator Bill Proxmire \nturns 80 this Saturday, and he deserves our heartfelt praise.\n  Senator Proxmire retired from this Chamber 7 years ago. When he did, \nhe left it as one of the Senate's most admired Members. Every day, when \nhe came to work after his 100 pushups and his 4-mile run, he brought \nwith him a Puritan work ethic and a unique commitment to a set of \nclosely held principles that set him apart from his colleagues, and \nwill ensure that he is forever remembered as one of this Chamber's \nfinest Senators.\n  His standards of personal conduct are legendary. He still holds the \nrecord for most consecutive votes in the Senate, having been in \nattendance for more than 10,000 rollcall votes during the course of 22 \nyears. In his last two campaigns for the Senate, in 1976 and 1982, he \nrefused to take campaign donations. Mr. President, let me reiterate \nthat. Not just PAC money, not just donations above a certain amount. He \ndid not take any money at all, from anyone. In each of these campaigns, \nhe spent less than $200 all of it out of his own pocket, and most of it \nto pay for postage and envelopes to send back donations offered to him \nby his supporters. Mr. President, when Senate campaigns nowadays cost \nmillions of dollars, this feat seems remarkable enough. The fact that, \nin both instances, he won by a landslide, demonstrates the peerless \nquality of his support and popularity among the fine people of \nWisconsin.\n  His legislative record is equally impressive. Senator Proxmire's \nindependence and integrity allowed him to be a strong leader on \ndaunting issues, making progress and achieving change in areas that \nothers might have forsaken. His battle in the late 1960's and early \n1970's to kill the supersonic transport plane is the stuff of legend in \nthe Senate. No matter what one might have thought of the merits of this \nprogram, one must admire Senator Proxmire's success in waging an uphill \nbattle against powerful opponents to end an expensive project that he \nsaw as a waste of the taxpayers' money.\n  Senator Proxmire was simultaneously a stalwart champion of both \ncompetition and the individual consumer, reminding us that the \ninterests of the latter are so often best served by the promotion of \nthe former. Early on in his career, he sponsored the Truth-in-Lending \nAct, which ensures consumer access to information in the lending market \nand forces banks to compete openly and on equal terms. Senator Proxmire \nwas right when he described this landmark bill as ``perhaps more \nvaluable to the consumer than any credit card in his wallet.'' Later, \nhis leadership was instrumental in securing passage of a 1980 bill \nderegulating the banking industry to free up financial institutions to \noffer better services at lower costs to consumers. He was motivated out \nof a profound belief that consumers would be better served by more \nchoices. History has undeniably proven him right.\n  Mr. President, I had the privilege and the honor of serving on the \nSenate Banking Committee for part of the time that Senator Proxmire was \nchairman of that body. I can tell you that his independence and \nstrength of character allowed him to perform his duties with a never-\nending commitment to his role as a beneficiary of the public trust. \nBeholden to no one except, in his own mind, the people who elected him, \nhe was a tireless advocate for the interests of ordinary people.\n  Senator Proxmire is perhaps best remembered for his near fanatical \ndevotion to saving taxpayer dollars. He refused to travel abroad at \nGovernment expense, and he returned $1 million to the Treasury over 6 \nyears by cutting back on staff expenses. This commitment to personal \nthrift gave him the credibility to stand up to the waste of taxpayer \nmoney elsewhere in the Government. And this he did with a passion and \nflair for which he will always be remembered in this Chamber, partly \nthrough a device uniquely his own: the Golden Fleece awards.\n  Mr. President, way back in 1975, long before the Vice-President was \nshattering ash trays on late night television, long before people were \nciting $200 Pentagon hammers, Senator Proxmire created these monthly \nawards to highlight particularly wasteful Government spending programs. \nDozens of programs earned this dubious distinction; some have said that \nthe Senator's zeal for exposing the waste of taxpayer dollars was \nmatched only by the abundance of candidates from which to choose.\n  It seems as if everyone who's been around here a while has their own \nfavorite Golden Fleece. Whether it's the research institution that \nspent $100,000 trying to establish whether sunfish that drank tequila \nwere more aggressive than sunfish that drank gin, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration project to research the body measurements of airline \nstewardess trainees, or the grant to study why people fall in love, \neach Golden Fleece not only makes its point about the potential dangers \nof ill-managed and ill-conceived government programs, but reminds us of \nthe humor and character of this noble public servant.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join me in conveying \nour best birthday wishes and our sincere thanks to Senator Bill \nProxmire, who, through over 30 years of loyal service in the Senate \nmarked by independence and hard work, demonstrated his steadfast \ncommitment to serving the people of Wisconsin and the citizens of this \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16931-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16931-S16932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HAZEL O'LEARY: IMAGE IS EVERYTHING\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, may I pose a not-so-hypothetical \nquestion? If you were head of a Government agency, and that agency were \nbeing criticized by the press, Members of Congress, and the American \npublic for inefficiency and incompetence; if, Mr. President, you knew \nthat the Government--at the American people's behest--was undergoing a \nmassive effort to cut spending in order to balance the budget, what \nwould you do, Mr. President?\n  If you are like most people, your answer might go something like \nthis: I would listen carefully to the criticisms, I would take a good \nhard look at my department and make the necessary changes, and I would \ndo everything possible to save money.\n  If, however, you are Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, the answer is a \nbit different. Secretary O'Leary, whose Department of Energy is still \njustifying its own existence, paid $43,500--taxpayer money, Mr. \nPresident--for a media analysis company to track her and her \ndepartment's coverage in the media.\n\n[[Page S 16932]]\n\n  Here's how today's Wall Street Journal describes it:\n\n       Mrs. O'Leary quietly hired an investigative service to poke \n     into the reporters who were poking around the DOE. From April \n     through August, the service, Washington-based Carma \n     International, tracked more than two dozen individual \n     reporters and hundreds of newspapers, magazines and \n     newscasts. It also pored over thousands of stories, giving \n     each one a numerical ranking based on how favorable or \n     unfavorable it was. It then calculated scores for how \n     favorably or unfavorably the DOE fared on various issues, \n     from nuclear waste to Mrs. O'Leary's own reputation. And it \n     scrutinized sources quoted in those stories, coming up with \n     its own ``Top 25'' list of ``Unfavorable Sources.''\n\n  Wanda Briggs and John Stang, reporters with the Tri-Cities Herald in \nWashington State, are among those the investigative service monitored.\n  Mr. President, the foolishness and irresponsibility of this venture \nboggles the mind. The first, most obvious point to raise is the fact \nthat we are on a mission to balance the budget. For Secretary O'Leary \nto waste taxpayer dollars on her image is inexcusable. While we in \nCongress are trying to reduce the size and cost of Government so that \nwe may achieve a balanced budget in 7 years, a member of the \nPresident's Cabinet feels free to throw money into frivolous projects.\n\n  Oh, and by the way, the Wall Street Journal quotes Secretary \nO'Leary's spokeswoman as saying that the investigative service ``wasn't \nparticularly useful,'' and that the Secretary read very little of what \nthe service had to offer since ``she found it too complicated.'' I \nthink it's time the Secretary understood that we can neither afford, \nnor will we allow, $43,000 mistakes.\n  Second, Mr. President, of all the various responsibilities of the \nDOE--and they are serious responsibilities indeed--using a private \ncompany to analyze Secretary O'Leary's image in the press is, to put it \nmildly, at the very bottom of the list.\n  The challenges facing DOE in Washington State alone are stupendous:\n  At the Hanford Nuclear Site, thousands of tons of nuclear waste lie \nunderground, yards away from the Columbia River, posing a direct threat \nto the region's safety.\n  Cleanup at Hanford, while progressing, still demands our utmost \nattention and concern. The health of the people of the Hanford region, \nand of the people all over the country who live near nuclear sites, \nrequires that we remain fully committed to cleaning up the nuclear \nwaste.\n  That is just in my home State, Mr. President. Across the country, \nsimilar problems exist. So it is disturbing to learn that Secretary \nO'Leary's attention is being diverted by such trivial concerns as what \nthe press is saying about her.\n  Mr. President, over the last 18 months, almost 5,000 people have lost \ntheir jobs at Hanford. They are struggling and will continue to \nstruggle with upheaval and uncertainty in their community. Meanwhile, \nthe Secretary of Energy, someone who has potentially great influence \nover their fate, pulls a stunt like this. So much for setting an \nexample at the top.\n  There are a lot of people in this town for whom $43,500 is nothing--\nless than nothing. In the White House, in Congress, in the agencies, \npeople deal on a daily basis with money in the millions and billions. \nBut Mr. President, for the peopel of Hanford, that's real money.\n  There is a man in the Hanford area who lost his job more than 6 \nmonths ago. He has talked with my office, and prefers to remain \nanonymous. For 15 years he worked at Westinghouse as a technologist. He \npaid his taxes, he was a Boy Scout, he provided for his family. He was \nlaid off on April 28--in the same month that Secretary O'Leary began \nher quest for a better image. He has two children and two \ngrandchildren. His wife recently had to quit her job due to illness. He \nis still looking for work.\n  Coincidentally, Mr. President, this man's salary--before he was laid \noff--was $44,000. Secretary O'Leary spent over $43,000 for 4 months of \nuseless media analysis. Food on the table, or image enhancement--Mr. \nPresident, just where do Hazel O'Leary's priorities lie?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16931-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16932-S16933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE ADVISORY COMMISSION ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to lament the fact that \nHouse Joint Resolution 115 contains a provision to provide for the \n``orderly termination'' of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental \nRelations [ACIR]. This is most regrettable, and ought not to go \nunnoticed.\n  The ACIR was created by Congress in 1959--during the Eisenhower \nadministration--``to monitor the operation of the American federal \nsystem and to recommend improvements.'' The commission is independent \nand bipartisan. Over 30 years ago, under Dr. Alice Rivlin, it commenced \nground-breaking research on alternative measures of fiscal capacity. It \nmeasures tax effort and representative expenditures and a host of other \ntopics that may appear arcane, but are of enormous importance when it \ncomes to governance. Few people are even aware of the ACIR because it \ngoes about its business quietly, professionally, and dispassionately.\n  Earlier this year, Mr. President, Congress passed the unfunded \nmandates bill--Public Law 104-4. That bill generated considerable \ndiscussion about our Federal system and the proper roles of and \nrelationships between the various levels of government. At that time, \nthe Commission's unique expertise on such questions was recognized, and \nCongress delegated much work regarding unfunded mandates to it. The \nCommission estimated it would need about $1 million over and above its \nfiscal year 1995 appropriation of $1 million to perform the unfunded \nmandates work and continue equally valuable ongoing research and \nprojects.\n  Earlier this year, the House Treasury-Postal appropriations bill \n(H.R. 2020) zeroed out funding for the Commission. The Senate bill \nprovided $334,000 for the Commission, but stipulated that no further \nFederal funds would be made available.\n  This seems to me a good example of an unfunded mandate. But no \nmatter. The ACIR is prepared to continue its operations without Federal \nfunding. I do not know how, but I leave it to them. When conferees met \non the Treasury-Postal bill, however, language was inserted that would \ngive ACIR a small appropriation to terminate its operations by April of \n1996. Senate Joint Resolution 115 also provides a minimum amount of \nfunding ``necessary to accomplish orderly termination'' of the \nCommission. Both the Commission and the Office of Management and Budget \n[OMB] are concerned that termination is something altogether different \nfrom simply not providing Federal funding.\n  I deeply regret the action of the Treasury-Postal conferees, and I \ndeeply regret that it has carried over to the continuing resolution. Is \nit necessary to terminate an organization that has indicated it can \nsurvive, somehow, without Federal funds?\n  Mr. President, the first principle of public affairs is that you \nnever do anything about a problem until you learn to measure it. I \nwould add a corollary: if your purpose is not to address problems \nthrough government, you will put an end to attempts to measure them. I \nwonder if that is what is at work here. Surely, we are not going to \nbalance the budget by eliminating the ACIR. What is this all about?\n  I remember back in December 1981, Edwin Harper, then deputy director \nof the OMB, issued a memorandum which stated:\n\n       As a result of recent evaluations of certain reporting \n     requirements, it has been decided to discontinue the \n     compilation and publication of the ``Geographic Distribution \n     of Federal Funds,'' effective immediately. Data should not be \n     submitted for fiscal year 1981.\n\n  The purpose of that directive was to make it more difficult to \nquantify the balance of payments between the States and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Beginning in 1968, the Community Services Administration began to \npublish annual reports, known as the Geographic Distribution of Federal \nFunds series, in which expenditures of various Federal programs were \nbroken down by State, and thereafter by counties and towns. It is worth \nnoting that the Community Services Administration was the successor to \nthe Office of Economic Opportunity, the organization established in \n1965 to carry out President Johnson's ``War on Poverty.'' As a member \nof the President's task force that drew up that legislation, I had been \nmuch concerned with the question of regional balance in Federal \nexpenditures and, in 1965, made what I believe \n\n[[Page S 16933]]\nwas the first formal statement calling attention to the loss of \nindustrial jobs in New York. The idea of measuring these matters was an \naspect of the poverty program, and it was pleasing to find that our \nintentions had not been lost on those who followed.\n  Unfortunately, the task was not done with sufficient vigor. Various \nGovernment agencies were simply asked where their money went, and the \nmatter was left at that. Because New York is the banking center of the \nworld, huge amounts of Federal moneys are deposited there, although \nthey are actually in transit elsewhere. No matter: vast sums of foreign \naid, payments by the Commodity Credit Corporation, and similar \ntransfers were being recorded as Federal outlays in New York.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, each year that I have been in the \nSenate I have issued a report I call the ``Fisc'' which measures the \nbalance of payments between New York and the Federal Government. You \ncan imagine my surprise--back when the finances not only of New York \nCity, but of the State, as well, were shaky--that the data, such as \nthey were, suggested that New York ran a balance of payments surplus.\n  Well, we discovered a phantom $14 billion in Federal outlays \nnominally attributed to New York. When these sums were subtracted from \nthe total, we discovered a large and unmistakably serious deficit in \nNew York's balance of payments. A deficit that persists to this day.\n  We got to the point where we had tidied up the data. It took some \ndoing. Looking back, if a general judgment may be offered of the \nperiod, the Community Services Administration was interested and \nhelpful. The Treasury Department, on the other hand, was aloof and \nimpervious--equally to reason or change. In the end, we turned to the \nTax Foundation, a private organization, as our source for data on tax \npayments, inasmuch as the Treasury Department refused to tell us then--\nand still will not tell us--where it gets its money.\n  And then the new administration came and decided to discontinue the \nGeographic Distribution of Federal Funds series. It was stopped in \norder to conceal trends and mute argument.\n  We protested, and we enacted Public Law 97-326, the Consolidated \nFederal Funds Report Act of 1982, which directed the Census Bureau to \ntrack allocable Federal expenditures. The Census Bureau does a \nmarvelous job. Its Consolidated Federal Funds Report and Federal \nExpenditures by State report are available on CD-ROM now, containing 10 \nyears' worth of data. It's marvelous.\n  Mr. President, the ACIR does important, if largely unheralded, work. \nAnd we stand on the brink of terminating it. This is a mistake which we \nwill regret. I realize the provision is identical to the conferees' \nagreement on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. But that bill is \nan unresolved matter. Neither the House nor the Senate has approved the \nconference report, and even if we were to do that, there is no \nguarantee the administration would sign it. There is a chance, albeit \nslim, to correct the mistake.\n  Mr. President, getting back to my first principle of public affairs, \nLord Kelvin stated it best:\n\n       When you can measure what you are speaking about, and \n     express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when \n     you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, \n     your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind: it may \n     be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your \n     thoughts, advanced to the stage of science.\n\n  Mr. President, without the ACIR, our knowledge of important matters \nwill never be anything more than meager. The action we are about to \ntake will harm our capacity to govern effectively.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16932-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO AGRI-MARK-CABOT COOPERATIVE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate and \npay tribute to the members of the Agri-Mark/Cabot Cooperative. On \nNovember 13, 1995, the hardworking Agri-Mark framers dedicate the newly \nrenovated state-of-the art cheddar cheese production facility in \nMiddlebury, VT.\n  For over 75 years Cabot Creamery has produced superior dairy products \nfrom local Vermont farms. Today, only the size of Cabot has changed. \nFarmers from throughout New England and New York have joined the \nfarmers from Vermont with great pride in producing the highest quality \nproducts. Farm fresh milk will be churned into Cabot's award-winning \ncheeses for stores throughout the country and around the globe.\n  Mr. President, Cabot products are in high demand. Cabot's special \ndetail to quality gives their products the edge over the competition. \nIn fact, Cabot's own sharp cheddar was acclaimed the best cheddar in \nthe country by the U.S. Cheese Makers Association in Green Bay, WI. \nThat's right, even the competition agrees that Cabot farmers produce \nthe best. In addition to the overwhelming satisfaction of real cheddar \nlovers, just this year Cabot's Vermont cheddar won first place at the \nAmerican Cheese Society's annual contest.\n  Throughout my years in Congress, I have been proud to represent the \nVermont dairy farmer. I have worked to protect farmer income, bring \nstability to the dairy industry, and preserve Vermont's agricultural \nlandscape. This investment of money and sweat from the farmers of Agri-\nMark/Cabot comes at a time when Congress is making sweeping changes to \nthe Government's involvement with the dairy industry. I am confident \nthat the farmers of Agri-Mark/Cabot will adapt to the changes of the \nindustry, becoming more efficient, competitive, and productive. I will \ncontinue to give the support that the farmers deserve and respect in \nCongress to allow them to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I join with the 1,800 Agri-Mark/Cabot farmers in a \n``Milk Toast to the Future.'' One hundred years from today, the farmers \nof Agri-Mark will open a time capsule. In it they will find the past \nthat helped build the future.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute today to \nSargent Shriver, my dear friend for whom I have the utmost respect and \nadmiration, on the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n  It is rare, in this day and age, to be able to say that a person has \ntruly made the world a better place in which to live. But that is a \nfitting description of Sargent Shriver. A man of stellar character, \nfaithful devotion, and tireless energy, Sargent Shriver has led a life \nof philanthropy, compassion, and public service.\n  Born on this day in 1915, Sargent Shriver earned both his \nundergraduate and law degrees from Yale University. In 1953, he married \nEunice Kennedy--and I say to my good friend Eunice today, she could not \nhave married a better man. Shriver has, at different points in his \nlife, played the roles of Navy serviceman, Newsweek journalist, \nMerchandise Mart general manager, Chicago Board of Education \ncommissioner, public servant, vice presidential candidate, and \nAmbassador to France.\n  But the roles in which Sargent Shriver truly shined are those for \nwhich he is best known. In 1961, Sargent Shriver became the chief \norganizer and first director of the Peace Corps, establishing an \norganization that would come to the aid of foreign communities needing \nmedical, educational, and technical assistance, while giving millions \nof Americans the opportunity to share knowledge and culture with those \naround the world. It was not easy--the critics were numerous and \nvocal--but he pressed on and the Peace Corps became one of the \nhallmarks of the Kennedy Administration. Mr. President, Sargent Shriver \ndeserves the gratitude of every American for his work in this capacity. \nI must add my personal thanks to him, for my own service in the Peace \nCorps profoundly affected my life.\n  But Sargent Shriver's commitment to those most in need did not end \nthere. Leading President Johnson's War on Poverty, Shriver ushered in \n\n[[Page S 16934]]\nmany of the Great Society programs that made the American dream a \nreality for so many families--programs that continue to bring so much \nto so many.\n  And now that he is 80, Mr. President, Sargent Shriver's altruism is \nfar from faded, but rather is as strong as ever. Since 1984, Shriver \nhas served as president, and since 1990, chairman of the board, of \nSpecial Olympics International, which was founded by his wife, Eunice. \nI was privileged to see the glorious results of Eunice's and Sargent's \ntireless efforts on behalf of this fine organization this past summer, \nwhen the State of Connecticut hosted the Special Olympic Games.\n  It has been said, Mr. President, that a true leader is one who \ndevelops leadership in others--one who wants to see every individual \nsucceed to the best of their ability, even if those achievements \nsurpass his own. Through his stewardship of both the Peace Corps and \nthe Special Olympics, Sargent Shriver has sought to encourage and \ndevelop the unique talents, energies, and abilities of all individuals, \nproving that he is indeed among the true leaders of our time.\n  Mr. President, Sargent Shriver is a humanitarian, an advocate, a \npublic servant, and a leader whose contributions to his country and to \nhis fellow man will endure throughout the ages. I am proud to call him \nmy friend, and I wish him and Eunice all the best on this very special \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16933-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDING THE UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 193, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 193) deploring individuals who deny \n     the historical reality of the Holocaust and commending the \n     vital, ongoing work of the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senior \nSenator from Utah in support of the Hatch-Lautenberg Resolution which \ncondemns individuals who deny the historical reality of the Holocaust. \nIt also commends the vital, tireless work of the U.S. Holocaust \nMemorial Museum. I urge my colleagues to join us in approving the \nresolution, affirming that this distinguished body, the U.S. Senate, \ndenounces those who deny that the Holocaust occurred.\n  Mr. President, more than 50 years ago, Adolf Hitler mounted his \nsystematic effort to destroy whole populations--including the Jewish \npeople, gypsies, the disabled, Poles, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, \nSoviet POW's and political dissidents. Six million Jews and five \nmillion others were murdered. That is a historical fact proven by \ndetailed records kept by the Nazis. Our duty to the survivors of the \nHolocaust and to those who died on the trains, in the fields, and in \nthe gas chambers is to make sure that their story is told from \ngeneration to generation. We must study and reflect on the atrocities \nof the Nazis, in order to make sure that this dark chapter of history \nis never repeated.\n  Mr. President, we have reason to be concerned. A recent poll found \nthat 22 percent of Americans think that it is possible one of the most \nhorrifying events in the history of the world never occurred. Even \nbefore the end of World War II, anti-Semitic groups worked to create \nthe illusion that the Holocaust was nothing more than a myth. These \nindividuals, bent on their own agenda of hatred, often pass themselves \noff as scholars and historians, and their findings as fact, they \ndispute all personal accounts and physical evidence as mere propaganda. \nTheir allegations are astounding when you consider how well the \nHolocaust is documented.\n  In recent years, these individuals have moved from the confines of \nhate groups and other anti-Semitic organizations to our colleges and \nuniversities. On campuses nationwide, in ads placed in university \nnewspapers, they spread their propaganda, lies, and falsehoods in the \nhope of selling their claims. We must not allow groups attacking the \nHolocaust to gain ground or respect, nor can we allow the existence of \nthe Holocaust be made a subject of debate. But most important, we can \nnot let the memory of 11 million people fade from our memories.\n  One of the most important tools we in combating those who would deny \nthe Holocaust is viewing firsthand the horrors that took place in the \nconcentration camps. This was the core concept of a living museum, \nwhere visitors could not only walk through and view exhibits, but \nactually feel them. In 1993, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum opened \nits doors to the world. Since then, over 5 million visitors have passed \nthrough its doors with over two-thirds of those being non-Jews.\n  I am honored to serve on the memorial council and to be involved in \nthe planning and management of the museum. In this capacity I have met \nand toured the museum with a number of Holocaust survivors. The stories \nof these survivors speak volumes of the horror and the stark reality of \nthis event. I find it unimaginable that anyone could view such a \ncollection without a heartfelt feeling of loss for what the victims and \ntheir families endured.\n  Mr. President, I commend the individuals whose vision made the museum \na reality. The survivors and families of those lost have shared their \nstories in a collection that teaches all that are willing to learn \nabout the Holocaust. The building, in the shadow of the Washington and \nJefferson Memorials, is a testament to the existence of one of the most \ntragic events in the history of the world. By acknowledging that the \nHolocaust did happen, and by educating these nonbelievers, can we help \nensure that it will never happen again.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 193) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 193\n\n       Whereas the Holocaust is a basic fact of history, the \n     denial of which is no less absurd than the denial of the \n     occurrence of the Second World War;\n       Whereas the Holocaust--the systematic, state-sponsored mass \n     murders by Nazi Germany of 6,000,000 Jews, alongside millions \n     of others, in the name of a perverse racial theory--stands as \n     one of the most ferociously heinous state acts the world has \n     ever known; and\n       Whereas those who promote the denial of the Holocaust do so \n     out of profound ignorance or for the purpose of furthering \n     anti-Semitism and racism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) deplores the persistent, ongoing and malicious efforts \n     by some persons in this country and abroad to deny the \n     historical reality of the Holocaust; and\n       (2) commends the vital, ongoing work of the United States \n     Holocaust Memorial Museum, which memorializes the victims of \n     the Holocaust and teaches all who are willing to learn \n     profoundly compelling and universally resonant moral lessons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16934-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16934-S16935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HISTORIC CHATTAHOOCHEE COMPACT AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 35, Senate Joint \nResolution 29.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n\n       A joint resolution (S. J. Res. 29) expressing the sense of \n     Congress with respect to North-South dialogue on the Korean \n     Peninsula and the United States-Korea Agreed Framework.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the unanimous \npassage of Senate Joint Resolution 29, a resolution which a bipartisan \ngroup, Senators Helms, Thomas, Simon, Robb, and I, introduced in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee last March.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of Congress with respect to the \nserious issue of North Korea-South Korea dialog, which was a key part \nof the United States-North Korea Agreed Framework on the nuclear issue \nsigned last October.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have spoken extensively about the \nproblems I see in the Agreed Framework, most recently on September 29 \nwhen I introduced S. 1293, a bill to provide for strict monitoring of \nand controls on U.S. spending on implementation of that agreement. \nThere is no need to repeat those arguments here other than to stress \nthe importance of passing that legislation as soon as possible.\n  Today I am speaking about only one specific, and critical element of \nthe Agreed Framework: the necessity of a meaningful North-South Korean \ndialog. Without such a dialog, I am convinced that implementation of \nthe Agreed Framework is unworkable. That's why it is up to us to make \nsure the North Koreans fulfill that and all of their other \nresponsibilities in the Agreed Framework.\n  Passage of this resolution is also particularly timely when taking \ninto account South Korean President Kim Young Sam's remarks to the \nJoint Meeting of Congress this summer. President Kim said:\n\n       Peace on the Korean Peninsula can only take root through \n     dialogue and cooperation between the South and the North, the \n     two parties directly concerned. Without dialogue, nothing can \n     be accomplished. I am thus grateful that both the President \n     and Congress have stressed the central importance of the \n     South-North dialogue.\n\n  South Korea remains a trusted and loyal ally, and I believe we must \nfollow a policy toward the Korean Peninsula that keeps South Korea's \nbest interests in the forefront.\n\n[[Page S 16936]]\n\n  Section III.(2) of the Agreed Framework specifies that ``[t]he DPRK \nwill consistently take steps to implement the North-South Joint \nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'' The \nAgreed Framework goes on to say in section III.(3) that ``[t]he DPRK \nwill engage in North-South dialogue, as this Agreed Framework will help \ncreate an atmosphere that promotes such dialogue.''\n  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary \nof State Warren Christopher had this to say about these provisions:\n\n       As part of the Framework, North Korea has pledged to resume \n     dialogue with South Korea on matters affecting peace and \n     security on the peninsula. We have made clear that resuming \n     North-South dialogue is essential to the success of the \n     Framework--so important that we were prepared to walk away \n     from the Framework if North Korea had not been willing to \n     meet that condition.\n\n  I am gratified that the United States negotiators held firm at least \non this issue, that is, including references to these two North-South \nissues. Nevertheless, and while I remain disturbed about many aspects \nof the Agreed Framework, I am concerned that the requirements of \nsuccess or even progress in the North-South dialog were not spelled out \nin greater detail. For instance, what is the time line for progress? At \nwhat point will the United States stop fulfilling its commitments under \nthe Agreed Framework if there has not been progress in North-South \nrelations?\n  It is this lack of specificity that led me and my colleagues to \nintroduce this resolution. I know and appreciate that the \nadministration is taking a firm public and private line that North-\nSouth dialog is essential. They reiterated that position, jointly with \nthe South Koreans, on November 2-3, during the annual Security \nConsultative meeting in Seoul. I also appreciate the fact that the \nadministration agreed not to oppose this resolution but rather to work \nwith me on achieving an objective we both support, a strong, renewed \ndialog between North and South Korea.\n  However, and this is the key point, as usual, the North Koreans are \nignoring their responsibilities and resisting restarting the dialog. \nThat is why the resolution calls on the executive branch to take steps \nto ensure that the North Koreans understand that the implementation of \nthe Agreed Framework is linked to substantive progress in the dialog \nbetween North and South Korea, including through developing timetables \nfor achieving measures to reduce tensions between North and South \nKorea.\n  Although not a comprehensive list, such positive measures could \ninclude: First, holding a North-South summit; second, dismantling North \nKorea's reprocessing facility; third, initiating mutual nuclear \nfacility inspections; fourth, establishing North-South liaison offices; \nfifth, establishing a North-South joint military commission; sixth, \nexpanding trade relations; seventh, promoting freedom to travel; \neighth, encouraging exchanges and cooperation in science and \ntechnology, education, the arts; health, sports, the environment, \npublishing, journalism, and other fields of mutual interest; ninth, \nestablishing postal and telecommunications services; and tenth, \nreconnecting railroads and roadways.\n  The resolution calls on the President to report to Congress within 90 \ndays regarding the progress made in promoting communication and contact \nbetween North and South Korea, and every 6 months thereafter.\n  Since the signing of the Agreed Framework with the United States, we \nhave seen North Korea go to great lengths to avoid any involvement with \nSouth Korea. The North Koreans refused for several months to accept \nSouth Korean reactors. The joint press statement issued in Kuala Lumpur \nby the United States and North Korea did not include a direct reference \nto South Korea's central role in providing the light water reactors. \nAnd the North Koreans had maintained that the United States will be its \nprincipal point of contact in the negotiations.\n  Also, North Korea continues to take steps to try to destroy the \nArmistice Agreement while insisting that it will only deal with the \nUnited States concerning an ultimate peace treaty. Further, North Korea \ncontinues to provide evidence that it wants to continue being a rogue \nnation, for example just a few days ago sending infiltrators into the \nSouth to attempt to cause problems for our ally. Mr. President, in sum, \njust as North Korea's attempts to downplay the role of South Korea \nwhile putting distance between the United States and South Korea must \nnot be tolerated, North Korea's misbehavior should be condemned.\n  I would note one recent development which had some potential for \npositive change--but then, typically, became a problem area because of \nthe North's irresponsible behavior. North Korea and South Korea \nrecently held talks in Beijing to discuss North Korea's renewed request \nfor rice from its cousins in the South to relieve the food shortage in \nthe North. This followed an earlier successful agreement to ship rice \nto the North--although the North then acted in its typically boorish \nfashion by arresting some of those who were trying to help its people. \nNow, despite the helping hand from the South, the North continues to \nresist the South's legitimate attempts to use the talks about rice aid \nto pave the way for greater dialogue.\n  Mr. President, I do not need to remind my colleagues that 37,000 \nAmerican soldiers stationed on the demilitarized zone remain in harm's \nway. We all received a grim reminder of this when a United States \nhelicopter was shot down on December 17, 1994, killing one United \nStates airman and leading to North Korean detention of another on false \ncharges of American espionage.\n  These American troops are part of the nearly 2 million troops who \nface each other across a heavily fortified demilitarized zone. Three \ndecades of on-again, off-again talks between Pyongyang and Seoul have \nproduced no significant progress in reducing tensions. Although a \ncease-fire effectively ended the Korean War in 1953, the two sides \ntechnically remain at war, and tensions today are as strong and all-\npervasive as they've ever been.\n  Mr. President, in sum, the Agreed Framework does not adequately \naddress the inevitable underlying tensions between North and South \nKorea. Nor do I believe that North and South Korea will simply work \neverything out without some outside assistance. For that reason, I \nbelieve that the Clinton administration must take specific steps to \nensure that North Korea lives up to its commitments under the Agreed \nFramework and understands that, if it does not, it will not receive the \nbenefits which have been promised.\n  This legislation will take us a step in the right direction. I hope \nour colleagues in the other body will also pass this legislation soon \nso that the process can begin.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be deemed read the third time, passed, the preamble agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the joint resolution appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 29) was deemed read the third \ntime, and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas the Agreed Framework Between the United States and \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of October 21, \n     1994, states in Article III, paragraph (2), that ``[t]he DPRK \n     will consistently take steps to implement the North-South \n     Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean \n     Peninsula'';\n       Whereas the Agreed Framework also states the ``[t]he DPRK \n     will engage in North-South dialogue, as this Agreed Framework \n     will help create an atmoshphere that promotes such \n     dialogue'';\n       Whereas the two agreements entered into between North and \n     South Korea in 1992, namely the North-South Denuclearization \n     Agreement and the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression \n     and Exchanges and Cooperation, provide an existing and \n     detailed framework for dialogue between North and South \n     Korea;\n       Whereas the North Korean nuclear program is just one of the \n     lingering threats to peace on the Korean Peninsula; and\n       Whereas the reduction of tensions between North and South \n     Korea directly serve United States interests, given the \n     substantial defense commitment of the United States to South \n     Korea and the presence on the Korean Peninsula of United \n     States troops: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Represenatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S 16937]]\n\n\n     SECTION 1.

INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND \n                   DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.\n\n        (a) Rate Adjustment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall, effective on December 1, 1995, increase the dollar \n     amounts in effect for the payment of disability compensation \n     and dependency and indemnity compensation by the Secretary, \n     as specified in subsection (b)\n        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be \n     increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:\n        (1) Compensation.--Each of the dollar amounts in effect \n     under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.\n        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the \n     dollar amounts in effect under section 1115(1) of such title.\n        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount in effect under \n     section 1162 of such title.\n        (4) New dic rates.--The dollar amounts in effect under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1311(a) of such title.\n        (5) Old dic rates.--Each of the dollar amounts in effect \n     under section 1311(a)(3) of such title.\n        (6) Additional dic for surviving spouses with minor \n     children.--The dollar amount in effect under section 1311(b) \n     of such title.\n        (7) Additional dic for disability.--The dollar amounts in \n     effect under sections 1311(c) and 1311(d) of such title.\n        (8) DIC for dependent children.--The dollar amounts in \n     effect under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of such title.\n        (c) Determination of Percentage Increase.--(1) The \n     increase under subsection (a) shall be made in the dollar \n     amounts specified in subsection (b) as in effect on November \n     30, 1995.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me, as chairman of \nthe Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, to summarize and comment briefly \non legislation to grant to recipients of VA compensation and dependency \nand indemnity compensation [DIC] benefits a cost of living adjustment \n[COLA] increase, effective on checks delivered to them at the first of \nthe year. This legislation is appropriate--even as we proceed this very \nweek to each final agreements with the House on reconciliation \nmeasures.\n  Mr. President, let me assure this body from the get-go that the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs will meet its reconciliation targets. \nIndeed, this legislation contains one provision--the so-called round-\ndown provision that I will explain in just a moment--which will help \nthe committee meet its targets. I give this assurance up front--just so \nall will be comfortable that this Senator has not suddenly gone soft \nand become a wild-eyed big spender. I surely have not. Even so, \nhowever, I believe that the recipients of veterans' compensation ought \nto receive a COLA--especially since we on the Veterans Committee have \nfound a proper way to reach our reconciliation targets, and get this \nNation on a path to a balanced budget, without denying such a COLA.\n  This bill, which was approved unanimously by the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs on September 20, 1995, is simple and straight-\nforward. It would grant to recipients of certain VA benefits--most \nnotably, veterans with service-connected disabilities, who receive VA \ncompensation, and the survivors of veterans who have died as a result \nof service-connected injuries or illnesses, who receive dependency and \nindemnity compensation or DIC--the same COLA that Social Security \nrecipients will receive. So, for example, if Social Security recipients \nreceive a 2.6-percent adjustment at the beginning of next year--as it \nappears they will--then so too would the beneficiaries of VA \ncompensation and DIC.\n  The bill would also do one other thing: It would modify the \nmethodology by which VA computes the amount of monthly benefit checks, \nas so adjusted. VA benefits, Mr. President, are paid in round-dollar \namounts. As a result, when a round-dollar benefit amount--say, as an \nexample, the current benefit of $260 per month going to a 30-percent \ndisabled veteran--is multiplied by a Consumer Product Index percentage \nof, say, 2.6 percent, it almost invariably yields a mathematical \nproduct that is not a round-dollar amount. In the case of a $260 \nbenefit check, for example, a 2.6-percent increase would yield a \nnonrounded number of $266.76.\n  VA practice, in the past, has been to round up fractional dollar \namounts of \n\n[[Page S 16938]]\n$0.50 or more, and round down fractional dollar amounts of $0.49 or \nless. So, in the above case, a 30-percent disabled veteran would get a \nmonthly check next year of $267 under past practice. This bill would \ndirect VA to round down next year in all cases, so, in the above \nexample, a 30-percent disabled veteran would get a monthly check of \n$266.\n\n  Some might say, ``What's the big deal?'' They might also say, ``Why \nis Simpson boring us with this green-eye-shade, accounting stuff?'' \nI'll tell you why: it is because this simple rounding-down provision--\nbecause it affects so many VA beneficiaries, but only to a degree which \nis painless to each--yields big money over time--big money--in terms of \nsavings and deficit reduction. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice [CBO], this simple provision will save the taxpayer $520 million \nover a 7-year period. I repeat: 520 million bucks. That's real money. \nReal money that benefits taxpayers collectively--and, I daresay, harms \nno individual VA beneficiary to the point that he or she will even miss \nthe loss.\n  This simple example of what can be done to balance the budget, Mr. \nPresident, ought to strengthen the resolve of each of us to get that \nvital job done. In the Veterans Committee, we have found ways to reduce \nthe growth of VA's mandatory budget accounts by over $6 billion in 7 \nyears--over 6 billion dollars--and no veterans are going to have to \nsuffer any inordinate harm. Despite the inaccurate, unfair, and \nunfounded pronouncements of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and \ndespite what veterans--and Senators--have heard from service \norganizations crying wolf, we will not be cutting off compensation \nbenefits to 10- and 20-percent disabled veterans. We will not be taxing \nor means-testing anyone's compensation benefits--though a good case for \ndoing just that can be made and, in fact, was made by a disabled \nveteran who is a member of this body, the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Kerry], in testimony before the committee. And we will \nnot be establishing a performance-of-duty standard now as a condition \nto receipt of disability compensation--though I can assure all that \nthis Senator continues to be interested in exploring that option at \nmuch greater length. We will, however, be making a huge dent in the \ndeficit.\n  As I stated when I opened this statement, I want all to understand \nthat we can give our disabled veterans, and their widows, a COLA and \nstill meet our deficit reduction targets. And we will do so. Please, \nall of you, keep this in mind when any person tries to tell you that \nthe Congress is going to ``balance the budget on the backs of the \nNation's veterans.'' It simply is not so. And no one--no one--has \nseriously suggested such a course. The Nation and the Congress have \nbeen good to our veterans. We will continue to be good to our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time that has been afforded me to \naddress this subject. I ask unanimous consent that at this point that \nCBO's cost estimate of S. 992, which is the text of the substitute \namendment with a minor technical adjustment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n     Washington, DC, October 25, 1995.\n     Hon.

Previous CBO estimate: On September 29, 1995, CBO \n     prepared a cost estimate for H.R. 2394 as ordered reported by \n     the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. That bill rounded \n     down the COLA for disability compensation and some DIC \n     recipients. It further reduced the COLA of other DIC \n     recipients.\n       11. Estimate prepared by: Mary Helen Petrus.\n       12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking minority member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass the pending \nlegislation, S. 992, the proposed Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, effective December 1, 1995, this bill would increase \nthe rates of compensation paid to veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation, or \nDIC, paid to the survivors of certain service-disabled veterans. The \nrates would increase by 2.6 percent, the same percentage as the \nincrease in Social Security and VA pension benefits for fiscal year \n1996.\n  Mr. President, there are 2.2 million service-disabled veterans and \nover 300,000 survivors who depend on these compensation programs. These \nindividuals have made enormous sacrifices on behalf of this Nation. As \nranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am \ncommitted to ensuring that these veterans and veterans' survivors \nreceive the benefits they deserve. I believe strongly that we have a \nfundamental obligation to meet the needs of those who became disabled \nas the result of military service, as well as the needs of their \nfamilies. This \n\n[[Page S 16939]]\nmeasure fulfills one of the most important aspects of that obligation.\n  Mr. President, ever since I began my career in public service, I have \nworked closely with the veterans of my home state of West Virginia, and \nnow, as ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nI have had the opportunity to work with veterans all across the \ncountry. Consequently, I am keenly aware of the fact that the \ncompensation payments that would be increased by this bill have a \nprofound effect on the everyday lives of the veterans and veterans' \nsurvivors who receive them. It is our responsibility to continue to \nprovide cost-of-living adjustments in compensation and DIC benefits in \norder to guarantee that the value of these essential, service-connected \nVA benefits is not eroded by inflation.\n  I am very proud that Congress consistently has fulfilled its \nobligation to make sure that the real value of these benefits is \npreserved by providing an annual COLA for compensation and DIC benefits \nevery fiscal year since 1976. Most recently, on October 25, 1994, \nCongress enacted Public Law 103-418, which provided for a 2.8-percent \nincrease in these benefits, effective December 1, 1994.\n  Mr. President, we cannot ever repay the debt we owe to the \nindividuals who have sacrificed so much for our country. Service-\ndisabled veterans and the survivors of those who died as the result of \nservice-connected conditions are reminded daily of the price they have \npaid for the freedom we all enjoy. The very least we can do is protect \nthe value of the benefits they have earned through their sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support this vitally \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time, passed as amended, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill appear at an appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2394), as amended, was deemed read the third time, \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16937-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.Res. 194) to authorize representation by \n     the Senate Legal Counsel.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, early next year, the substantive provisions \nof the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which, among other \nthings, creates procedures for judicial review of employment \ndiscrimination claims throughout the Congress, begin to take effect. \nAlthough the 1995 Act will govern all cases that arise after the \nrequirements of the new law takes effect, the Senate's process for \nreview of employment discrimination claims in Senate employment, which \nwas created by the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, continues to \ngovern older cases. Office of the U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms versus \nOffice of Senate Fair Employment Practices, now pending in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, is a case initiated \nunder the 1991 act.\n  The petitioner in this case is the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, \nwhich under the 1991 law is the employing office for Senate-paid \nmembers of the Capitol Police. The Office of the Sergeant at Arms seeks \nreview of a ruling of the Select Committee on Ethics, which affirmed a \ndecision of a hearing board appointed by the Director of the Office of \nSenate Fair Employment Practices. The Ethics Committee decision, which \nwas signed jointly by the chairman and vice chairman, held that there \nhad been a failure to reasonably accommodate a Capitol Police officer's \ndisabilities of alcoholism and depression in violation of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990, as incorporated into the Government Employee Rights Act.\n  Under the Government Employee Rights Act, a final decision of the \nEthics Committee is entered in the records of the Office of Senate Fair \nEmployment Practices, which is then named as the respondent if the \ndecision is challenged in the Federal Circuit. As petitions for review \nin the Federal circuit challenge final decisions of a Senate \nadjudicatory process, under the Government Employee Rights Act the \nSenate Legal Counsel may be directed to defend those decisions through \nrepresentation of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in \ncourt.\n  Accordingly, this resolution directs the Senate Legal Counsel to \nrepresent the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in the case \nof Office of U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms versus Office of Senate Fair \nEmployment Practices, in defense of the Ethics Committee's final \ndecision.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the resolution appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 194) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the outstanding life and military career of a veteran of the \nSecond World War: Retired Major General Lloyd Moses who currently \nresides in Vermillion, SD.\n  General Moses came from humble beginnings. He was born in 1904 on \nwhat was then the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in Fairfax, SD. His \nmother was half Sioux Indian. His father was a carpenter.\n  Despite not having a formal grade school education, General Moses \ngraduated from High School and the Black Hills Teachers College, and \nobtained a degree in Chemistry from the University of South Dakota.\n  General Moses enjoyed a long and illustrious military career. In \n1933, General Moses applied for Active Duty in the U.S. Army and was \npromoted to the rank of first lieutenant in 1935. During World War II, \nhe served as a battalion commander of the 75th Infantry Division and \nvolunteered to participate with the 507th Parachute Regiment, 17th \nAirborne Division in ``Operation Varsity,'' the airborne assault across \nthe Rhine River in 1945.\n  In the Korean War, General Moses commanded the 31st Infantry and in \n1955 was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In 1957, he was \npromoted to the rank of major general. General Moses reached the \npinnacle of his military career in 1960 when, following in the \nfootsteps of other generals such as George McClellan, Andrew Jackson, \nand Ulysses S. Grant, he became commanding general of the 5th U.S. \nArmy.\n  His military awards include the Distinguished Service Cross, the \nSilver Star for heroics in Korea, and the Distinguished Service Medal, \nthe Nation's highest peacetime military award. General Moses retired in \n1964 as the highest ranking South Dakotan ever to serve in the U.S. \nArmy.\n  General Moses remains committed to the promise of education. After \nretiring from the military, General Moses returned to the University of \nSouth Dakota and became the director of the Institute for American \nStudies.\n  As an enrolled member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, he spent the next \n10 years successfully expanding the curriculum of Native American \ncourses at the University in an effort to teach cultural awareness and \nencourage the continued education of Native American youth. When he \nretired in 1974, the enrollment of Native American students at the \nUniversity was at an all-time high, and the Institute for American \nStudies was rapidly becoming one of the foremost centers of oral \nhistory and tradition in the United States.\n  From such humble beginnings, General Lloyd Moses developed the \nleadership and education that helped our forces to victory in Europe \n50-years ago and has continued to assist our growth as a Nation. His \nstory is proof that great deeds can still come from hard work and a \nstrong mind. And that great men can still come from small places like \nFairfax, SD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16940-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16940-S16941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                WELFARE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not want to take a long time, but \nthere are a couple of matters I want to address, and I will do that at \nthis time. The first concerns a series of discussions that have been \nheld now over the last several days about reports relating to welfare \nreform.\n  A recent report discussed in this morning's Washington Post relating \nto a study undertaken by the Department of Health and Human Services \ncompares the welfare bills passed by the House and Senate and proposed \nby Senate Democrats. It examines the income distributional effects of \nthe Republican budget, and it estimates how many children will be put \ninto poverty by the various welfare plans.\n  The report uses two different definitions of poverty, the official \npoverty measure and an alternative. It is under the alternative, not \nthe official measure, that over 1 million children are put into \npoverty.\n  The report represents a range for the Democratic alternatives because \nthe Office of Management and Budget did not have the time to develop a \nfull model of the effects of that plan.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important to note that the 1.2 \nmillion figure is reached using an alternative definition of poverty \nnever before relied upon by the Federal Government.\n  When people say ``poverty,'' they usually mean the official poverty \nmeasure, which counts only a family's cash income such as AFDC and SSI \nand Social Security checks they receive.\n  Using the official measure of poverty, the Senate-passed bill would \nincrease the number of children in poverty from 15.5 million to about \n15.8 million, or an increase of 1.9 percent. Under the official poverty \nmeasure, the Senate Democratic alternative would not increase poverty \nat all.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. Under the official poverty \nmeasure, the measure that we have used for decades, the Senate \nDemocratic alternative would not increase poverty at all.\n  The alternative measure counts cash and in-kind income, such as food \nstamps and EITC, as well as AFDC, SSI, and Social Security, which \nexaggerates the poverty effect of the bill.\n  So while the numbers released concern me, I do not think that they \nought to argue that somehow we ought to turn our backs on welfare \nreform. We simply cannot keep the status quo. We need to restructure \nour welfare system. We need to require people on welfare to work, and \nbe responsible parents. We need to remember that the current system \nkeeps 9 million children in poverty. That is the status quo, Mr. \nPresident. Nine million children today live in poverty as a result of \nthe programs, the framework, and the institutions that we have in \nexistence.\n  I want to make a couple of more points with regard to the numbers.\n  First, we should note that the statement that the Senate bill will \nput 1.2 million more children in poverty is based on an alternative \ndefinition, and that definition has never been used before.\n  Second, and perhaps more importantly, more children will be put into \npoverty only if the welfare system that we are proposing fails.\n  So I believe that we need to recognize four points, Mr. President, as \nwe consider welfare reform.\n  First of all, the apples and oranges comparisons that the data makes \nis something that everybody ought to completely appreciate prior to the \ntime we come to any conclusion. The fact is, using official poverty \ndefinitions, the Senate-passed bill does not increase the level of \npoverty for children at all.\n  We can say, regardless of whether one uses the official or the new \nalternative definition of poverty, that the Democratic bill is vastly \nsuperior to the Senate-passed bill, and the Senate-passed bill is at \nleast four times superior than the House-passed bill.\n  So, as we have articulated all the way through this process, the Work \nFirst proposal that Democrats laid out that we debated, that we voted \nfor unanimously, is by far the best version of all.\n  Second, I think it ought to be emphasized that no one said that this \nwas the \n\n[[Page S 16941]]\nlast word on welfare reform. I do not know of a colleague on this side \nof the aisle who is content to say, all right, we have now done welfare \nreform, and there is nothing else to do. I think it is critical that \neveryone understand this is the first installment. This is the first \nopportunity for us to build a new infrastructure, to take what we have \ndone, to analyze it, to see how well the States work with it, and to \ncome up with ways in which to make it better in subsequent years. There \nis not one program that we have not done that with.\n  I submit that regardless of what happens on welfare, we are going to \nrevisit this issue again and again.\n  So it is critical, it seems to me, that everyone understand. We want \nto build a new system, and we do it one step at a time. What we have \nattempted to do with the Senate-passed bill, with the Democratic bill \nin particular, is to provide the foundation.\n  Third, I think it is fair to say that it is vastly superior to the \nstatus quo. That was what we said before. I think the study confirms \nthat it is better than the status quo now. What we have attempted to do \nis to improve upon the status quo, to create a new system, a new \ninfrastructure, an emphasis on work, trying to get people off of \nwelfare and into work, creating welfare opportunities in offices that \nwill become work opportunities once this legislation passes.\n  So we are not satisfied with the status quo. We need to build upon \nit. We recognize the importance of creating new opportunities to do \nthat. We do not want people on welfare. We want people to find new \nopportunities in work, in education, and in creating new lives. That is \nwhat this is designed to do.\n  Finally, I think it is very important that we know that much of what \nwe did a couple of months ago as we considered welfare reform we did \nwith an expectation that the other pieces of the safety net will still \nbe there, that we will have an earned income tax credit that makes work \npay, that we will do all we can to ensure kids are adequately cared for \nwith regard to their nutritional needs, that we ensure everyone has at \nleast a minimal amount of health care as a result of Medicare and \nMedicaid, that we do not gut the program today, to provide for \nmeaningful housing. That safety net, regardless of what we do in \nwelfare, is critical, if we indeed are concerned about not moving \npeople back into poverty.\n  So I would only reiterate that we are beginning a process that will \ntake some time to complete. We hope that we have created an opportunity \nfor a lot of people at long last to make work pay, to find new ways to \nensure that they will not be dependent upon welfare as they have in the \npast, recognizing that the status quo is unacceptable, and encouraging \nin as many ways as we can with new mechanisms so people can go out and \nfind the jobs and find the opportunities that we hope will be there as \na result of what we are attempting to do now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/09/senate-section/article/S16940-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16941-S16942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think it is important that I take just \na moment to describe something I guess I never thought I would have to \ndo, but I suppose it is important to set the record straight.\n  Somewhat baffling to me has been a debate over the public airwaves \nand in the press about what actually happened on the way to Israel. Did \nthe President come back and talk to the leadership? Did he express his \ndesire to work with the Republican leadership in an effort to resolve \nour outstanding differences? Senator Dole, Speaker Gingrich, Minority \nLeader Gephardt, myself, and others were on the airplane. The four of \nus were in a room that allowed us, I think, to safely say we know \nexactly what happened.\n  There is a contrast here that is very interesting to me. In my view, \nSenator Dole, our majority leader, has taken the high road in this \nwhole debate and has made it very clear that he is not going to become \ninvolved in it. I applaud him for taking that position. At least, as I \nunderstand it, that is his position. I have not heard him make any \npublic comment on it. Unfortunately, the Speaker, for whatever reason, \nhas chosen to make this an issue.\n  I can recall at least a half dozen occasions the President, during \nthat very brief trip, both coming and going, came back and talked to \nus, expressed a desire to work together to find ways in which to \nresolve our difficulties with the debt limit, with the continuing \nresolution, with reconciliation. He expressed a desire to get together. \nHe made the effort to suggest that whenever there was an understanding \nabout what the consensus was with regard to the debt limit and the \ncontinuing resolution, we would be ready to go to work.\n  I do not know what else he could have done, frankly. No one has ever \nfaulted the President for not being gregarious. He demonstrated that \nquality in spades on his way over and on the way back. I think he could \nprobably tell you from memory what books each one of us were reading. \nHe checked them all out, asked about them.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is a silly debate. I hope we get it \nbehind us. We have much more important things to talk about. But I do \nthink it is important to set the record straight for fear that somebody \nout there might have thought that during this entire trip there was no \ndialog, no discussion, no discourse on what we ought to do, no \nopportunities to talk about what we have attempted to do here today.\n  There was a great deal of opportunity. And the hallways work both \nways. I do not recall the Speaker making any effort to go to the head \nof the plane. If he was so concerned, if he wanted to speak with the \nPresident, I did not see any guard saying the Speaker is not allowed up \ninto the front section of the airplane.\n  But, again, it is silly. The issue is, can we put aside our \ndifferences and begin working in a meaningful way to accomplish what we \nknow we must against very difficult deadlines?\n  So I hope in good faith we can do that. We made an effort at that \ntoday, and I know we will again on Monday. I know the President cares \ndeeply about using every opportunity he has available to him to ensure \nthat the dialog is there, the opportunities for discussion are there, \nand the opportunities to resolve these outstanding differences be \ncreated whenever possible. He did that on the airplane going over. He \ndid that on the airplane going back. He will do it again next week. He \nwill do it whenever the situation arises.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The leader should understand that we are under a unanimous consent \norder to adjourn.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous-consent that following my statement, we do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this Saturday, November 11, America will \ncelebrate Veterans Day--the day we set aside to honor the men and women \nwho defend our country and preserve our peace and freedom.\n  Veterans Day was originally called Armistice Day. It was first \ncelebrated in 1919, to mark the end of a war that was to have ended all \nwars.\n  Two years later, the remains of four unknown American soldiers were \nbrought to a town square in a small French town. An American sergeant \nplaced a bouquet of white roses on one of the caskets, designating the \nAmerican Unknown Soldier of World War I.\n  The casket was brought across the Atlantic, and our Nation laid this \nhero to rest in Arlington National Cemetery on November 11, 1921.\n  Seventy-four years have now passed since that ceremony, and in that \ntime, thanks in part to the efforts of the citizens of Emporia, KS, \nArmistice Day became Veterans Day.\n  That change became necessary because, as we all know, the First World \nWar did not end all wars. Today, caskets bearing the remains of other \nUnknown Soldiers who fought in World War II, in Korea, and in Vietnam, \nnow rest in Arlington alongside countless other American heroes.\n  Mr. President, in the early days of World War II, Gen. George \nMarshall \n\n[[Page S 16942]]\nwas asked whether or not America had a secret weapon. And the General \nsaid, ``Just the best darned kids in the world.''\n  Those words were true then, and they have remained true throughout \nthis century. America has succeeded and democracy and freedom have \nflourished only because the best darned kids in the world were willing \nto risk their life for their country.\n  On Saturday, I hope all Americans will pause to remember those who \nstood boldly in harm's way, defending freedom and liberty around the \nworld.\n  As we remember those who served in the conflicts of yesterday, let us \nnot forget the men and women who fill the ranks of our Armed Forces \ntoday. They share with the veterans of past conflicts the same values \nof duty, courage, and sacrifice.\n  Today's All-Volunteer Force--Active and Reserve--stands ready to \ndefend our individual freedoms and our national ideals. At the same \ntime, they are asked to take on new, additional missions around the \nworld. As always, they complete each new mission with professionalism \nand excellence. They give us all reason to be proud.\n  Mr. President, veterans know better than anyone else the price of \nfreedom, for they have suffered the scars of war.
