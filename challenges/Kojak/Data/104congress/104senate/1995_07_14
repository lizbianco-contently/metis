Mr. President, I want to call to your attention an \neditorial which was in yesterday morning's Washington Post by Charles \nKrauthammer.\n  I think he best characterizes where we are today in terms of our \nNation's defense--in this editorial--more than anything I have read \nrecently. He talks about the problems that we have in our defense \nsystem.\n  I think several of us have been disturbed that this administration \nhas stripped our defenses down to the bone. We are operating now on a \nbudget that is about what it was in 1980 when we could not afford spare \nparts. There are several of us who believe that we could not fight two \nregional wars right now. We could not fight the Persian Gulf war as we \ndid.\n  This Nation has to rebuild its defense system. Charles Krauthammer \nstates three incontrovertible facts.\n  The first is, America is coming home. He points out that we are \nbringing from overseas our bases back to the mainland of the United \nStates. In 1960, we had 90 bases around the world. Today we have 17.\n  His second incontrovertible fact is that America cannot endure \ncasualties. If you look at what is happening on CNN with the coverage \non all of these humanitarian missions that are going on right now all \nover the world, we have more troops in more parts of the world right \nnow on missions that have nothing to do with our Nation's security. We \nsaw Captain O'Grady and how the entire Nation was watching him and \nhoping and praying for him. This is a concern that the entire Nation \nhas; that we have a very low tolerance of casualties. Yet we look at \nSomalia. We had 18 Rangers that were killed there. And I have a great \nfear for what can happen in Bosnia.\n  The third fact is that America's next war will be a surprise. I think \nwe all understand this. Certainly, Pearl Harbor was a surprise. The \ninvasion of South Korea was a surprise. The Falklands war was a \nsurprise. The next war will be a surprise, too.\n  To meet this criterion, what weapon, according to Charles \nKrauthammer, is the best one to do that? He says clearly it is to \nexpand the B-2 bomber program--the B-2 bomber program--because, No. 1, \nit has the range; No. 2, it is invisible; and, No. 3, it is immediate. \nIf you look at the Persian Gulf war, the F-117's, they had the \ninvisible characteristics of a stealth fighter. Over 2 percent, I \nthink, of the missions were flown by the F-117, and they got 40 percent \nof their targets. \n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that seven of the \ncurrently living former Secretaries of Defense agree with Charles \nKrauthammer that we need to expand the B-2 program, and I believe it, \ntoo.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial by Charles \nKrauthammer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 13, 1995]\n\n                    The B-2 and the ``Cheap Hawks''\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       We hear endless blather about how new and complicated the \n     post-Cold War world is. Hence the endless confusion about \n     what weapons to build, forces to deploy, contingency to \n     anticipate. But there are three simple, glaringly obvious \n     facts about this new era:\n       (1) America is coming home. The day of the overseas base is \n     over. In 1960, the United States had 90 major Air Force bases \n     overseas. Today, we have 17. Decolonization is one reason. \n     Newly emerging countries like the Philippines do not want the \n     kind of Big Brother domination that comes with facilities \n     like Clark Air Base and Subic Bay. The other reason has to do \n     with us: With the Soviets gone, we do not want the huge \n     expenses of maintaining a far-flung, global military \n     establishment.\n       (2) America cannot endure casualties. It is inconceivable \n     that the United States, or any other Western country, could \n     ever fight a war of attrition like Korea or Vietnam. One \n     reason is the CNN effect. TV brings home the reality of \n     battle with a graphic immediacy unprecedented in human \n     history. The other reason, as strategist Edward Luttwak has \n     pointed out, is demographic: Advanced industrial countries \n     have very small families, and small families are less willing \n     than the large families of the past to risk their only \n     children in combat.\n       (3) America's next war will be a surprise. Nothing new \n     here. Our last one was too. Who expected Saddam to invade \n     Kuwait? And even after he did, who really expected the United \n     States to send a half-million man expeditionary force to roll \n     him back? Then again who predicted Pearl Harbor, the invasion \n     of South Korea, the Falklands War?\n       What kind of weapon, then, is needed by a country that is \n     losing its foreign bases, is allergic to casualties and will \n     have little time to mobilize for tomorrow's unexpected \n     provocation?\n       Answer: A weapon that can be deployed at very long \n     distances from secure American bases, is invulnerable to \n     enemy counterattack and is deployable instantly. You would \n     want, in other words, the B-2 stealth bomber.\n       We have it. Yet, amazingly, Congress may be on the verge of \n     killing it. After more than $20 billion in development \n     costs--costs irrecoverable whether we build another B-2 or \n     not--the B-2 is facing a series of crucial votes in Congress \n     that could dismantle its assembly lines once and for all.\n       The B-2 is not a partisan project. Its development was \n     begun under Jimmy Carter. And, as an urgent letter to \n     President Clinton makes clear, it is today supported by seven \n     secretaries of defense representing every administration \n     going back to 1969.\n       They support it because it is the perfect weapon for the \n     post-Cold War world. It has a range of about 7,000 miles. It \n     can be launched instantly--no need to beg foreign dictators \n     for base rights; no need for weeks of advance warning, \n     mobilization and forward deployment of troops. And because it \n     is invisible to enemy detection, its two pilots are virtually \n     invulnerable.\n       This is especially important in view of the B-2's very high \n     cost, perhaps three-quarters to a billion dollars a copy. The \n     cost is, of course, what has turned swing Republican votes--\n     the so-called ``cheap hawks''--against the B-2.\n       But the dollar cost of a weapon is too narrow a calculation \n     of its utility. The more important calculation is cost in \n     American lives. The reasons are not sentimental but \n     practical. Weapons cheap in dollars but costly in lives are, \n     in the current and coming environment, literally useless: We \n     will not use them. A country that so values the life of every \n     Capt. O'Grady is a country that cannot keep blindly relying \n     on non-stealthy aircraft over enemy territory.\n       Stealth planes are not just invulnerable themselves. \n     Because they do not need escort, they spare the lives of the \n     pilots of the fighters and radar suppression planes that \n     ordinarily accompany bombers. Moreover, if the B-2 is killed, \n     we are stuck with our fleet of B-52's of 1950s origin. \n     According to the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, \n     the Clinton administration assumes the United States will \n     rely on B-52s until the year 2030--when they will be 65 years \n     old!\n       In the Persian Gulf War, the stealthy F-117 fighter flew \n     only 2 percent of the missions but hit 40 percent of the \n     targets. It was, in effect, about 30 times as productive as \n     non-stealthy planes. The F-117, however, has a short range \n     and thus must be deployed from forward bases. The B-2 can \n     take off from home. Moreover, the B-2 carries about eight \n     times the payload of the F-117. Which means that one B-2 can \n     strike, without escort and with impunity, as many targets as \n     vast fleets of conventional aircraft. Factor in these costs, \n     and the B-2 becomes cost-effective even in dollar terms.\n       The final truth of the post-Cold War world is that someday \n     someone is going to attack some safe haven we feel compelled \n     to defend, or invade a country whose security is important to \n     us, or build an underground nuclear bomb factory that \n     threatens to kill millions of Americans. We are going to want \n     a way to attack instantly, massively and invisibly. We have \n     the weapon to do it, a weapon that no one else has and that \n     no one can stop. Except a ``cheap hawk,'' shortsighted \n     Republican Congress.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9945-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9946-S9971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 343, the regulatory reform \nbill, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 343) to reform the regulatory process, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 1487, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Domenici amendment No. 1533 (to amendment No. 1487), to \n     facilitate small business involvement in the regulatory \n     development process.\n       Hutchison amendment No. 1539 (to amendment No. 1487), to \n     protect against the unfair imposition of civil or criminal \n     penalties for the alleged violation of rules.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio [Mr. Glenn] is recognized to speak for up to 45 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot the last few days about horror \nstories of regulations, horror stories about Government's heavy hand \nand how civil servants that serve this country well most of the time \nsometimes get carried away with the program and throw their Federal \nregulatory weight around to the point where it really is intrusive in \nthe lives of our citizens and do some things that just defy common \nsense.\n  I am not going to be the last one to stand here today and say that \nnever happens. I think when we rise on the floor here and make repeated \nremarks and make repeated examples of things that are not of obvious \ntruthfulness, that we do a disservice. So some of the things that have \nbeen said here on the floor in the last few days I want to spend some \ntime this morning correcting.\n  Let me say I feel strongly about this for our people that work in \ncivil service for this Nation. For the last 8 years until last fall I \nwas chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. One of our areas of \noversight, our areas of jurisdiction, is the civil service of this \ncountry. We work very closely with them. We have representatives of \ncivil service groups that come in and talk to us on a regular basis. We \nkeep in touch with them on almost a daily basis with staff. We work to \nget them better pay and working conditions and so on.\n  So, we work with the people of OPM, the Office of Personnel \nManagement, to make sure that the people in civil service are treated \nfairly. Many of them are very talented people who serve the Government \nand who could be doing better outside. They have every bit of the same \ndedication for their country as we have right here, and they feel \nstrongly. It hurts them when they are unfairly castigated, unfairly \npointed out as doing things that are wrong in administering the laws of \nthis land.\n  So I wanted to correct some of the things that have been said. I know \nmy distinguished colleague from Utah pointed out that he has his daily \n10 transgressions in the area of misuse of rules and regulations. I \nsort of overlooked these things until they started being picked up and \npublished in some of our papers in Ohio.\n  So I think I have it as a duty to correct some of these things. We \nhave asked the administration downtown to look into some of these \nthings. Some of the information I have puts a little different slant on \nsome of these things. I want to run through a few of these this morning \nbecause I think it is important to protect the reputation, protect the \nfeelings--if you want to put it on that basis also--of people who work \n\n[[Page S9947]]\nvery hard in the civil service. I want to correct some of these things.\n  It was said the other day on the floor--I believe it was No. 10 on \nthe list for that particular day--that the Federal Government was \n``delaying a Head Start facility for years because of the dimensions of \nthe rooms.''\n  The reality of the situation was that this is misleading because it \nwas not due to Federal regulations at all. And I would add that S. 343, \nthe Dole-Johnston bill, would do nothing in any way to solve this \nproblem.\n  The fact is that Head Start regulations do not address room \ndimensions. Head Start applies reasonable and flexible standards to its \nfacilities, and over the past 6 years these flexible standards have \nallowed Head Start to develop thousands of new facilities.\n  The example that was given by my distinguished colleague was due to a \nlegal dispute between a subcontractor and the city of New York. It had \nnothing to do with Federal regulations. If such legal disputes are the \nproblem, then I think we should question support of what some describe \nS. 343 as--a lawyers' full employment act of 1995.\n  Now, another one was put out which turns out to be a myth also. The \nclaim was that the Federal Government was:\n\n       Forcing a man to choose between his religion and his job \n     because rules do not allow workers to wear a mask over a \n     beard.\n\n  The reality. This is flat wrong. OSHA knows of no cases in which a \nemployer received a citation because their employees were not wearing \nproperly fitting respirators because their workers wore beards for \nreligious reasons. In fact, OSHA regularly grants exemptions for \nprotective gear requirements for employees who object due to ``personal \nreligious convictions.''\n  Now, the general rule of respiratory protection is for the protection \nof the people involved, but obviously if a person has a beard for a \nreligious purpose or whatever, they try to take care of that. They do \nnot insist that a person be cited in a situation like that. They give \nan exemption for that. And that is their policy.\n  Another one was cited that morning. It was No. 7 that particular \nmorning on the list of items of ridiculous regulations. I quote:\n\n       Fining a gas station owner $10,000 for not displaying a \n     sign stating that he accepts motor oil for recycling.\n\n  The reality. There is no such Federal regulation. EPA does not \nrequire gas stations to post signs stating that they accept used motor \noil. There is no Federal RCRA regulation requiring the posting of such \na sign. RCRA does require gas station owners just to label tanks used \nto store recycled oil, but that is to prevent contamination of stored, \nused motor oil with other solvents or other contaminants. So there was \nno regulation on a sign that would accept motor oil for recycling.\n  Another one stated that same morning. This was No. 3, I believe, on \nthe list:\n\n       Prohibiting an elderly woman from planting a bed of roses \n     on her land.\n\n  The reality. There is no current regulation which could prohibit \nplanting a rose bed. This allegation is one that keeps cropping up all \nthe time, it turns out. I was not aware of this, but they say this is \none that comes around from time to time--it has been around for years--\nin Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. It has \nbeen recycled for years, and the State in which this is alleged to have \noccurred has varied with the telling of the story. In some cases it has \nbeen Wyoming, in others it has been Texas or Louisiana. So they have \nheard this over at the agency for a long time.\n  Whenever it surfaces, EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers attempts to \ntrack down the specific situation, so every time this rumor comes up \nthey go at it again to make sure they have not missed something. And \nsince the name of this supposed elderly woman has never surfaced, it \nhas been very difficult to verify it. It involves checking with \nmultiple field offices of various Federal agencies. Despite these \nnumerous checks, there never has been any wetlands case identified that \ninvolved anyone planting a rose bush. So that one has been around for \nyears.\n  Another one. This was cited as No. 2 the morning this particular one \nwas given. It said, and I quote:\n\n       Fining a man $4,000 for not letting a grizzly bear kill \n     him.\n\n  Well, the reality is it simply is not true. This story was circulated \nin a Wall Street Journal editorial on June 23, 1993. The story painted \na portrait that would have flattered a Hollywood screen writer and \nmischaracterized the real facts as much as they were misrepresented on \nthe floor.\n  A rancher was fined $4,000 for shooting a grizzly bear which is \nlisted as an endangered species, but he shot him because it had killed \nand eaten some of the rancher's sheep.\n  Now, the fact is the bear did not attack or threaten the rancher or \nanyone in his family. Indeed, it is certainly not illegal to kill an \nendangered species when a human life is threatened.\n  The rancher in this case was fined because he killed an endangered \nspecies for killing the sheep--listen to this--after he was financially \ncompensated for the loss of his sheep, after he was assured that he \nwould be compensated for any further losses, and after he declined the \nState of Montana's offer to build an electric fence to protect the \nsheep and after he was informed that if he killed the bear anyway he \nwould be prosecuted.\n  We do not have too many bears in my home State of Ohio, so I guess we \nare not going to be coming under some of these same problems, but to \nthe western States that is an important one.\n  Another one. And this was No. 1 on the hit list the other day on the \nfloor. It says:\n\n       Requiring braille instructions on drive-through ATM \n     machines.\n\n  Well, according to the American Bankers Association,\n\n       It is entirely conceivable and not unexpected that a \n     passenger may exit the automobile to use the drive-up ATM and \n     this passenger may be an individual who is visually impaired.\n\n  So when no other machines on the premises are available, this is an \nentirely rational regulation. It recognizes the need for these machines \nfor passengers and walkup users both.\n  Now, there was another one on one of the other days here. These lists \nthat my colleague from Utah has put out have been I think two mornings \nI know of, maybe three mornings but two mornings for sure. So this was \nNo. 10 on the list as we counted David Letterman style on the floor on \nanother morning. It was said that we stopped an owner from building on \na wetland of 0.006 acres, about the size of a Ping-Pong table.\n  Well, the reality of the situation when it was checked is this. The \napplicant proposed to place 30 cubic yards of fill material in a creek \nand EPA received objections to the proposed project from local property \nowners. The local property owners themselves complained about this. And \nthe applicant was unwilling to reduce the size of the fill, was \nunwilling to move the proposed building 25 feet to avoid dumping fill \nmaterial in the creek. The applicant then attempted to obtain a waiver \nfrom the local city to its requirements, not Federal but to its \nrequirement of a 25-foot buffer zone. The applicant evidently obtained \na waiver of some sort from the city and did not need to dump fill \nmaterial in the creek. Those are the facts of the situation.\n  Another one that day. I think this was No. 7 on the list. I quote:\n\n       Fined a company for not having a comprehensive hazardous \n     materials communication plan for its employees even though \n     the company only has two part-time employees.\n\n  Well, the reality of the situation is that OSHA does not require a \n``comprehensive hazardous materials communication plan.'' It does have \na right to know standard or a hazardous communications standard that \nprotects employees when they are working with potentially toxic \nsubstances. And that is common sense. The simple right to know \nprinciple would have made a difference, for instance, for a nursing \nhome maintenance worker who unknowingly--he had not been told about \nthis so he did not know what the hazardous materials were--unknowingly \nmixed bleach and common lime remover in a bucket and was killed by the \nresulting toxic gas.\n  Another one was pointed out as a Federal transgression on \nadministration of regulations. This was another one on the list that \nsame day, No. 6.\n\n       Required a $6 hospital mask instead of a $1.25 mask with no \n     analysis of the benefits and costs.\n\n  Well, what is the reality of this one? This one is slightly more \ncomplicated. In the last 10 years, the rate of new \n\n[[Page S9948]]\ncases of tuberculosis has increased by 23 percent, reversing a 30-year \ndownward trend. Outbreaks have occurred in hospitals in Atlanta, Miami, \nand New York City. In 1993, OSHA released its guidelines for protecting \nworkers from exposure to TB.\n  That means they are going to be in where the TB patients are.\n\n       The OSHA guidelines are based on a document issued by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1990. The CDC \n     guidelines recommend employees wear NIOSH-approved high-\n     efficiency particulate air respirators as a minimum level of \n     protection.\n       In 1993, OSHA was petitioned to protect workers against \n     contracting TB in certain workplaces. When the proposed rule \n     is published--\n\n  It is not finalized.\n\n     when the proposed rule is published, it will include a \n     preliminary risk assessment, a cost of compliance analysis, \n     an analysis of effective indices, and the evaluation of the \n     rule's benefits. Through these analyses, OSHA will then \n     determine which type of mask would adequately protect workers \n     from TB.\n\n  Another one pointed out as the heavy hand of Federal regulation that \nday:\n\n       Required such stringent water testing that local government \n     considered handing out bottled water to save money.\n\n  The reality is this. EPA has recognized the high cost of water \ntesting for some small communities can be a serious problem, \nparticularly if water supplies are contaminated and need treatment. EPA \nhas been working for several years to assist States in implementing \nscience-based programs of waivers from monitoring requirements while \nstill assuring the safety of water supplies.\n  Most States now have waiver programs, but they are not always \nactively used. But for the vast majority of Americans, drinking water \nsafety monitoring inspection is inexpensive and effective. Costs range \nfrom 1 cent to 9 cents a month for 90 percent of U.S. households, far \nless than the cost of bottled water, as was pointed out.\n  I will also point out that President Clinton specifically asked EPA \non March 16 of this year to undertake revision of water testing to \nensure water safety at a reasonable cost. EPA has subsequently met with \nofficials from 19 States that are developing a new approach to \nstreamline the drinking water monitoring.\n  Ironically, I will point out, the Dole bill, S. 343, might delay \nimplementation of many of these streamlining rules. It could delay \nsolving the problem rather than help out.\n  Another one pointed out that day as a regulatory misfire, No. 1--\ncounting down 10 to 1 like David Letterman does:\n\n       A company was fined $34,000 by the EPA for failing to fill \n     out form R, even though they did not release any toxic \n     material.\n\n  EPA could find no record of any case exactly like this. We think \nthere may be some because the dollar figure is similar, but there is no \nrecord of a case like that. EPA is seeking penalties of $34,000 against \ntwo companies that did release potentially harmful chemicals.\n  Two companies, Washington Ornamental Iron Works and Thatcher Tubes, \nwere fined for failure to report air emissions to EPA's toxics release \ninventory, as required by section 313 of the Emergency Planning and \nCommunity Right To Know Act.\n  The principle behind this statute is that citizens in a community \nhave a right to know what chemicals are being released into their \ncommunities, what chemicals their children are breathing, what \nchemicals they themselves are breathing, when these releases take place \nand in what quantity.\n  Washington Ornamental Iron Works of Gardenia, CA, was fined $34,000 \nfor failure to report for the years 1990 and 1991. In 1990, the iron \nworks released 14,000 pounds of trichloroethylene. In 1991, the iron \nworks released 12,000 pounds of the same material. They finally came \ninto compliance in June 1995 after receiving a civil administrative \ncomplaint from EPA.\n  Why is this important? At high levels of exposure, this kind of \ntrichloroethylene causes central nervous system disorders, irregular \nheart rate, and pulmonary edema. Production of this solvent is \nscheduled to be phased out by the year 2002 because of its ozone-\ndepleting characteristics also.\n  I think in a case like that, the fine was well justified. I do not \nknow about form R--nobody knows what happened on form R. That is one \ncase where the $34,000 fits, and I think justly.\n  Another one happened to also involve a $34,000 fine. Thatcher Tubes \nof Muscatine, IA, was fined $34,000 for failure to report the company \nemitted 7,300 pounds of methylethylketone in 1991 and 8,783 pounds of \nthe same chemical in 1992. Methylethylketone is irritating to the eyes, \nmucous membranes, and the skin. Headache and throat irritations are \nreported among people exposed to the concentration near the maximum \nlevel allowed in the workplace. At higher levels, workers complained of \nnumbness in the fingers and arms, sometimes a leg. Dermatitis was \nsometimes reported following prolonged exposure to vapors.\n  Those are two EPA could find where the $34,000 figure fit. I think \nanybody could look at these things and say, ``Good, let us applaud the \nEPA for what they did for protecting all of us and for the people in \nthose particular communities in those cases.''\n  Here is another one. No. 7 on the list the particular day it was \ngiven on the floor.\n\n       Nevada rancher, Wayne Hague, faces a potential 5-year \n     prison sentence under the Clean Water Act by hiring someone \n     to clear scrub brush from irrigation ditches on his property. \n     The ditches have been used since the turn of the century.\n\n  Facts of the case, back to reality again: Virtually every part of \nthis statement is false. The case did not even involve violations of \nthe Clean Water Act. The scrub brush, as it is called, consisted of \nover 100 pinion pines and juniper trees in the Toiyabe National Forest \nin Nevada. He claimed his property was actually on Federal property. \nMr. Hague's actions constituted an unauthorized destruction of Federal \nproperty in violation of Federal criminal law.\n  Another one: Fish and Wildlife Service required a farmer to stop \neconomic activities on his 1,000 acres because of the presence of the \nred-cockaded woodpecker. The reality is this is just factually \nincorrect. This example refers, we believe, to Mr. Cohen, a timberland \nowner of North Carolina who owns far more than 1,000 acres of land, but \nprivate property owners, like Mr. Cohen have the opportunity to develop \na habitat conservation plan that allows them to both protect the \nendangered species and to use their land productively.\n  Many organizations and developers are participating in such plans to \nprotect the woodpecker. Mr. Cohen has submitted a management plan to \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and it has been approved and he is \nlogging his land in a productive way that does not destroy the \nendangered species.\n  Another one which was myth No. 3 on the day that it was stated:\n\n       OSHA fined a company $500 for failure to submit a report \n     that no employee was hurt last year.\n\n  This is something that was a problem, but the problem has already \nbeen fixed. This is no longer a problem. OSHA is committed to injecting \ncommon sense into the enforcement process when an employer has an \neffective health and safety program but fails to meet the exact letter \nof the law, such as failure to fully complete or sign the annual form. \nThat well-meaning employer is treated differently.\n  Over the last year, OSHA citations for these recordkeeping \nrequirements have declined by between 60 and 70 percent. It reflects \nOSHA's new emphasis in this administration on compliance with the \nspirit rather than simply the letter of the law. OSHA will continue to \nissue citations when employers clearly disregard their obligation to \nmaintain records of work-related injuries and illnesses. It is \nimportant that OSHA continue to provide employees with the message that \ncomplete and accurate occupational injury records are of paramount \nimportance. Records of workplace illnesses provide employers and \nworkers information that can help them identify hazards and prevent \ninjuries and illnesses in the future.\n  Mr. President, those are just a few of the responses. We could not \nget the complete answers to all of the things that were charged on the \nfloor. I think we see there is a lot of myths going around here. I \nwanted to make sure the reality of these situations was also brought to \nlight today. I hope that we will have better substantiation of any \ncharges in the future because it reflects poorly on the Federal \nemployees, those in civil service who are trying to administer the law \nand do it fairly and \n\n[[Page S9949]]\ncorrectly, not only adhering to the letter of the law but also doing it \nin a fair manner so that people do not have undue problems with the \nFederal Government.\n  I am the last one to say there are not a lot of problems. I have been \nadvocating regulatory reform for years in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. We have a bill, S. 1001, which we think does a better job of \nbalancing the requirements for protecting the public while not \noverburdening people with rules and regulations.\n  Let me go on to another one stated on the floor also. The \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa has been on the floor for 2 days when I \nwas on the floor, at least, and has repeated this one story in \nparticular that I wanted to address today, because it disturbed me \nenough the first day that, if it were true, I really wanted to look \ninto it. His description of it was very, very graphic. He talked about \nMr. Higman in Akron, IA, and how some 40 agents of the Federal \nGovernment--EPA I believe it was stated--came rushing into this \nestablishment with their guns cocked, pointing at everybody, \nparticularly the accountant, as I recall, and that this whole thing \ncost Mr. Higman about $200,000 in court costs, all because a \ndisgruntled employee gave false information about pollutants, toxic \nmaterials at this business site.\n  Well, I was very curious about this because I thought if there was \nthat kind of egregious behavior going on around the country without due \ncause, we should be looking into it and maybe we should have a hearing \non this. I did not know. So we looked into it. It turns out that a \nletter was sent to Senator Grassley on August 18, 1993. I would like to \nread you selected parts of this because it puts a little different \nlight on this incident about these people rushing in with guns cocked, \npointing at people in Mr. Higman's establishment in Akron, IA.\n  The special agents that I am quoting comes in part from the letter \nfrom EPA to Senator Grassley. This person was asked by Administrator \nBrowner to respond to Senator Grassley's letter, I gather, of July 1, \n1993, concerning a criminal enforcement action taken in 1991 against \nthe Higman Sand & Gravel Co. in Akron, IA. I am pleased to be able to \nrespond. Special agents of EPA's criminal investigation division \nconducted a search at the Higman site pursuant to a Federal search \nwarrant authorized by a Federal magistrate and approved by a U.S. \nattorney. This was not something where people decided willy-nilly to \ncome rushing in. The search warrant was authorized by a Federal \nmagistrate, approved by a U.S. attorney.\n  The affidavit for the search warrant was based on information from, \nthey thought, a confidential, reliable informant that hazardous waste \nwas being stored at the site. The Higman Co. is not a permitted \nfacility to store hazardous waste. It does not have the proper \nfacilities.\n  Information was also received from another Federal law enforcement \nagency that searches of the homes of some of the Higman employees had \nrecovered machine guns and explosives and that the agents conducting \nthe search at the Higman Co. site might encounter armed individuals and \nexplosives. An informant advised the agents that a loaded rifle was \nalways kept in the office at the Higman Co.\n  Based on this information, 17 law enforcement officials from the EPA, \nATF, and the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigations participated in \nthe execution of the search warrant at the Higman Co. There were not \n40. This says 17, which is certainly enough; there were 10 employees at \nthe company when the search was conducted. The agents recovered loaded \nweapons from the site, and the hazardous waste specified in the search \nwarrant was found on the grounds of the company.\n  So the material was there. They were not authorized to have it there. \nThe reason they were not permitted to have it there was because it \nmight be a danger. What was it, cyanide? I do not know. What can you \nstore that is a danger to other people around the community? These \nthings have to have special storage, and this was not a site that was \npermitted to have this toxic material.\n  Now, this went to trial. I believe the Senator stated on the floor \nthat Mr. Higman's court costs were somewhere around $200,000. Now, a \njury acquitted defendants Harold Higman, Jr., and Harold Higman, Sr., \nand Higman Sand & Gravel Co. in this case. The jurors were polled after \nthe trial and stated they knew the Higman Co. was not a permitted \nfacility and that the material recovered was in fact hazardous waste. \nHowever, they did not believe the Government proved that the hazardous \nwaste was stored at the site knowingly.\n  So the difference here is that everything that led the agents to come \nin there in the first place was true. There were loaded weapons. They \nfound those on the site. The toxic material was there on the site. So \nall the reasons why they took the precautions and acted as they did and \ngot approval from a Federal magistrate and a U.S. attorney, were \nverified with exactly what happened once they got into that community. \nEPA special agents are thoroughly trained in the use of force, and they \nexercise the use of force with great discretion, with the \nconstitutional rights of affected citizens in mind. They take \nprecautions in this area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in its entirety \nin the Record so people can make their own judgments on that.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 18, 1993.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Administrator Carol Browner has \n     asked me to respond to your letter of July 1, 1993, \n     concerning a criminal enforcement action taken in 1991 \n     against the Higman Sand and Gravel Company in Akron, Iowa. I \n     am pleased to be able to respond to your letter.\n       Special agents of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division \n     conducted a search at the Higman site pursuant to a federal \n     search warrant authorized by a Federal Magistrate and \n     approved by a U.S. Attorney. The affidavit for the search \n     warrant was based on information from a confidential reliable \n     informant that hazardous waste was being stored at the site. \n     The Higman Company is not a permitted facility to store \n     hazardous waste.\n       Information was also received from another federal law \n     enforcement agency that searches of the homes of some Higman \n     employees had recovered machine guns and explosives and that \n     the agents conducting the search at the Higman Company site \n     might encounter armed individuals and explosives. An \n     informant advised our agents that a loaded rifle was always \n     kept in the office at the Higman Company.\n       Based on this information, seventeen law enforcement \n     officials from the EPA, ATF, and the Iowa Department of \n     Criminal Investigations participated in the execution of the \n     search warrant at the Higman Company. There were ten \n     employees at the company when the search was conducted. The \n     agents recovered loaded weapons from the site and the \n     hazardous waste specified in the search warrant was found on \n     the grounds of the company.\n       A jury acquitted defendants Harold Higman, Sr., Harold \n     Higman, Jr., and Higman Sand & Gravel Company in this case. \n     The jurors were polled after the trial and stated that they \n     knew the Higman Company was not a permitted facility and that \n     the material recovered was in fact hazardous waste, however, \n     they did not believe the government proved that the hazardous \n     waste was stored at the site ``knowingly.''\n       EPA special agents are thoroughly trained in the use of \n     force. They exercise the use of force with great discretion \n     and always with the constitutional rights of affected \n     citizens in mind. Our special agents are also trained to be \n     concerned for their own safety and the safety of others when \n     entering potentially dangerous surroundings. Special agents \n     must weigh and balance all these considerations when \n     executing a search warrant. The recent events in Waco, Texas \n     are a chilling reminder of the very real dangers federal \n     agents face in the performance of their law enforcement \n     duties.\n       Although I favor an enforcement process without unnecessary \n     confrontation, I would not presume to second-guess the \n     judgment of those special agents who were responsible for the \n     execution of a Federal search warrant for alleged criminal \n     violations of Federal laws. While this Administration is \n     dedicated to the establishment of an improved relationship \n     between the EPA and the business community it regulates, and \n     would always prefer to achieve environmental protection \n     through voluntary compliance, this Agency is also charged \n     with the congressional mandate to aggressively enforce \n     against violators of the environmental laws. The Agency's \n     execution of its enforcement responsibilities is always \n     guided by the particular circumstances surrounding each \n     individual case, exercising the best judgment with the \n     information available.\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\n       I hope this responds to the specific concerns raised in \n     your letter. If you wish to discuss your concerns further, \n     please let me know so I can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Steven A. Herman,\n                                          Assistant Administrator.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Another one brought up on the floor also was that in the \nJuly 11 Congressional Record, there was an extended statement about how \nEPA's air permitting program is causing a lot of redtape for the grain \nelevators in the State of Iowa. This has been a problem, I know that. \nBut I think the statement is misleading in that EPA is aware that small \ngrain elevators operate only on a seasonal basis. They have been \nworking with the Feed and Grain Association to get the facts about the \namounts of small particle pollutant emissions that might be expected \nfrom these sources. They responded to Senator Grassley's concerns in \nthis regard. I am glad they have done so.\n  The main points I summarize as follows. EPA's air permitting program \nprovides for a 2-year transition period during which small sources such \nas some grain elevators can avoid the need to get a Clean Air Act \npermit and maintaining records sufficient to document their low-level \nemissions. EPA is working with the Feed and Grain Association to \nidentify more realistic assumptions on the amount of time an elevator \ncan operate. They recognize that small grain elevators only operate on \na seasonal basis, not year around. They are participating in an \nindustry-sponsored source-testing effort aimed at the emissions factor, \nwhich is the estimate of how much small particle pollution is emitted \nper unit of grain processes. It is industry sponsored, and EPA is \nworking right along with them on this.\n  So those efforts, while not completed yet--I grant that--should help \nclarify which, if any, grain elevators should be considered a major \nsource of emission and subject to air permitting requirements.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the things that have come up \nhere on the floor. I did not try to make the complete 100-percent \nrebuttal to all of the things said here on the floor because some of \nthese may very well be cases where there were onerous oversteps made by \nFederal agents in the enforcement of laws. But I also state again what \nI have stated before.\n  If we want to see the difficulty with regulation, I think most of us \nin the Senate need only look in the mirror when we get up in the \nmorning. Eighty percent of the regulations are required by law and \npassed in the Congress. We pass laws here with the House, back and \nforth, it goes to the President and is signed, and they implement the \nlaws and regulations. Eighty percent of what they write there are \nregulations written pursuant to what we require right here.\n  So if we want to see one of the biggest problems with regulators, we \nbetter just look in the mirror in the morning.\n  We have another problem here. What we are requiring with the proposed \nlegislation, S. 343, there are going to be an awful lot of checks, an \nawful lot of requirements for regulations.\n  I had an example here of just one under the Clean Water Act. I will \nnot go through all the details, as I have done the last couple days on \nthe floor here.\n  This one regulation passed, implemented, just one out of several \nhundred under the Clean Water Act, just one requires 126 feet of shelf \nspace. We checked with the Capitol Architect. I can tell Members what \nthat is--three piles of documents from this well to the ceiling up \nthere. That is 42\\1/2\\ feet, the Architect says. Mr. President, three \npiles of documents.\n  The average cost, we are told by testimony in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, was about $700,000 per regulation, that is \nnecessary. I am not one that says we cut back on that. If we are going \nto have a regulation, we should do it right and make sure the \napplication is absolutely correct.\n  In the time I have remaining, I would like to point out, also, that \nthese regulations are not all just dreamed up by some Government \nbureaucrat. Mr. President, 80 percent of them are required by what we \nrequire here on the floor, in the laws that we pass.\n  We are the ones requiring them. I think all the cost analysis that we \nare now putting over there and requiring on the agencies by this \nlegislation, we should apply to ourselves, right here, when we are \nconsidering passing a law. Why do we not do the cost studies, not pass \nsomething unless we do the cost studies, not put it over there, require \nall sorts of studies, and say it is too expensive?\n  Now we provide a capability for legislative review. We call it so we \ncan bring a rule back, redo it here, after they have done it over \nthere. We should be correcting that in the first instance, right here.\n  Let me run through just a few of the things, regulations that have \nsaved lives. Toy safety. Small parts on children's toys. We estimate 12 \nchoking deaths are related to such small parts annually. Should we not \nprotect our children against that, if we can? If we can just have some \nregulations that help establish the right procedures on that? Of \ncourse.\n  Child resistant cigarette lighters. The Consumer Safety Commission \nissued a safety standard in 1993 that established a requirement to make \ndisposable cigarette lighters child resistant. Fires started by \nchildren under age 5 cause an estimated average of 150 deaths, \napproximately 1,100 injuries, nearly $70 million in property damage.\n  Can we not do better than that? I think we can. That is what they \nhave done. These are regulations that save lives every year. All \nregulations are not goofy. All regulations are not something just \ndreamed up by some bureaucrat and misadministered or maladministered.\n  Poison prevention safety closures. They estimate that packaging for \nproducts like aspirin or turpentine making them child resistant saved \nover 700 lives per year. Ban on bean bag cushions. Where they had \nproblems with these things, deaths occurred when a pocket was created \nin a cushion that could trap an infant's exhaled carbon dioxide and the \ninfant could not breathe properly. Had regulations on that that saved \nlives.\n  Child-resistant packaging for mouthwash. Very simple things like \nthat, but they save lives. Fireworks requirements. Safe cribs. \nFlammable children's sleepwear. Power mowers. Are these things that are \njust dreamed up? No, most of these things, I would say, are required by \nlegislation we passed here. Most of these things are implemented over \nin the agencies because we required them to be implemented with the \nlegislation that we passed here.\n  Automatic residential garage door openers. Hit that thing and it \ncomes down. Well, if a child happens to get under it, and the report \nindicates that some 54 children between the ages of 2 and 14 had died \nafter being trapped under such garage doors. Died. Is it wrong to say \nthat it has to have a safety device on it? Equipment manufacturers, \nafter January 1, 1993, provide features to minimize the likelihood that \na child would be trapped and killed by a garage door.\n  We have more regulations on lead poisoning, and brown lung disease \nregarding the textile workers. In 1978 there were an estimated 40,000 \ncases of brown lung--also byssinosis--but in 1985 the prevalence of the \ndisease declined to about 900 cases, or less than 1 percent of cotton \ntextile workers.\n  There is evidence that complying with OSHA's cost dust standard \nincreased productivity in the textile industry. A 1980 article in the \nEconomist reported that a tighter dust control measure required by \nOSHA's rule prompted firms to replace outdated machinery with newer, \nmore efficient systems, and they were more productive after they did \nthat.\n  Exposure to HIV and hepatitis B.--rules were put out to protect \nworkers who routinely were exposed to blood or other infectious \nmaterial. Saved lives.\n  Mine explosions and fires. Safety requirements there have been very \neffective. In my home State of Ohio, which is affected by that because \nwe have a lot of mines in southeast Ohio, near the area I grew up. The \nventilation standards for underground coal mines prevent the \naccumulation of methane and cold dust fuel for explosions and fires.\n  In the 25 years before passage of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act \nof 1969, 901 miners were killed in explosions. I can remember \nexplosions happening when I was a kid back there. There would be a mine \nexplosion and \n\n[[Page S9951]]\nseveral people would be killed. It would be a terrible thing. In the 25 \nyears after that act was passed, the explosions claimed 133 miners, \ninstead of the 901. Mine falls are also covered by safety rules, black \nlung disease, mine cave-ins, all with improved, decreased mortality \nrates.\n  Mr. President, I say that I did not really plan to get into all of \nthese things originally when these things were brought up on the floor, \nbut I found that some of our papers back home in Ohio were picking up \non these examples and using them in editorials, and I thought I better \ncorrect some of these things to make sure we understand that all of \nthese rules and regulations that were cited here on the floor are not \nbad.\n  Some of them are misunderstandings and some of them are good \nregulations, even though they are pointed out in a different light.\n  I do not have much time remaining, but let me say one other thing. We \nhad E. coli debates here on the floor the last couple of days, and \nvotes here on the floor the last couple of days.\n  I heard on the radio when I was driving in this morning, an outbreak, \nI believe in Atlanta, where there were 18 cases of E. coli reported \nyesterday. I already knew about 16 cases. I believe most of that was in \nWisconsin. We have an outbreak now in Wisconsin, Tennessee, Illinois, \nand Georgia, of E. coli.\n  This is not something that is just a fictitious product of our \nimagination here when we express concern about E. coli, and we were \ntold we were nit-picking, we were just trying to delay things, because \nwe are concerned about the safety and health of people out there. We \nknow what E. coli does. We lose an average in this country of 500 lives \na year to E. coli. This bill would delay implementation of regulations \nthat would help curtail that.\n  Mr. President, 3,000 to 7,000 total lives lost each year to foodborne \nillnesses. Cryptosporidium in the water supply, and so on. Up in \nMilwaukee, it killed 100 people, made 400,000 people deathly ill. Mr. \nPresident, 100 died. That is the reason the Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Kohl, was so concerned about this and brought this amendment to \nthe floor.\n  These are not idle concerns we have had over here. We have been \ntermed all sorts of things the last few days. One that stuck in my mind \nfrom the other side is we are liberal Democrats favoring big \nGovernment. Liberal Democrats favoring big Government. That is all we \nare doing--favoring big Government. This is the reason we are opposing \nS. 343.\n  Mr. President, that is not the case. I am as concerned as anybody in \nthis body about the health and safety of people across this country. I \nam as concerned as anybody about having a regulatory system in this \ncountry that does not permit excesses but, at the same time, hits that \nbalance of protecting the people from the kinds of things we are \ntalking about here this morning.\n It protects the people of our country whose health and safety has been \nhard won over the last 25 years. Have there been excesses? Of course \nthere have been excesses. But by and large have we had people's lives \nsaved? Are our children breathing safer air? Are they drinking safer \nwater? Are they protected more from food illnesses, and so on, than \nthey were back 25 years ago? Yes, the answer is, and these regulations \nhave done that. They have made a better, safer America.\n\n  Have there been times when things were overregulated, when people \noverregulated, got carried away by the particular regulation and went \ntoo far with it? Sure there are, and we ought to correct that. But to \ntake a chance of rolling back the clock and saying, as a means of \ngetting more money, disregarding the selfish greed some people might \nhave, that we will let up on these regulations or will somehow make it \nmore difficult to protect health and safety, I think is just plain \nwrong. That is the reason why we, at the appropriate time, will offer \nour amendment, S. 1001, as a substitute, because we think it does hit \nthat better balance. It does not have the excesses that S. 343 has.\n  Mr. President, I only ask one thing, before I yield the floor, and \nthat is when we bring examples to the floor, from now on, from whatever \nsource, on whichever side of the aisle, we document these charges being \nmade, the horror stories about rules and regulations and how \nmaladministered they have been.\n  I will return to the statement I started out with. The civil service \npeople and the rules and regulations writers, basically, in this \ncountry, are people as fine as anybody in this body; as fine as any \nSenator. They are just as dedicated to their country. They are just as \ndedicated to the health and safety of this country as anybody in this \nbody. And they are on the firing line. They are charged with \nadministering these things out there. And I do not think we often \nappreciate it. We castigate them there as though most civil servants \nadministering these things are somehow deficient in mentality, I guess, \nand cannot administer with some sort of modicum of just plain old \ncommon sense.\n  Yet it is just exactly the opposite. These people are as dedicated as \nanyone here. If we want to see who is misleading them there, look in \nthe mirror. That is what I tell my colleagues here. Because 80 percent \nof the regulations that are written are written pursuant--they are \nrequired by the legislation we pass here; 80 percent. We had that \ntestimony in committee. That is the best estimate we can make, is 80 \npercent are required to be written by what we put in legislation here.\n  So I think our efforts at regulatory reform are good. I think, out of \nall this debate, we will come out of it with better legislation, better \nrequirements. But, at the same time, I say we should be requiring these \nsame kinds of cost analysis, risk assessments, in the first place, \nright here. We should be looking at that before we pass legislation, \nnot sending it over there and then griping about the people on the \nother side, downtown in the agencies, who are trying to administer the \nlaws we pass and then we give them the devil because we did not give \nthem enough guidance in the first place and they come up with something \nwe do not like. We say, ``Oh, isn't it terrible?''\n  I would like to see us take these same laws and requirements and \nrequire ourselves to do these thing before we pass legislation here on \nthe floor. That would make common sense. Maybe we would really restore \nconfidence in Government at that time.\n  I see the Presiding Officer getting a little nervous about my time \nhere. I know I am a few minutes over, and I appreciate his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1539\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of amendment No. 1539, offered by the Senator from \nTexas [Mrs. Hutchison].\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague. I might just add that I have tremendous \nrespect for him, but he has been pretty defensive here this morning on \nsome of these illustrations. I was interested that 80 percent of all \nregulations are deemed necessary.\n  Mr. GLENN. They are required by law.\n  Mr. HATCH. They are required by law. Since there were almost 70,000 \npages last year of regulations, I suspect you would have to say that 80 \npercent of those were required by law. What about the other 20 percent? \nYou see the other 20 percent is what we are concerned about. If that is \nso, that is between 12,000 and 14,000 pages of regulations that were \nnot required by law.\n  I think Senator Glenn has misunderstood my point. I have not said \nthat all regulations are goofy. Of course not. If they were, it would \ntake me 50 years of bringing up my list of 10 to even make a dent in \nthe goofy regulations.\n  What is the point? That the Government is perfect? Efficient? Spends \nour money wisely? Is that what the point is here today? Because I do \nnot think there is an American citizen alive who believes that.\n  I would just like to ask a question. Do you really believe out there, \nAmerica, that you are not overregulated? Do you really believe these \npeople here in Washington are always doing everything just wonderfully \nright for you? Do you believe small business is not oppressed? Do you \nbelieve that private properties are not being taken by ridiculous rules \nand regulations?\n  I know people, real down-home people, who have lost their properties \n\n[[Page S9952]]\n  without just compensation, which is required under the Constitution, \nbecause of goofy regulations. I have to say I enjoyed listening to the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio this morning. I appreciate all the \nresearch he and apparently OSHA and EPA and other agencies have tried \nto put together to track all of this material down.\n  I hope these agencies are as quick and responsive to question the \nconcerns raised by me and other members of the public. See, that is the \nproblem here. They are not quick to resolve these goofy regulations \nthat are ridiculous, that wear America down, that cost us our \nefficiency, that do not really help us, health-and-safety-wise, but \njust oppress small business, oppress individuals, oppress our farmers--\ntaking property, land values in the process. But I do think the Senator \nfrom Ohio has made the point. We can debate the details of these \nillustrations, but I have tried to cite some examples this week to \nillustrate a problem that I think the American people can confirm.\n  Let me just make two additional points.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to, sure.\n  Mr. GLENN. What I pointed out were things where the examples you gave \nwere flat wrong. That is the point. Those are the ones I pointed out. \nThey were flat not true, and I refuted a good portion of the ones that \nwere pointed out here on the floor.\n  Everyone knows there is overregulation. I agree with that.\n  Mr. HATCH. We respectfully disagree. We think they are true, and they \ncome from real, down-home, real-life Americans.\n  Mr. GLENN. I just gave the data, the specifics of each case here. You \nmust not have been listening.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was listening. I think you admitted in many cases that \nthis could happen, but there is another spin, another interpretation. I \ncan acknowledge that. But let me just make two points.\n  That does not mean they are wrong. That does not mean they did not \nhappen. Just because OSHA has a different point of view or EPA has a \ndifferent point of the view--which naturally they do--that does not \nmean that they are right and that these poor down-home average citizens \nof America are wrong.\n  Let me just make these two quick points. One, we need regulations. We \nall acknowledge that. Many regulations serve the public well and \nprotect our interests in maintaining healthy and safer workplaces and \nenvironment. I am the first to admit that. I agree with that. And I may \neven agree that up to 80 percent of those regulations are needed, under \nthe statutes that we passed.\n  By the way, let us not let us off the hook either. Some of the \nstatutes we pass are goofy.\n  Mr. GLENN. I agree with that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I heard the distinguished Senator from Ohio agree with \nthat.\n  Mr. GLENN. I agree with that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Some of the statutes we pass are goofy. And let me agree \nwith my colleague from Ohio, whom I happen to care a great deal for, \neven if he is defensive here today, that not only are some of the \nstatutes goofy but we in the Congress, we do not define statutorily \nwhat we really want, sometimes, and we just leave it up to the \nbureaucracy to go out and screw up America. And sometimes they do. And \nI think anybody who does not agree with that proposition is not living \nin America, or even outside of America and watching what goes on in \nAmerica, with some of our overregulatory excesses. That is what this is \nall about.\n  I have to say, thousands of workers for the Government work hard and \nthey really do a good job, and many of the regulators do a great job. \nWe are not meaning to malign all Federal regulators, certainly not. But \nwe do know a lot of these regulations are goofy. We do know that a lot \nof them cost American business and small business a lot of unnecessary \nmoney and, thus, every American citizen. We do know that people are \nbeing hurt and oppressed in this country because of stupid, idiotic, \nridiculous and, yes, to use my term, silly regulations. I have to say, \nacknowledging that most regulators do a good job and are really trying \nto do what is right, and we want to recognize and commend their \nefforts--but this bill does nothing to change good regulation. Good \nregulation is going to be sustained by this bill and it is going to be \nmore scientifically proven.\n  We are going to use the best science, not just 1958 Delaney clause \nscience that, really, everybody admits does not really apply today in \nthis sophisticated day, where we can do parts per quintillion compared \nto the parts per thousand that we did back in 1958 when Delaney was \npassed, from a scientific standpoint.\n  All this bill does is try to rationalize the system to make it more \naccountable to the public. That is first. Second, notwithstanding the \nmany necessary worthwhile regulations in effect, and notwithstanding \nthe commendable efforts of many civil servants, this is a regulatory \nsystem out of control. I think the American public can confirm the need \nto fix the current system, as the Dole bill does, to ensure that common \nsense and accountability prevail. That is all we are talking about \nhere.\n  Let me just make a couple of points and then I would like to see if \nwe can get some time agreements.\n  Mr. President, the Federal bureaucracy does not work the way it \nshould. It is wasteful, it is inefficient, and all too often hurts the \nAmerican people it is trying to help. Americans have come to fear and \neven loathe the leviathan that has grown inside of this Washington, DC, \nbeltway.\n  We have heard a lot about how this bill will harm the public health \nand safety. The opponents of the bill like to suggest that by stopping \nthe runaway train of regulation we will reduce the protection of public \nhealth, safety, and the environment. That simply is not true, and I do \nnot think many Americans believe it to be true.\n  Opponents of the bill continue to claim--in my view, erroneously--\nthat lives will be lost because if this bill is passed. The fact is \nthat lives are being lost due to the inefficiencies in the current \nregulatory system. By failing to pass this bill, thousands of people \nwill die due to misplaced priorities in the current system.\n  There is a report put out by the National Center for Policy Analysis \nwhich illustrates this point. They asked Dr. John Graham, the director \nof the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, to look at how the Federal \nbureaucracy spends money. He concluded that they do a very bad job--\nsuch a bad job that, if we got them to do it right, we could save \n60,000 lives a year every year for the same amount we spend now--60,000 \nlives, if we would just do regulations right. In other words, a more \nefficient regulatory system would save lives. According to Dr. Graham, \nwe could save the same number of lives we do now and do it for $31 \nbillion less.\n  I would like to give a couple of examples from Dr. Graham's study to \nshow how absurd and wasteful the current system is. Right now we spend \n$115.6 million per year on benzene emission control, and it saves only \n5 years of one life; $115.6 million per year on benzene emission \ncontrol that saves only 5 years of one life--not five lives, but 5 \nyears of one life in this country. If we spent the same amount of money \non requiring the installation of collapsible steering columns in \nautomobiles, we could save 1,684 years of life. That is an increase in \nefficiency of 33,680 percent.\n  Another example of misplaced resources is the $100 million spent on \ncontrol of release of low-level radiation from nuclear power plants. \nAccording to Dr. Graham--remember, he is a Harvard Ph.D. who is widely \nrespected across the board by the left, right and everybody else--\naccording to Dr. Graham, that $100 million spent on control of release \nof low-level radiation from nuclear power plants buys 1 year of one \nlife--just 1 year. However, if we spent that money on cervical cancer \nscreening and treatment, it would save 2,000 years of life every year.\n  I would like to use one other example to illustrate how the money \nwasted by foolish bureaucrats hurts society. A February 1994 FYI \npublication by the Heritage Foundation calculated that over $4 billion \nthat is spent to prevent one death under the hazardous waste disposal \nban could instead be used to keep over 47,000 criminals in jail for \n3\\1/2\\ years. They further estimated that it would reduce the arrest \ncharges over those 3\\1/2\\ years by 22,680 violent crimes, 7,711 \nrobberies, 1,035 homicides, 586 \n\n[[Page S9953]]\nrapes, 1191 other sexual assaults, and 658 kidnapings.\n  In other words, by spending our resources more wisely we can save \neven more lives. But, no, the Nader crowd, Ralph Nader, Joan Claybrook, \npeople like that, are crying for an inefficient zero-risk attitude in \ncertain select areas that do not allow us to save all of these lives in \nanother area. These regulations cost us an arm and a leg to save a few \nmonths or years out of one life in this whole society when we could be \nsaving 60,000 lives every year. That is what this bill is about, \ngetting some common sense into the regulatory system.\n  Opponents of this bill might respond by arguing for spending even \nmore money on collapsible steering columns, jails, and more regulations \nwhile preserving the status quo. But the status quo is not acceptable. \nWe should be maximizing the benefits to society and minimizing the \nrisk, and doing it intelligently and in a decent way. And this bill \nwill help us to get there. The current bureaucratic mess misses the \nbest opportunities to really help Americans and impose this crushing \ncost on our citizens. I wanted to make that little point here today.\n  The Senator from Ohio again referred to his alternative substitute \namendment this morning, noting that he planned to offer it. Could I ask \nthe Senator if he is prepared to offer his substitute this morning or \ntoday, because I think we ought to get into that. It is really going to \nlead to a more efficient and more effective debate. We can get right \ndown to the nitty-gritty of what our differences are between the two \nbills.\n  Both sides have discussed it this week. We would be happy to enter \ninto a time agreement on it. I think it is just a wise thing for us to \nget it up and try to narrow the differences between the two bills if we \ncan. The only way we are going to get there is if the Senator calls it \nup and we debate it. Does he think we can?\n  Mr. GLENN. We will have meeting in a little while to determine when \nwe will be bringing it up. It will be brought up. There is no doubt \nabout that.\n  Mr. HATCH. We would like to bring it up today if we can and get \nmoving on it. So I hope that the meeting will allow us to get going. I \nthink it will join the issue. It will do everybody a favor and a \nservice, and we will be able to discuss the differences between the two \nbills, if we can narrow the differences and go from there.\n  Could I ask the Senator another question? We have Senator Hutchison \nhere today and Senator Domenici. They both have amendments. I think the \nother side is completely aware of these. I think they are prepared to \nargue them. Is it possible for us to have reasonable time agreements?\n  Mr. GLENN. I will have to check into that. Maybe we could. I do not \nknow yet. What time would be suggested on Hutchison?\n  Mr. HATCH. Would she be happy with 10 minutes equally divided?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes. I am happy with 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GLENN. I am sure that would not be satisfactory. I think we had \nsome people who wanted to speak on that side on that. I will see if we \ncan come up with a time agreement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I propose a unanimous consent on it? Why do I not \njust propose it and see if the Senator can accept it. If he cannot, we \nwill understand.\n  Mr. GLENN. I already said I cannot accept a time agreement until I \ntalk to the people who want to speak on this subject. I will object to \nit. Go ahead and propound it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator see if he can share with his side a time \nagreement with 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. GLENN. We have people interested in speaking on this. They are on \ntheir way over now. I do not know how much time they may require. I \ncould not commit to any time agreement at this moment.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is some indication that we might be able to, if we \ncan join this issue. Some of the Senators are on their way over. We \nmight be able to shoot for a vote sometime right after 11, shortly \nafter 11, maybe around 11:10. Let us at least push for that. Then will \nthe Senator also check and see if we can get a time agreement on the \nDomenici amendment? We would like to move on these.\n  We know that a lot of people want to get out of town, but we want to \nhave some votes today, and I do not want to have them at 6 o'clock.\n  If we could do Hutchison and then Domenici and then Kennedy, if he \nwants to do his OSHA amendment, that would be great.\n  Mr. GLENN. We have a list of amendments we can proceed through today \nall right. We have about, I think there are six or seven substantive \namendments, and we do not have time agreements on any of them. We have \nto discuss time agreements as we go along. I join my friend; I hope we \ncan do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I can recommend something to my dear colleague and \nfriend, what we would like to do is narrow down all the amendments if \nwe could today so we know where we are going and everybody knows what \nthe game plan is and we can plan on this, because I know that we are \nnot going to give too much more time to this bill. I know the majority \nleader has a very important agenda, and he does not want to spend too \nmuch more time on this. So if we could get a list of all the amendments \nthat we are going to have to decide between now and next Monday night, \nto hopefully finish this bill by Monday evening probably late, then we \nwill work on this side to try to make sure we get time agreements on \nthese amendments as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator from Utah a \nquestion, would the Senator like for me to proceed with the amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator should begin.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Explain it, and then as soon as the Democrats who \nwish to speak on the issue come, we would work out a time agreement?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we should move ahead on the amendment and \nhopefully we can have a vote about 11:10.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator from \nUtah working on this amendment, and I appreciate the fact that he is \nalso cosponsoring the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Hutchison-Heflin amendment is also cosponsored by \nSenators Nickles, Craig, and Lott. The purpose of our amendment is to \nprevent agencies from bringing enforcement actions seeking criminal and \ncivil penalties when due process and fair notice are not followed. In \nsome cases, agencies have sought to impose penalties retroactively \nbased on a new agency interpretation of a rule or a new factual \ndetermination even where the person against whom the action is brought \nhas reasonably relied upon a prior agency interpretation or \ndetermination.\n  Now, because of this, corporations are forced to spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to defend civil and criminal cases brought under \nthe various Federal statutes. These millions, of course, take from that \nbusiness's ability to grow and create new jobs. It is hurting our \neconomic vitality in this country that we have to spend so much \nfighting regulations that are unfairly put forward and that the company \neither does not have notice of or the interpretation has been changed \nand the company cannot reasonably be expected to know there has been a \nchange.\n  Now, we in Congress bear a large share of the blame for this \nsituation. For example, we have created open-ended environmental \nenforcement statutes which call for penalties of up to $25,000 a day in \ncivil cases, months and even years in Federal prison for criminal cases \nwithout having to provide proof of actual damage to the environment or \nthe intention to violate a single provision of the Federal regulations. \nNow is the time to put common sense and justice back into the equation.\n  This amendment would add a new section 709 to the Administrative \nProcedure Act to prevent penalties from being imposed for unpublished, \ninconsistent and retroactive agency interpretations in civil and \ncriminal actions. My amendment would codify into administrative law the \nfundamental principle that an agency must give the regulated community \nadequate notice of its interpretation of a statute or any rule \nenforcing that interpretation through civil or criminal penalties. \n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\n  We are talking here about people going to prison, or we are talking \nabout huge fines that can make a difference, especially in a small \nbusiness, as to whether that company can keep on going, if it can hire \nnew people, if it can buy that new machine. That is what we are talking \nabout. The $25,000 a day fine is not small potatoes and especially if \nyou are a small business.\n  Such notice may be lacking where the agency's interpretation of a \nrule in question is not made clear to the regulated community or where \nthe agency states that the rule does not apply to certain conduct or \nwhere the agency attempts to apply a new interpretation but does it \nretroactively. It is fine that there is a new interpretation, but I \nthink the people who are responsible for dealing with these regulations \ncertainly should know if the regulation interpretation has changed.\n  Section 709 would impose limitations on the ability of Federal \nagencies to pursue civil or criminal penalties for alleged violations \nof rules in circumstances where the imposition of such penalties would \nbe inconsistent with basic principles of due process.\n  Now, courts routinely will uphold principles which this amendment \nembodies. The codification of the principles would deter agencies from \npursuing these cases in the first place and save unnecessary legal \nexpense. We know litigation is expensive and burdensome, particularly \nfor small businesses. Many defendants are forced to settle a case and \npay a reduced fine because to fight it would be more expensive.\n  So even if the finding is plainly unfair, a company may just pay the \nfine to avoid the costly litigation expenses. That is not the way the \nFederal Government should rule. Federal Government agencies that we \ndelegate should be fair. We are not against the businesses of this \ncountry. We are for them. We want business to succeed because that is \nhow we create the economic vitality and the jobs that keep our country \ngoing.\n  Agencies that are used to being given a considerable measure of \ndeference when their regulatory interpretations are challenged in a \nnonenforcement context sometimes misunderstand that fundamental \nprinciples of due process should take precedence over the concept of \ndeference when civil and criminal penalties are at stake in court.\n  Section 709 will discourage Government regulators from initiating \nunjustified enforcement or other actions by reminding them through \nclear statutory pronouncements of their obligation to provide \nbusinesses with adequate notice of their regulatory responsibilities \nand their duty to enforce the regulations fairly.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, to apply the \nsame principles of due process and justice that are embodied in our \nConstitution and in our enforcement of civil and criminal laws to the \nenforcement of agencies' rules. That is what this amendment does. This \namendment says that the basic rules of fair play--notice before you are \ngoing to have a penalty assessed--would be in this code so that \nagencies would be on notice and so, of course, the person or business \nthat has to comply with these regulations will know exactly what they \nare being required to do. That is a concept that is well settled in our \nConstitution, in the framework of our Government and in the laws that \nwe pass.\n  Basic fairness and due process has been the foundation of our \nGovernment. My amendment today just puts those basic principles into \nthe Administrative Procedure Act so that everyone is on notice--the \nFederal regulator is on notice and the regulated entity is on notice--\nthat there will be fair and due process.\n  Mr. President, that is what this amendment does. I hope that we can \nget a fair debate on this, because I think it is a very important \nconcept for us. But it is essential that everyone have the same book to \nread from, the same playing field to play on; that everyone is on \nnotice of what the regulations are going to do, what the interpretation \nby the regulators will be.\n  We put that in the code so that everyone knows what they are required \nto do--the agency and the regulated. I would like to see a time in this \ncountry when we did not have an adversarial relationship between our \nregulators and our businesses because, after all, we want our \nbusinesses to succeed. We want our companies to export overseas. We \nwant the jobs to be created in America. Why cannot business be a \npartner rather than an adversary?\n  That is what my amendment will try to do by putting everyone on \nnotice that they have to have a fair and due process. But it is going \nto take more than that, Mr. President. It is going to take an attitude \nby everyone that we are going in the same direction, that we want to \nhave good, solid, firm regulations. If a business gets out of line, we \nwant to make sure that business gets back in line. But we want to do it \nin a partnership, not an adversarial relationship.\n  I think just putting it down on paper is the responsibility of \nCongress. It is our responsibility to say what the parameters are, and \nthat is what this regulatory reform bill does. This regulatory reform \nbill sets the parameters. It makes Congress do what it should have done \na long time ago. And that is, tell the regulators what the \ncongressional intent is.\n  Why would we pass broad general guidelines, delegate our \nresponsibility to the regulators to enforce these broad general \nguidelines and then be surprised when they do things that we never \nenvisioned? It is our responsibility to make sure they know what our \nintent is so that when we delegate that responsibility, they stay \nwithin those limitations. It is our responsibility, Mr. President, but \nI think rather than broad general guidelines, we need to be more \nspecific.\n  This is a specific. This amendment does put in the Administrative \nProcedure Act exactly what everyone must do--the people making the \nregulations and the people following the regulations. It is our \nresponsibility to make it clear. I think this will go a long way toward \nstopping the over litigation, the money that is wasted on lawsuits, \ninstead of going into the bottom line so that a business can grow and \nprosper and export and create jobs and keep our economy able to absorb \nthe new people that want to come into our system and the immigrants \nthat are coming into our system. That has been a hallmark of this \ncountry, and that is what we want to continue. That is why this is such \na good bill and so important that we pass it.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to stop and let those who might have \nother views state them. Let us have a good debate, but I hope that my \ncolleagues will realize that this is a very important amendment for \nfairness, for justice, for due process and for making sure that \neveryone is singing from the same hymnal, that we all know what is \nexpected of us, that we know that there will not be a law in this \ncountry or a regulation in this country that a company will have to \nfight when they did not even know that it was on the books. That is the \npurpose of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to speak in behalf of the \nHutchison amendment. I would like to inquire first--parliamentary \ninquiry--of what is the time situation. Is there any agreement on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to speak in behalf of the \nHutchison amendment and commend her efforts to develop this amendment. \nI know that she has been working tirelessly to develop the right \nlanguage, and I know that some changes have been made.\n  I think this amendment goes to the heart of what this bill is all \nabout. When I look at words that describe what she is trying to \naccomplish, it is words like ``fairness,'' ``understanding of what the \nrules are,'' ``not being penalized by a change in the rules,'' or the \n``effects of retroactive rules.''\n  I have seen in my own State many instances where businessmen and \nwomen, large and small, and even farmers complied with the rules that \nthey understood were on the books, and then they had those rules \nretroactively changed and were told, ``You are going to be penalized, \nyou did not comply with the law'' when, as a matter of fact, they did. \nThey complied with the existing rules.\n  What we are asking of the small businessman and woman of America, in \n\n[[Page S9955]]\n  some instances, is it to be mind readers of how Washington bureaucrats \nwill interpret a rule or how a rule will be interpreted in the future.\n  What we are trying to do here today is to stop retroactive \nrulemaking, and get a clarification on what occurs when a rule is \nchanged. Americans need to know what the rules are.\n  The amendment, in my opinion, will prevent unfair administrative \nenforcement action. It requires, as I understand it, the agencies to \nshow the same concern for due process--due process--that Americans \nexpect from the courts and the Congress.\n  The amendment prohibits the imposition of civil or criminal penalties \nif the agency did not give adequate notice of a prohibited conduct. Let \nme stop on that. Should you not at least get adequate notice? Should \nyou not be told what you are going to have to comply with? It seems \nlike a minimum sort of requirement.\n  Or if a court finds that the defendant reasonably determined it was \nin compliance with a rule based on the published rule or based on its \nsummary explanation in the Federal Register; or if the defendant was \ntold that it was in compliance by the agency.\n  Think about that. You are told by some agency or department--all of \nthis alphabet soup in Washington--``OK, you're all right, you're in \ncompliance,'' and then later, weeks, months, years later you are told, \n``Sorry about that, one of our employees gave you the wrong \ninformation. You are not in compliance. And, oh, by the way, there is \nthis little civil or criminal penalty you might be liable for.''\n  These are basic fundamental American rights that we have lost over \nthe past 20 years. I think there have been overzealous interpretations \nof rules and maybe even laws. Although, when I talk with some of these \nagency representatives often I am told, ``No, no, no, we can't do that, \nthe law doesn't allow that,'' but when I examine it further I find it \nis not the law, it is the agency's interpretation of the law. This is \nnot a little difference--this is a big problem.\n  This amendment would prevent an agency's rule interpretation from \nbeing enforced by a court if the agency did not publish in a timely \nmanner the information.\n  This amendment would prevent courts from imposing civil penalties \nbased on retroactive application of rule changes. I guarantee you, \nevery Senator in this Chamber can tell you an example where a \nconstituent complied with the rules and were faced with fines because \nthe rules were changed and then they were told, ``You have to pay.''\n  It does not make any difference that your constituent complied with \nthe law at the time, it does not make any difference if you took action \nto deal with cleaning up something and you properly transferred what \nyou got in that cleanup process to somebody else, you are responsible \nfor the subsequent requirements of this rule. This is just basically \nwrong.\n  This amendment would prevent that from happening if there is a \nretroactive application of an agency's interpretation of a law or rule \nor in an agency's determination of facts.\n  This amendment does not--does not--prevent agencies from making \nchanges. Sure, lots of times you find new evidence, new science, new \nfactors come into play and changes should be made. That is fine. This \nis all well and good. I know lots of rules and regulations I would like \nto see changed. Agencies can make those changes and then apply them \nprospectively with adequate notice. If an agency makes a change, fine. \nBut it should only apply henceforth, and you must tell the American \npeople that they are going to be affected differently because there has \nbeen a change.\n  Some may be surprised that we even need this amendment in the first \nplace. Most Americans do not have to deal with so many Government \nagencies and departments. They do not know all of this.\n  They would be amazed that American's are denied public notice or that \nthey can have a rule change and then be subjected to a process where \nthey can be put out of business because of unknown penalties or even \ncriminal violations. In their zeal to collect more fines and increase \ntheir budgets and sometimes even make work, in my opinion, for an ever-\nincreasing number of cases and lawyers at the Justice Department, \nagencies have done a number of things.\n  Let me share with you some examples. One aspect of the regulatory \nabuse is inadequate notice of an agency's interpretation. The \nDepartment of Agriculture tried to impose the continuous meat \ninspection requirements for meatpackers on a retail grocery store chain \nbecause it sold pizzas which were baked at a central location. USDA \nsaid the grocery stores were meatpackers because their pizzas had \npepperoni, ham, and bacon on them. My son is in the pizza business. If \nthere is any food business I know anything about, it is pizza. This is \na crazy rule. USDA said the store was in the meatpacking business, but \nthe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that USDA failed to properly \ngive notice that it was going to change and expand it rule \ninterpretation. Therefore, it could not enforce the rule against the \ngrocery store chain.\n  OSHA--one of my favorite agencies--requires that tunnel diggers have \nself-rescue equipment when they are near the end of a tunnel where the \ndigging is going on. That makes sense, but then without notice OSHA \ntried to expand this rule to cover other workers like those building \nthe metro system here in Washington, DC, metro. No notice--that is the \nkey phrase. It is OK to expand a rule, but you should at least tell the \nfolks effected?\n  The judge--now Supreme Court Justice Scalia--writing for the D.C. \nCircuit, said:\n\n       Where the imposition of penal sanctions is at issue . . . \n     the due process clause prevents [deference to agency \n     interpretations] from validating the application of a \n     regulation that fails to give fair warning of the conduct it \n     prohibits or requires.\n\n  Fair warning and fair notice--this is a basic American tenet, I \nthought. But over the years we have lost that too.\n  Another OSHA example of inadequate notice. Here OSHA ruled that a \nrailing be installed around open-sided floors, but not open-sided \nroofs. It could have required railings for both, but it did not. OSHA \nthen cited a builder for failing to have a railing around an open-sided \nroof. Maybe it should have been there that is not the point. The Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals found that while OSHA could require rails \naround open-sided roofs, they clearly knew the difference between \nfloors and roofs, and that it had not done so. But the court ruled that \n``an employer * * * is entitled to fair notice in dealing with his \nGovernment,'' and that ``if a violation of a regulation subjects \nprivate parties to criminal or civil sanctions, a regulation cannot be \nconstrued to mean what an agency intended but did not express.''\n  An agency should at least tell us what it wants. If they do not \nexpress it, why are we liable for that? Again, we are not mind readers \nof agency bureaucrats.\n  I have many, many illustrations that there are occasions when \ninadequate notice of prohibited conduct with retroactive application \nhas occurred, but let me conclude with one final example from EPA. I \nthink EPA is one of the more blatant violators of due process and fair \ntreatment. It fined General Electric Corp. $25,000 for violating the \nToxic Substances Control Act, for distilling and reusing a freon \nsolvent rinsing agent. EPA concluded that the distillation and reuse of \nthis solvent posed no health risks and actually produced an \nenvironmental benefit by reducing the amount of contaminated \nmaterials--but the EPA nevertheless imposed a penalty. In this case \nthey actually said GE had a positive effect on our environment by \nreusing contaminated materials. Judge Tatel--a recent appointee to the \nD.C. Circuit Court by President Clinton--said, ``In the absence of \nnotice--for example, where the regulation is not sufficiently clear to \nwarn a party about what is expected of it--an agency may not deprive a \nparty of property by imposing a civil or criminal liability.''\n  This is one of President Clinton's own judicial appointees on the \nD.C. Circuit Court that, once again, said that without proper notice, \nyou cannot penalize. Clearly, this demonstrates that this amendment is \nnot partisan in nature. It is about basic justice and fairness.\n  I support this amendment. I think its addition would greatly enhance \nthis \n\n[[Page S9956]]\nregulatory reform bill. Again, I commend the Senator from Texas for her \nwork in this effort. This amendment is so fundamental, so basic, so \nlogical that I would think that it would be just overwhelmingly \naccepted. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to both compliment the Senator from \nTexas on what she is attempting to do, if it is what I think she is \nattempting to do, and I would like to be able to ask her a few \nquestions and ask her to consider whether or not she might be willing \nto make a few modifications.\n  Let me begin by saying that the idea of an individual or a \ncorporation expending their time, energy, and money in an effort to \ntake an action in which they operate in total good faith, and they go \nto a Federal agency, speak to an appropriately authorized bureaucrat, \nsomeone with authority to make a judgment, and are told that, yes, what \nyou are proposing, based on what information you have given us, is \ntotally appropriate, is consistent with the rules and regulations, and \nyou should be able to go forward; and then that person goes forward and \nfinds--after they have made their investment, after they have \nundertaken their action, they are told, wrong, wrong, you are violating \nthe regulation, you are violating the rule, you are subject to a civil \nor criminal penalty here. And the taxpayer retorts and says, but they \ntold me it was all right. They said it was OK to do this. I think that \ntaxpayer should, as this amendment suggests, be exempt from civil and \ncriminal penalties, with no civil administrative penalty, either court \nimposed or administratively imposed, if they violate a rule after \nhaving been told by the rulemaker that it is OK to go ahead and do \nthis.\n  Now, I understand from the comments--and I was able to listen to some \nof the comments of the distinguished Senator from Texas in my office on \nthe television, but I did not hear them all. As I understand it, her \nfundamental intention is to hold harmless people who act in good faith, \nrely on in good faith, and provide in good faith with the blessing of \nthe appropriate agency.\n  So my question is: Is that the major thrust and purpose of the \nSenator's amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator from Delaware is correct, as far as I can \ntell from what you are saying. It is a matter of fairness, notice, \nretroactive interpretation, change, basic due process and basic \nfairness.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I ask the Senator another question. If, in fact, a \ntaxpayer goes in to the regional director of the EPA or into any number \nof Federal ``alphabet'' agencies and sits down and says, I want to do \nthe following, and then in laying out the facts of what they intend on \ndoing does not disclose all the facts--does not, for example, tell the \nregulator that where they want to lay this pipe or where they want to \nbuild this building is in the middle of a swamp. He says, ``I own a \npiece of land that is high ground and here is my plan, this is what I \nwant to do. Can I do it?''\n  If the taxpayer does not fully disclose to the agency the actual \nfacts as the taxpayer knows them, does the Senator intend for that \ntaxpayer to be held harmless, if it turns out the rule has been \nviolated?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would say to the Senator from Delaware that becomes \na fact question for the agency or for the court to determine if a \npenalty is put forward.\n  Mr. BIDEN. So, if, in fact, the agency, after the fact, the agency \nwrites a letter, saying, ``John Doe, taxpayer, go ahead and build your \nbuilding on the site you asked whether you could build it on,'' and \nthen finds out later that John Doe told them it was high ground, and it \nturns out to be a literal swamp that they filled in, I assume that John \nDoe would not be able to say in court, ``Look, I got a letter here and \nit says go ahead and build.''\n  The agency would be able to say, would they not, that, well, ``We \nwere not given all the facts, your honor, and the penalty should \nprevail,'' is that what the Senator is saying?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I say probably that situation is covered very well in \nour amendment, because it says that the agency shall not be able to \nimpose the civil or criminal penalty after disclosure of material facts \nat the time and appropriate review.\n  I think it is possibly covered very well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am not suggesting it is not. I want the record to \nreflect if all the material facts are not made known to the agency at \nthe time the approval is given, I assume the taxpayer does not get the \nbenefit of being held harmless, is that correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would say any court or any agency probably is going \nto be able to determine pretty carefully the difference between high \nground and a swamp.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator reads the first section of the Senator's \nsection 709, subsection (1):\n\n       No civil or criminal penalty shall be imposed by a court, \n     and no civil administrative penalty shall be imposed by an \n     agency, for the violation of a rule.\n\n  By law, we are telling a court they cannot impose a penalty.\n  My question is, Is the exception to that, if it is clear that on a \nmaterial fact the taxpayer did not disclose all the facts, would the \ncourt be able to say as the Senator reads her own amendment, look, I \nunderstand section 709 of the amendment says we cannot impose a \npenalty?\n  But if we look forward down here, mister lawyer for the defendant, it \nsays material facts--the material facts were not all made available \nhere; therefore, even though the taxpayer has a letter saying go ahead, \nI will fine the taxpayers.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator from Delaware is stating it \ncorrectly.\n  Reading further through the amendment, after the part that the \nSenator read: ``No civil or criminal penalties shall be imposed'' if \nthey find that the defendant ``engaged in the conduct alleged to \nviolate the rule in reliance,'' and it provides all of the ability for \nthe court or the agency to make the fact determination.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Where does it say that? Can the Senator show me where in \nthe amendment it says that?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. ``if the court or agency, as appropriate, finds that \nthe defendant''--in good faith determined based on the language of the \nrule or ``engaged in the conduct alleged to violate the rule in \nreliance upon a written statement issued by the appropriate official'' \n``* * * stating that the action complied with, or that the defendant \nwas exempt * * *''\n  I think that there is a lot of latitude by the court to determine. If \nwe go on through the rest of the amendment and go over to the next \nsection it says:\n\n       No agency shall bring any judicial or administrative action \n     to impose a civil or criminal penalty based upon . . . a \n     written determination of fact made . . . after disclosure of \n     the material facts at the time and appropriate review of \n     those or in interpretation of the statute.\n\n  Section (c), the third page is where I am reading from.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator is reading from page 3 of her amendment where \nit says:\n\n       No agency shall bring any judicial or administrative action \n     to impose a civil or ciriminal penalty based upon--\n       (1) an interpretation of the statute, rule, guidance, \n     agency statement or policy, or license requirement or \n     condition, or\n       (2) a written determination of fact made by an appropriate \n     agency official, or state official as described in paragraph \n     (a)(2)(B), after disclosure of the material facts at the time \n     and appropriate review,\n\n     if such an interpretation or determination is materially \n     different from the prior interpretation made by the agency or \n     State official described in (a)(2)(B), and if such person, \n     having taken into account all information that was reasonably \n     available at the time of the original interpretation or \n     determination, reasonably relied in good faith upon the prior \n     interpretation or determination.\n\n  What that says to me, Mr. President, is not, I think, what the \nSenator intends.\n  Would the Senator object to language explicitly saying that if all \nthe material facts are not disclosed to the agency at the time of the \nletter of approval then a civil and criminal penalty could apply if the \nlaw was violated. Would the Senator have any objection to clarifying \nit?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be happy to sit down with the Senator from \nDelaware and go through it. I do not think it is a very good idea to \nwrite a bill on the floor. The Senator has the evening to look at it. \n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\n  We can go to your desk, and if there is something we can modify that \nwould allow the Senator to support this amendment, that I can agree to, \nI would love to do that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me make another point, and I truly appreciate the \nSenator's consideration.\n  The second problem I have with the amendment as it is written is this \nsection (a)(2)(A), it says, ``no civil or criminal penalty,'' and then \nit shifts to ``shall be imposed, if the court or agency as appropriate, \nfinds that the defendant reasonably in good faith determined, based \nupon the language of the rule published in the Federal Register, that \nthe defendant was in compliance with, exempt from or otherwise not \nsubject to, the requirements of the rule.''\n  Let me explain why that bothers me. We can make an analogy to one of \nthe more loathed agencies in America, the IRS. I know I do not do my \ntaxes anymore, and I have the dubious distinction two times ago as \nbeing listed as the poorest man in the U.S. Senate. Second poor only to \nthe man in Montana sitting behind the Senator, so I do not have a very \ncomplicated tax form to fill out.\n  But I do not even do my own taxes anymore. I pay about 1,200 bucks a \nyear to have somebody do my taxes when I do not have anything to \ndeclare. I do not have any money. I am not proud of that, but I do not \nhave anything. I do not own a single stock, a single bond, a single \ninvestment. I do not own anything, except me and the bank own my house.\n  Having said that, if I decided I was going to try to save myself this \n1,200 bucks this year--were I not a U.S. Senator, I would not have \nanybody do my taxes, but I am afraid I would inadvertently make a \nmistake and there would be a headline in the newspaper that says \n``Biden screws up his taxes'' so I pay somebody to do them, even though \nI do not have any need to do it.\n  Having said that, I sat down and tried to figure out interest, on \nwhat interest is a legitimate deductible--on my mortgage. So I wrote \nthis all out and I got it figured. I got this all down just right.\n  It turns out, when I sent it in, figuring if I sent in this finished \ntax form to the accountant, one of these big accounting firms, that I \nwould get a break because they would not have to do all this work and \nmaybe it would not be $1,200 or whatever it was, maybe it would be \n$300--it turns out I was wrong the way I calculated the interest.\n  I did it in good faith. I acted in good faith. I guess I am revealing \nthe fact that maybe I am not as bright as I would like to think I am, \nbut I am a relatively well educated guy. I acted in good faith. I went \nout and did it as best I could--fearful of the political consequences \nif I was wrong, so I had an incentive to get it right. And I still \nended up wrong.\n  Nobody suggests that, even though I relied--I acted in good faith, I \nreasonably, in good faith, determined that I could deduct more than I \nwas actually able to deduct on my home mortgage interest--because I did \nnot figure out the basis correctly, but at any rate, that I was able to \ndo that--I doubt, when the IRS came to me and said, ``No, Biden, you \nowe $220 more than you calculated,'' that I should go to a court and \nsay, ``I am not paying it; take it to court,'' and you cannot get it \nfrom me because I can prove to a court I reasonably relied on what the \ncode said.\n  I just made a mistake. What worries me here is that some of these \nregulations are understandably complicated, like the IRS code. So, if I \ncome along, as a guy who in my State wants to build a project or \ndispose of a chemical or whatever, and I act in good faith and I \nreasonably, in good faith, determine that this law does not apply to \nme--when anybody who really knows, knows if I had gone to my lawyer or \nif I had spoken to somebody they would make it clear that I did have \nthe requirement to abide by a different way--I do not know why we \nshould reward ignorance.\n  I can understand rewarding reliance, reliance on good faith: Going, \ndisclosing all the facts to the agency, saying ``Here is the deal, this \nis what I plan on doing, here are my plans.'' And some agency guy or \nwoman saying, ``That is OK.'' Then I go ahead and do that, and they \ncome back and say, ``Wrong, wrong. We are going to fine you.'' That \nperson should be held harmless.\n  But what I do not agree with, that subsection (a) seems to allow, is, \nif I sit down as Joe Biden Waste Removal Co., read the regulations, and \nsay, ``You know, in good faith I think I can dump this toxin in the \nlocal landfill,'' and I go ahead and dump it in the local landfill, and \nthen the EPA, or State of Delaware comes along and says, ``No, you \nviolated the law,'' for me to be able to go back and say, ``You know, I \nin good faith determined that this word meant that,'' I do not think I \nshould be held harmless, because the public interest is at stake here.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If I might just inquire of the Senator, I have an \ninterest in this language but also I have an interest in getting the \nbill moved.\n  If the Senator has a suggestion, we are happy to consider those \nsuggestions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I know several Senators want to know----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will cease and desist and negotiate with my friends. I \nassume we are not going to vote on this right away, correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could interrupt my good friend \nfrom Oklahoma, I absolutely agree with him. I think we need to sit down \nand work together if we can. But, with all due respect, the point that \nhe is making is not even necessary, under this. We are talking about \nnot being able to have a penalty, a fine, or put you in jail. I think \nthat is covered now.\n  If you sit down with the IRS and say, ``I, in good faith, thought I \nshould have this exemption,'' I would expect the IRS and hope the IRS \nwould say, ``No, Senator Biden, you actually owe $220 more.'' And I \nwould not suggest a Senator as smart as the Senator from Delaware would \nthink that is a fine?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to the Senator, maybe it is because I had the \ndisadvantage of having practiced law, I can assure her the IRS does \nsay, ``By the way, there is a fine.''\n  Fortunately, the Senator did not have to practice law. And they do \nthat, by the way.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator from Delaware knows it is well settled in \nour law that there is a good-faith test. If it is not a willful \nviolation, I would hope we would protect people who in good faith, in a \nfact determination, would be able to say I did not mean to do this.\n  If you think the IRS would, in fact, penalize someone with a fine for \nthat, then I think we should protect them from the IRS. That is what my \namendment does.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not want to be overtechnical. The Senator from Texas, \nI think, is confusing the difference between civil law and criminal \nlaw. Willfulness is required for criminal, not for civil. But I do not \nwant to get into that debate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think good faith is well settled in principle in \ncivil law.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I admire the Senator but she is \nfundamentally wrong on the law. But I do not want to debate that.\n  Let me just say this. If the Senators are saying that they, in fact, \nare not going to move to vote on this right away, then there is not a \nproblem. I am willing to yield the floor and go ahead and see if we can \nnegotiate this.\n  But if we are going to vote, if I yield the floor and we are about to \nvote on this issue, then I am going to speak on the issue. I do not \nwant to speak on the issue. I would rather try to resolve it.\n  Would the Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator from Texas be kind \nenough to tell the Senator from Delaware what the plan is, relative to \nmoving on this amendment as is, in terms of the timeframe?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to respond to the Senator. I know \nSenator Dole wants a couple of votes quickly. That is the reason why I \nthought maybe we could talk.\n  In listening to the Senator from Delaware I thought I heard the \nSenator say he has real problems with the words that were inserted, \n``in good faith.'' If he has other suggestions, I would like us to talk \nabout them and maybe we can resolve that.\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Good.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I do know Senator Dole wants some votes. I do not want \nto get into protracted, extended debate. I know Senator Kennedy has an \namendment dealing with OSHA that shall be controversial. We need to \ndispose of it, I hope, pretty quickly. We were in hopes we could have \nvotes on Senator Hutchison's amendment quickly. My thought is we might \nbe able to resolve more with a little side discussion than we could on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me say to my friends--it will take 30 seconds to say \nit--I am delighted to see if we can resolve it. If we cannot, I will \nhave a second-degree amendment to which I will wish to speak. But I \nthank the Chair and yield the floor, and maybe we can talk.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, while my colleagues are----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Idaho could \nyield just for 2 minutes so I can address the Senator from Delaware and \nTexas on this issue?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could have the attention of the Senator from Delaware \nand the Senator from Texas just for one moment? The suggestion has been \nmade by the Senator from Delaware that we attempt to work out language \non the amendment of the Senator from Texas. I hope that can be true, \nbecause I think the intent of the amendment is an important one and a \nlaudatory one.\n  There are a number of things which I believe can be clarified, which \nwill help that amendment reflect what is that laudatory purpose, where, \nif people act in good faith, they should be able to rely on agencies' \nrules and interpretations.\n  We do want fair warning to people. In addition to the problem which \nhas been raised by the Senator from Delaware, there is an additional \nproblem which is that there is a narrow reference to the word ``rule,'' \nin the amendment of the Senator from Texas. I believe that the court \nopinion which the Senator from Mississippi, I believe, quoted--although \nit may have been someone else--it is not just a rule, that agencies act \nby. It is also interpretations, guidance. In other words agencies act \nin many ways.\n  As a matter of fact, this bill is going to permit petitions to get \nagencies to reconsider guidance and interpretations. So the notice \nwhich so correctly we should insist upon comes frequently from more \nthan just a published rule, but also comes from agency guidance and \ninterpretations. We do not want the agency to be limited to just \npublished rules. We want people to be able to get interpretation and \nguidance from agencies, so that when the Senators from Texas and \nDelaware are sitting down to try to put the language of (c) in (a), I \nhope they will also look at the use of the word ``rule'' and expand \nthat to include other published guidance, correspondence and so forth.\n  That is the suggestion that I would make as they are reviewing this \nvery useful amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time. I would be happy to \nyield for a comment by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate that because I would like \nto respond to the Senator from Michigan that we would be happy to add \nsome language, to have ``definition'' and ``rule.'' ``Rule'' is in \nsection C. If you would prefer to put ``rule'' and ``definition'' in A, \nI think we could work something out because, as the Senator from \nMichigan said, what we are trying to do here is have a due process and \na fair play in the Administrative Procedure Act. We want to have that \ngoal. Then perhaps with some word changes and better definitions, we \ncould work something out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Texas. I thank the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas. I hope that she and the Senators from Michigan and \nDelaware can work out the differences because I think it is an \nextremely important amendment.\n  When I look at what has gone out there in the past and is currently \ngoing on, I pose this question to you, Mr. President: Can you imagine \nliving in a country where the laws are not posted or published--\nanywhere, in some instances--but you can still get in trouble for \nviolating them? That is kind of the feeling of a lot of our people out \nin the private sector trying to make a living, especially those in the \nbusiness community and especially the small business community that \ndoes not have the hundreds of thousands of dollars of resources to keep \na stable of attorneys around telling them what to do and how to do it. \nSometimes they find themselves exactly in that situation. They find \nthemselves in a world where those who enforce the laws tell you it is \nOK to do something and then turn around and punish you for doing it.\n  That is some of what the Senator from Delaware just spoke to. But in \nthe same instance, if you have invested a lot of money and time and you \nthought in good faith you were doing it only to be told you are not and \nthen to be fined, I think in most instances the average citizen in our \ncountry who has reacted very openly about these issues would say that \nis just wrong. Most Americans, I believe, would find that kind of \nsystem to be intolerable, outrageous, and in all fairness I agree with \nthem. That is why I am a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Yet, as unbelievable as that description may be--Mr. President, we \nfind today that that is in part the regulatory system we have--it is a \nmystery to me how anyone could most possibly defend that status quo. \nYet, we find Senators on the floor saying, Wait, everything is OK. \nWell, everything is not OK if we spend $600 billion nonproductive \ndollars in our economy every year in this situation, and yet good-faith \ncitizens find themselves subject to penalties and subject to fine.\n  It is inconceivable that the current system actually would allow \nagencies to decide after the fact that an action or a failure to act \nshould be penalized. If we were talking about criminal law--and that \nbecame a brief discussion a moment ago--it would be considered flat-out \nunconstitutional. Well, if it is unconstitutional in criminal law, why \nshould not it be unconstitutional here? That is because for three \ndecades we have been caught up in the attitude that the regulatory \nagencies of our Government know better how the world out beyond the \nbeltway ought to be instead of the private citizen who is trying to \nprovide the goods and services for society and operate in good faith, \nwho has the right to choose and make reasonable and sound decisions.\n  So I think if it is unconstitutional in criminal law, it ought to be \nunconstitutional here, and that is why we ought to fix it. And I think \nthat is why the Senator from Texas is clearly headed in the right \ndirection.\n  I compliment her for her energies and her effort in her amendment. \nHer amendment is nothing more than I think, as I mentioned a moment \nago, common sense and fair play. It just says that people should be put \non notice as to what actions are required or prohibited of them. That \nought to be clear and straightforward. Those who get approval before \nthey act from an agency authorized to regulate or speak on policy in a \nparticular area should not be punished for relying on that advice.\n  The simple question then is, Well, then, where do we go? If I have \nheard that once, I have heard it a hundred times, Mr. President, in my \ntown meetings from small business people saying, What do we do then? Do \nwe just simply go out of business because we cannot get the right \ndirection, or we cannot find a way to be in compliance with some \nobscure rule or regulation, that a Federal regulator now comes in and \nsays, Here is the $10,000 fine for doing something wrong, when they in \nfact may have been advised that the way they were going to do it and \nthen did it was right? That is an intolerable world.\n  This amendment does not interfere with an agency's ability to revise \nits rules or to interpret those rules. It just requires penalties to be \nimposed for future violations as opposed to past violations.\n  Mr. President, regulations are not supposed to be a goal in \nthemselves. They are supposed to be a way of reaching important goals. \nLet me repeat that because that is exactly where the small business \ncommunity, the backbone of the American economy, finds themselves. They \nfind themselves \n\n[[Page S9959]]\nalways moving toward the regulation. That is the goal. It ought not to \nbe the goal. It should be the way you get to a productive economy, in \nthe right and proper, socially acceptable level of performance.\n  If we make the laws and regulatory process a trap for the unwary, \nnobody is served, and the tragedy of nobody being served is that then \nnobody wants to play. And in this instance, what we are talking about \nis the creation of jobs, the strengthening and the building of an \neconomy. When nobody wants to play because they find themselves \nprohibited or the very limited failure to perform is so violent that it \ncould put them out of business, then something is substantially wrong.\n  It does not get us to our goals because people do not even know what \nis required of them. It discourages them from even trying to find a way \nto work with the law, to work with the enforcing agency. One of those \nimportant concepts is embodied in our law and our Constitution, a \nconcept that we all fight to adhere to here. That is called due \nprocess. Really, what the Hutchison amendment talks about is the simple \nconcept of due process. That is just another way of defining fairness.\n  Mr. President, we need this reform. Let us send a strong message of \nsupport for fairness and due process with what I hope is an amendment \nthat we could accept unanimously, and that the Senators now involved in \nit might work out their differences so we can as a Senate say to the \nAmerican people and to the producers out there, We have heard you, we \nare responding to you, we are going to create a government that is a \ngood deal more friendly, which respects your right as the producer and \nthe taxpayer, and will work with you in good faith as a partner instead \nof a cop that comes through the front door and says, Here is the fine, \npay up, you are in violation for something we told you to do because \nnow we have decided you did it wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, negotiations are underway right now to \nsee if we cannot come to a closure on Senator Hutchison's amendment. I \nthink there is general agreement that her amendment is needed. I happen \nto share that concern. I am happy to be a cosponsor of it. I hope maybe \nwe can alleviate some of the concerns that were raised legitimately by \nSenator Biden and Senator Levin and pass that amendment. Those \nnegotiations may be going on for a few more minutes.\n  So I would hope that we could move ahead on a couple of other things. \nI know Senator Kennedy mentioned yesterday that he has an OSHA \namendment, that he would like to exempt OSHA. I hope he will bring that \nto the floor. I hope we can have a vote very quickly on Senator \nDomenici's amendment which he raised, and it was debated last night.\n  So I would let people know that hopefully we will have soon a vote on \nthe Domenici amendment. I hope Senator Kennedy will bring his amendment \nto the floor very soon and that we can begin debate on it and hopefully \nhave a vote on it after a short discussion. Maybe a time limit with be \nnecessary on that. Possibly by that time we will have the negotiations \ncompleted on the amendment offered by Senator Hutchison. I think her \namendment is needed. I also think it is well drafted. Maybe we can \nsolve some of the ambiguities on it.\n  But it is important to let people know that, if they rely on an \nagency ruling, that ruling made sense and there will not be a \nretroactive application of a fine or a penalty. If they are given a \nletter, if they are told by administrative agency, this is OK, this is \nright, this is in the Congressional Record, you should not have \nretroactive application and fine or some type of other civil penalty. \nThat would be a mistake. That is not fair. That is unjust.\n  I believe there would be bipartisan support for that. I agree that \nthere should be overwhelming support for this amendment. Hopefully that \nwill be adopted.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. I mention to him \nmaybe we could move forward on his amendment very quickly and try to \nsolve that. I know Senator Dole has real concerns about moving this \nlegislation forward.\n  I want to compliment the managers. I saw Senator Glenn just a moment \nago, and Senator Roth and Senator Hatch, because they worked very, very \nhard to try to make some progress. It was very frustrating the first 2 \nor 3 days.\n  I think yesterday we made a lot of progress. I compliment Senator \nJohnston for helping make that happen. So yesterday evening we started \nmaking real progress. I might mention for those on the other side of \nthe aisle that had raised a lot of concerns about this bill, I think a \nlot of those concerns were alleviated.\n  So maybe, again, that will help promote this and make it more \npossible to pass this bill. I know the majority leader said he would \nlike to have this bill passed no later than Tuesday. I think he is \nbeing patient. We started on this bill actually on Thursday before the \nrecess. So we have had a lot of debate.\n  This bill is needed, Mr. President. In my opinion, it is one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation we will consider this year. It is \nneeded for a lot of reasons. One of the primary reasons is because we \nhave a lot of unnecessary regulation in this country. We have a lot of \nregulations that do not make sense, a lot of regulations that cost too \nmuch. So people do feel like they are overregulated, overburdened. When \nyou have regulations coming in that do not make sense or cost an \ninordinate amount for marginal improvements, we are saying, wait a \nminute; let us do something different. And that is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  So I compliment the sponsors of this legislation. The idea of saying \nthat we should have a policy to make sure that the benefits justify the \ncosts, I think makes eminent good sense. We have had past Presidents \nwho have put that in Executive orders, but we never had it in the law. \nWhy not put it into law? That is what we are trying to do. We are \nsaying that we should use risk analysis so we can actually prioritize \nthose areas that need a scientific analysis so we will determine where \nwe can focus and concentrate our efforts to make sure that we take the \nlimited resources we have from the regulatory agencies, from the \nGovernment, from the taxpayers to concentrate on those that will do the \nmost good.\n  Some people have characterized this bill and said this will be \nharmful to their health. I do not think so. I think it will be just the \nopposite. We only have so many dollars in the agencies; we only have so \nmany dollars from the taxpayers. Let us concentrate those dollars where \nwe can get basically the maximum amount of safety, the maximum amount \nof health from the dollars that are expended.\n  Mr. President, again, if there are additional amendments, I urge our \ncolleagues to bring those amendments forward because I know the \nmajority leader wants to draw this bill to a close. At least one \ncloture motion has been filed. There may be another one filed. I hope \nthat is not necessary. I hope that everyone in good faith will offer \ntheir amendments, bring them to the floor, debate them, debate them \ntoday, debate them all day Monday if necessary, maybe very late Monday \nnight if necessary, and come to an agreement where we can have final \npassage on Tuesday.\n  I also know the majority leader wants to go to a Bosnia resolution on \nTuesday. We also have appropriations bills that we must begin \nconsideration of.\n  I think we are making good progress on the Hutchison amendment, and \nif we could resolve it and have a vote or pass the Domenici amendment, \nI think that would be progress, and hopefully dispose of Senator \nKennedy's amendment. That would be excellent progress as well.\n  So I thank my friends. Again, I compliment Senator Hatch and Senator \nRoth and Senator Johnston for their leadership on this bill. I would \nlike to see some greater momentum and movement on the amendments \npending today. I encourage all Republicans who have amendments to bring \nthem to the floor as well and maybe we can dispose of those today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n[[Page S9960]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Hutchison amendment that is currently \npending, which restores a modified version of section 709 to the \nJudiciary Committee version of S. 343, is intended to deal with the \nproblem that is appearing with more frequency of agencies bringing \nenforcement actions and seeking civil and criminal penalties for the \nalleged violations of rules that are increasingly complex, convoluted, \nand often unclear.\n  In their zeal to compile enforcement statistics, some Government \nagencies have, on occasion, initiated cases based upon novel \ninterpretations of their own rules, interpretations that have never \nbeen communicated to the regulated community, or the community they are \nregulating. In some cases, the actions have been brought to \nretroactively impose requirements based on some new--some new--agency \ninterpretation of a rule or some new factual determination even where \nthe person against whom the action is brought has reasonably relied \nupon a prior agency interpretation or determination.\n  Moreover, there are situations in which agencies develop complicated \nand ambiguous rules and then seek to punish individuals or companies if \nthey guess wrong as to what those rules mean. At stake in these cases \nare penalties worth millions of dollars, and even Federal imprisonment \nis at stake for some of our citizens.\n  Against this backdrop, I believe the Hutchison amendment contains an \nappropriate and necessary restraint on the authority of agencies to \npursue civil or criminal penalties for the alleged violation of rules \nand circumstances where the imposition of such penalties would plainly \nbe unfair. In large measure, the amendment simply makes explicit or \nclarifies requirements that already exist under the Administrative \nProcedure Act.\n  Moreover, nothing in this amendment prevents an agency from changing \nits interpretation of a rule consistent with the requirements of \nsections 552 and 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act and subject to \nthe protections provided by this section, enforcing the new \ninterpretation prospectively.\n  The Hutchison amendment does, however, prevent the Government from \nextracting civil or criminal penalties or retroactively imposing \nregulatory requirements in cases where the defendant can demonstrate \nthat prior to the alleged violation the responsible agency or State \nauthority told the defendant, either directly or through an \ninterpretation duly published in the Federal Register, that the \ndefendant was in compliance with or was not subject to the rule at \nissue. The ultimate result of this legislation will be, in my view, \nbetter enforcement leading to better compliance, better protection of \nhealth, safety, and the environment and greater respect by the \nregulated community for the enforcement practices of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  So this is an important amendment, and I really hope we can work out \nthe language to the satisfaction of our colleagues on the other side \nand get this amendment passed as soon as we can.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma that we need to \nmove ahead on this bill. We need to have a number of votes today and, \nhopefully, get rid of some of the amendments that we have today and \nmove on.\n  While we have this lull, let me just give my 6th of the top 10 list \nof silly regulations. And I will start with No. 10.\n  Silly regulation No. 10: Prohibiting a person from developing his \nland because it will become a habitat for the endangered salt marsh \nharvest mouse after--get this--after the polar ice caps melt and the \nsea rises. That is No. 10 on my list of silly regulations.\n  Silly regulation No. 9: The owner of a van was in an accident and as \na result 2 gallons of gas leaked out of the van's gas tank. The fire \ndepartment flushed it into a drainage ditch. As a result, the Coast \nGuard attempted to fine the owner of the van $5,000 for ``polluting the \nwaters of the United States.'' That is silly regulation No. 9.\n  Silly regulation No. 8: Prohibiting the sale of a children's toy for \n8 months, sending the company into financial reorganization only to \nadmit the toy should not have been banned at all.\n Yet, it admitted that it was an editorial error.\n\n  Silly regulation No. 7: Attempting to dismantle private homes at a \ncost of $8 million due to lead-contaminated soil, except there was no \nevidence of any lead contamination.\n  Silly regulation No. 6: The General Accounting Office estimated that \nin 1990, the IRS imposed over 50,000 incorrect or unjustified levies on \ncitizens and businesses per year. That makes today's list a list of the \ntop 50,000 silly regulations.\n  Silly regulation No. 5: FDA, which has a legendary bias against \ndietary supplements, tried to assert that the product, black currant \noil--the oil of the fruit, black currants--was not a supplement, but \nrather an unsafe food additive. The FDA's logic was that the oil was \nthe additive added to the food--the gelatin capsule containing the oil. \nTwo different U.S. courts of appeal rejected this.\n  Two different U.S. courts of appeal rejected this unanimously, one \nsaying it was ``nonsensical,'' the other saying it was ``Alice in \nWonderland.'' Those are actual quotes from the courts.\n  Silly regulation No. 4: FDA also banned dietary supplement \nmanufacturers from telling women of childbearing age that folic acid \ncould prevent birth defects in their babies, even though the FDA's \nmother agency, the Public Health Service, and its sister agency, the \nCenters for Disease Control, had publicly issued this recommendation.\n  Let us just talk about lives for a minute. Had the FDA allowed the \ndietary supplement manufacturers to make the absolutely accurate \nclaim--which they, of course, do now--over the last 11 years since they \nhave known about folic acid's 0.4 milligrams of folic acid benefit in \nhelping to prevent neurotube defects, we would have prevented 1,250 \nneurotube defective babies every year for the last 11 years, babies \nborn with spina bifida. That could have been completely prevented had \nthose claims been permitted. The agency, according to some, has known \nabout it for the last 11 or 12 years. To be fair to the FDA, they knew \nabout it for 3 years before they finally conceded that their bias to \nthe dietary supplement was not valid and 0.4 milligrams of folic acid \nwould prevent 1,250 babies a year from having spina bifida.\n  Silly regulation No. 3: FDA has a regulation, the so-called food \nstandard of identity, specifying in great detail the Government-\nmandated ingredients characteristics of French dressing. I might add, \nthey issued no such requirements for any other dressing--Italian, \nranch, or honey-mustard to mention a few--but I am sure they are \nworking on it.\n  Silly regulation No. 2: Seizing $2,000 of a business' bank account \nonly to concede the case against it was baseless, but they still did \nnot return the money because of ``computer difficulties.''\n  Finally, silly regulation No. 1: I want to thank my good friend from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, for bringing today's No. 1 silly regulation \nto my attention. Requiring a woman's clothing store to hire male \nsalesmen and place them in the fitting rooms.\n  Now who in America does not know of some of these silly regulations \nand interpretations of regulations? Who in America doubts that we are \ninundated with this kind of crap? Who in America is not upset about it? \nWho in America does not realize that that is what this bill is all \nabout? We are trying to stop this type of stuff and get regulators to \nbe more responsible. And that is recognizing the fact that many of them \nare and most regulations are, but it is the ones that are not that is \ndriving this country crazy, making us uncompetitive, making it more \ndifficult for this country, in many respects, to be the greatest \ncountry in the world. Frankly, it will be the end of us if we keep \ngoing the way we are going.\n  That is why this bill is so important. That is why we simply have to \ndo a better job about regulating in our society. The Hutchison \namendment, just to end with that, I think, makes a lot of sense. It \nprotects people against silly interpretations of regulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1539 be \ntemporarily laid aside and that Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer \nhis amendment on OSHA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me suggest the absence of a quorum. Did the Chair rule \non that? \n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. HATCH. I withhold.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I \nthink we are making good progress on the Hutchison amendment. \nHopefully, that will be resolved very quickly.\n  The unanimous-consent request just agreed to says we now go to the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts dealing with OSHA \nexemption. Hopefully, we can come to a quick time agreement on that and \ndispose of that amendment.\n\n\n                            Rescissions Bill\n\n  I make one other plea. It is Friday morning, and we still have not \npassed the so-called rescissions package. Mr. President, I believe \nabout 90-some percent of the Senate agrees with passing the rescissions \npackage. I was at the White House earlier this week and President \nClinton said he hoped the Senate would pass it very quickly.\n  I believe there is one or maybe two colleagues that still have some \nopposition to that package. But I urge that they come forward and agree \nso we can save the taxpayers $9 billion and we can get some much-needed \nrelief to victims of disasters in California, Oklahoma, and other \nplaces. I think it is vitally important.\n  It is also important for us in the appropriations process so we can \nhave those amounts. It would make a big difference on the \nappropriations levels for 1996.\n  I certainly hope we can pass the rescissions package before we leave \ntoday.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. I also see my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts on the floor. I appreciate his \ncooperation, as well. I hope that we can enter into a time agreement on \nhis amendment very soon.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I just hope we can get some votes. We have \nhad a lot of speeches. We have not had any votes. It is now 11:30. Many \nof our colleagues have plans this afternoon. But if we are going to \nspeak all morning, we are going to have to vote all afternoon. It is \nall right with me, as long as everybody understands that. I hope we can \nget time agreements so we can make more progress on this bill today.\n  Our attendance is good. I think most people planned on being here all \nday today, and we will be here all day today and, hopefully, we will be \nvoting all day today. If we can get time agreements, as suggested by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, it certainly would be helpful.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the majority leader will yield, I think there is good \nattendance and there was some progress made. The Senator from Texas \noffered an amendment this morning----\n  Mr. DOLE. I think Senator Biden has been negotiating.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes. I think progress has been made. It is an amendment \nthat has purpose which I think is shared widely and broadly, and there \nis progress being made on that language. I believe Senator Kennedy is \non the floor ready with his amendment, as well.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can we agree to a time agreement?\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator agree to a time agreement? Great.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me comment, too, that I hope we can \ncomplete our work on a couple of additional amendments this morning and \nwork well into the afternoon. I have talked to a number of our \ncolleagues, and we are prepared to stay late into the afternoon to work \non these amendments. So I encourage the leader to continue to hold us \nhere and continue our work.\n\n\n                            Rescissions Bill\n\n  I did not have the opportunity to listen to my friend, our colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, about the rescissions bill.\n But I hope we can resolve that matter at some point as well. We have \nmade an offer that, in my view, is a good-faith offer. We have laid \ndown three amendments, and we are prepared to work under very tight \ntime agreements there. We could have that bill on the President's desk \nby the end of the week. We can do it today.\n\n  I hope that we can accommodate the Senators who have expressed an \ninterest simply in being heard on some very important issues. They have \nagreed to limit their amendments. They have agreed to a limited amount \nof time. We have had a number of other colleagues that have expressed \nan interest in modifying the bill, who have said in the interest of \nmoving the bill, they will withhold doing that at this time.\n  So we are really at a point where a couple of Senators simply want to \nhave the right to offer an amendment. I do not think that is too much \nto ask. Hopefully, we can resolve that and move on with rescissions. We \nare here to work, and we will be here this afternoon. I encourage \neverybody who wants to participate in the debate to do so and come to \nthe floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the bill open for amendment at this time?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, is he willing to agree to a \ntime agreement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest one-half hour equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, we would need at least 45 minutes to be able to make \nour presentation. I do not know what will be necessary on the other \nside. Why do we not get started, and we can try and work that out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that Scott Garrison, a legislative \nfellow with the Oversight Subcommittee staff, have floor privileges \nduring consideration of S. 343.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from \nMassachusetts--he said he would need 45 minutes. Why do we not get an \nhour and a half time agreement, and we can yield back time if we do not \nneed all of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us just move ahead and see where we are.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think we would do well to get a time agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why do we not get started on it. It is not my intention \nto take a great deal of time. We would like to get moving and start on \nit.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1543 to Amendment No. 1487\n   (Purpose: To provide that certain cost-benefit analysis and risk \n  assessment requirements shall not apply to occupational safety and \n health and mine safety and health regulations, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1543 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 46, insert between lines 4 and 5 the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 629A. Inapplicability to occupational safety and \n       health and mine safety and health regulations\n\n       ``This subchapter shall not apply to any standard, \n     regulation, interpretive rule, guidance, or general statement \n     of policy relating to--\n       ``(1) occupational safety and health; or\n       ``(2) mine safety and health.\n       On page 50, insert between lines 15 and 16 the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(4) This subchapter shall not apply to any standard, \n     regulation, interpretive rule, guidance, or general statement \n     of policy relating to--\n       ``(A) occupational safety and health; or\n       ``(B) mine safety and health.\n       On page 96, insert between lines 20 and 21 the following \n     new sections:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, the purpose and effect of this amendment \nis simple and straightforward; that is, to exempt the rulemaking by the \nMine Safety and Health Administration and Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration from the cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment provisions of S. 343 and to substitute in their place the \nmore sensible provisions of the Gregg-Bond OSHA reform bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator from Massachusetts take 40 minutes, and we \nwill take 20 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We would like 45, if we could. It is my understanding it \nwill be without a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. There will be a motion to table.\n  Mr. HATCH. A total time of 1 hour is fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, we have 45 minutes, and the Senator \nhas 15; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is fair.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Kennedy amendment be \nsubject to an hour time agreement, with 45 minutes devoted to Senator \nKennedy, and 15 minutes under my control, and that there be no second-\ndegree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment takes the exact \nlanguage from the Gregg-Bond OSHA reform bill, S. 562, and applies it \nto OSHA and MSHA, as well. Rather than imposing a duplicative new layer \nof rulemaking procedures, the amendment requires that, along with the \npublication of a final rule, the Secretary of Labor publish a \ncertification that the rule was developed using good science and that \nits benefits justify its costs. That is basically what has been the \nrecommendation of those that are supporting S. 343, that we are going \nto use the best in science and we are going to make sure that the \nbenefits are going to justify the costs.\n  It is that test, that criteria, that was introduced by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and Senator Bond, and five other \nRepublicans, to be the test that would be applied in terms of the OSHA \nlegislation. We are accepting that as an additional requirement on the \nexisting cost-benefit ratio, so that we will be complying with the \nspirit of the legislation and doing it in an effective way, \nparticularly with regard to these two agencies that make such a \ndifference in terms of the protections of the health and safety of the \nworkers.\n  The purpose of this amendment is simple and straightforward: To \nexempt the rulemaking by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and \nOSHA from the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment provisions of \nS. 343, and to substitute in their place these more reasonable \nprovisions.\n  The Mine Safety and Health Act has been a tremendous success--an \nexample of sensible regulation that has saved lives without \ncompromising, in any way, the productivity of the industry. For 25 \nyears, the act has contributed to a steady decline in deaths and \ndisease among mine workers, while productivity has improved \ndramatically. Mine explosions were once common; today they are rare. \nBlack lung disease was once a fact of life in the coal fields. Now it \nis much less prevalent--cut by two-thirds.\n  The charts I have behind me demonstrate what has been the record over \nthe period since 1969 when the MSHA was actually put into effect, in \nterms of mine safety. If you look here, coal mine fatalities are \nrepresented by this falling line here, and coal mining productivity is \nrepresented by the rising blue line here. We have seen a dramatic \ndecline in terms of fatalities since the time MSHA was actually put \ninto place, and what we have seen is a dramatic increase in \nproductivity.\n  This legislation is working. This legislation is working, providing \nfor the protection of workers, and also, as I indicated, productivity \nfor the mine operators. This is another example of the coal mining \nfatality rate, where we have seen a dramatic decline in terms of the \nfatalities in the mines of this country.\n  In 1968, a coal miner was five times more likely to be killed while \nworking than he would be today. Since 1968, coal mining productivity \nhas increased 80 percent. With that kind of record, it is clear that \nMSHA has provided the kind of commonsense regulation that every mining \nfamily and every American are looking for.\n  Mining and its hazards create the kind of risk that must be \nregulated. MSHA's concerns are cave-ins, where tons of rock crush \nminers to death, underground fires that burn miners to death or \nasphyxiate them, and methane gas explosions. These are dangers that \nhave been present for decades.\n  These are the tragic mine accidents that occurred in recent years:\n  The Wilberg Mine fire, 1984, that killed 27 Utah miners.\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\n  Magma Copper Mine (1993), where an underground mine structure \ncollapsed and killed four Arizona miners.\n  The Grundy Mine explosion (1982) that killed 13 Tennessee coal \nminers.\n  Golden Eagle Mine (1991) where a methane explosion injured 11 \nColorado miners.\n  Solvay Trona Mine (1995) in Wyoming, where a collapse trapped two \nminers for days and one died of a heart attack.\n  Marianna Mine fire (1990), where an explosion and fire injured 11 \nPennsylvania firefighters.\n  We do not have to elaborate on the risk assessment and peer review \npanels like those required by the bill to tell us that excessive coal \ndust levels cause black lung disease. Congress, based on unquestioned \nscience, made that judgment in the Mine Act of 1969. We debated it and \ndiscussed it. We had hearing after hearing after hearing. All the \nmedical science indicates it.\n  Why put that particular regulation at risk? Why would we waste \ntaxpayer dollars, forcing the labor Department to respond to petitions \nquestioning whether proper risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses \nwere done for the law's ventilation and dust standards? Who complains \nto the Congress about these standards? It is not the mining industry. \nRichard Lawson, who is president of the National Mining Association, \nregards those rules as in large part responsible for the amazing \nprogress of the last quarter century.\n  In March, at an event celebrating the Mine Act's success, this is \nwhat Lawson said. This is Richard Lawson, the president of the National \nMining Association.\n\n       There is no question in my mind, and I don't know of \n     anybody in the entire mining industry that would argue with \n     this statement, that we wouldn't have achieved the results \n     that we have in the past 25 years if we hadn't had a Federal \n     regulatory program and a State regulatory program.\n\n  Now, here we have the miners that are supporting it. And Mr. Lawson's \nstatement represents the mine operators' view of the record of what has \nbeen achieved in terms of increasing productivity and the success of \nthis program. To my knowledge, there is no welling up from around this \ncountry, particularly from mining States, that says that we ought to \nabandon this or change this in a dramatic way and build in all these \nother kinds of additional steps into this to make it effective. Yet, we \nare being asked to do it.\n  Mr. President, if it ain't broke, why fix it? Why would we waste \nagency resources and tax dollars by forcing MSHA to respond to \npetitions by fly-by-night mine operators? They are the ones that are \ngoing to make the petitions. Make no mistake about it. They are the \nones that are going to be asking for the petitions in terms of rules \nand regulations. They will be able to do it. They will be qualified and \nbe able to do that under this proposed legislation.\n  They will seek exemptions from roof support standards or methane gas \nstandards--standards that have saved scores of lives. 1979 to 1983, \nbefore MSHA issued its automated temporary roof support system, 64 \nminers were killed by roof falls while installing temporary support. \nSince the regulation went into effect, no miners have been killed in \nthis way.\n  Who can say how many lives have been saved by MSHA's methane gas \nregulations? The burden is on those who want to change the way the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration goes about its work. The burden is on \nthem to prove that any change would not impede the agency's \nperformance, let alone that the changes are somehow an improvement.\n  Mr. President, no one has even attempted to make that case. Why? \nBecause no one but lawyers and lobbyists, and some mining companies, \nwho want to escape the law that would benefit from the changes made by \nS. 343.\n  Mr. President, the $100 million threshold amendment that the Senate \nadopted will do nothing to help MSHA because regulations that cost less \nthan $100 million have a significant impact on small businesses, and \nare still treated as major rules under the small business impact \namendment which was adopted. Ninety-nine percent of the mines are \nclassified by SBA as small businesses. Virtually every MSHA regulation \nwill be classified as a major rule.\n  Thus, the new MSHA rules have to go through the complex procedures of \nthe bill, and existing rules would be subject to sunset through the \nbill's petition process. Will MSHA standards be repealed under the \nlookback provisions? There is a real reason to worry. Mine operators \nwho want to avoid penalties for noncompliance can be expected to \npetition to have as many rules added to the lookback schedule as \npossible.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would, for a brief question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator.\n  On page 4, line 15 of his amendment, it says if the Secretary cannot \nmake the certification required under section 1(C), he shall notify the \nCongress and publish his statement.\n  1(C) says, the main part there, that the benefits must justify the \ncost.\n  Now, my question is, when the Senator says he cannot make the \ncertification, does that mean he cannot in good conscience make it, or \nhe cannot because he disagrees with it?\n  In other words, is there any limitation on why he cannot make the \ncertification?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, I will come back to that. I would like to make \nthe presentation with regard to what this section provided. Then I will \ncome back to how this proposal, S. 343, undermines the kinds of \nprotections for miners, even with the Levin amendment, which deals with \nhealth standards, but would not apply in terms of the safety standards. \nI will be glad to come back.\n  I want to make the point and the case, which is the obvious case, and \nthat is, if the MSHA program is working, and protecting the lives of \nworkers, and if under the S. 343 we are going to be opening up safety \nand health standards that are working and protecting lives today, the \nburden ought to be on those who say why the present standards are not \nworking.\n  The important question is not whether the various new other \nprovisions are going to be adequate or sufficient or insufficient to \npermit the Secretary, under certain circumstances, to make certain \ncertifications, based upon scientific information.\n  When a person is out there in the mine and has lost a brother in \nthose mines, lost loved ones in the mines, and we see the dramatic \nchange that has taken place in the mines in productivity, that is what \nis before the Senate, not some extraneous provisions about \ncertification based upon other scientific information that is going to \nalter and change.\n  If the Senator has specific recommendations, the specific issuance of \nsafety regulations that he believes under MSHA have been so \nbureaucratic, have been so outrageous, have been so intolerable, those \nare legitimate matters we should debate.\n  What we will debate and show is that because of the steps that have \nbeen taken by MSHA, the mines of this country have become a great deal \nsafer.\n  That is the basic point. It is the basic point of this amendment, to \nsay, look, it ain't broke, why alter it? Why change it? Why risk it? It \nis working and working effectively.\n  I dare say that with regard to occupational health and safety \nprovisions that we have a similar kind of a result as well.\n  If we take, for example, on the OSHA--and as I mentioned earlier in \nthe course of the debate, we find some 100,000 inspections that are \nconducted a year--if we have 99.9 percent good ones, we have done \nextremely well but 100 businesses are still unhappy. And I must say \nthat under the leadership of Joe Dear, the head of OSHA, OSHA has done \nan extraordinary job in bringing that agency into a sensible, \nresponsible position.\n  It always amuses me that when examples are raised about the abuses of \nOSHA, by and large it is under the administration of the previous \nadministration--not of this one.\n  No one can tolerate that it is the previous administration or this \none. We ought to free ourselves. When we have rules coming out and we \nhave 99.9 percent accuracy, solid and sensible and responsible \nissuance, we still will have some that do not make any sense.\n  This is not a bad batting average, particularly when looking at what \nhas happened in the annual occupational fatalities declining under OSHA \nfrom 1947, 1970 and 1993. These are the figures: 17,000, 13,000 and \n9,000. \n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\n  We can look back and we can either take the time of the Senate or not \ntake the time of the Senate. If we looked at the decline in terms of \nfatalities prior to OSHA, even based upon the alterations and change in \nterms of the industrial direction of this country, we still see the \ndramatic, dramatic, dramatic results which I have mentioned. That is, \nthe very significant decline in terms of fatalities.\n  That has to be worth something. We listened to our friends and \ncolleagues talk about the person that issued some citation because the \nfailure of publication of some safety standard say, ``Well, therefore, \nwe ought to abandon this kind of process.'' What we have to do is look \nat the results.\n  If you look at what is happening in terms of the current timeframe, \nunder OSHA, for the issuance of various standard settings, the standard \nsettings which have direct relationship to the killing of workers in \nthe workplace and also occupationally hazardous conditions in it, you \nsee a picture of delay.\n  At the present time the number of years, right here on the bottom of \nthis chart, the number of years to complete the rules --take, for \nexample, the cadmium standards. It has taken 3 years to issue these \nstandards--17 deaths a year. Every year we fail to issue it, 17 deaths, \nplus 78 additional workers developing kidney disease each year.\n  We look at the confined spaces--17 years to issue these regulations. \nIt took 17 years to do it; 54 deaths a year, 5,000 serious injuries a \nyear.\n  The lockout/tagout standards--it took 9 years to get these \nregulations. It has taken 9 years. There were 122 fatal electrocutions \na year. Mr. President, 122 electrocutions a year and 85,000 injuries \nper year that are going to be remedied with the issuance of those \nlockout standards.\n  The process safety management standards, that is to prevent chemical \nexplosions--it has taken 5 years. It has taken 5 years for those. There \nare 26 deaths a year and 150 serious injuries per year. This is the \ntime just on these matters. This is the amount of time it has taken \njust in these areas. Why? Because of hearings, because of peer review, \nbecause of open hearings about re-review, advisory committees, all of \nthe rest of the process that goes on. That takes years and years and \nyears.\n  If my colleagues want to extend all of those right out here and right \nacross this, then you go ahead and implement S. 343. That is the basic \nresult. Because of the series of petitions, the lookback provisions, \nthe ability for various companies and corporations who are going to be \naffected by these standards to petition, we will undermine safety \nstandards.\n  Who is out there to say that these kinds of factors, that we have \ndemonstrated have a direct impact on the safety of working conditions \nfor Americans, should not be addressed? Of course they should be \naddressed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see others who wish to address this \nissue on the floor. I yield myself 2 more minutes and then I will be \nglad to yield to the Senator from Illinois and then I will be glad to \nanswer some questions on this.\n  But what we are basically saying is that we have a challenge as a \ncountry and a society to ensure that the workplace is going to be as \nsafe as we can make it. There are always going to be accidents. But we \nought to have, as a society, the sense that we are not going to be just \nproducing widgets more efficiently and effectively and more dangerously \nthan any other industrial country in the world. We should make every \nsingle attempt to try to make sure that the workplace is going to be \nsafe and secure.\n  By and a large, the employers of this country are desirous to do it. \nAnd many of the States have moved ahead in very creative and \nimaginative ways, like the State of Washington, Oregon, other States as \nwell, in terms of developing systems to be able to do that. And we are \nencouraging it and want to work and try to find more effective ways.\n  But the fact of the matter is, at the same time that we are seeing \nthis wholesale assault that we are seeing on MSHA, reducing their \nbudget by a half, we are also complicating their lives with limited \nresources to be even more dilatory in the publications of rules and \nregulations that have a direct correlation to the safety and security \nof those that work in the mines and those that work in other hazardous \noccupations.\n  All we are saying at the present time is, first of all, we have OSHA \nreform regulation that is before the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee that is being considered at the present time and on which we \nhave had hearings. We have recommendations that have been made by our \nRepublican friends on that committee--I yield myself 2 more minutes--by \nRepublican friends on that committee, to try to work out ways to \naddress, in a very important and significant way, some of the abuses \nthat have been there. We are trying to work together to do that.\n  But what is happening now here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, S. \n343, is, under the guise of regulatory reform, putting in danger the \nworking conditions of workers in the mines of this country, in the most \nhazardous industry. Make no mistake about it, in the most hazardous \nindustry in this country we are affecting, in an adverse way, \nprotecting the health and safety of those workers without a single \nhearing and without any kind of due consideration. That is wrong. That \nis wrong.\n  For that reason I hope our amendment will be accepted.\n  To reiterate, if their petitions are granted, the rules will all be \nscheduled for review in the first 3 years.\n  This is particularly troubling because MSHA's budget is not growing; \nthe Agency will have fewer people to perform these reviews, not more.\n  The House Appropriations Committee is in the process of slashing \nMSHA's budget, and the congressional budget resolution called for a 50 \npercent cut in MSHA's budget.\n  There is every reason to fear that even a supportive administration \nwill be so overloaded and hamstrung that it will not be able to \ncomplete reviews of all scheduled rules, and they will be repealed, \ndespite their proven effectiveness in savings miners' lives. But there \nis another problem.\n  The bill allows a hostile Secretary of Labor to put every safety and \nhealth standard up for review--and no one could challenge his action.\n  The bill provides: ``The head of the agency may, at the sole \ndiscretion of the head of the agency, add to the schedule any other \nrule suggested by a commentator during the rulemaking under subsection \n(a).''\n  This in an invitation for real mischief. It is no wonder that \nmineworkers and others fear this bill and suspect that its real purpose \nis to roll back the regulations that have helped improve their lives.\n  And what about the future? What is the hope of making further \nprogress in mine safety through sensible regulation, if this bill is \nenacted? If MSHA is forced to respond to a multitude of petitions and \ndevote additional resources to the lookback process, there will be \nfewer resources available to develop new standards to deal with \nemerging threats to miners' lives. And because this bill adds so many \nnew requirements to every rulemaking, each rule will take longer to \ncomplete and will be more expensive to develop.\n  MSHA has an important regulatory agenda, which includes updating 22-\nyear-old air quality standards and addressing the hazards of diesel-\npowered equipment in underground coal mines. Diesel emissions at the \nlevels commonly found underground have been linked to cancer and \nchronic lung disease, and diesel equipment poses the risk of fire or \nexplosion. Rules to address these issues should not be delayed.\n  The same kind of considerations apply to the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration, which--like MSHA--has had tremendous success in \nmaking America's workplaces safer and healthier.\n  We hear anecdotes repeatedly about OSHA's overzealous or misguided \nenforcement, and a small number of those stories are true.\n  But the plain, unvarnished fact is that OSHA and its State partners \nconduct 100,000 inspections a year. The handful of stories we hear \nabout overzealous inspectors involve less than one-tenth of 1 percent \nof OSHA's annual inspections. Yet these anecdotes take on a political \nimportance totally out of proportion to their true impact.\n  What we hear too little about is the tremendous positive impact of \nOSHA \n\n[[Page S9965]]\non the lives of America's working men and women.\n  Since the creation of OSHA in 1970, the fatality rate from on-the-job \naccidents has fallen 57 percent. This is an accomplishment we should \ncelebrate, but almost no one in the Senate or in America ever hears \nthis good news.\n  OSHA has worked. It has saved lives and it continues to save lives.\n  If Congress does not get in the way, I have no doubt that OSHA will \nbe even more successful in the years to come, thanks to the groundwork \nlaid by its current Assistant Secretary, Joe Dear, and Secretary of \nLabor, Bob Reich.\n  Some people have suggested that things improved on their own, that \nindustry was getting safer before OSHA was created, and that OSHA has \nhad no real impact. That is bunk.\n  As the charts I have with me show, it is true that workplace \nfatalities were falling before the act's passage in 1970, but the rate \nof improvement is far greater post-OSHA that pre-OSHA. In the 23 years \nbefore OSHA, death rates fell 43 percent. In the 23 years after OSHA, \ndeath rates fell 57 percent.\n  The real impact of OSHA has been even greater than these rates \nindicate, since such a large number of on-the-job deaths today are \ncaused by murders and homicides which are risks that OSHA has never \nregulated.\n  These are impressive numbers, but they deal with only a small part of \nOSHA's mission. The act's greatest impact is on occupational health, \nnot on accidental, traumatic deaths. And that impact is directly \nattributable to OSHA's regulations and standards, the subject of my \namendment.\n  OSHA's regulations have been enormously successful in reducing the \nharm they were designed to address. Let me mention just a few of them:\n  Cotton dust. In 1978, OSHA issued a standard to protect the Nation's \ntextile workers from brown lung, a crippling and sometimes fatal \ndisease that destroy's the lungs, effectively strangling its victims. \nAt that time, there were 40,000 cases of brown lung among textile \nworkers.\n  Seven years later, after OSHA's standard had greatly reduced the \nlevel of cotton dust in the plants, the prevalence of the disease had \ndeclined to about 900 cases, a 98-percent reduction in the disease.\n  Industry fought the issuance of the cotton dust standard and \npredicted dire consequences. But the industry's cost estimates for \ncompliance turned out to be wildly exaggerated, and it ignored the \neconomic benefits of the standard.\n  As it turned out, the new machines installed to reduce dust exposure \nwere so much more efficient that the industry's productivity and \nprofits increased significantly.\n  The Economist magazine reported that the dust standards unexpectedly \ngave America's textile industry a leg up on the rest of the world.\n  Lead poisoning.--In 1978, OSHA issued a standard to protect workers \nfrom excessive exposure to lead, which accumulates in the blood, \norgans, and bones, causing anemia, brain and nerve disorders, high \nblood pressure, and reproductive illnesses.\n  Within 5 years, the number of workers in lead smelting and battery \nmanufacturing plants with dangerously high levels of lead in their \nblood dropped by 66 percent, from 19,000 to 6,500--12,500 workers saved \nin those two industries, from the disabling and deadly effects of lead \npoisoning.\n  HIV and hepatitis B.--In December 1991, pursuant to legislation \nsponsored by Senator Dole, Senator Hatch, Senator Mitchell, and myself, \nOSHA issued a rule to protect workers routinely exposed to blood or \nother infectious material from HIV, hepatitis B, and other bloodborne \ndiseases. Some people have forgotten the urgency of that standard, now \nthat it has done its job and workers are better protected.\n  But in 1990 there were 65 reported cases of health care workers \nbecoming infected with HIV from on-the-job exposures, and in 1987, \n3,100 health care workers contracted hepatitis B. In 1993, the first \nfull year of employer compliance with the standard, hepatitis B cases \namong health care workers dropped 77 percent.\n  OSHA's job safety standards have also been highly effective.\n  Since OSHA revised its trench standard, which protects workers \nagainst cave-ins, the number of deaths in trench and excavation \naccidents has fallen 35 percent.\n  In a single month in 1977, 59 people were killed, and another 49 were \nseriously injured in grain dust explosions. Since OSHA's grain handling \nrule was issued in 1988, grain dust explosions have fallen by 58 \npercent.\n  No one denies that OSHA's fire protection and fall protection \nstandards save lives, though we tend to forget it until something \ndramatic happens.\n  The Hamlet, NC, poultry plant fire where 25 employees died and 55 \nwere injured, was a tragic reminder of what noncompliance with OSHA \nstandards can mean for workers.\n  The Cleveland, OH, construction site where an OSHA inspector ordered \ncompliance with fall protection just 2 days before a scaffold \ncollapsed, and the two workers' lives were saved because of it, was a \nmore positive reminder of the value of these standards.\n  Few Members of Congress know the facts about these agencies and the \nlaws they administer, let alone the potential adverse effects of \napplying the Dole-Johnston bill to their standards-setting processes.\n  There have been no hearings in the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee on this bill's application to these agencies. The Department \nof Labor has never been given an opportunity to testify about S. 343 or \nregulatory reform by any Senate committee.\n  But one thing is clear, Mr. President, this bill will mean the \naddition of numerous new steps and months and years of delay in \nrulemaking at OSHA and MSHA.\n  OSHA has analyzed the effect the bill would have had on its recent \nissuance of a standard regulating worker exposure to cadmium, a \nchemical that causes cancer and kidney ailments. It estimates that S. \n343 would have delayed the standard by at least 4 years.\n  Is delay somehow a good thing? Has OSHA been too hasty over the years \nin its standard setting? Has it rushed to judgment? Not at all. In \nfact, just the opposite is true.\n  OSHA's rules have been issued at a glacial pace that has constantly \nfrustrated worker safety, regardless of which party controlled the \nexecutive branch. As the charts I have with me show, OSHA's rules often \ntake many years to complete--17 years in the case of the confined space \nstandard.\n  Will the bill's requirements lead to better standards?\n  No. OSHA and MSHA standards are governed by statutes that prohibit \nthe use of cost-benefit analysis as a decisional criterion. And as has \nbeen made abundantly clear, the Dole-Johnston decisional criteria do \nnot override the underlying statutory criteria. Because OSHA must set \nits standards to reduce significant risks of harm ``to the maximum \nextent feasible,'' cost-benefit analysis cannot change the outcome of \nthe rulemaking.\n  What sense does it make, therefore, to require OSHA to do elaborate \nanalyses of the regional effects of a rule or to analyze the costs and \nbenefits of numerous alternatives, when it is compelled by statute to \nchoose the level of protection that reduces the risk to the maximum \nextent feasible?\n  Many Senators apparently believe that OSHA's rules have been too \nonerous and costly. In fact, they have not.\n  As a study recently reported in Scientific American makes clear, \nhealth and safety regulation has been a negligible cause of layoffs. \nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics has for many years asked business owners \nand managers what they perceive to be the cause of layoffs they have \nordered. According to the managers themselves, who are the people in \nthe best position to know, environmental and safety regulations \ncombined only cause one-tenth of 1 percent of layoffs.\n  In fact, OSHA's regulations often cost far less than industry \npredicts. I mentioned the case of cotton dust earlier, where the \nindustry over-estimated the cost of the rule by 400 percent and failed \nto anticipate its benefits.\n  As Business Week magazine pointed out in its July 17 issue, other \nOSHA rules have also had positive economic effects.\n  The vinyl chloride standard, for example, succeeded in wiping out the \ncancer it was designed to prevent, but it also boosted industry \nemployment, productivity, and profits by inducing investments in \nautomated technology.\n  Will the risk assessment provisions lead to better decisionmaking? \nNo.\n\n[[Page S9966]]\n\n  OSHA and MSHA deal with recognized hazards of so great a magnitude \nthat the bill can add nothing useful to their risk identification. \nFollowing Supreme Court cases, OSHA does not attempt to regulate risks \nless than one in a thousand, unlike other agencies that sometimes \naddress risks as small as one in a billion.\n  Will OSHA benefit from the bill's peer review procedures? No.\n   OSHA already employs the most robust peer review procedure of any \nagency in the Government.\n\n  Public hearings are held, on the record, on all proposed OSHA \nstandards. Scientists, lawyers, and technical staff from academia or \nindustry can cross-examine OSHA's staff and experts, submit comments \nfor the record, and critique every document on which the agency relies. \nEvery significant question is answered on the record and in the \npreamble to the final rule.\n  Because the bill's provisions will add nothing but expense and delay \nto worker safety and health rulemaking, my amendment adopts a different \napproach to this subject--an approach endorsed by seven Republican \nSenators and suggested by two of them, Senator Bond and Senator Gregg, \nboth of whom were or are members of the Senate Republican Task Force on \nRegulatory Reform.\n  My amendment takes the language from the Gregg-Bond OSHA reform bill, \nS. 562, and applies it to OSHA and MSHA.\n  Rather than imposing a duplicative new layer of rulemaking \nprocedures, the amendment requires that along with the publication of a \nfinal rule, the Secretary of Labor publish a certification that the \nrule was developed using good science and that its benefits justify its \ncosts. An estimate of the costs and a comparative analysis of the risk \naddressed by the rule would also have to be published.\n  This is the sort of commonsense approach to regulatory reform that \nthe American people want--a guarantee that top government officials \nwill not publish rules without examining their costs and benefits, and \nassurance that they have employed good data and sound science.\n  The people do not want--and Congress should not impose--a rigid, one-\nsize-fits-all bureaucratic maze that will complicate regulation without \nmaking it better.\n  OSHA and MSHA rules have worked. We should not attempt to fix \nsomething that is not broken.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Illinois and then we will \nanswer some questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I strongly support the Kennedy amendment. \nThis bill, as it stands, is a bureaucracy builder, not a bureaucracy \nbuster. I would just point out that Business Week has an article in the \nJuly 15 issue which suggests this is adversely going to affect business \nas well as working men and women.\n  But very specifically, the Kennedy amendment protects MSHA and OSHA, \nand protects working men and women. The Presiding Officer is from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, where there is a lot of coal mining. I am \ndown in southern Illinois. From our home, a little community of 402 \npopulation, Makanda, the biggest big city, if I can call it that, is \nCarbondale, IL, which, as its name suggests, used to be a coal mining \ncity. There are a lot of coal mines around there.\n  I talked to too many people who have lost husbands, fathers, \ngrandfathers in coal mine disasters. I have been at too many entrances \nto coal mines while people wait. I have been to eastern Kentucky. \nCongressman Carl Perkins asked me to go there with him after a coal \nmine disaster in eastern Kentucky. We are not just talking about \nstatistics, those statistics that Senator Kennedy--if I could ask \nSenator Kennedy's staff to put those coal mine statistics up there \nagain?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to put them up there.\n  Mr. SIMON. You do an excellent job at that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. SIMON. Take a look at what happens there. Those are not just \nstatistics. We are talking about the lives of people. That has been a \ndramatic change for coal miners in southern Illinois, in Pennsylvania \nand elsewhere. Why change this when both the industry and the coal \nminers say this makes sense?\n  Let me give it from the viewpoint of OSHA. First of all, OSHA has \njust recently reviewed 33,000 pages of regulations and targeted more \nthan 1,000 of those for elimination. Has OSHA been excessive, had too \nmuch minutiae in what they have been doing? No question about it. We \nhave had too much regulation. But they are dealing with it and I am \nimpressed by Joe Dear, who now heads OSHA, and what he is doing.\n  We had a witness who testified about problems with OSHA. I asked that \nwitness to come that afternoon and asked the head of OSHA to come to my \noffice. He was there. They are moving.\n  Trenches? 1990, trench deaths have fallen by 35 percent, since they \nput in their regulation on trenches.\n  Grain dust, a major problem in Midwest States, deaths from explosions \nin grain elevators. The grain dust--since 1988, according to the grain \nindustry, the fatality rate in the industry has dropped by 58 percent. \nAnd the injury rate has dropped by 41 percent.\n  I would add here, even with the changes that we have made in OSHA, we \nstill have, among the Western industrialized countries, the highest \nfatality and injury rate in manufacturing and in construction of any \nWestern industrialized nation. If you adopt this legislation without \nthe Kennedy amendment, let me tell you, the figures that you see right \nthere on coal mine fatalities are going to go up. Just as certain as I \nam standing here, that is going to be the result.\n  Brown lung: In 1978, there were an estimated 40,000 cases affecting \n20 percent of the industry's work force. I visited with these workers \nin southern Illinois and talked about this problem. By 1985 only 1 \npercent of the textile industry work force was affected by the disease.\n  Here we have OSHA--which, unquestionably, as we all know, has been \nexcessive--getting hold of their situation. They are eliminating over \none-third of the regulations they have. They are doing the job. Let us \nnot interfere with the job that is being done well.\n  The coal miners of Pennsylvania, the coal miners of Illinois, and of \nevery State that has coal mines, would plead with us, if they knew the \ndetails of this, they would plead with us to adopt the Kennedy \namendment. And the same on OSHA.\n  I think it is extremely important that we protect our working men and \nwomen. OSHA is doing an improved job. OSHA is performing. There have \nbeen abuses, like in any good thing. Religion can be abused, education \ncan be abused, affirmative action can be abused, anything can be \nabused. But OSHA basically has been doing a good job and improving the \njob. Let us not risk the future of our workers.\n  I strongly urge the adoption of the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments that we have \nat this time to go through at least some of the types of changes that \nhave taken place in recent times which have made important differences \nin terms of the health and safety of workers in this country.\n  In 1978, cotton dust standards: OSHA issued a standard to protect the \nNation's textile workers from brown lung, a crippling and sometimes \nfatal disease that destroys the lungs and effectively strangles its \nvictims. At that time there were 40,000 cases of brown lung among \ntextile workers. Seven years later, after OSHA, the standard had \ngreatly reduced the level of cotton dust in the plants, the prevalence \nof the disease had declined to about 900 cases, a 98-percent reduction \nin the disease.\n  Those cotton dust standards were brought. The question was about the \nissuance of these standards, whether OSHA was complying with the \nexisting law. That was the statute that had been approved by Congress. \nIt went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of the \nUnited States affirmed that it did. Effectively, that law was being \nchallenged by the major textile companies, and the major textile \n\n[[Page S9967]]\ncompanies had a different standard. The difference standard effectively \nis the kind of standard that is included in this legislation. That is a \nvery practical way of describing and understanding what is at risk.\n  The industry fought the issuance of the cotton dust standards and \npredicted dire consequences. But the industry's cost estimates for \ncompliance turned out to be widely exaggerated, and it ignored the \neconomic benefits of the standard. As it turned out, the new machines \ninstalled to reduce the dust exposure were so much more efficient than \nthe industry's, productivity and profits increased significantly.\n  Here was a major health standard resisted by the industry but saving \nthousands and thousands of workers who were working 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year, trying to bring up a family, working in the kind of \nconditions in which their lungs were effectively closed down. There are \nways of dealing with it--by establishing limitations on the amount of \ncotton dust in the workplace. OSHA issued those regulations. As a \nresult of it, thousands of workers are alive today.\n  That was resisted by the industry, the same industry that supports S. \n343. They did not want those kind of standards then and they do not \nwant future standards to protect the workers in those workplaces now.\n  That is what this thing is all about. You can talk about other \nthings, such as trying to bring the most important and significant new \nscientific data. We are all for it; that is, the provisions to make \nsure there is an adequate review of the risk benefits and the bringing \nof the best in terms of the certification.\n  But when you have to wait months and years and years for the issuance \nof standards that can make a difference in terms of the lives of \nworkers, why are we so willing to throw those out? Who on the floor of \nthe Senate could say that there is an uproar across this country, by \nindustries all across this Nation, or by workers that we are being \nclosed down, that we are being put out of business? It is to the \ncontrary, Mr. President.\n  A recent publication of Business Week talks about how industry in a \nnumber of different areas resisted the kind of health and safety \nstandards for their industry, made wild claims about the cost and about \nwhat is it was going to mean in unemployment and all the rest. And \nafter they implemented these various health and safety standards, they \nincreased their profitability and productivity because the workers were \nable to work and work effectively and work harder.\n  Take another example: lead poisoning. In 1978, OSHA issued a standard \nto protect workers from excessive exposure to lead which accumulates in \nthe blood, organs and bones causing anemia, brain and nerve disorders, \nhigh blood pressure and reproductive illness. Within 5 years the number \nof workers in lead smelting and battery manufacturing plants with \ndangerously high levels of lead in their blood dropped 66 percent--from \n19,000 to 6,500--12,000 workers saved in those two industries from the \ndisabling and deadly effects of lead poisoning--12,000 workers.\n  All of us here in the Senate want to work to find ways of eliminating \nirrational, irresponsible bureaucratic rules and regulations. But when \nyou are talking about saving 12,000 workers from either death or \nserious injury, and you want to change the process, you want to change \nthe way it is done, you want to open up the door for a lot more \nindustries that are being directly required to implement those health \nand safety standards, you are putting at risk the lives and the well-\nbeing of those workers. Where is the outcry? Where is the outcry from \nour colleagues in terms of safety?\n  As I mentioned earlier in the presentations, the statements that are \nmade by the organizations of miners have indicated that the kind of \nwork that has been done in mine safety has been consistent with the \nincreasing productivity.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as chairman of the Small Business Committee \nand chairman of the Regulatory Relief Task Force, I am looking forward \nto the opportunity to discuss the problems at OSHA and some potential \nsolutions. I believe we will have this debate in earnest after next \nJanuary 1, when Congress will finally have to comply with the \nCongressional Accountability Act. For the first time, thanks to the new \nRepublican Congress, we will ourselves get a feel for what we have \nfoisted upon the private sector for a generation, through OSHA \nregulations and the Fair Labor Standards Act and many others from which \nwe have until now exempted ourselves. This amendment focuses attention \non the Gregg-Bond OSHA reform bill sooner than I expected.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire and I introduced the OSHA reform \nbill in April, we tried to address many of the problems we had heard \nabout from our constituents. And believe me, we have had complaints. We \nhave had complaints of OSHA overreach and OSHA overzealousness from \nvirtually every sector of employment: from bakeries to construction \ncompanies to restaurants and retailers to roofers to colleges and \nuniversities--we have heard about problems.\n  Now, I don't for 1 minute advocate abolition of the agency. I believe \nthey are charged with an important public purpose: that is, protecting \nthe health and safety of the American worker. No one disputes the \nimportance of the purpose of the agency. But in this case, enforcement \nhas been a problem.\n  Yesterday I outlined some of the examples of OSHA silliness: material \nsafety data sheets for common household products, material safety data \nsheets which are required at every worksite but never looked at by the \npeople they are supposedly protecting, and fines without purpose and \nwithout merit.\n  I hate to tell some of the inside-the-beltway, stuck-in-the-past\n   crowd this, but safe business is good business. I have always \nbelieved that most employers have the best interests of their employees \nat heart. In many cases, employer and employee are neighbors, or \nmembers of the same church or parish, or have kids that attend school \ntogether. Employers want the best for their employees, and vice versa. \nBut even those few employers who do not care are concerned about the \nbottom line. With the rising costs of worker's compensation, most \nemployers want to do everything in their power to promote safety and \nhealth.\n\n  But OSHA still lives in the past, and takes an adversarial role to \nbusiness. Instead of helping businesses comply with the many rules and \nregulations they set forth, they send an inspector--who may or may not \nknow anything about the type of business they are inspecting--to a \nworksite to try to find as many violations as possible. The Gregg bill \nwould codify OSHA's little used onsite consultation program, through \nwhich Federal funds are used to provide technical assistance to \nemployers to assist them in complying with OSHA standards. That way, a \nhospital administrator who is uncertain about specific steps her nurses \nshould take to comply with the bloodborne pathogen standard or the \nforeman at a construction site uncertain about how many ladders and \nrails should go up to meet the fall protection standard could call the \nregional OSHA office and have someone come out to help them come into \ncompliance with the law. Consultation is a part of our bill, but the \nSenator from Massachusetts has left that, and other good provisions, \nout of his amendment.\n  I would like to devote a few moments to discussion of the cost \nbenefit and risk assessment provisions the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas included in his amendment. As he indicated, he has taken language \ndirectly from the Gregg bill. I am delighted that he agrees we should \nexamine all OSHA rules, and not just those over $100 million. Perhaps \nit would not be too big a step to support the rest of the Gregg OSHA \nreform bill as well. But I must say, frankly, the cost benefit and risk \nassessment provisions in S. 343 are an improvement over what we \nenvisioned in this bill. I think the Senator from New Hampshire would \nagree that we did not envision S. 526 as the ``be all and end all'' of \nOSHA reform. We are open to new ideas and improvements. And many of \nus--Senators Dole, Johnston, Roth, Nickels, and others--have spent the \nlast several months working on the fine points of what is needed to \nachieve a\n fair regulatory system.\n\n  There are several important elements of S. 343 that Senator Kennedy \nhas left \n\n[[Page S9968]]\nout of his amendment, including judicial review, the requirement that \nagencies use the least costly option to implement a proposed rule, and \nthe opportunity for affected businesses to petition the agency for \npermission to implement an alternative method of compliance.\n  To carve out a special exemption for OSHA from the regulatory process \nwe have laid out in S. 343 is just plain silly. S. 343 clearly permits \nrules affecting the health and safety of the American people to go into \neffect without delay. But if the Kennedy amendment were adopted, we \nwould not have the opportunity to get rid of some of the silly OSHA \nregulations already on the books, that we have heard about over and \nover during the last few days. Businesses would not have the \nopportunity to petition for a review of material safety data sheets for \nJoy detergent, for instance.\n  So the Senator from Massachusetts has suggested that he will take our \nold language on the cost benefit and risk assessment verbatim, knowing \nthat we prefer the new language. So I must ask my colleague from \nMassachusetts, why not take the whole bill?\n  Why not release the small business men and women of this country, \nincluding those in Massachusetts, from the burden of excessive \npaperwork and the threat of recordkeeping fines, as the Gregg bill \ndoes.\n  Why not release the small business men and women of Massachusetts, \nMissouri, and every other State from the threat of an OSHA citation--\nthat is, fine--in each and every circumstance where a violation is \nfound--even those that do not put workers at risk or where the employer \nacts immediately to correct the program. Our bill would give OSHA \ninspectors the discretion to issue a warning in lieu of a citation in \nthose cases where either there is no danger to the workers or the \nemployer has acted in good faith to correct a violation quickly.\n  Further, why not release the small business men and women of this \ncountry, who create the new jobs that provide paychecks to families, \nfrom the burden of large fines for paperwork, recordkeeping, or other \nrelatively minor violations, as the Gregg bill does.\n  Those are the reforms we need in OSHA; we do not need to change the \ngood language we have agreed on regarding reform of the regulatory \nprocess to accommodate the bureaucrats at OSHA.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains? I know there are \nothers who want to speak on this and are also interested in shortening \nthe period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 10\\1/2\\ minutes \nof his time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from Massachusetts \nwill agree to a unanimous consent to reduce both sides by 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time does that leave us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would leave the Senator from \nMassachusetts approximately 5 to 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will put the question. I ask unanimous \nconsent to reduce the time allotted to both sides by 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I rise in strong, strong opposition to the amendment proposed by our \nfriend, Senator Kennedy. This amendment exempts OSHA. It exempts it \nfrom cost-benefit or risk assessment under this bill.\n If we are going to do that, why have a bill?\n\n  I heard my colleague say we are interested in safety and if you are \nnot--almost imply that if you want this bill, you are not interested in \nsafety, and that is totally incorrect.\n  Mr. President, I happened to be an employer before coming to the \nSenate. I wish I had all the OSHA volumes that are required for a small \nmanufacturer. I wish I had those. They would not fit on this desk. And \nif you have 60-some-odd employees, you have reams and reams and reams \nof volumes, mostly written by unnamed bureaucrats that know very little \nabout business telling you what to do, subjecting you to fines and \npenalties if you do not subscribe. To say that they should be exempt \nfrom cost-benefit or risk assessment is totally wrong--totally, \ncompletely wrong. I happen to care about public safety and the safety \nof our workers and any workers in America as anybody on this floor, but \nwe need to rein in unnecessary regulations. That is what this bill is \nabout. They should not be exempt.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to support our motion to table the \nKennedy amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, as I listened to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, you would have thought we were repealing OSHA and MSHA, \nrepealing the underlying law that protects workers and miners.\n  Mr. President, this bill, the Dole-Johnston amendment, specifically \ntakes into consideration that all of the standards of existing law \nremain in effect and are not overridden or changed.\n  Now, the Kennedy amendment is based on two false premises. First, \nthat good science is somehow an enemy of health and safety. It is \nexactly the opposite. And second, that somehow the Dole-Johnston \namendment does not allow you to take into consideration the value of \nlife, health and safety. And the amendment specifically states that \nadministrators, or agency heads may take into consideration and \nincrease the cost of regulation in order for benefits, nonquantifiable \nbenefits to health, safety, or the environment.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment, while on the one hand \nseeming to suggest that you have to have benefits justifying the costs, \nin another provision about which I asked him, all the administrator has \nto do, if he does not want to comply with the fact that the benefits \nhave to justify costs, is say he cannot do it. Why can he not do it? \nWell, he might not in good conscience be able to do it. He might not be \nable to do it because he disagrees. He might not be able to do it \nbecause he wants not to.\n  And what does he do if he does not make this certification that the \nbenefits justify the costs? All he has to do is publish it and send a \ncopy to the Congress and no problem. In other words, Mr. President, \nthis permits the administrator to waste the taxpayers' money because \nadmittedly the benefits do not justify the costs and no problem; we \nwill continue to do business as usual and waste the taxpayers' money \nwithout helping health and safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue is are we going to put at risk \na set of procedures which have worked and which we want to perfect and \nwhich the committee is considering and on which we are prepared to work \nwith our Republican colleagues by accepting a standard of using good \nscientific information and good cost-benefit analysis as was in the \nGregg-Bond bill.\n  This is not something that was dreamed up by this side. It is a \nstandard which has been included by seven Republicans to require a \ncertification that there will be sound cost-benefit relations and the \nbest in terms of scientific information will be available. We are \nprepared and urge that that be added to the existing criteria. But to \nsay, well, we are prepared to use a complete new kind of way of \nregulating the health and safety of workers in the workplace as \nsuggested in this bill I think is a great disservice and puts at \nserious risk the health and well-being of workers in this country.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas just over 4 minutes; the majority has 5\\1/2\\.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair. \n\n[[Page S9969]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would just like to say as chairman of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, that there is no way that either the \ncommittee or this body would ever put at risk the lives of American \nworkers. That is not what is in question here. And I find it very \ntroubling that that is the message being conveyed on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We would all agree that health and safety standards are enormously \nimportant. That is why there has been support over the years for OSHA. \nOSHA addresses workplace hazards by issuing safety and health \nstandards. That has not been the question. But OSHA has also become one \nof the most intrusive of all Federal agencies, and that is one of the \nprimary reasons why we need regulatory reform.\n  I do not understand, as the Senator from Illinois mentioned, why coal \nmining fatalities would increase simply because we would do a stronger \ncost-benefit analysis of regulations promulgated since April.\n  There has been much made about Senator Gregg's legislation which was, \nof course, drafted and introduced without knowing whether there would \nbe a significant regulatory reform effort. Since we are now dealing \nwith regulatory reform in this Chamber, Mr. President, OSHA must be \nconsidered as part of that process. And I think Senator Gregg's \nlegislation, as he would acknowledge himself at this point, has been \novertaken by events.\n  It is really very sad to me that somehow, some in this Chamber would \nsay that workers' lives were being placed at risk when all we are \ntrying to do is to make the regulatory process work in a positive and \nconstructive way.\n  The Senator from Illinois acknowledged that OSHA itself is working to \neliminate about one-third of their regulations. They are recognizing \nthat changes need to be made. We have held two hearings in the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, and we heard from many witnesses that \nchanges must be made. But I think in no way does this regulatory reform \nlegislation undermine that positive effort.\n  I do not know how much time I have remaining, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. If I may yield myself another minute or two, I would \nask the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Let me just give you an example. For instance, OSHA \nis currently working on its indoor air quality regulation that it \nestimates may cost the business community about $8 billion to \nimplement. This indoor air standard, according to OSHA, will prevent \nsome respiratory diseases such as sick building syndrome, which can \ncause asthma, lung irritation, and other congestion.\n  Yes, that surely is a problem in some workplaces, but we are not \ntalking about putting a price tag on human life necessarily in this \ninstance. We are talking about congestion and irritation, and we are \ntalking about a process that may become so regulatory and burdensome \nthat we might lose the opportunity to have an effectively functioning \nwork force. And we threaten our workers' job security when the burden \nbecomes so onerous to both the business side and the work force side. \nTo its credit, OSHA is now carefully examining that proposed \nregulation.\n  There has to be a balance. It has to be a positive one. There has to \nbe worker protection through health and safety standards that operate \nto the benefit of both employer and employee. I would just suggest that \nthis is not the time or the place to undermine the efforts that are in \nthis legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 seconds. Because of the failure of \noccupational health and lung and respiratory standards, the Department \nof Registry of Motor Vehicles in my State of Massachusetts just closed \ndown. So I think it is something that is serious, at least in my State.\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Illinois and the remaining time \nto the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in response to my friend from Kansas, the \nreality is what we are doing is we are putting in effect a procedure \nthat will lengthen the time in which MSHA and OSHA can respond to \nproblems.\n  She mentioned indoor air quality. I do not know very much about it. I \nknow I have been in some factories and it has been great. I have been \nin others where there clearly is a problem. We want balance, but why \nlengthen this procedure that is already one that takes years?\n  It just looks like a blip on the chart when you see the coal mine \nfatalities go up in 1984. I remember when we cut back on the number of \ncoal mine inspectors and that went up, and then we put more back in and \nyou see the line go down.\n  What we are doing is making it harder to get standards that make \nsense. I want balance. The Senator from Kansas wants balance. We will \nhave that with the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Illinois \nthat his 1 minute has expired. The Senator from Massachusetts yielded \nthe remaining time to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, which will clarify our Nation's policy toward protecting \nthe American worker by exempting the mine safety and health regulations \nfrom the subjective cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nrequirements in this proposed bill.\n  Recently, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, recognized \nthe 25th anniversary of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, \nwhich has led to a quarter-century of effective life-saving health and \nsafety regulations in mining. On this anniversary, mine workers, \nmanagers, and owners all praised MSHA's achievements.\n  I believe Members of the Senate need to pause and consider the \nhazardous conditions and the risks to which hardworking miners are \nexposed.\n  During the 3-year period prior to passage of the act, an average of \nmore than 250 workers died annually in coal mining accidents. \nConversely, between 1992 and 1994, the average number of annual coal \nmining deaths totaled fewer than 50.\n  In addition, cases of black-lung disease, caused by inhalation of \ncoal dust in the mines, have been reduced in the last 25 years by an \naverage of 75 percent, and the prevalence of black lung disease among \nminers has declined by more than two-thirds.\n  I strongly support MSHA's efforts in improving mining safety \nconditions, and I am thankful for the lives saved because of the \npassage of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act 25 years ago.\n  I urge all Members to support the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts to assure all American miners that our Nation's \nprosperity will not come at the price of their health and well-being.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield back all time remaining on our \nside and move to table the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will note that the Senator from \nMassachusetts still has 17 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts yields back his \ntime.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? \n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 1543. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] \nand the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to respond to some unfortunate \nremarks that were made by my friend from Ohio, Senator Glenn, regarding \nsome of the constituents of mine who have been mistreated by Federal \nagencies. These are examples, over each of the last 4 days, that my \ncolleagues have heard me speak about on the floor of the Senate. And I \nused these examples of my constituents being mistreated by the \nbureaucracy as evidence of the need for the regulatory reform bill.\n  It is very interesting that my colleague from Ohio was interested \nenough in my constituents to go to those Federal agencies that had \nabused them and to get some talking points for their defense. I can \nunderstand wanting to get the story straight. We should all want to do \nthat. But as most of us know, relying on an agency for the truth can be \na big mistake. I say that to say the very least, because, after all, we \nare not----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, can we have order in the Chamber so the \nSenator from Iowa can be heard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is correct. Will \nthe Senate please come to order and Senators take their conversations \nto the cloakroom so that we might have order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, really the only person I care who hears \nthis is Senator Glenn. But if everybody else wants to listen and see \nhow what I said these last few days is accurate, I am going to go into \nthose points. But, as I said, Senator Glenn went to the agency and got \ntheir side of the story. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as \nthey get the truth. But as most of us know, relying on an agency for \nthe truth can be a big mistake, and I say that at the very least. After \nall, we are not having hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge and Whitewater \nbecause Federal agencies and officials always tell the truth.\n  Now, in regard to the incident I related on Monday, about Mr. Higman \nof Akron, IA--that is in northwest Iowa, not Ohio--Akron, IA, northwest \nIowa. Mr. Higman's was the gravel company that some of you may have \nheard me use as an example.\n  Senator Glenn stated that a Federal magistrate and a U.S. attorney \napproved the search warrant. That is all very true. But, as I said in \nmy remarks on Monday, the Federal agencies, including even the \nmagistrate and U.S. attorney, were relying on a phony informant who, by \nthe way, was a disgruntled employee. And, by the way, Mr. Higman was \nacquitted. As I said, he, in the process, has lost $200,000 in either \nlegal fees or lost business.\n  There were supposed to be firearms and machine guns on the property. \nWhat did they find? They found a loaded .22 used for rats and varmints, \nnot a shotgun as was alleged by my friend from Ohio. And it is not a \ncrime to have a loaded .22 rifle on your property. Of course, if the \nATF and some of my colleagues had their way, there would be millions of \npeople in hot water for having a loaded .22 on their property.\n  As for the so-called toxic waste that was on the property, the \nSenator from Ohio made an unfortunate insinuation that it could have \nbeen cyanide or something deadly. So, what was it? It was some drums of \npaint thinner. Maybe paint thinner should not have been on the \nproperty. But at least the Senator from Ohio acknowledged that Mr. \nHigman was acquitted. But then the Senator said that he found that Mr. \nHigman did not do it knowingly. The fact is, Mr. Higman did not do it \nknowingly because he did not do it at all. He did not do it at all. Who \ndid store the waste on Mr. Higman's 300-acre property without Mr. \nHigman's knowledge? It was the paid informant that the EPA used. This \npaid informant, who, by the way, was offered $24,000 by EPA, was \nactually paid only $2,000. This paid informant had taken this waste, \nhid it on the property, and tried to sell it to people. And who did the \nFederal agencies go after? They went after the innocent small business \nowner, Mr. Higman, who was set up by this disgruntled employee.\n  The fact remains that innocent people were subjected to very harsh \ntreatment by a large force of Federal agents, with guns brandished, \nbecause the owner had a .22 rifle.\n  Remember, this is a story where I said a shotgun was pointed in the \nface of an accountant sitting at her desk doing accounting. Where is \nthe rationality of all of this? You know the story of Federal law \nenforcement agencies out of control. These are all getting too \ncommonplace. And to defend these actions only makes things worse. We \nwill have a lot about Waco and about Ruby Ridge to consider in this \nprocess.\n  There is one other instance that the Senator from Ohio used, and it \nwill take me a couple of minutes and I will yield the floor. This is in \nregard to the grain elevator problem I talked about, the grain elevator \nproblem where EPA made a rule that assumed that every grain elevator in \nmy State was going to operate 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, emitting \npollution into the air when, if one little elevator operated that long, \nthat would be able to process all of the 10.3-billion-bushel corn crop \nof the entire United States. How ridiculous can the regulation be?\n  The Senator from Ohio said that the EPA is aware of this problem and \nthat the EPA is working on this problem. The only reason the EPA is \naware of this problem, and supposedly is working on this problem, is \nbecause I have introduced a bill to solve this problem and because I \ngrilled Carol Browner, the EPA Administrator, on this problem before a \ncommittee. Ms. Browner has been so-called working on it now for 9 \nmonths and the problem is still there. The regulation is still on the \nbooks. And we are not getting very far.\n  As a matter of fact, the EPA has refused to communicate with the Feed \nand Grain Association since May, despite the statement of the Senator \nfrom Ohio that the EPA is working with the grain elevator operators and \nowners.\n  My question is, why was the EPA not aware of the problem before \ninitiating such a stupid rule in the first place, and hence the need \nfor this legislation? And even Ms. Browner acknowledges that this rule \ndoes not make sense. But do we see any changes yet? No. Because this is \nanother example of Federal bungling and Federal inertia, and, hence, \nthe need for this legislation.\n  So I want Senator Glenn to know, I want EPA to know, that I stand by \nmy constituents and, regardless of whether \n\n[[Page S9971]]\nU.S. Senators or Federal agencies bring their reputations into \nquestion, these people were and are still innocent small business \npeople, trying to get by without being strangled by an out-of-control \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer an amendment in behalf of Senator \nWellstone and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Illinois \nthat amendment No. 1539, offered by the Senator from Texas, is pending.\n  Mr. SIMON. I ask unanimous consent that be set aside so this \namendment can be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1547 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n   (Purpose: To exempt rules and agency actions designed to protect \n                        children from poisoning)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], for himself and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 1547 to amendment \n     No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n       ``(g) Exemption for the Protection of Children.--None of \n     the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to agency rules \n     or actions intended to protect children against poisoning, \n     including a rule--\n       ``(1) relating to iron toxicity poisoning;\n       ``(2) relating to lead poisoning from food products; or\n       ``(3) promulgated under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act \n     of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.).\n       On page 49, line 21, strike ``or''.\n       On page 50, line 2, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; or''.\n       On page 50, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(F) a rule or agency action a purpose of which is to \n     protect children from poisoning, including a rule--\n       ``(i) relating to iron toxicity poisoning;\n       ``(ii) relating to lead poisoning from food products; or\n       ``(iii) promulgated under the Poison Prevention Packaging \n     Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that I think we have an \namendment that will be agreed to. It is very simple. It says: None of \nthe provisions of this subchapter shall apply to agency rules or \nactions intended to protect children against poisoning; including a \nrule, and it specifies three:\n  Iron toxicity poisoning. We had 28 children die of iron poisoning and \nthose kinds of injuries in the last 3 years;\n  Relating to lead poisoning from food products. That is, cans that \ncome in from other countries that use lead soldering in the top of the \ncans;\n  Third, promulgated under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act to \nprotect children.\n  I believe my colleagues, Senator Hatch and Senator Levin, find the \namendment acceptable. I do not want to speak for them.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept this amendment. I \nhave to say there are some who are concerned about any exemption at \nthis point in the bill. But I am prepared to accept it on behalf of the \nmajority. I presume that the minority is prepared to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are not only prepared to accept the \namendment, but we commend our friends from Illinois and Minnesota for \noffering this amendment and for pointing out the importance of so many \nof our regulations on health and safety and the risk that we take if we \nproceed down a road which might jeopardize some of those regulations \nunnecessarily or needlessly.\n  We certainly accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Is there further debate on the \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The amendment (No. 1547) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we still want to have a few more votes \ntoday. It is my understanding that the Domenici amendment is being \nworked on, and the Hutchison amendment is being negotiated. We are \nhopeful that we can resolve both. If we cannot, in the case of \nHutchison, I just suggest we get it up and vote on it, and do it as \nsoon as we can. So that our colleagues need to understand what is going \non. If there are any other amendments that should be brought to the \nfloor at this time, I would sure like to have them so we can move \nahead.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There will indeed be other amendments available should we \nwant to proceed on additional votes. We are working currently on the \nHutchison amendment, I understand, and on the Domenici amendment as \nwell. They may be ready soon.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wonder if it would not be a wise thing \nfor the interim periods like this when we do not have anything else to \ndo, when we are waiting for people to come with their amendment, if we \nlaid down amendments, such as the Glenn amendment, and debated them. \nThere are a lot of differences between the two bills. That would be the \nbest way for people to become informed on what is going on and what the \ndifferences are. It is also a methodology for us to get together and \nsee if we can resolve some of the difficulties between the two bills. \nAnd then we will have a vote on the Glenn amendment as soon as we can, \nso everybody knows.\n  I think that also would help diminish the total number of amendments \nthat we have. We would like to finish this bill and finish it as soon \nas we can. I think everybody is starting to feel that way. There is no \nreason for the delays.\n  In the meantime, I do not see any reason why those who have \namendments should not be here right now presenting their amendments. We \nwill set aside temporarily the Domenici and Hutchison amendments and \nallow any amendment to be presented.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is our intention to lay down the Glenn \nsubstitute today. Senator Glenn is not here because of an illness in \nthe family. Even in his absence, we intend to lay that down. I think it \nis important that the differences between the Glenn-Chafee amendment \nand the Dole-Johnston approach be laid out clearly. There are many \nremaining differences. There are many remaining issues to be resolved \nin the Dole-Johnston substitute for which amendments will be offered.\n  So even though Senator Glenn cannot be here, the Glenn-Chafee \namendment will be laid down a little bit later on this afternoon. In \nthe meantime, we are trying to resolve these other two amendments. \nThere are other amendments available.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I also ask the minority, since we have been \naccepting amendments over here and I understand there is really no \nlogical or real objection to the Snowe bottled water amendment, I think \nwe ought to get that accepted and move it through.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not familiar with the Snowe amendment. I am happy to \nbecome familiar with it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Thomas amendment is one that can be accepted \non your side. I think we could move those out of the way. We could \ncertainly be moving forward on those. As soon as you give approval on \nthat, we will go ahead.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not familiar with them. I assume our staff is.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, my remarks are not related to this \nlegislation, if the managers need to interrupt my remarks. My remarks \nwill not last long. But I do want to make them today in person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9946-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9972-S9974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9972]]\n\n\n   TRIBUTES TO SENATOR JOHN C. STENNIS AT HIS FUNERAL IN MISSISSIPPI\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, a number of us on the floor of the Senate \npaid tribute to our former colleague, John Stennis, shortly after his \ndeath on April 23 of this year.\n  From the days when he was the youngest judge in Mississippi, through \nhis time as President pro tempore of this body, when he was third in \nthe line of Presidential succession, John Stennis was a man of \nintegrity, honor, judicious temperament, and great personal kindness.\n  A robber took the Phi Beta Kappa key he had worn since his graduation \nfrom the University of Virginia Law School--and almost took his life--\nbut no one could ever take away the courage, kindness, and humility of \nthis giant who served in this body for more than 41 years. He married a \nyoung home demonstration agent who had come to his county to help farm \nfamilies improve their lives, and together he and Miss Coy demonstrated \nfor 55 years what a happy, loving home could be. He loved his family, \nhis country, and his State, and his great affection for the people of \nMississippi was returned in equal measure.\n  A large delegation of both Democrats and Republicans, led by Senators \nCochran and Lott, journeyed to Senator Stennis' hometown, DeKalb, MS, \nfor his graveside service on April 26. The service beautifully \nsymbolized the life of John Stennis. It was simple, but powerful and \ninspiring, reflecting the quiet dignity, wisdom and humility that \ncharacterized the man.\n  Today I would like to enter into the Record the remarks made at \nSenator Stennis' funeral on April 26, 1995, at Pine Crest Cemetery in \nDeKalb, MS, by his son, John Hampton Stennis, and his minister, the \nReverend Jerry Allan McBride, as well as the tribute sent by President \nClinton, and a number of other tributes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those tributes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nA Service in Thanksgiving for the Life of the Honorable John Cornelius \n        Stennis, Pinecrest Cemetery, DeKalb, MS, April 26, 1995\n\n\n                    remarks of john hampton stennis\n\n       My sister, Margaret Jane, and I as we grew up in Kemper \n     County during the mid-1940s were required to memorize \n     passages. My mother handled the Bible; by father taught us \n     patriotic sayings and poems.\n       First was the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the \n     United States of America. Daddy taught from the small plaque \n     I now hold. We were in the midst of World War II. He \n     illustrated the meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance by Judge \n     Learned Hands' address at ``I Am an American day,'' entitled \n     ``The Spirit of Liberty'':\n       ``The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure \n     that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which \n     seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the \n     spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests \n     longside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty \n     remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; \n     the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two \n     thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never \n     learned, but has never quite forgotten; that there may be a \n     kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by \n     side with the greatest.''\n       His patriotism did not consist of short and frenzied \n     outbursts of emotions, but in the tranquil and steady \n     dedication of a lifetime.\n       My father's oldest sister, Aunt Janie, had given him a copy \n     of One Hundred and One Famous Poems With a Prose Supplement. \n     We learned almost all these poems; I shall share a few lines \n     from some.\n       From ``Be Strong,'' Maltbie Davenport Babcock:\n\n     Be strong!\n     We are not here to play, to dream, to drift;\n     We have hard work to do, and loads to lift;\n     Sun not the struggle-face it; 'tis God's gift.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     Be strong!\n     It matters not how deep intrenched the wrong,\n     How hard the battle goes, the day how long;\n     Faint not--fight on! To-morrow comes the song.\n\n       From ``A Psalm of Life,'' Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:\n\n     Tell me not, in mournful numbers,\n       Life is but an empty dream!--\n     For the soul is dead that slumbers,\n       And things are not what they seem.\n\n     Life is real! Life is earnest!\n       And the grave is not its goal\n     Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\n       Was not spoken of the soul.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     Let us then be up and doing,\n       With a heart for any fate:\n     Still achieving, still pursuing,\n       Learn to labor and to wait.\n\n       From an unknown poem about a young boy who watched his \n     father to go to the field behind a mule-drawn plow at sunrise \n     and return at dusk:\n\n     I believe my father had a pact with God\n     To guide his plow and keep his furrow straight.\n\n       Finally, from Micah 6:8 of the New English Bible:\n\n     God has told you what is good;\n     and what is it that the Lord asks of you?\n     Only to act justly, to love loyally,\n     to walk wisely before your God.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               sermon by the reverend jerry allan mcbride\n\n       When all is said and done, the most important words that \n     will be said about John Cornelius Stennis will not be that he \n     was a great statesman and United States Senator. He was \n     certainly all of that; but he was so much more. In all of the \n     ways by which we measure value in our society and our world, \n     the person and spirit of this man transcended common worth. \n     For the measure of John Stennis is found in his character and \n     dignity. To his wife, he was a devoted husband and partner. \n     To his children and grandchildren he was a loving father and \n     grandfather and a wise teacher. To his friends he was a man \n     whose friendship could always be counted on. To his country \n     he was a leader who found his ``power'' only in the \n     commitment to service. And to his state he was a shining \n     example for the very best that is in all of us.\n       Above all, John Stennis was a man of faith. He spent his \n     life in ministry that was just as dedicated as if he had \n     donned the clerical robes of a minister in his beloved DeKalb \n     Presbyterian Church. John Stennis believed that success was \n     ultimately measured in terms of how faithful he was to the \n     trust that the people had placed in him. And by all accounts, \n     the trust of the people was never betrayed, and although he \n     rose to the highest levels of political power, he never \n     forgot who sent him, and what his mission was. I was so very \n     touched when\n      I walked into the Senator's home. It is a true monument to \n     the goodness of John Stennis and his family. The \n     simplicity of this great man's surroundings spoke of an \n     inner wisdom and a real sense of what is ultimately \n     important; and what is not. John Stennis never forgot \n     where he came from and subsequently he never forgot who he \n     was. The great prophet of social justice in the eighth \n     century B.C., Micah, ask the question, What is it that the \n     Lord asks of you?'' And the answer, ``to act justly, to \n     love loyally, and to walk wisely before our God,'' \n     describes the life of this true servant of the people.\n       So we gather today for all of the reasons that people come \n     together at a time like this. We gather to celebrate the long \n     and meaningful life of John Stennis, and we gather to mourn. \n     Both are part of the cycle of creation. This great man meant \n     so much to so many, and even though I did not know him \n     personally, he knew me. And he knew all of the people who \n     farmed the land, and worked the hills, and built the towns \n     and cities of this our beloved state. John Stennis knew all \n     Mississippians, and all Americans, and for that matter all \n     people everywhere, and he left us such a legacy, and an \n     example of how to live life as a public servant and a citizen \n     of the world.\n       In the cynical, ego centric, and violent world which we \n     live, it is important that we follow the good example that \n     John Stennis has left us. He was so many things. He was ever \n     a gentleman who never forgot that integrity was the only way \n     to fully honor the trust of the people. He was a man of \n     civility who never forgot that there is a right and a wrong \n     way for men and women to disagree, and then come to a \n     solution that will benefit the common good. Above all, John \n     Cornelius Stennis was a man who, when he saw injustice would \n     have no part of it, and he called us all to a higher standard \n     of fairness and justice. He was a man who\n      believed that service meant giving to others rather than \n     gathering for himself.\n       In his campaign literature for the 1947 senatorial race, \n     John Stennis stated what would be the standard for his life \n     and his public service when he wrote.\n       ``I want to go to Washington as the free and unfettered \n     servant of the great body of the people who actually carry \n     the burden of everyday life. I want to plow a straight furrow \n     right down to the end of my row. This is my political \n     religion and I have lived by it too long to abandon it now. I \n     base my appeal to you on this simple creed, and with it I \n     shall rise and fall.''\n       By all accounts, John Cornelius Stennis always remembered \n     the ``great body of the people who actually carry the burden \n     of everyday life.'' He remembered them because he was one of \n     them. And by all measures, it can be said that John Stennis \n     did in fact ``plow a straight furrow.'' And not only did he \n     plow it, but he watered, and tended, and harvested, and then \n     he plowed again, and harvested again. John Stennis plowed the \n     straight furrow and we are better because of who he was and \n     what he did for everyone of us. We will miss John Stennis but \n     because of the fruits of his life, which were justice, \n     compassion, and integrity, we will never forget the furrow he \n     plowed.\n\n[[Page S9973]]\n\n       The liturgy, for Burial, is characterized by joy, in the \n     certainty that ``neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor \n     principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor \n     powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all \n     creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in \n     Christ Jesus our Lord''.\n       This joy, however, does not make human grief unchristian. \n     The very love we have for each other in Christ brings deep \n     sorrow when we are parted by death. Jesus himself wept at the \n     grave of his friend. so, while we rejoice that one we love \n     has entered into the nearer presence of our Lord, we sorrow \n     in sympathy with those whom mourn.\n       May the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   April 25, 1995.\n     To the Family and Friends of Senator John C. Stennis:\n       Hillary and I were deeply saddened by Senator Stennis' \n     death, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy.\n       During more than four decades in the United States Senate, \n     Senator Stennis proved himself to be a wise leader and a \n     devoted patriot, consistently earning the respect of his \n     colleagues and the support of the people of Mississippi. A \n     grateful nation will honor his memory next December with the \n     commissioning of the John C. Stennis, the next Nimitz class \n     aircraft carrier. His positive influence on our nation's \n     defense policies, his insistence on ethics among public \n     officials, and his many personal examples of bravery remain \n     an inspiration for all Americans.\n       John, Margaret, and the rest of you are in our thoughts and \n     prayers.\n     William J.

Stennis; Longtime Senator\n\n                      (From a Times Staff Writer)\n\n       Former Sen. John C. Stennis (D-Miss.), a deeply religious \n     defense hawk who served four decades in the Senate and \n     exercised a major influence on U.S. military policy, died of \n     pneumonia Sunday afternoon at St. Dominic Hospital in \n     Jackson, Miss. He was 93.\n       Nicknamed the ``Conscience of the Senate'' for his personal \n     rectitude and his efforts to shape the upper house's code of \n     ethics, Stennis retired in 1988. He had undergone \n     cardiovascular surgery in 1983 and a year later had his left \n     leg amputated because of a malignant tumor in his upper \n     thigh.\n       As chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee \n     for 12 years, beginning in 1969, Stennis played a key role in \n     fighting off deep cuts in the defense budget. He opposed \n     judicial efforts to desegregate public schools in 1964, but \n     three decades later he supported extending the Voting Rights \n     Act.\n       Close to eight presidents, Stennis was the last of the \n     classic Southern gentlemen who so forcefully shaped the \n     character of the mid-century Senate. He was crusty yet \n     courtly, a stern moralist with an almost mystical devotion to \n     the Senate.\n       ``He was a great senator in every way,'' Sen. Thad Cochran \n     (R-Miss.) said Sunday. ``He was effective, respected and \n     deeply appreciated by the people in Mississippi. He was truly \n     a man of great stature.''\n       Stennis himself was more modest about his place in history. \n     ``How would I like to be remembered?'' he mused in a 1985 \n     interview. ``I haven't thought about that a whole lot. You \n     couldn't give me a finer compliment than just to say, `He did \n     his best.'''\n       Despite his genteel manners, Stennis could be tough. Early \n     in 1973, when the senator was 71, he was held up by two young \n     hoodlums in front of his home in northwest Washington. They \n     robbed him and then shot him twice. One bullet pierced his \n     stomach, pancreas and colon.\n       Surgeons at the Army's Walter Reed Hospital at first \n     doubted he would survive. But then-President Richard Nixon, \n     emerging from Stennis' hospital room, predicted that the \n     senator would make it because ``he's got the will to live in \n     spades.'' Within eight months, Stennis was back on the Senate \n     floor.\n       Stennis attributed his remarkable recovery to prayer and to \n     his excellent physical condition, achieved from years of \n     exercising in the Senate gym.\n       ``I just prayed that I could be useful again,'' he said, \n     reflecting on his ordeal. ``That's what the consuming thought \n     was, the consuming question--could I survive and be useful I \n     decided that I could.''\n       Stennis displayed a different kind of toughness in 1954 \n     when he served on the select committee that probed charges \n     against the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarty (R-Wis.) and became \n     the first Senate Democrat to call for censure of the free-\n     swinging Wisconsin lawmaker. Although Stennis was a dedicated \n     conservative and an outspoken foe of communism, he was \n     offended by McCarthy's tactics.\n       During the censure debate, Stennis rallied support from \n     many colleagues who had been afraid to attack McCarthy. In a \n     vigorous speech, he accused McCarthy of besmirching the \n     Senate's good name with ``slush and slime.''\n       That same year Stennis was one of the first members of \n     Congress to caution against U.S. involvement in Indochina.\n       In a Senate speech delivered when the Eisenhower \n     Administration was considering intervention to prevent a \n     French disaster in Vietnam, Stennis presciently warned that \n     committing U.S. ground forces could lead to ``a long, costly \n     and indecisive war.''\n       Yet 11 years later, when President Lyndon B. Johnson made a \n     large scale commitment to fight in Vietnam. Stennis loyally \n     backed his commander in chief. ``Once the die is cast and \n     once our flag is committed and our boys are sent out to the \n     field, you will find solid support for the war from the \n     South,'' he said.\n       He also firmly backed defense spending throughout his \n     career, supporting the Pentagon even when the Vietnam War \n     made weapons procurement unpopular. ``If there is one thing \n     I'm unyielding and unbending on, it is that we must have the \n     very best weapons.'' he once said.\n       As the Vietnam War wound down, however, Stennis co-\n     sponsored the War Powers Act of 1973, which limits the \n     President's power to send troops into combat without \n     congressional consent.\n       Senate liberals clashed frequently with Stennis on subjects \n     ranging from defense spending to civil rights, but they \n     invariably praised him for his fairness and courtesy.\n       And those were the qualities he praised.\n       From the time he entered politics in 1928 as a member of \n     the Mississippi Legislature, he tried to base his life on \n     this motto: ``I will plow a straight furrow right down to the \n     end of my row.''\n       That slogan reflected his rural background. John Cornelius \n     Stennis was born Aug. 9, 1901, in DeKalb, Miss., and grew up \n     on a cotton and cattle farm in what he described as the \n     ``poor end of the poor end'' of his state. He graduated from \n     Mississippi State University and the University of Virginia \n     Law School, and served as a district attorney and circuit \n     judge before entering politics.\n       His Scots Presbyterian parents taught him to appreciate the \n     value of a dollar. ``I was raised to believe waste was a \n     sin,'' he once said. Stennis practiced that belief with a \n     vengeance: He carefully saved all the string from packages \n     that arrived at his home.\n       As a courtly Southern gentleman, Stennis was known to \n     interrupt a Senate committee hearing to find a seat for a \n     woman spectator. But he had little tolerance for miniskirts \n     and other modern feminine trends.\n       When a female Senate aide once sat on a sofa wearing a \n     skirt that exposed a good deal of her thigh, Stennis averted \n     his eyes and grumbled to a colleague: ``I'm going to get a \n     bolt of cloth so that lady can finish her dress.''\n       After his retirement, Stennis served as executive-in-\n     residence at the Mississippi State University campus in \n     Starkville. The university houses the John C. Stennis \n     Institute of Government and the Stennis Center for Public \n     Service, created by Congress.\n       ``I do believe the most important thing I can do now is to \n     help young people understand the past and prepare for the \n     future,'' Stennis said in 1990. ``As long as I have energy \n     left, I want to use it to the benefit of students.''\n       Stennis is survived by two children. His wife, Coy Hines \n     Stennis, whom he always called ``Miss Coy,'' died in 1989.\n                                 ______\n\n     Ability to Adapt Helped Stennis Endure and Mississippi Advance\n\n                     (By Butch John and Jay Hughes)\n\n       U.S. Sen. John C. Stennis was remembered Sunday as a man \n     willing and able to adapt to sweeping change in Mississippi \n     without surrendering his dignity or his devotion to its \n     people.\n       A staunch segregationist during his early years in the U.S. \n     Senate, he became an enthusiastic proponent of equality for \n     all Mississippians in his later years, former state \n     Democratic Party Chairman Ed Cole said.\n       ``He had a deep and abiding respect for people, even when \n     they disagreed with him. He had a deep and abiding faith in \n     the good of people, all people,'' said Cole, the first black \n     political professional employed by Stennis.\n       Hired in 1981 to work in Stennis' Jackson Congressional \n     Office, Cole said Stennis, 93, who died Sunday of pneumonia, \n     never forgot the people who helped his four-decade career in \n     the U.S. Senate.\n       And his state won't forget him, said Gov. Kirk Fordice, who \n     ordered flags at state offices lowered to half-staff in \n     mourning for Stennis.\n       ``All of Mississippi mourns for John C. Stennis, one of the \n     outstanding Americans ever to serve in the United States \n     Senate,'' Fordice said. ``His service to this state was long \n     and faithful.''\n       Fordice, a Republican said he once served on Stennis' local \n     reelection committee in Vicksburg at the senator's request, \n     ``probably as a note of bipartisanship.''\n       ``He was that kind of guy,'' Fordice said. ``In the olden \n     days I think there was a lot less partisanship.''\n       Stennis never fell prey to many politician's flaw of \n     forgetting the people who put him in office, Cole said.\n       ``I was constantly amazed how he remembered the small \n     things people did for him--seven, eight, nine races before,'' \n     Cole said. ``He would often have you drive up a back road to \n     see some farmer who nobody knew about, and nobody knew Sen. \n     Stennis knew anything about. He never forgot them.''\n       Others who knew him said he never lost his down-home touch \n     despite a rocketlike rise to some of the most powerful \n     positions in the Senate.\n       ``We used to travel some together, go around in the \n     district and to other places. He always would tell me, `Let's \n     get some ice cream; that's my weakness.' Wherever we were, \n     we'd go get it. That was just the way he was,'' said 3rd \n     District U.S. Rep. Sonny Montgomery, who served with Stennis \n     for 23 years.\n\n[[Page S9974]]\n\n       ``He was one of the stalwarts for the state of \n     Mississippi,'' said state Sen. David Jordan of Greenwood, who \n     as an early civil rights supporter found himself on the other \n     side of Stennis' pro-segregation stand.\n       ``I would have liked to have seen him more open to all of \n     the state. We didn't always have the access to him that some \n     of the white folks had. But over the years he changed. He \n     became a statesman for all of the people.''\n       Former Lt. Gov. Evelyn Gandy said Stennis remained in close \n     contact with state officials throughout his stay in \n     Washington. When there was a problem, she said, Stennis would \n     make a point to fix it.\n       ``His heart was with the people of Mississippi, and he \n     responded to their needs, and he helped those of us who were \n     elected at the state level to respond to those needs,'' she \n     said.\n       Rex Buffington, Stennis' press secretary from 1978 until \n     the senator retired in 1988, said the key to Stennis' power \n     sprang from his reputation.\n       ``A lot of that came from being committed to doing the \n     right thing. A lot of his power and influence came, not just \n     from the positions that he held, but from the esteam that \n     people held him in,'' Buffington said.\n       Buffington said he admired Stennis long before going to \n     work for him, and when he took the job he was concerned that \n     in Washington he would find a man much different from his \n     public reputation.\n       ``What I found when I got there was just the opposite. He \n     was an individual who was even greater than that wonderful \n     image,'' he said. ``It was incredible, really, working for a\n      legend, and one who lived up to and even exceeded his \n     reputation.''\n       Almost immediately after leaving office, Stennis' health \n     began to seriously fail and he was forced to drop out of all \n     public life, Buffington said.\n       ``The senator that we knew has really been gone for a \n     while,'' he said. ``It was as though when he left the Senate \n     he finally let go.''\n       Buffington now serves as executive director of the Stennis \n     Center for Public Service at Mississippi State University. It \n     was created by Congress in 1988 to attract young people to \n     public service careers.\n       Former Gov. William Winter campaigned for Stennis when \n     Stennis first ran for the Senate in 1947. He later served as \n     his legislative assistant.\n       ``He represented, to me, what a public leader ought to be \n     like,'' Winter said. ``His total commitment to public \n     service, his integrity, his impeccable personal character and \n     his qualities as a true gentleman.''\n       ``During his service in the United States Senate, \n     Mississippi had one of the most effective and highly \n     respected senators that this or any other state ever had,'' \n     Winter said. ``We shall not soon see his like again.''\n       Others echo Winter's assessment.\n       ``He truly was a man of great stature. He will long be \n     remembered as one of the finest senators Mississippi ever \n     produced,'' said U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, a former colleague. \n     ``He never said anything bad about anybody else and looked \n     for the good in others. He was appreciated for that. People \n     noticed that.''\n       Former Gov. Ray Mabus, currently ambassador to Saudi \n     Arabia, called Stennis ``a statesman for the ages.''\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, John C. Stennis devoted his long life to \npublic service. He encouraged, taught, and inspired many Senators and \nSenate staffer members, and was the model for many young people who \nhave entered public service, not only in Mississippi but throughout \nthis country. The John C. Stennis Center for Public Service at \nMississippi State University continues that work with programs for \nyoung people and for current public servants at the local, State, and \nFederal level. Starting with the 103d Congress, the center began \nconducting leadership workshops for senior congressional staff members. \nSenator Stennis' strong commitment to honorable public service will \nlive on through the work of the Stennis Center, and through the \ncountless lives he influenced.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that both sides have agreed to \naccept this amendment. Therefore, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment is acceptable on this side. \nMy understanding of the amendment, and I would like perhaps \nconfirmation of this from my friend from Utah, is that this amendment \ngets into the problems that have been created for the bottled water \nindustry by the delay in getting the rules which they are waiting for \naccepted and promulgated.\n  If my understanding is correct, this is an instance where it is the \nbusiness community that wants the rule. Sometimes we think it is the \nbusiness community alone that is bothered by burdensome regulations. \nThere have been too many instances where there have been burdensome \nregulations. There has also been many instances where there were \ncritically necessary regulations, and the struggle we are going through \nis to try to come up with reform which will leave in place the \nessential process to protect our health and safety.\n  But my understanding of this amendment is that in the case of the \nbottled water industry, we have an industry which has been waiting for \nregulation, asking for regulation in order to stop people from \nrepresenting on bottled water that it, for instance, might be spring \nwater if it is just tap water.\n  We need, we are told by the bottled water industry, the agency to \nact, and the delay in this is actually hurting an industry.\n  So this is an instance where it is the industry which is trying to \nget through a regulatory process, trying to get a rule which will both \nprotect it from bottled water which is misrepresented as something \nother than it is not, and we also had the situation where this was \ncaught up in a moratorium.\n  One of the arguments against the moratorium is while it may sound \ngood at first blush, the problem is we have a whole lot of businesses, \nas well as people, waiting for safety and environmental and health \nrules, that are awaiting the regulatory process to work.\n  I have not had a chance to study this amendment, and I want to make \nsure my understanding is correct, but it is my understanding that the \npurpose of this amendment is an attempt to get the bottled water \nregulations finally adopted; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, the Senator has stated it correctly. \nThis is the situation where regulation can be a very good thing if it \nis appropriately done. And, in many cases, it can be a very good thing. \nAnd so I commend the Senator from Maine for bringing it forth at this \ntime. I believe the Senator is correct. I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to first thank the majority leader \nand Senator Hatch for working with me and Senators Cohen, Kempthorne, \nLeahy, and Lieberman on this amendment. Throughout this process, they \nhave clearly demonstrated their strong support for the bottled water \nindustry and for bottled water consumers, and they deserve to be \ncommended for their cooperation and good work.\n  I also wanted to clarify a couple of points that were raised during \nthe discussion on the amendment between Senator Hatch and Senator \nLevin. First, it is definitely correct that the amendment is supported \nby the bottled water industry. In fact, this legislation has been one \nof the bottled water industry's biggest priorities for the past couple \nof years.\n  Second, Senator Levin referenced the FDA's standards for defining \nspring water. This amendment does not apply to the FDA's spring water \ndefinition rules. It applies only to public health standards for \nbottled water.\n  In addition, I wanted to point out that the big issue here is more \nthe discrepancy in timing between the EPA's and the FDA's issuance of \nrules for tap water and bottled water, respectively, than it is the \nbottled water industry's level of enthusiasm for Federal regulation. \nThe bottled water industry does have an interest in the promulgation of \nreasonable regulations that provide additional assurances of the safety \nof its product, but the industry's biggest interest is in making sure \nthat the FDA does not take too long in issuing its regulations for \nbottled water after the EPA promulgates regulations for tap water. And \nI will explain why in a moment.\n  I also wanted to thank Senator Kempthorne, who chairs the \nSubcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife, for his \nassistance in getting this amendment adopted. My motive in offering the \namendment to the regulatory reform bill was to provide another option \nby which we can get the legislation enacted, giving it a better chance \nof ultimate success. But I think it is important to recognize that \nSenator Kempthorne has been working on this issue as part of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act reauthorization bill that he is now drafting, and \nthat he will continue to do so as that bill moves through the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I commend him for his efforts \non this issue, and I look forward to working with him during the SDWA \nreauthorization process so that we can give this urgently needed \nlegislation another opportunity for eventual adoption.\n  Mr. President, my amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Cohen, \nKempthorne, Leahy, and Lieberman, is designed to make the regulatory \nprocess for\n bottled water more efficient and responsive, while expanding health \nprotections for the consuming public.\n\n  Under current law, bottled water is considered a food product, and is \ntherefore subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. My \namendment requires the FDA, which has jurisdiction \n\n[[Page S9976]]\nover bottled water, to publish final regulations for a contaminant in \nbottled water no more than 6 months after the EPA has issued \nregulations for that same contaminant in public drinking water or tap \nwater.\n  Unfortunately, the FDA has a history of long delays in issuing its \nregulations for bottled water after EPA publishes its standards for tap \nwater. On December 1, 1994, FDA published a final rule for 35 \ncontaminants in bottled water. Nearly 4 years earlier, however, in \nJanuary 1991, the EPA regulations for these contaminants had already \nbeen issued.\n  In another case, it took the FDA 4 years to issue regulations for a \nseries of volatile organic chemicals in bottled water after the EPA \nissued regulations for those chemicals in public drinking water in \n1989. And presently, final regulations for 23 new contaminants in \nbottled water are still pending at FDA, even though the EPA's version \nof the regulations went into effect in January 1994--a year and a half \nago.\n  While the FDA takes its time, bottled water producers and consumers \nare left in limbo. In the absence of Federal standards, the bottled \nwater industry, which is composed of 430 bottling facilities in the \nUnited States, is vulnerable to charges that its product is unsafe. In \nfact, the Administrator of the EPA suggested publicly on two occasions \nthat bottled water was not fully protected because the FDA had not \nissued certain regulations that had already been issued by the EPA for \npublic drinking water.\n  Of course, charges that bottled water is unsafe or unprotected \ncouldn't be further from the truth. Bottled water is subject to strict \nindustry safety standards and to various State rules. But the Federal \nstandards do provide an important additional assurance for consumers \nnationwide. Without these standards, consumers may question whether \nbottled water is really a safe, natural, and healthy alternative to tap \nwater, and sales in the industry could be unnecessarily dampened. Not \nonly do consumers lose when the bureaucracy drags its feet, but an \nindustry that employs thousands of Americans loses.\n  My amendment will ensure a more expeditious response in the future. \nIn addition to the 6-month deadline for new contaminants, the FDA will \nbe given 1 year to issue final regulations for contaminants that the \nEPA already regulates, but that have not yet received new FDA standards \nfor bottled water. If the FDA fails to meet either the 6-month or 1-\nyear deadlines, the existing EPA standard is automatically implemented \nfor bottled water.\n  In some cases, FDA may determine that a particular contaminant \nregulated by EPA does not occur in bottled water. My amendment would \nallow the FDA to simply publish such findings in the Federal Register \nbefore the deadline periods expire.\n  The amendment also stipulates that in all cases, the FDA standards \nfor bottled water must be at least as stringent as the EPA's standards \nfor public drinking water. The bill does reserve the FDA's right to \nissue more stringent standards, however, adding an extra measure of \npublic health protection, if necessary.\n  It is my hope that this amendment will prompt the FDA to coordinate \nits regulatory activities for drinking water with the EPA from the \nbeginning, before either agency issues a notice of proposed rulemaking. \nBy coordinating in this process, the agencies could issue their \nregulations at roughly the same time. The amendment would therefore \nhave the effect of improving the efficiency of the Federal regulatory \nprocess--something all of us agree is necessary--while enhancing health \nprotections for consumers. It represents a clear win-win proposition \nfor all of our constituents.\n  The bottled water industry generates $2.7 billion in sales annually, \nand it serves millions of American consumers, with the potential to \nserve even more. Surely, these producers and consumers alike deserve \nthe kind of consideration from\n their Government that my amendment guarantees. I am pleased to see \nthat Senators on both sides of the aisle agree and support the \namendment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to be a cosponsor of Senator \nSnowe's amendment which is the exact language of S. 412 regarding \nbottled water quality standards. Like many other enterprises from heart \nsurgery to hang-gliding, the bottled water industry needs nationwide \nregulations that ensure the quality of its product.\n  The Food and Drug Administration [FDA] has been very slow in issuing \nregulations that guarantee a particular standard of quality. In fact, \nthe FDA has lagged behind the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], \nsometimes by a matter of several years. The net result is that some \nwater companies can legally distribute water that is less healthy than \nordinary tap water. This is bad for consumers, bad for honest \nbusinesses, and underscores one of the reasons why our Nation is \nsupportive of regulated standards.\n  I am particularly interested in this amendment because of a Vermont \nbusiness that has a clear interest in enforceable standards of quality. \nThe Vermont Pure Springs Company of Randolph Center, VT, is one of the \ngreat success stories of Vermont's growing specialty food industry. \nVermont Pure Springs produces, in my opinion, the best bottled water in \nthe world--Vermont Pure Natural Spring Water. In fact, I invite each of \nmy colleagues to stop by my office to taste this water--I keep about a \ndozen bottles of Vermont Pure water in my refrigerator.\n  Each bottle of Vermont Pure Natural Spring Water contains water that \nis naturally filtered through Vermont mountain rock strata for at least \n12 to 20 years. Some of Vermont Pure Springs' competition comes from \ncompanies whose water is not only not as pure as Vermont Pure, but may \nin fact have pollutants that are illegal in tap water. Since its \nbeginning in 1990, Vermont Pure Springs has been seeking the regulatory \nguidance in this amendment to ensure its water is known throughout the \nworld and guaranteed by our Government as Vermont Pure.\n  The provisions of this bill ensure that whenever the Environmental \nProtection Agency issues new standards for drinking water, the FDA will \nhave 180 days to issue regulations that address the same contaminants \nto the minimum standard required by the EPA. If the FDA does not issue \nformal regulations, the EPA drinking water standards apply to bottled \nwater. In the case of EPA standards that have already been established \nand the FDA has not yet acted, the FDA has 1 year to act before the EPA \nstandards automatically apply. This bill allows the FDA to hold bottled \nwater to a stricter standard, but ensures that bottled water will be \nheld to a minimal standards.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this amendment today. I look \nforward to moving this particular legislation through Congress so that \nit may be signed by the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1549) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it appears that we cannot get the Hutchison \namendment completed and negotiated in a way that is satisfactory to \nboth sides. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from \nTexas is prepared to go to a vote on the amendment. I hope the other \nside is prepared to do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, we had a conversation where it was, I thought, \nindicated that we were trying to----\n  Mr. HATCH. I talked to the Senator from Texas and she felt it was not \ngetting done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are awaiting their redraft of the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are making some progress. We would like \nto work through the afternoon. \n\n[[Page S9977]]\n\n  I had a discussion with the distinguished Democratic leader about \nthere being a number of votes on Monday. We may move the time for the \ncloture vote, depending on what I hear from the Democratic leader.\n  I have also indicated that in addition to that cloture vote, if \ncloture fails, there will be another cloture vote on Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9974-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9977-S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     substitute amendment to S. 343, the regulatory reform bill:\n       Bob Dole, Bill Roth, Fred Thompson, Spencer Abraham, Kay \n     Bailey Hutchison, Jon Kyl, Chuck Grassley, Craig Thomas, \n     Orrin Hatch, Larry E. Craig, Mitch McConnell, Conrad Burns, \n     Bob Smith, Jesse Helms, Jim Inhofe, Judd Gregg.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the distinguished majority leader \nindicated, he and I have had the opportunity to discuss this cloture \nmotion.\n  I will say again, I do not know that cloture motions are even \nnecessary at this point. We have had a very rigorous debate. There have \nbeen very few quorum calls and there is not a filibuster going on here.\n  We are proposing amendments. We will lay down the substitute this \nafternoon. We are ready to go to additional votes this afternoon. I \nhope that we could have a vote on the Hutchison amendment this \nafternoon. I am sure that is something the majority leader is prepared \nto do.\n  I yield to the majority leader for comment on the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. As we discussed earlier, obviously, if the amendments on \neither side are acceptable, that is certainly satisfactory to both the \nleaders, because some Members are necessarily absent, and there is no \nneed to punish Members who are not here.\n  On the other hand, if we cannot agree, we ought to have the votes, \nand everybody was notified there could be votes throughout the \nafternoon on Friday.\n  As far as I know, the afternoon does not end at 1 o'clock. It ends \nmuch, much later. We will be here. As far as I am concerned, we will \nhave votes. If we reach an impasse, or once I think the major \namendments have been laid down on the so-called Glenn amendment--I \nthink that will take considerable debate.\n  Until that happens, I would hope we would continue to work out some \nof the amendments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is my point. I want to emphasize, at least to \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle, there is likely to be additional \nvotes this afternoon, and that Members ought to be prepared to come to \nthe floor to cast those votes.\n  Let me say in the larger context, that is the reason why, in my view, \nwe do not need a cloture motion, because, as I say, the work is getting \ndone.\n  This has been a good debate this week on a very, very complex issue. \nI would hope we could continue to work in good faith and find a way to \naccommodate Senators who have good amendments, who have reasons to \noffer these amendments, and do so in a time that accommodates the \nschedule but also accommodates the Senator.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's decision, but I hope that at some \npoint we could get beyond the cloture votes and try to finish this \nbill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I hope, too. The reason for the cloture motion is to make \ncertain we do finish the bill. If we cannot get cloture, we will not \nfinish the bill on Tuesday. It is my hope we can finish the bill on \nTuesday.\n  Let me again indicate to all my colleagues who are at the majority \nleader. The August recess is not far away--at least the starting date \nis not far away. We have a certain number, I think a number of \nlegitimate things we should do before that recess begins.\n  It may not begin on the 4th of August. It may not begin until the \n12th or the 15th, or in that area. That is not a threat, just what may \nhappen.\n  I put in the Record yesterday a proposed schedule which I believe is \nreasonable, but it depends on finishing this bill and then moving to \nthe next bill, and appropriation bills. We hope to do six appropriation \nbills before the August recess. We have three major authorization \nbills: DOD authorization bill, foreign operations, State Department \nauthorization. That will take some time. There will be a lot of \namendments. Six appropriation bills, plus welfare reform, plus Bosnia, \nplus lobbying and gift reform, plus the Ryan White bill.\n  That is the reason the cloture was filed. Hopefully, if we cannot \nwork it out, we will have a cloture vote on Tuesday, which I hope would \nbe successful. Then we would at least have the end in sight.\n  Obviously, if we are making progress, and we are going to finish the \nbill Tuesday in any event, I would be happy to withdraw the cloture \nmotion.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the distinguished majority leader will yield the floor, \nwould it make sense to set a time certain for a vote on the Hutchison \namendment? Should we not work it out?\n  Obviously as the day goes on, both sides may lose more people and \ntherefore it would punish more not to have a time set in the event we \ndo not work it out.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have no objection to that. Somebody suggested 30 minutes, \nif they do not work it out. I will not be that arbitrary, but I think \nafter some reasonable time, 30 to 45 minutes, that would be \nsatisfactory.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. I know some of these things are very technical and I do not \nprofess to understand some of these technical provisions. I am not on \nthe committee and have not followed that closely. I know they are \nmeeting as we speak. Hopefully, we can do that.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the amendment \nprocess. I came to make a statement on the bill. I want to proceed if \nthere are no amendments. I am willing to abbreviate my statement when \nthe managers are ready to move to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are grinding away slowly in this process \non regulatory reform. I think all Members had hoped we would be able to \nmove much more quickly on this legislation.\n  The majority leader has just outlined a schedule for the Senate \nbetween now and the August--I should say supposed August--recess. It \nseems to me that schedule will be impossible to meet, given the \ntimeframe and the seriousness of the issues which we will be debating.\n  Nevertheless, we cannot even begin to get to complete that agenda if \nwe cannot move along on this particular piece of legislation. We are \nnow completing a full week's debate, with amendments. We have had long \ndays and long nights, and there is no end in sight.\n  I hope that we can continue to make progress. I certainly am not \ngoing to be one to delay that process.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that during the course of this debate, \nmedia reports about activities on the Senate floor, debate on this \nfloor, and general discussion about what is taking place here, have \nleft a misimpression as to what this legislation is designed to \nachieve.\n  There have been claims made, by a number of individuals, that if this \nbill stands as it is and is not drastically changed, the quality of our \nwater and our air will be placed in jeopardy, our environmental \ntreasures will be threatened, our Nation's wildlife will be endangered. \nThere have even been accusations that the result of this legislation \nwould be the increased incidence of contamination of the very food that \nwe eat and the water that we drink.\n  I think we need to set the record straight on some of these charges. \nThese are disturbing charges because they threaten to undermine a \nprocess of reform that I believe is critical to the viability of our \neconomic system. Our current regulatory process is, I believe is \ncomplicated beyond the ability of many of our small business people to \nunderstand or to comply with. It is punitive in many ways. It is \nduplicative \n\n[[Page S9978]]\nin many ways. It simply does not provide the efficiency, and in many \ninstances the intended effect of the regulations as they were \noriginally drafted. It drains family income, it chokes small \nbusinesses, it denies jobs.\n  The Small Business Administration has estimated that small business \nowners spend nearly 1 billion hours a year filling out and completing \nGovernment forms. This, at a cost of millions of dollars. Turning this \ntide, restoring some balance and efficiency to the regulatory process \nis really what this legislation is all about.\n  I think it is important we understand what this legislation does and \nwhat it does not do. I intend to review that. Before I do, let me \nprovide a couple of examples as to why I think this legislation is \nnecessary.\n  Perhaps the most important reasons it is necessary is the negative \nimpact the current system has had on our society, on the American \nfamily, on those who are seeking to hold meaningful employment. \nAccording to a 1993 study conducted by Citizens Against Government \nWaste, Federal regulations cost the American household $4,000 a year; \nroughly $400 billion annually. A former OMB official placed the cost \neven higher, at $500 billion annually, or $5,000 for the average \nAmerican family.\n  A popular statistic thrown out in this town every year, particularly \nin the spring, is how long the average American has to work through the \nyear to pay their Federal and State taxes. The date is now \napproximately May 5th. If you add on their share of the regulatory \nburden, you push that date even farther forward, into mid-July.\n  Many advocates of the status quo, those who would keep the current \nsystem of regulations as they are, rejecting this reform process, argue \nthat this legislation will jeopardize our public health. I do not think \nthis is correct. The legislation we are currently debating, and have \ndebated all week, does not override existing health, safety or \nenvironmental law. The cost-benefit requirements of this legislation \nsupplement, not supersede existing law.\n  This legislation does not seek to overturn the very real progress \nthat has been achieved in many cases of public safety regulation. To \nthe contrary, this legislation seeks to provide procedural reform that \nwill ensure that the rules and regulations efficiently and effectively \nachieve the very goals they were designed to seek.\n  So I ask my colleagues, why should we not proceed with an effort to \nprovide some efficiency in implementing regulations that are designed \nand intended to promote vital health and safety concerns for Americans? \nThat is a goal we ought to embrace, not a goal we should resist.\n  There have been some charges concerning health emergencies, charges \nthat this legislation would place public health in jeopardy in cases of \nemergency. The reality is that the cost-benefit analyses and risk \nassessments are not required if they are impractical due to an \nemergency or health or safety threat, if they are likely to result in \nsignificant harm to the public or to our natural resources. \nFurthermore, on Tuesday this Senate adopted the Dole amendment by \nunanimous vote. That clarified the intention, in case there was any \ndoubt, of this legislation to cover food safety emergencies in addition \nto all public health matters.\n  The legislation further provides the same protections where \nenvironmental management activities are concerned. Let me repeat, cost-\nbenefit procedures do not apply where they would result in an actual or \nimmediate risk to human health and welfare.\n  Where a petition for alternative compliance is sought, the petition \nmay only be granted where an alternative achieves at least an \nequivalent level of protection of health, safety and the environment.\n  So in this Senator's opinion, and I think in the opinion of many \nSenators, this legislation is not a radical overhaul of Federal \nregulations. It is a procedural reform that is designed to ensure more \neffective, more efficient rulemaking. I think that is a common sense \napproach. I doubt if there is a Member of this Chamber who has not been \nbesieged by his constituents back home, or her constituents back home, \nor by groups that visit us here in the Senate who point out the \nduplicative, cost-ineffective, procedural nightmare that they have to \ngo through in complying with Federal regulations. Time and time again \nit has been pointed out to this Senator how one regulation by one \nagency countermands a regulation by another agency, leaving the \nindividual to throw up his or her hands, saying which regulation am I \nsupposed to comply with? To comply with one violates the other. It is a \nnightmare of bureaucracy in terms of filling out forms and complying \nwith injunctions handed down by the various regulatory agencies.\n  A cost-benefit analysis is not an unreasonable request, to examine \nthe benefit of a proposed regulation versus what will be the cost. It \nis information we ought to have when we assess the viability of rules \nand regulations and the procedure that produces those.\n  There has been a lot of talk by advocates of the status quo about \ntheir compassion, about justifying this legislation to constituents \nback home. I challenge Members to go back home to a town meeting, or \nlocal diner, and to stand up and make the argument for why the Federal \nGovernment should not engage in reform of its regulatory process. Why \nit should not impose a cost-benefit analysis in determining the \nviability of a regulation, Why we should not determine whether what is \nthe most efficient and effective way to spend their tax dollars. I \nsuspect they will run into a little opposition if they try to defend \nthe status quo.\n  There are many agencies that have been highlighted during the debate \nthis week. There are many that we hear complaints about. Perhaps the \none I receive the most complaints about from individuals that I \nrepresent is OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. \nRegularly, constituents walk into my office with fistfuls of compliance \nrequests and stories of the nightmare of administrative litigation \nproceedings, complaining, not only about the process but about the \nineffectiveness, the inapplicability, and the duplicative efforts of \nmany of the regulations they are asked to comply with.\n  A roofing business owner in Indiana wrote to me. He said we have \nthese forms, the material safety data sheets, MSDS's, required by OSHA. \nHe said, and I quote from his letter:\n\n       Materials have an MSDS's that were never intended to be \n     encompassed by the regulatory standards. It has gotten to the \n     point that almost every product in America comes with an \n     MSDS. Products like sand and compressed air, dishwashing \n     detergent, glass cleaner, baby oil, powder, shampoo, all have \n     MSDS's.\n\n  To carry this product, to use this product, to manufacture this \nproduct, if you store this product, you have to fill out this sheet.\n  He tells the story about an OSHA compliance officer who illegally \nsearched his foreman's vehicle. He writes: He searched our foreman's \nvehicle and found a small plumber's propane torch in the vehicle.\n  It was the employee's personal property. It had nothing to do with \nthe company. This was his personal property. It is not even used in the \nroofing business. The label had fallen off that propane torch. The \nforeman tried to explain to the OSHA compliance officer that this was \nhis personal property. He even produced an MSDS sheet. The company was \nfined $825 because the label had fallen off the propane torch, a \nproduct not even used in the business of the employer. Yet, the \nemployer was fined.\n  Another individual from Indiana talked to me about the fact that they \nhad some chalk stored. I believe they used the chalk for certain \npurposes not necessarily related to the product that they were \nmanufacturing. Yet, they had to fill out the MSDS forms. It was not \nacceptable to fill out one MSDS form labeling the chalk. But because \nthe chalk came in red, blue, green, yellow and different colors, they \nhad to have spearate forms for each color of chalk.\n  I can go on and on with these stories. In the interest of time, I \nwill not do that.\n  But the point is that we have an overzealous, an overregulatory \nprocess at work in America today that is placing costs and burdens on \nbusiness, and particularly small business, that is denying job \nopportunities and competitive advantage to these businesses.\n  I think every Member understands how the regulatory process grows and \nmushrooms and continues to ignore the desire and need for efficiency in \nimposing what had been determined to be \n \n[[Page S9979]]\n\nnecessary health and safety regulations but imposing it in a way that \nthwarts the very purpose of the rule in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we are not derailed in the process of \nresponding to the very clear call of the American people that we clean \nup the act of the Federal Government here in Washington. We have been \ngiven a somewhat historic opportunity to do that. Items that Americans, \nour constituents, have been complaining about for decades now have an \nopportunity to be vented in this Congress and reformed in this \nCongress.\n  People have lost faith in our ability to apply commonsense solutions \nto the problems that they face. They have seen an insensitive, \nuncaring, ineffective government impose law after law, and regulation \nafter regulation on their livelihoods, on their businesses, on their \nfamilies, and on society as a whole.\n  They have lost faith in government which reaches into every corner of \ntheir lives, stealing from them the very hard-earned wages that they \nhave worked so long to accumulate. They have lost faith in a government \nthat is suffocating their access to opportunity and to the American \ndream, the hope of starting and running a successful business, the \nopportunity to benefit from the jobs of a strong economy, the \nopportunity to pass along to their children the hope of a better life \nthan they have had.\n  This legislation does not accomplish all that we must. But it is a \ncritical start. If we cannot reform the regulatory process that is \nsuffocating America, there is little that we can do to respond to the \nvery genuine calls for a reformed Congress and a reformed way of doing \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can move forward. We spent a week now, long \ndays and long nights with no end in sight, with amendment, after \namendment, after amendment. But I hope we can expedite this process and \nmove forward. This is an important piece of legislation. It has been \ndiscussed, deliberated, and talked about for years. Now is the time \nthat we need to move forward and enact it.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to bring this debate to a \nreasonable close so that we can exercise our final vote on whether or \nnot we believe that the regulatory process needs to be fixed, needs to \nbe reformed, needs to be made more efficient and effective for this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9977-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to take \nthe floor. I do not know quite how to do this. I may not do it very \nwell. I do not know whether my words will accomplish anything. But \nsometimes, you know, you just feel like you should speak on the floor \nof the Senate. That is what comes with the honor of being a U.S. \nSenator.\n  Mr. President, on the front page of the Washington Post today--this \njust needs to be recognized on the floor of the Senate--there is a \nheadline, ``For Ousted Bosnians, a Trail of Tears.''\n  Under that headline, ``Serbs Force Thousands of Muslims in Harrowing \nJourney.''\n  Then there is a picture of older men, women, and children, a Bosnian \nwoman wheeling what I gather would be, Mr. President, her elderly \nfather in a wheelbarrow. And the first paragraph reads, ``Bedraggled, \nhungry and scared, thousands of Bosnian Muslims flooded into a swelling \nmakeshift refugee camp with little food, water or medicine today after \na harrowing journey into Muslim-held territory from the fallen town of \nSrebrenica, now occupied by Bosnian Serbs reveling in their victory.''\n  Mr. President, another article in the Washington Post is headlined, \n``Serbs Start Expelling Muslim Civilians From Seized U.N. Conclave,'' \nwith pictures of women and children herded into refugee camps.\n  Mr. President, these pictures send chills down my spine. I am the son \nof a Jewish immigrant born in Odessa in the Ukraine who lived in \nSiberia in Russia. I am an American Jew, and these pictures send chills \ndown my spine, along with the reports that the Serbs are taking all \nyoung men, boys 16 years of age, away from their families. I do not \nknow where they are taking them to. But they are taking them away to \nfind out whether they are guilty of ``war crimes.''\n  Mr. President, I do not know exactly what it is the international \ncommunity should do. But I am convinced the international community has \nto do something.\n  Mr. President, it is as if the world has not learned anything in the \nlast half a century. We really are talking about genocide of people.\n  I will not talk about the position a number of Senators took several \nyears ago in calling for action. I took such a position. Normally, I do \nnot talk about intervention, international military intervention, but \nseveral years ago several of us came to the floor and said it had to \nhappen. That is beside the point.\n  Mr. President, I was thinking about this this morning, and I was \ntalking to my wife, Sheila. We have been debating the regulatory reform \nbill, and it is extremely important. I have been involved in the debate \nabout the rescissions bill. All of us care about our work, and all of \nus give everything we have, whether we agree or disagree. The Presiding \nOfficer and I, who are good friends, are good examples; we do not agree \non all issues. But I am trying to figure out, for God sake, what in the \nworld is the world going to do? What is the civilized international \ncommunity going to do? We see people just expelled, expunged, young men \ntaken away from families to see whether they are ``guilty of war \ncrimes.'' Elderly and children, 1-year-olds put on trains--to go where? \nWhat is going to happen to these people?\n  Sometimes, in the history of humankind, silence is betrayal. I do not \nthink we can be silent about it. I wish to God I knew exactly what the \ninternational community could do. The fact that there are no good \nchoices does not mean we still should not choose some course of action. \nI do not mean any easy fix, Mr. President. I do not mean something \nwhere we essentially turn our gaze away from the rape and torture and \nmurder of innocent people.\n  So, Mr. President, I just wanted to take a few minutes to speak to \nthese pictures. If my father, Leon, was alive--he is no longer alive--\nhe would say that there exists on the part of humankind an enormous \ncapacity for good but also, unfortunately, an enormous capacity for \nevil. It is that parallelism that makes it all so complicated.\n  I assume that next week in this Chamber we will be talking about what \nis now happening in the former Yugoslavia. I do not know what the focus \nof the debate will be. I know there are several resolutions, but I \nthink it has to be more than resolutions and amendments. The \ninternational community cannot turn its gaze away from this. This is \ngenocide. We should have learned some lessons over the last half a \ncentury. I do not think we can go about our normal business just \nbecause it is long distance, somewhere away. These are all of God's \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9979-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9979-S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INHUMANITY IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am on the floor for the same reason that \nmy colleague from the State of Minnesota is here. I have stood silently \nby for a long time now because I have the same feeling that a lot of us \nhave, one of desperation, despair. I was forced to think about this as \na result of the statement given yesterday by the Senator from the State \nof Arizona [Mr. McCain] a man who understands war, a man who spent more \nthan 5 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, a man who spent more than \nhalf that time in solitary confinement. So I figure that when Senator \nMcCain talks about war, I should listen. Senator McCain did not use the \nWashington Post. He used the New York Times as an illustration. I went \nand looked at the New York Times after he brought it to my attention. \nIt showed a mass of humanity, but if you looked closely at the picture \nthere were uniformed troops in there. Who were those troops? They were \nU.N. troops. My friend from the State of Minnesota today made the same \nstatement. \n\n[[Page S9980]]\n\n  Mr. President, each day now brings a whole new series of horrible \nstories of the inhumanity in Bosnia. I did not know Leon Wellstone. \nObviously, with the sensitivity that the Senator from Minnesota has \nabout issues generally, I am sure that Mr. Wellstone was a good teacher \nand certainly had some wisdom and philosophy about the nature of man as \nimparted by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. Wellstone would, I am sure, stare in amazement, with each day \nbringing a whole new series of horrible stories of inhumanity in that \npart of the world. The Bosnian Serbs are conducting offenses on one \nU.N. safe haven after another, and doing it with remarkable speed, \nreminding me of the blitzkrieg of 50-odd years ago. Why should they not \nmove with remarkable speed? It is just like 50-plus years ago when \nHitler moved into those areas; he had no opposition basically. They \nhave no opposition basically. So why should they not move quickly?\n  The safe haven's only protection--and I use that word very loosely--\nis a small number of lightly armed U.N. troops who are quickly forced \nto surrender their positions. I think most of the time they are not \nasked to surrender; they wave the white flags very early, leaving \nBosnian civilians defenseless to these aggressors. Srebrenica has \nfallen and has been ethnically cleansed, by their definition. Zepa is \nunder heavy artillery fire and troops there were given an ultimatum to \nput down their weapons by what was 8 o'clock this morning local time. \nThe Bosnian Serbs have openly declared that the safe area of Gorazde \nwill be next. And 40,000 civilians were forced out of Srebrenica--\n40,000, as many people as watched the all-star game. Where were they \nforced? Anyplace they could go. We have reports of murder, rape, \ntorture. The men are lined up, and those that are of military age are \ntaken one place, the old and infirm are taken someplace else. Women are \nlined up, some taken away for obvious reasons.\n  These pictures, stories of human suffering, are heart wrenching. \nFamilies are torn apart. We have reports of mothers searching for their \nchildren, the elderly succumbing to exhaustion from the heat and lack \nof water as they are forced to leave on foot.\n  And we do not see all the pictures. We do not know what else goes on. \nWe can only imagine what else goes on. Given the past cases of ethnic \ncleansing, atrocities committed by the Bosnian Serbs that have already \nbeen documented by human rights groups in Bosnia, we can believe the \nreports are certainly true; that our imagination is certainly without \nbound. What is next?\n  There are about 16,000 civilians in Zepa, civilians who now, no \ndoubt, will undergo the same inhumane treatment that we have seen the \nlast week, the last month, the last several years.\n  And what about Gorazde? It is the most highly populated area of all, \nwith as many as 60,000 civilians. Are we going to stand by and watch \nthese people fall victim to their captors, just as the people of \nSrebrenica fell victim?\n  The United Nations officially declared and demilitarized the safe \nareas, promising to protect civilians and provide aid. But, surely, no \none believes anymore that the United Nations has any hope of protecting \nsafe havens anyplace in Bosnia. News reports, and TV news reports in \nparticular, show the anger of the Bosnian Moslems forced out of \nSrebrenica at the promises made to them by the United Nations and the \nWest.\n  A United Nations official is quoted in a New York Times article \ntoday:\n\n       We are at that point in the war where there is no peace to \n     keep. We were never equipped or given enough troops to \n     protect these enclaves. The Serbs have called our bluff.\n\n  Mr. President, certainly they have called our bluff. The United \nNations is not a peacemaker--they are a peacekeeper; they were sent in \nto keep the peace--and that is something they cannot do and should not \nbe asked to do. The Serbs, in the New York Times article today, \ncertainly have called the United Nations' bluff. The will of the West \nto take definitive action is weak, and the Bosnian Serbs know it.\n  Time and time again, United Nations officials have rejected NATO's \noffer to conduct air strikes. The NATO alliance itself shows signs of \ndisintegration as the alliance members disagree on a course of action \nand find the U.N. troops are used as tools to blackmail the United \nNations and NATO into promises not to conduct the strikes.\n  And the world watches, as U.N. troops watch, while the Bosnian \nMoslems fall victim. The United Nations cannot protect the men carted \noff to an unknown fate. They cannot help those women taken from the \ngroup. They cannot help the injured and the dying, and they cannot help \nmothers find their children.\n  It is a pitiful sight to see the U.N. forces standing in the \nbackground as hundreds of thousands of people have been inhumanly \nherded away like animals. You would not treat rodeo animals the way \nthese people are treated. Animal rights groups would rise up in anger. \nAnimal protection groups would rise up in anger if you treated animals \nanywhere like these people are being treated.\n  The President said yesterday that if the United Nations does not get \nits act together, its days are numbered in that area. The contact group \nis formulating a regrouping of U.N. forces, consolidating them in \nSarajevo. You can move the players around the board all you want, like \nchess or checker moves, but they will be no more effective if they \ncannot do something more than what they have done. The U.N. force has \nalready been badly routed. It has failed to influence any peaceful \nsolution, and it has failed to protect civilians.\n  The present policy of international reliance on continued peace \nnegotiations and containment has only prolonged Serb aggression against \nthe Bosnians. We must lift the arms embargo.\n  Mr. President, for me to come on the floor and talk about lifting the \narms embargo is not easy. I met with a large group of Pakistani \nphysicians 1\\1/2\\ years ago. They asked me, ``What about lifting the \narms embargo?''\n  I said we cannot have more military, that is what caused the problems \nin the world today. I spoke to those people, who were so agitated about \nwhat was going on, and said we should not lift the arms embargo. Well, \nI was wrong. There is nothing else we can do. It will cause more \nbloodshed, but what else can we do?\n  We must allow the Bosnians to defend themselves and defend their \nfamilies. Frankly, most military experts say it is too late, that by \nthe time they get their act together with new arms, a military force, \nthe Serbs will have run over them.\n  I do not know if that is the case, but at least they need a chance to \ndefend their families. The U.N. forces should withdraw so they no \nlonger can be used by the Serbs to facilitate Serb goals.\n  The U.N. forces have not helped the Bosnians. They have helped in \nrecent months the Serbs. The Serbs have confiscated arms, they have \ntaken humanitarian aid and money from U.N. forces. They have taken U.N. \ntroops hostage. We all remember the pathetic pictures of U.N. troops \nchained to poles. It is time for the United Nations to stop aiding the \nSerbs in this ruthless pursuit. The Bosnian Serbs hold no regard for \nthe U.N. mission or for finding a peaceful solution to the war.\n  Mr. President, there is no pain-free solution to what is going on \nnow, but we can predict with more certainty what the future brings. The \nSerbs will continue their aggression. The Serbs will continue ethnic \ncleansing. The Serbs will attack U.N. safe havens, and they will \nrespond only to a real threat of force. U.N. forces will not alter this \ncourse and may only advance the Serbs' cause by serving as hostages, by \nsupplying the arms that they steal and by surrendering their supplies. \nThe arms embargo should be lifted and the Bosnian people allowed to \ndetermine their own fate.\n  The ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the former \nchairman from Georgia said in a recent statement, and I quote: ``There \nwill be a high price to be paid once the U.N. forces are withdrawn from \nBosnia.''\n  As usual, the senior Senator from Georgia is right. There is no easy \nway out of this conflict. The Bosnians are aware of the high price to \nbe paid, and they are willing to pay it for the right to defend their \ncountry and their families. To them, the status quo is far worse than \nany alternative brought on by lifting the embargo and, if necessary, \nwithdrawing U.N. troops.\n  Mr. President, I also say this. I say the United States should send \nno \n\n[[Page S9981]]\ntroops to that part of the world. Why not call upon the nations that \nhave influence in that part of the world? That is in their sphere of \ninfluence. Where is France? Where is England? France wants to be a \nsuperpower. They are setting off tests in the middle of the ocean. Let \nthem bring in their troops and do something rather than talk. It is in \ntheir sphere of influence.\n  The United States, I say, should, at the most, supply air power and \nhave the troops withdrawn. I do not think we should commit troops to \nthat part of the world, even though my colleague, the majority leader \nfrom Kansas, has said that there should be U.S. troops supplied to help \nwithdraw the U.N. troops. I do not think I can go that far, Mr. \nPresident.\n  What has gone on there is something that should have the world \ncommunity saying, ``At least let's get the U.N. troops out of there, \nthey are only serving the Serbian forces.'' I say let us have France \nand England and the European nations join together and let them bring \ntroops into that area. We have done Somalia; we have done Haiti. Have \nwe not done enough, Mr. President? We have done the gulf war. It is \ntime for the United States to step back and let other countries do \ntheir share for a change.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9979-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUBY RIDGE INCIDENT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I have just received a \nrelease from the Federal Bureau of Investigation advising that the FBI \nDirector is transferring Mr. Larry A. Potts from the position of Deputy \nDirector to a position within the FBI's training division.\n  I have just had an opportunity to discuss this briefly with FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh. I think that this is a very wise move in light of \nall of the developments on the Ruby Ridge incident, especially the most \nrecent disclosure of this week that documents were destroyed by one of \nthe FBI agents who was involved in the Ruby Ridge incident.\n  There is a very substantial question, Mr. President, about what was \ndone at Ruby Ridge with respect to the use of deadly force and also \nwith respect to the rules of engagement with Special Agent Glenn, the \nspecial agent in charge at the present time of the Salt Lake City \noffice having been at the scene, saying that there had been changes in \nthe rules of engagement, and Mr. Potts having said that there was no \nchange in the rules of engagement and no change on the use of deadly \nforce.\n  That is a matter of considerable importance. Also, disclosed in the \nWashington Post yesterday was the task force report of the Department \nof Justice, indicating that there was excessive force used within the \ndefinition of constitutional parameters, and also with the task force \nexposure as printed in the Washington Post yesterday about the \nrecommendation for consideration of prosecutions, which was rejected by \nthe Department of Justice.\n  I have raised the issue of the promotion of Mr. Potts with Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno when she testified recently at general oversight \nhearings before the Judiciary Committee, and had raised the issue as to \nwhy Mr. Potts was promoted in light of the outstanding questions about \nRuby Ridge. The Attorney General was further questioned about the \npossibility of a criminal prosecution by the prosecuting attorney of \nBoundary County, ID, of an official whom I talked to had made comments \non the Senate floor some time ago. Attorney General Reno said she would \nnot speculate about what local law enforcement would do and was not \ngoing to get involved in any way in hindering local law enforcement \nwhich was hardly responsive to my question as to why there was a \npromotion, in light of these issues which were very much in the public \ndomain.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that there will yet be oversight \nhearings by the Senate. I made an extensive statement about this \nyesterday, calling for those hearings and, in fact, had pressed the \nissue in a resolution calling for a Senate vote in May, understanding \nfull well that it was highly unlikely to be accepted, considering the \nprerogatives of chairmen under our Senate procedures. I think it \ncontinues to be a matter of the utmost importance. We have had an \nenormous growth of the militia, as I commented on more extensively \nyesterday. I can understand and sympathize with people in the United \nStates who are unhappy with what is going on in Government because of \nthe need to hold people accountable at the highest levels.\n  I think with the reassignment of Mr. Potts today, it has extra \nemphasis on the need for hearings. Mr. Potts, for one, is entitled to \nhis day in court or his time to have a hearing to see precisely what it \nwas that he did. There is a cloud hanging over Mr. Potts at this time. \nThere is a cloud hanging over the FBI and a cloud hanging over the \nDepartment of Justice, as long as these questions remain unanswered. It \nis the responsibility of the Congress of the United States to have \noversight hearings. We are the proper institution to undertake those \nhearings, and I renew my request that these hearings be held at the \nearliest possible time.\n  I note that the Presiding Officer, the senior Senator from Idaho \nnodding. I will not make any interpretation from his nods of the head, \nbut I do think this is a matter of great importance. And the \nreassignment of Mr. Potts today underscores the necessity for prompt \nhearings on this important matter.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9981-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9981-S9984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If \nyou are in the midst of some procedure here, I am reluctant to \ninterrupt it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are very close, we believe, to working something out on \nthe Hutchison amendment. That is not quite ready. So I have no \nobjection, and I do not believe Senator Hatch would either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, during consideration of this regulatory \nreform bill, we have heard a litany of horror stories about silly \nregulations, costly regulations, and useless regulations. Many of these \nstories have focused on rules and laws that are designed to protect the \nenvironment.\n  It must be remembered, however, that tales of environmental excess do \nnot present the complete story.\n  I have spoken many times about the tremendous progress we have made \nin cleaning up our environment over the past 25 years. I think the last \n25 years, starting in about 1970, 1972, those were the glory years of \nenvironmental legislation. As a result of that legislation, our Nation \nis far cleaner in its waters and in the air, and far ahead in the \npreservation of endangered species than we otherwise would have been. \nIn just about every instance, that progress can be attributed directly \nto environmental rules and regulations and laws that were passed. \nSurely, there are examples of overly rigid applications of specific \nrules. But there is no doubt that the world is a better place today \nprecisely because we have stepped in and forced industry to clean up \nits act.\n  In today's Washington Post, on page A3, there is a good news, pro-\nenvironmental success story. It is a story about environmental \n``regulation''--that word that everybody seems to rebel against around \nhere. The headline reads, ``A Threat to Ozone Layer Diminishes.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the story from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9982]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           A Threat to Ozone Layer Diminishes, Scientists Say\n\n                         (By Boyce Rensberger)\n\n       One of the chief threats to Earth's protective ozone layer \n     has begun to diminish, an international group of scientists \n     has found. According to their report in today's issue of the \n     journal Science, the concentration of methyl chloroform in \n     the atmosphere peaked in 1990 and has been falling ever \n     since.\n       ``This represents the first actual decrease in atmospheric \n     concentration recorded for any halocarbon [the class of \n     chemicals that attack ozone] restricted under the Montreal \n     Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,'' the \n     researchers wrote.\n       In a related article in the same issue, other researchers \n     confirmed a finding, first reported two years ago, that CFCs \n     have almost stopped increasing in the atmosphere. These \n     substances pose an even bigger threat to the ozone layer and \n     are also regulated by the Montreal protocol. The growth rates \n     of CFC-11 and CFC-12 ``are now close to zero,'' the \n     scientists said.\n       If trends continue, the researchers said, CFC \n     (chlorofluorocarbon) levels in the atmosphere are expected to \n     peak next year or in 1997 and then begin to decline slowly. \n     Previous estimates of CFC levels projected a peaking around \n     the year 2000.\n       Scientists also said a fourth ozone depleting substance \n     regulated under the Montreal protocol, carbon tetrachloride, \n     appears to have begun declining but those data have not yet \n     been published.\n       The Montreal protocol is a 1987 international treaty to \n     phase out production of all major ozone depleting chemicals. \n     It was amended in 1990 and 1992 to speed up the schedule. \n     Although the ban on CFCs was not to take effect until 1996, \n     most manufacturers cut production of the chemicals well in \n     advance of the deadlines.\n       ``This is good news for the atmosphere,'' said James W. \n     Elkins, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics \n     Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. ``We're starting to see the \n     first real benefits of regulation.''\n       ``The Montreal protocol works,'' said an author of one of \n     the Science papers, A.R. Ravishankara of NOAA's Aeronomy \n     Laboratory.\n       Still, both atmospheric scientists said, the decline in \n     overall threat to the ozone will be slow and is not expected \n     to eliminate recurrences of the Antarctic ozone hole until \n     perhaps 2050. Throughout this period, however, the ozone \n     layer is expected to thicken because ozone constantly is \n     being created by the action of sunlight on ordinary oxygen \n     and, within a year or two, the creation rate will exceed the \n     destruction rate. The ozone layer helps screen out much of \n     the sun's ultraviolet radiation, which causes DNA damage \n     leading to increased rates of skin cancer.\n       A major concern about the Montreal protocol is whether \n     Russia, China and India will also stop production of CFCs \n     when their opportunity to be exempted expires in a few years. \n     Substitutes for CFCs are more expensive and require costly \n     changes in refrigerating equipment.\n       The decline in methyl chloroform (also called \n     trichloroethane) was reported by Ronald G. Prinn, of the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and eight colleagues \n     at various institutions in this country, Australia and \n     Britain.\n       Their report also contains a major correction to the key \n     method used by atmospheric chemists to estimate the ability \n     of chemicals to deplete ozone or to cause global warming. As \n     a result of the correction it is now clear that many \n     synthetic gases are nearly 20 percent less capable of doing \n     harm than was estimated previously. The immediate practical \n     effect of the correction is to lower the ozone depleting \n     potential, or ODP, of some chemicals below the maximum \n     tolerated under the Clean Air Act.\n       The law says that gases cannot be released to the \n     atmosphere unless their ODP is less than 20 percent that of \n     CFC-11. Because of the correction, new calculations are \n     likely to reveal that several synthetic gases once thought \n     banned are now acceptable.\n       The correction grew out of new studies by the Prinn group \n     of the amount of hydroxyl radical, or OH, in the air. Prinn \n     had thought the concentration was low and slowly rising. It \n     now turns out that the OH level is higher than thought and \n     has not risen at least since 1978.\n       ``This is good news,'' Elkins said, ``because OH is a \n     natural cleanser in the atmosphere. It removes various ozone \n     depleting substances [including methyl chloroform] and some \n     `greenhouse' gases.''\n       Unfortunately, OH does not help break down carbon dioxide, \n     one of the chief greenhouse gases, or CFCs, the major ozone \n     depleters.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in 1987, under the leadership of our \nPresident--who was President? Ronald Reagan was President in 1987--the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency convinced the rest of the world to sign \nonto a treaty known as the Montreal Protocol. That treaty called for a \nreduction in the production and use of chemicals that scientist \npredicted and stated were destroying the stratospheric ozone layer.\n  The stratospheric ozone layer is Earth's shield against harmful \nultraviolet radiation. What is the harm with that? Why do we care about \nultraviolet radiation? Well, ultraviolet radiation comes in through \nthese holes made in the ozone layer as a result of chemicals such as \nchlorofluorocarbons. This was first discovered in the mid-1980's, over \nAntarctica. Scientists told us that there was a class of ozone-\ndestroying chemicals, such as methyl chloroform and CFC's, as I \npreviously mentioned. As a result of the hole in the ozone layer, the \nultraviolet radiation came through without being screened, and that is \nthe principal cause of skin cancers in our society today.\n  In 1987, the Montreal Protocol called for a 50-percent reduction in \nthe production and use of these chemicals by the signatories to the \nprotocol.\n  In 1990, under the leadership of another Republican President, \nPresident Bush, the protocol was amended, and Congress passed the Clean \nAir Act, and part of that required a complete elimination of these \nchemicals.\n  A number of groups opposed those regulatory efforts. They said it was \nunnecessary. They said it could not be done, that it would cost too \nmuch.\n  What has been the result? As reported in today's newspaper, one of \nthe chief threats to Earth's protective ozone layer has begun to \ndiminish. The concentration of CFC's in the atmosphere is just about at \nits peak. In other words, when we stop sending up the CFC's, it does \nnot stop just like that, because those that were released years before \nare winding their way up into the stratosphere. But because of the \nefforts we took in the mid-1980's, those that we released at the time \nhave just about completed their journey, and we have cut off the \nsupply, and the number of CFC's going into the stratosphere is \nbeginning to diminish. The concentration is just about at its peak and \nshould start to diminish shortly. The concentration of methyl \nchloroform peaked in 1990 and has been falling ever since.\n  I have here a quote by James Elkins of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics \nLaboratory in Boulder, CO. ``This is good news for the atmosphere. * * \n* We're starting to see the first real benefits of regulation.''\n  Mr. President, the point of highlighting this good news story is to \nshow that sometimes we get it right. All environmental laws and \nregulations are not the demons some would have us believe. I am certain \nthat the good news of today would not have been possible if the pending \nbill had been in effect at the time of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 \nand the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990.\n  If this law that we are debating today had been in effect at that \ntime, the first thing we would have spent years doing would be a risk \nassessment and a cost-benefit analysis. When all of that was completed, \nbecause of the judicial review provisions in this statute before the \nSenate, this act would be on appeal after appeal after appeal. What we \naccomplished in 1987 we never would have done.\n  Mr. President, I wish to draw people's attention to, first, that \nregulations do produce some good effect; second, to point out some of \nthe problems that are incipient in the act before the Senate.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1539, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment No. 1539. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. Is there \nobjection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1539), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place:\n\n     SECTION 709. AGENCY INTERPRETATIONS IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL \n                   ACTIONS.\n\n       ``(a) No civil or criminal penalty shall be imposed by a \n     court, and no civil administrative penalty shall be imposed \n     by an agency, for the violation of a rule--\n       ``(1) if the court or agency, as appropriate, finds that \n     the rule, and other information reasonably available to the \n     defendant, failed to give the defendant fair warning of the \n     conduct that the rule prohibits or requires; or\n       ``(2) if the court or agency, as appropriate, finds that \n     the defendant--\n       ``(A) reasonably in good faith determined, based upon the \n     language of the rule published in the Federal Register, and \n     other information reasonably available to the dependent, that \n     the defendant was in compliance with, exempt from, or \n     otherwise not subject to, the requirements of the rule; or\n\n[[Page S9983]]\n\n       ``(B) engaged in the conduct alleged to violate the rule in \n     reasonable reliance upon a written statement issued by an \n     appropriate agency official, or by an appropriate official of \n     a State authority to which had been delegated responsibility \n     for implementing or ensuring compliance with the rule, after \n     the disclosure of the material stating that the facts, action \n     compliance with, or that the defendant was exempt from, or \n     otherwise not subject to, the requirements of the rule.\n\n     In making its determination of facts under this subsection, \n     the court or agency shall consider all relevant factors, \n     including, if appropriate: that the defendant sought the \n     advice in good faith; and that he acted in accord with the \n     advice he was given.\n       ``(b) In an action brought to impose a civil or criminal \n     penalty for the violation of a rule, the court, or an agency, \n     as appropriate, shall not give deference for the propose of \n     that action only to any interpretation of such rule relied on \n     by an agency in the action that had not been timely published \n     in the Federal Register, and was to otherwise personally \n     available to the defendant or communicated to the defendant \n     by the method described in paragraph (a)(2) in a timely \n     manner by the agency, or by a state official described in \n     paragraph (a)(2)(B), prior to the commencement of the alleged \n     violation.\n       ``(c) Except as provided in subsection (d), no civil or \n     criminal penalty shall be imposed by a court and no civil \n     administrative penalty shall be imposed by an agency based \n     upon--\n       ``(1) an interpretation of a statute, rule, guidance, \n     agency statement of policy, or license requirement or \n     condition, or\n       ``(2) a written determination of fact made by an \n     appropriate agency official, or state official as described \n     in paragraph (a)(2)(B), after disclosure of the material \n     facts at the time and appropriate review,\n\n     if such interpretation or determination is materially \n     different from a prior interpretation or determination made \n     by the agency or the state official described in (a)(2)(B), \n     and if such person, having taken into account all information \n     that was reasonably available at the time of the original \n     interpretation or determination, reasonably relied in good \n     faith upon the prior interpretation or determination.\n       ``(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     preclude an agency:\n       ``(1) from revising a rule or changing its interpretation \n     of a rule in accordance with sections 552 and 553 of this \n     title, and, subject to the provisions of this section, \n     prospectively enforcing the requirements of such rule as \n     revised or reinterpreted and imposing or seeking a civil or \n     criminal penalty for any subsequent violation of such rule as \n     revised or reinterpreted.\n       ``(2) from making a new determination of fact, and based \n     upon such determination, prospectively applying a particular \n     legal requirement.\n       ``(e) This section shall apply to any action for which a \n     final unappealable judicial order has not been issued prior \n     to the effective date.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, are we prepared to move ahead on this?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I believe we need a couple of minutes of debate, with \nperhaps 3 minutes to Senator Biden and the same for me, if that is \nacceptable to everyone.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 6 \nminutes equally divided between the distinguished Senator from Texas \nand the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are willing to have this adopted on a \nvoice vote. If there is a request for a rollcall, as apparently there \nwas, of course, that is the right of folks who want a rollcall.\n  We are prepared to accept this on a voice vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield a minute?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from Texas for her willingness to make \nthe accommodations she has. Because she has operated under such good \nfaith, I will vote for this amendment if there is a vote. I want to \nmake it clear it does not satisfy all of my concerns and objections, \nnor, I suspect, do the changes satisfy her.\n  There is an effective date in here that would make this, in effect, \nretroactive. I think that is bad public policy. I think it is also \ninconsistent with having a piece of legislation that will take effect \nas a whole upon passage but one section of it that looks back and is \nretroactive.\n  I also am still not satisfied, nor, I suspect, is the Senator from \nTexas satisfied, with the section allowing, in effect, an individual to \nbe able to say, ``I acted in good faith,'' and not be subject to \npenalties or not be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\n  There are a few other things I still have problems with. If we ever \nget to the point where, in the substitute that the Senator from Ohio is \ngoing to offer to this legislation as a whole, I would attempt to put \nin the language more to the liking of the Senator from Delaware, were \nthat ever to prevail.\n  Having said that, I sincerely thank the Senator from Texas. This is, \nfrom my perspective, a much improved version and meets the vast \nmajority of my concerns that I had relative to the amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator from Texas for her cooperation in \nworking out on my behest a number of amendments.\n  I believe this is a well-drawn amendment now. It speaks to a much \nneeded principle of the law, and that is that Federal officials ought \nto tell the truth. And we ought to be able to rely on them when they \ndo. This amendment carries out that policy. I enthusiastically support \nit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not know if I have any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is long enough.\n  Mr. President, a number of the problems which I saw in this amendment \nhave been corrected. There still remains a problem with it, but I \nintend to vote for this amendment, and I want to thank the Senator from \nTexas for introducing it. It is an important point she is making, and \nthe changes she has made have significantly improved the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the cooperation \nI have had with the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Delaware, \nthe Senator from Louisiana, and the Senator from Alabama, all of whom \non the other side worked very hard, I think, to improve this amendment.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to make sure there is fair play in the \nsystem, that our administrative regulatory agencies give notice to \nthose who are going to rely on it so that they can comply with the \nregulations. That is the purpose.\n  I think, frankly, it is a better amendment now. I think there will be \nfair play on both sides.\n  I think it is very important that we keep the principle of fairness \nin this regulatory reform bill. I think we have achieved that with this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murkowski be \nadded as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Last, I want to thank the Senator from Utah.\n  I want to say I have never seen a more patient manager of a bill than \nthe Senator from Utah. This has been a very tough amendment. We have \nspent most of the day on it. He has been very accommodating to all of \nthe differing views on both side, and has listened patiently. For that \nreason, I think we have improved this bill.\n  In the future, there is going to be--I hope--a good working \nrelationship, rather than an adversarial relationship, between the \nregulators and the regulated. That is the purpose of this bill. I think \nwe have achieved it.\n  I ask for the support of all of our colleagues for this improved \namendment. I look forward to a strong vote. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to commend the distinguished Senator from Texas. It \ncorrects some real injustices. She has worked long and hard to \naccommodate everybody, and I hope we will all vote for this amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield back the remaining time, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, will this be the last \nvote today?\n  Mr. HATCH. I honestly do not know.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator from Michigan had an amendment ready to go. \nI urged him not to bring it up at this time because I hope we can work \nit out over the weekend.\n\n[[Page S9984]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I know the distinguished leaders of both sides prefer to \npress onward, but I am not sure what their decision will be. I think we \nneed to have this vote and go from there.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will also be offering the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute this afternoon.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That would be voted on Monday.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That will require some significant debate both Monday and \nperhaps today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], the \nSenator from Montana [Mr. Burns], the Senator from Colorado [Mr. \nCampbell], the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], the Senator from Texas \n[Mr. Gramm], the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. McCain], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], and the \nSenator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, let me indicate there will be no more votes \ntoday. I understand that the major amendment on the other side, the so-\ncalled Glenn-Chafee, et al, amendment, will be laid down and that will \nbe debated this afternoon, and then on Monday I understand the \ndistinguished Democratic leader would like to change the time of the \ncloture vote from 5 to 6 p.m.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the leader will yield, that would accommodate a \ncouple of our Members who will be back and ready to vote at 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on Monday \noccur at 6 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the leader will yield, does the leader contemplate \nvotes prior to that?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my hope--and we were discussing it earlier--there may \nbe solid debate Monday on the major amendment. If that is the case, \nthen there would not be any votes. If there should be a lull, then we \nwould like to set the amendment aside and take up other amendments. So \nthere could be rollcall votes. I think it is probably less than a 50-50 \nchance. I would not want anybody to leave here thinking there will not \nbe any votes. There could be a vote. But I think that will be \ndetermined by debate on this major amendment, which I assume will \nprobably be extended and continuous.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the leader will yield, that would be my understanding \nas well. I think there are a number of people who have expressed an \ninterest in speaking on the substitute, but I would say, in fair \nwarning to all of our colleagues, if there is a lull, we are prepared \non this side to bring up another amendment, set the substitute aside \nand have a good debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think another suggestion might be that if there were any \nvotes--there probably would not be any more than one or two--they could \nimmediately follow the cloture vote. So let us do it that way, so that \nwe could say the first vote will occur at 6 p.m. and if any other votes \nare ordered during the afternoon, they will occur immediately following \nthe vote on cloture. The vote on the substitute, I am not certain \nwhether that will come on Monday evening or Tuesday. There is no \nindication of that yet.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. At this point, I am not sure we are prepared to come to \nany agreement on a time certain, but we will have a good debate on the \nsubstitute on Monday, and I assume sometime either Monday night or \nTuesday we will be prepared for a vote on that, too.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is still our hope to complete action on this bill on \nTuesday. I know there are some amendments on each side. I do not know \nhow many, but I think maybe three or four on this side, maybe three, \nfour, five on the other side.\n  So I advise Members that it will probably be late on Monday evening \nand early on Tuesday so that we can complete action on this bill, so we \ncan move on to the next matter on the agenda, so that we can start our \nAugust recess sometime in August.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, about an hour ago, I had a phone \nconversation with the Director of the FBI, Louis Freeh. At that time, \nhe told me that he permanently reassigned Larry Potts, his immediate \nassistant, Deputy Director, to a new assignment in the FBI pending an \ninvestigation that is now underway in the Justice Department as it \nrelates to the performance of certain FBI personnel with the Ruby Ridge \nincident in Idaho.\n  For over 2 years, I have pursued open, factual airing of the events \nof that incident. At the time Mr. Freeh had recommended Potts for his \nappointment, I asked that be deferred and the man not be considered \nuntil such time as the cloud over the FBI was cleared up. It appears we \nnow may be moving in the direction of full public disclosure of \n \n[[Page S9985]]\n\nthis incident and the activities of the Federal agents involved.\n  I say this on behalf of the FBI and its reputation, which is \ncritically important as the major law enforcement community of our \ncountry, Federal law enforcement community, and I also say this for the \nfamilies of the victims of Ruby Ridge, that it is time we move now \nopenly and publicly with hearings both here, in the Senate, and with \nthe activities of the Justice Department to clear this issue.\n  Mr. Freeh, in that conversation, pledged full cooperation in all \nactivities that will occur in the Senate and in the House in the \nhearings that may come about. I certainly hope we can move late this \nsummer or early this fall to full and thorough investigative hearings, \noversight hearings on this incident. I think the American people now \ndemand it, and I think it is important we once again reestablish the \ncredibility of the FBI by the cleansing of this issue.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from the State of \nIdaho. I probably was nearly as shocked and surprised as he was to hear \na few moments ago on national television that the Deputy Director of \nthe FBI has been ``reassigned.''\n  It seems to me that the Senator from Idaho has made a very good \npoint. I do not claim to have any inside information with what happened \nat Idaho. It is entirely possible my colleague from that State knows \nmuch more about this than I do.\n  If I understand it correctly, the Deputy Director of the FBI has been \nreassigned. I do not know what that means, but I hope that the Senate \nwill move forthwith and speedily for a thorough investigation of this \nmatter. I reserve the right to exercise my final judgment on this after \nI know more about it than I do at this particular moment.\n  But I think the Senator from Idaho has put his finger on the matter. \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is something that must be beyond \nreproach. Again, I do not know at this moment what the reason for this \nwas, but as I understand it, the Director of the FBI has determined \nthat, for the good of the service and because Mr. Potts is under some \ninvestigation that I believe started in the House of Representatives, \nthat he thought it was best for him to be reassigned.\n  I do not agree with that matter at all. If Mr. Potts has not done \nanything wrong, not done anything improper, not violated the law, not \nviolated the Federal Bureau of Investigation rules, then the Director \nof the FBI and the administration should stand square behind him and \nfight out the matter.\n  If, on the other hand, that is not the case and he did do something \nwrong in any area that I just mentioned, or any other area, he should \nbe fired, because it appears to me that this is a tremendously serious \nmatter. I certainly agree with my colleague from Idaho that I hope the \nproper committee of jurisdiction, which I assume would be the Judiciary \nCommittee, should move aggressively on this matter in the Senate so we \ncan, too, make sure that we have a full explanation of what is or is \nnot going on.\n  This is a serious matter that has had a very adverse effect on this \nSenator's view of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and what it does \nor does not do properly.\n  I thank my friend from Idaho for bringing this up. I wish to \nassociate myself with his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion \non the Delaney clause in connection with S. 343, the regulatory reform \nbill, with which we are dealing right now. There is a provision in S. \n343 that would eliminate the Delaney clause ``zero-cancer risk'' \ncriterion and replace it with a ``negligible risk'' criterion when \ndetermining the maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues on \nfoods.\n  The Delaney clause, a provision contained in section 409 of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1958 states that no additive \nwill ``be deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by \nman or animal. . . .''\n  The intention of this law is admirable: To prevent cancer-causing \nagents from entering our food supply. I do not disagree with this \nintent, and I am sure that no one else does in this body either. The \nproblem, however, is that in 1958 when the Delaney clause was passed, \nscientists could not measure additives in parts per billion or parts \nper quintillion, as they can today. In 1958, scientists could only \ndetect cancer-causing additives in parts per thousands--concentrations \nthat, indeed, often posed legitimate health risks to many Americans.\n  This 37-year-old Federal law establishing a ``zero risk'' level for \npesticide residues in processed food is outdated and unnecessary and \nhas adverse impacts on almost every farmer in the United States.\n  In my own State of Washington, more than 200 minor crops are affected \nby the Delaney clause. Since 1988, our farmers have lost nearly half of \nall pesticides registered for agricultural use and are currently faced \nwith a shortage of agricultural pesticides because the cost of \nregistration and reregistration is so high.\n  For example, about 2.6 million acres of crops in the United States \nrely on Propargite. Propargite, a common pesticide used for mite \ncontrol, is absolutely necessary to combat mites that feed on apples, \ngrapes, hops, mint, potatoes, alfalfa seeds, and many other crops that \nare grown not only in my State but in other States as well.\n  The potential impacts of a Propargite cancellation would be \ndetrimental to agricultural producers in States like California, Idaho, \nOregon, and my own State of Washington where crops grown on smaller \nnumbers of acres, like these, are important to the economy.\n  These potential impacts could cost our farmers hundreds of millions \nof dollars and would not only unnecessarily increase the price of our \nfood but may well jeopardize food safety itself.\n  Further, I have always been an advocate for safe, affordable, and \nabundant foods. Let me be clear, safety for foods will not be \nthreatened because of this provision in S. 343. The specific provision \nonly replaces the ``zero-cancer-risk'' criterion and replaces it with a \nnegligible risk criterion. This ``negligible risk'' standard will give \nthe Federal Government the flexibility it needs to permit our farmers \nto use newer and safer pesticides when they do not provide any \nsignificant risk to our foods. The status quo, however, is a threat to \nour farmers because present technology can measure these commodities in \namounts so small as not to have any real impact, other than to bar the \nuse of particular pesticides.\n  As the Senate prepares to pass legislation that will move us toward a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002, we must make tough choices. In light \nof reducing price support programs, I believe we should also work \nextremely hard to eliminate outdated and burdensome regulations that \nare placed on our farmers, among others. The Delaney clause is such an \nexample of such an unnecessary regulation, and I am convinced that the \nSenate should pass legislation that will reduce regulatory burdens that \nfarmers across this country face every day with no true, valid social \npurpose.\n  As I travel around my own State, I have listened closely to the \ncomments, suggestions, and concerns of my State's agricultural \ncommunity. Their message is clear: Reduce the regulatory burdens that \nrestrict our ability to do what we do best--provide healthy, safe, \naffordable, and abundant food. As Members of Congress, we should do all \nwe can to provide that relief for those who carry out this important \nand very vital task.\n  In summary, the science that drove the intent of the Delaney clause \n37 years ago is outdated. With today's technology and science, it is \nright--not only right but necessary--to revise and to revisit that law \npassed in 1958 and put a new one in its place that will meet its goals \nand, at the same time, save the ability of our farmers to produce food \naccurately and well. \n\n[[Page S9986]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me take a minute to state I am going to \nmake an announcement here, in the next half hour or so, about what the \nJudiciary Committee is going to do about the Tennessee debacle. So I \njust want to put people on notice that the Judiciary Committee is going \nto act on that debacle. I am very upset about it. I am upset about the \nway law enforcement officers have acted. It appears that there may have \nbeen--these are allegations, not necessarily facts--may have been ATF \nagents, FBI agents, perhaps even U.S. attorneys and other officials, \nthere may even have been some Canadian Royal Mounted Police involved in \nthis racist incident.\n  So I am going to have a few remarks to make, and I am going to set a \ncommittee agenda on that before we end today. I just want people to be \naware of it because we are not going to sit around and let that type of \nstuff happen.\n  Mr. President, I will announce with more specifics what we are going \nto do. But as of today I am sending out a notice that the Judiciary \nCommittee will hold a hearing next Friday on this matter. We expect top \nrepresentatives from Justice, Treasury, FBI, ATF, and others to be in \nattendance and to come and tell us what they are going to do to get to \nthe bottom of this, what kind of action they are going to take, to the \nextent they can tell us with the investigation as of that date.\n  So I will talk about it with more specificity before the day is out, \nbut I already have a notice going out. I have consulted with Senator \nBiden, and I have to say I have consulted with the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, who, representing his State, \nsaid that Tennesseans want to get to the bottom of this, they want to \nresolve it, and that he, representing Tennessee, will want to be \ninvolved in it and do everything he can to resolve it as well. He has \nshown great interest. I want to pay a special tribute to him for his \nwork with me on this matter.\n  Next Friday there will be an intensive hearing on this matter. We are \ngoing to just start to get to the bottom of it, and we are going to \nmake some demands on the leaders of this country to come up with a \nsystem that will never permit this to happen again anywhere. We are not \ngoing to have law enforcement people, who wear the badge of the public, \nacting like racists, or being racist, or participating in racist \nactivities.\n  From what I have heard about this, assuming that it is true--and I \nhave only read newspaper accounts and I have checked with some of these \nleaders--what I have heard about this, it is abominable. I have to tell \nyou, I have chatted with some of the leaders who confirmed that it is \ntrue, that some of our agents have participated in this. Frankly, it is \ntime to put an end, once and for all, to that type of racist activity, \nand we are going to do it.\n  I want to personally pay tribute to people in Justice and the FBI and \nATF and Treasury who have all indicated to me that they are with me on \nthis, they want to get to the bottom of it, and they are going to \nhandle it with great care and with efficiency.\n  So we will talk more about it a little bit later. Those hearings are \nscheduled now for next Friday, and we are going to get to the bottom of \nthis thing as much as we can as of that date. Then we are going to \nfollow up.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am sickened by media reports, if they are \ncorrect, regarding the so-called ``Good O' Boys Roundup'' in Tennessee. \nAccording to these reports hundreds of law enforcement officials are \ninvolved in this whites only event in the spring of each year.\n  These reports describe events at the gathering, sale of items like T-\nshirts with a target superimposed over a picture of Rev. Martin Luther \nKing, activities and displays so blatantly racist that I would not want \nto repeat them on the floor of the Senate. But, I want to make clear \nthat the behavior of these officers, if the reports are true, is \nreprehensible and cannot be tolerated. They must be condemned if \nengaged in by anyone. But, if the participants were law enforcement \nofficers sworn to protect the rights of all Americans, such activities \nare all the more reprehensible.\n  I am pleased to see that Director John Magaw has ordered an \ninvestigation into the involvement of any ATF officers. I would hope \nthat State and local authorities would follow suit. I trust that the \nATF investigation will be timely, professional, and thorough, and that \na full report will be made to the appropriate committees of Congress, \nand that officers found to have participated in racist activities \nshould be discharged.\n  Mr. President, this kind of overt racism is unacceptable and has no \nplace today in American life. It is a sad fact of American history that \nit has existed at all. I am confident that the American people \noverwhelmingly reject such behavior, particularly by officers of the \nlaw, and will demand that it not be tolerated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two articles from the Washington Times \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n               [From the Washington Times, July 11, 1995]\n\n    Racist Ways Die Hard at Lawmen's Retreat--Annual ``Good O'Boys \n        Roundup'' Cited as Evidence of ``Klan Attitude'' at ATF\n\n                            (By Jerry Seper)\n       Ocoee, Tenn.--They're trying to tone down the racist \n     trappings of the ``Good O'Boys Roundup'' here in the \n     Tennessee hills east of Chattanooga, where hundreds of \n     federal, state and local law enforcement officers gather \n     every spring to let off steam.\n       There was a lot to tone down. Gone, for example, are many \n     of the crude signs that once greeted arriving officers, like \n     this one: ``Nigger check point.''\n       The ``Good O'Boys Roundup'' is organized by agents of the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and it was held this \n     year on May 18-20.\n       Also gone this year was the traditional Saturday-night skit \n     highlighting the Good O'Boys steak dinner.'' In one skit, an \n     officer in fake Ku Klux Klan garb pulled a dildo from his \n     robe and pretended to sodomize another officer; who was in \n     blackface.\n       But according to law enforcement officers who attended this \n     year's and other events, a whites-only policy remains in \n     effect.\n       Still on sale were T-shirts with Martin Luther King's face \n     behind a target, O.J. Simpson in a hangman's noose and white \n     D.C. police officers with a black man sprawled across the \n     hood of their car under the words ``Boyz on the Hood.''\n       ``Nigger hunting licenses'' also were available throughout \n     the compound, consisting of motor homes, trailers, tents and \n     pickups gathered around a large beer truck.\n       At this year's event, some black officers--including ATF \n     agents--attempted to crash the party and were turned away \n     after having ``bitter words'' with some of the white officers \n     in attendance, the sources said.\n       At attempt by roundup organizers to tone down the event's \n     racist activities comes at a time when black agents have \n     charged ATF\n      with discrimination. In a lawsuit pending in U.S. District \n     Court in Washington, they claim ATF supervisors have done \n     little to address complaints of racial slurs, harassment \n     and other job discrimination.\n       Brought by 15 plaintiffs, the suit alleges that such \n     incidents as ``nigger hunting licenses'' seen in ATF offices, \n     a Ku Klux Klan card posted in ATF's Oklahoma City office and \n     use of the word ``nigger'' by white ATF officials have gone \n     unpunished. There are about 200 blacks among the 2,000 agents \n     within ATF, a law enforcement arm of the Treasury Department.\n       Representing the black agents is lawyer David J. Shaffer of \n     Washington. He said that his clients were aware of the Good \n     O' Boys Roundup and that discovery in the case found that \n     announcements concerning it had been circulated exclusively \n     by and to white agents.\n       ``This is what this lawsuit is about: a Ku Klux Klan \n     attitude among some of the white agents that seriously \n     affects black agents on a day-to-day basis,'' Mr. Shaffer \n     said.\n       Trial in the case has been tentatively set for next year \n     before U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth.\n       The roundup, according to invitations sent out last year, \n     has been coordinated unofficially for the past several years \n     through the \n\n[[Page S9987]]\n     ATF office in Greenville, S.C., and is open to ``any good o' boy \n     invited to attend.'' Non-law-enforcement attendees must be \n     sponsored and accompanied by law enforcement officers, and \n     participants wear wristbands to verify that they were \n     invited.\n       The event coordinator is Gene Rightmyer, a retired ATF \n     agent who previously was assigned to field offices in \n     Tennessee and South Carolina. Mr. Rightmyer did not return \n     telephone messages left for him with ATF for comment.\n       Roundup invitations show that participants were asked to \n     send their registration fees--ranging from $70 to $90--to the \n     Greenville ATF office, and the office's telephone was listed \n     as the number for any questions concerning the event.\n       Todd Lockhart, acting agent in charge of the Greenville \n     office, declined comment, referring inquiries to the ATF \n     regional office in Charlotte, NC.\n       Several ATF agents in Greenville, however, were aware of \n     the roundup, and during interviews they expressed concern and \n     dismay over the annual event.\n       ``I have never attended, nor would I,'' said one agent, \n     adding that he and others knew about the racist activities \n     and felt the event reflected poorly on the agency.\n       ``I am not surprised about the signs or the other \n     activities, and\n      whether the racism is overt or subtle, it is wrong,'' said \n     another ATF official. ``I cringe on behalf of the \n     agency.''\n       None of the several Greenville agents interviewed \n     volunteered that they had ever attended the event.\n       Earl Woodham, ATF spokesman in Charlotte, said he was aware \n     of the annual roundup and had been invited on one occasion to \n     attend but declined. He noted that the event was not \n     sanctioned or authorized by ATF.\n       ``The ATF does not and will not tolerate any kind of \n     discrimination,'' he said. ``But what people do on their own \n     time is their business; we cannot control internal \n     morality.''\n       Mr. Woodham said, however, that Mr. Rightmyer used ``poor \n     judgment'' in using the ATF address and telephone number in \n     his invitation. He said if Mr. Rightmyer were still employed \n     by the agency, he would be subject to ``a full review and \n     possible sanctions.''\n       He also suggested that ATF officials who attend the annual \n     event were ``a lot of the older agents, spinoffs from the \n     days of the revenuers and moonshine chasers.''\n       ``The younger agents just don't have time for this kind of \n     activity,'' he said.\n       ATF spokesman Jack Killorin in Washington did not return \n     calls for comment.\n       The roundup was organized in 1980 by ATF agents in \n     Chattanooga and Knoxville. It began with 58 persons, mostly \n     ATF agents, from Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and \n     North Carolina. Roundup attendance jumped to 341 last year.\n       According to Mr. Rightmyer's invitation, there are few \n     rules. Among those listed were no fighting, no fireworks and \n     ``what goes on at the roundup stays there.''\n       Jeff Randall, a former Attalla, Ala., policeman who \n     attended this year's event, said that while he would not \n     ``condemn'' the entire group, there was ``an obvious racist \n     overtone'' by many of those in attendance.\n       ``People can gather and have fun, and there was a lot of \n     good, clean fun available,'' he said. ``But the obviously \n     racist stuff was just not acceptable.''\n       Mr. Randall also confirmed seeing black agents at this \n     year's event being turned away, saying that some of the \n     program participants were ``real mad'' that they had tried to \n     get into the compound.\n       A former Alabama police official who asked not to be \n     identified said entrance to the roundup has in the past been \n     tightly controlled along a one-lane dirt road. He said he \n     personally saw and photographed racially inflammatory signs \n     along that road.\n       The former police official, who said he attended three of \n     the roundups, said the majority of participants identified \n     themselves as ATF agents. ``The roundup has been a place for \n     law enforcement personnel to go and let their hair down,'' he \n     said. ``But some of this overt racism is just inappropriate, \n     plain and simple.''\n       J.T. Lemons, owner of Grumpy's Whitewater Rafting here, \n     whose company sponsored rafting trips at the roundup, said \n     that organizers have ``done what they can over the past few \n     years to clean up the racism'' and that some overt signs were \n     ordered taken down.\n       Mr. Lemons confirmed, however, that racially sensitive T-\n     shirts ``and other stuff'' remained on sale.\n       Other business owners in this Polk County, Tenn., \n     community--east of Chattanooga, adjacent to the Cherokee \n     National Forest--also confirmed they had seen the signs, T-\n     shirts and other racist trappings but declined to be quoted \n     on the record.\n       Meetings ``designed to keep the White House informed'' on \n     the incident, including a listing of administration officials \n     involved in giving or receiving information.\n       Mr. Clinton and agency heads have pledged to cooperate with \n     the request.\n       But yesterday, nine days before the hearings are set to \n     open, the joint panel has received documents on ``roughly \n     half'' of the issues requested, according to a senior GOP \n     source close to the negotiations.\n       ``The Department of Defense has been very helpful, [and] \n     the Treasury Department just sent over 13,000 pages of \n     documents,'' Mr. Zeliff said. ``Some people are trying to \n     help us do our job, and some people aren't.''\n       Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern denied that his \n     agency was stalling. ``We've given the committee complete \n     cooperation.''\n       Mr. Mikva's office and the Defense Department did not \n     return calls seeking comment. Treasury Department officials \n     hotly denied they are stalling, saying about 80 percent of \n     the materials requested have been sent to the committee, and \n     ``almost all'' of the rest will arrive by tomorrow.\n       Staffers for Mr. Zeliff's subcommittee have requested seven \n     years' worth of personnel records on every ATF agent charged \n     with misconduct. A senior source at the Treasury Department, \n     which oversees ATF, said officials there don't consider \n     records of agents not disciplined for their involvement in \n     the Waco siege to be relevant to the investigation.\n       But the subcommittee is pressing on with its request, in an \n     effort to ``develop a pattern of overreaching on the part of \n     BATF agents,'' according to the high-level GOP source on the \n     joint panel.\n       Also yesterday, Sen. Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania Republican \n     and presidential candidate, attacked Mr. Rubin for charging \n     last week that the hearings are politically motivated and \n     that proponents of hearings are ``opponents of law \n     enforcement.''\n       In a response yesterday, Mr. Rubin denied saying that and \n     suggested Mr. Specter ``misunderstand[s] my views.''\n                                                                    ____\n\nAppalled ATF Chief Orders Probe of Agents' Role in Racist ``Roundup''--\n                  Plans Discipline for Those Involved\n\n                            (By Jerry Seper)\n\n       The head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \n     yesterday ordered an investigation into the involvement of \n     ATF agents in a whites-only ``Good O' Boys Roundup'' in the \n     Tennessee hills, saying he has ``zero tolerance'' for racism \n     in the agency.\n       Director John W. Magaw, who took over ATF in October 1993 \n     in the wake of the botched Branch Davidian raid, said he was \n     ``appalled'' that agents would take part in an \n     event marred by obvious displays of racism.\n       The Washington Times reported yesterday that ATF agents had \n     organized and helped coordinate the annual roundup since 1980 \n     and that participants, who numbered more than 300 this year, \n     had displayed crude signs bearing racist remarks and sold T-\n     shirts with racist and degrading slogans with depictions.\n       The times also reported that, despite efforts in recent \n     years to tone down the roundup's racist trappings, a whites-\n     only policy has remained in effect, and black law enforcement \n     officers, including an AFT agent, were turned away from this \n     year's May 18-20 event.\n       ``I am appalled that an event as the one reported in \n     today's Washington Times would happen in any facet of our \n     society--particularly involving law enforcement officers,'' \n     Mr. Magaw said in ordering agency officials to find out how \n     many agents were involved and whether ATF property was used \n     to organize the event.\n       ``Everyone at ATF knows of my intolerance for \n     discrimination and harassment,'' he said. ``If an inquiry \n     finds that anyone is involved in these practices, I will do \n     everything in my power to mete out the strongest possible \n     discipline.''\n       An AFT Officer of Inspection inquiry will look into \n     accusations that current and former agents\n      participated, review whether current agents had breached the \n     agency's code of conduct, and try to determine what role \n     former agent Gene Rightmyer played in the roundup.\n       Mr. Rightmyer, who has not returned telephone messages, has \n     organized the roundup the past several years and, according \n     to a recent letter of invitation, used the address and \n     telephone number of the ATF office in Greenville, S.C., where \n     he was assigned, as the contract point for registration fees \n     and questions about the event.\n       Mr. Magaw said a preliminary review of the accusations \n     began last month after article from the Gadsden Minutemen \n     Newsletter was posted on the Internet. The Alabama article \n     said racist activities went on at the roundup and that ATF \n     agents were involved.\n       The preliminary inquiry found that as many as 10 agents had \n     attended and that a black agent who went with two white \n     agents had left after hearing ``the racial undercurrents of \n     other participants,'' Mr. Magaw said.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Roundup attendance jumped to 341 last year.\n       Two former Alabama police officers who attended the event \n     this year said there were obvious racist overtones and \n     confirmed seeing black officers being turned away. They said \n     the majority of the participants they met identified \n     themselves as ATF agents, an accusation denied by Mr. Magaw.\n       ATF has come under fire since the Branch Davidian raid in \n     1992 near Waco, Texas, during which the agency tried to serve \n     an arrest warrant on sect leader David Koresh, resulting in \n     the deaths of four agents and six Davidians. The agency's \n     actions at Waco will be the subject of House hearings \n     beginning next week.\n       Black ATF agents have charged in a federal lawsuit that \n     agency supervisors have done little to address complaints of \n     racial slurs, harassment and discrimination.\n       Trial in the case has been tentatively set for next year \n     before U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth. There are about \n     200 \n\n[[Page S9988]]\n     blacks among the 2,000 agents in ATF, an arm of the Treasury \n     Department.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, again I commend Senator Hatch. I know he \nwill find strong bipartisan support for this initiative he is taking. \nThere is a bipartisan determination to go root out this kind of racism \nin America.\n  Again, I think he will find very strong support, both in the \nadministration and in those agencies, to root it out, and, I am sure, \non the part of both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I could just add one other thing. The \nJudiciary Committee is going to resolve that problem. But we are also \nworking very hard on the Ruby Ridge situation and also the Waco \nsituation. We are going to resolve those, too. But I want to do it with \na full investigation and not halfcocked. I want to get into it and do \nwhat has to be done.\n  With regard to Waco, we also know the House is starting their \nhearings next week. They have asked us to defer our hearings until \nafter theirs, in other words until September. We have agreed to do it, \non Waco.\n  On Ruby Ridge we are looking at it very, very carefully. We intend to \nfollow through on it. I know the Senators from Idaho have both talked \nto me many times about this, and I have assured them this is going to \nhappen and it is going to be done thoroughly and it is going to be done \nwell. I just want everybody to understand that aspect as well, but I do \nthink we do need to do some more investigation.\n  On the ATF matter, or should I say the Tennessee matter that involves \nATF, FBI and others, naturally we will not, by next Friday, have all of \nthe investigation done. But next Friday is to make sure we have our top \nofficials in Government come in and tell us what they are going to do \nabout these racist activities and to chat with us on the Judiciary \nCommittee about what we can do to help them.\n  I have to, preliminarily, tell you, I am very concerned. I think, \ncurrently, our leaders over at the ATF and FBI are as good as we can \nhave. John Magaw and Louis Freeh, Judge Freeh, are excellent leaders. \nThey both are jumping right on this. Both of them have done an awful a \nlot to try to make sure there is no racism within their agencies, and \nDirector Freeh in particular has been making sure that equal \nopportunity laws are abided by, outreach is being undertaken for \nAfrican-Americans and other minorities to come into the FBI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add a new section 637 to Subchapter III as follows:\n\n     SEC. 637. INTERAGENCY COORDINATION.\n\n       ``(a) To promote the conduct, application, and practice of \n     risk assessment in a consistent manner and to identify risk \n     assessment data and research needs common to more than 1 \n     Federal agency, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, in consultation with the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy shall--\n       ``(1) periodically survey the manner in which each Federal \n     agency involved in risk assessment is conducting such risk \n     assessment to determine the scope and adequacy of risk \n     assessment practices in use by the Federal Government;\n       ``(2) provide advice and recommendations to the President \n     and Congress based on the surveys conducted and \n     determinations made under paragraph (1);\n       ``(3) establish appropriate interagency mechanisms to \n     promote--\n       ``(A) coordination among Federal agencies conducting risk \n     assessment with respect to the conduct, application, and \n     practice of risk assessment; and\n       ``(B) the use of state-of-the-art risk assessment practices \n     throughout the Federal Government;\n       ``(4) establish appropriate mechanisms between Federal and \n     State agencies to communicate state-of-the-art risk \n     assessment practices; and\n       ``(5) periodically convene meetings with State government \n     representatives and Federal and other leaders to assess the \n     effectiveness of Federal and State cooperation in the \n     development and application of risk assessment.\n       ``(b) The President shall appoint National Peer Review \n     Panels to review every 3 years the risk assessment practices \n     of each covered agency for programs designed to protect human \n     health, safety, or the environment. The Panels shall submit a \n     report to the President and the Congress at least every 3 \n     years containing the results of such review.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my amendment is to promote the use of risk \nassessment in a consistent manner across agencies because we believe it \nwill clearly improve the intent of S. 343 and will further the bill's \nintent of improving risk assessment within the Federal Government.\n  It only makes sense to ensure that the conduct, application, and \npractice of risk assessment be done as uniformly as possible across \nagencies. A consistent approach will help to minimize unnecessary \nbureaucracy, overlap, and duplication, and will lead to a more \nefficient and effective process of performing risk assessment.\n  This amendment is pulled directly from the Glenn substitute, and \nshows our effort to continue this process in a truly bipartisan manner. \nThis amendment would require the Director of OMB, in consultation with \nthe Office of Science and Technology Policy to survey relevant agency \nrisk assessment practices to determine the scope and adequacy of risk \nassessment practices used by the Federal Government.\n  The amendment also requires the establishment of interagency \nmechanisms to promote coordination among agencies' risk assessment \npractices, to promote the use of state-of-the-art risk assessment \npractices throughout the Federal Government, and establish mechanisms \nto communicate risk assessment practices between Federal and State \nagencies, as well as to promote Federal and State cooperation in the \ndevelopment and application of risk assessment.\n  In addition, the amendment requires national peer review panels every \n3 years to review risk assessment practices across agencies for \nprograms designed to protect human health, safety, and the environment.\n  This amendment will ensure that advances in science and technology \nare continuously incorporated in Federal risk assessment practices and \nensure coordination of these practices among Federal and State \nagencies.\n  This amendment will, therefore, improve risk assessment practices in \nthe Federal Government, and will result in a more effective and \nefficient risk assessment process--a process that is the foundation of \neffective health, safety, and environmental regulations.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment on \nthis side. We think it is a good amendment. I believe the other side is \nprepared to accept it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are not only prepared to accept the \namendment but we are delighted that it is offered. It is language that \nactually comes from the Glenn-Chafee substitute. Needless to say, the \nmore of that substitute that we can incorporate in the pending bill the \nhappier we are. We are certainly pleased with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Delaware. \n\n[[Page S9989]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 1575) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1581 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n   (Purpose: To reform regulatory procedures, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk now the so-called Glenn-\nChafee substitute. This is on behalf of myself and Senators Glenn, \nChafee, Lieberman, Cohen, Pryor, Kerry, Lautenberg, Daschle, Boxer, \nKohl, Simon, Kennedy, Dodd, Murray, Akaka, Jeffords, Biden, Dorgan, \nBaucus, and Kerrey, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Glenn, for \n     himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Cohen, Mr. \n     Pryor, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Boxer, \n     Mr. Kohl, Mr. Simon, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Akaka, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Biden, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Baucus, and \n     Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment numbered 1581 to amendment \n     numbered 1487.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are going to begin the debate on this \nsubstitute today and then continue this on Monday.\n  This embodies a number of changes that are really significant from \nthe bill that is before us. They are succinctly set forth in a \nstatement of administration policy.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I know the Senator \nis just beginning what really is a very important statement of his \nposition and others on this bill. But could I ask a special favor of \nthe Senator? Senator Stevens is here. He just needs to speak for about \n4 or 5 minutes. I would rather have him do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand Senator Chafee is on the way to the airport. \nIf the two of them could work out an order, it would be great.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Chafee first, and then Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Alaska \nvery much for permitting me to proceed, and indeed giving me his \npodium.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Glenn and Senator \nLevin and a bipartisan group of cosponsors to put this alternative \nbefore the Senate.\n  First, I want to say something about the pedigree of this amendment \nwe are proposing. It is the bill which was reported unanimously by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee 15 to nothing. There are other \nregulatory reform bills before this body. One was reported from a \ncommittee on a straight party line vote, Republicans voting one way, \nthe Democrats voting the other. Another was discharged by unanimous \nconsent when the committee could not agree on a procedure for a markup.\n  In other words, there is tremendous dissention within the committee. \nBut this amendment that we are offering is based on the bill that has \nthe support of all the Republicans, and all of the Democrats on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  There is another point to be made about the history of this \namendment. Back in 1982, the Senate passed a regulatory reform bill on \na vote of 94 to 0. It is pretty rare that you get a vote like that \naround here, 94 to 0. A regulatory reform bill was passed just 15 years \nago.\n  Many of the issues that were discussed here on the floor over the \npast few days were all addressed by that bill; issues such as the role \nof cost-benefit analysis, judicial review, and setting agency \npriorities. I invite Members to go back and read that bill. They will \nfind that it has more in common with the amendment that Senator Glenn \nand I are presenting than it has in common with the underlying \nsubstitute.\n  There was no supermandate in 1982. Cost-benefit analysis did not \noverride other law. There was no prohibition on issuing a rule unless \nthe agency could demonstrate that the benefits justified the cost. \nCost-benefit studies were required. Yes; just as they are in this \namendment that Senator Glenn and I are presenting. Agencies were asked \nto determine whether the benefits of a rule justified the cost. But the \nbill that the Senate adopted unanimously in 1982 did not set cost \nbenefit as the ultimate test that a rule had to pass. That is one of \nthe problems with the bill that we are amending here today.\n  On judicial review, the 1982 bill specifically precluded judicial \nreview of the substance of cost-benefit studies. The agencies were \nrequired to perform them. Yes. They were. But the court challenges to \nthe methods and the assumptions, or the underlying data, could not be \nused to overturn a rule. This is consistent with judicial review in the \nprovisions we have in the Glenn-Chafee amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has been down this road before. In 1982 it \nunanimously adopted a regulatory reform bill. Members ought to read \nthat bill. They will find that the Glenn-Chafee amendment is cut from \nthe same cloth. This year, one committee of the Senate unanimously \nreported a regulatory reform bill, and that is the Glenn-Chafee \namendment.\n  In addition to the cost-benefit and judicial review benefits, there \nare other important differences that we will outline in the debate on \nMonday. I look forward to a spirited discussion.\n  I wish to thank the Chair and thank the managers of the bill for \npermitting me to proceed.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend. I will take just \na few minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the submission of S. Con. \nRes. 21 are printed in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the substitute which we offer is basically \nthe same bill as the Roth-Glenn bill, a bipartisan bill, a strong \nregulatory reform bill that passed Governmental Affairs unanimously.\n  Our substitute would fundamentally change the way that Federal \nregulatory agencies do business and would achieve meaningful, \nresponsible regulatory reform.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute would help prevent regulatory agencies \nfrom issuing rules that are not based on good science or common sense \nand that impose costs that are not justified by the benefits of the \nrule. At the same time, the Glenn-Chafee substitute would not inhibit \nor prevent agencies from taking the necessary steps to protect public \nhealth, safety, and the environment.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute strikes a good balance between reducing \nthe costs and the burdens of Federal regulation while ensuring that \nneeded public protections and benefits are being provided. It would \nproduce better informed decisions without bringing the regulatory \nprocess to a standstill or forcing outcomes which are harmful to health \nand to safety.\n  Under the Glenn-Chafee substitute, all Federal agencies would be \nrequired to perform and publish cost-benefit analyses before issuing \nmajor rules. The agencies must compare the costs and benefits of not \nonly the proposed rule but of reasonable alternatives as well, \nincluding nonregulatory market-based approaches. The agency must \nexplain whether the expected benefits of the rule justify the costs and \nwhether the rule will achieve the benefits in a more cost-effective \nmanner in the alternative. The cost-benefit analysis must be reviewed \nby a panel of independent experts and the agency must respond to peer \nreviewers' concerns.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, the major regulatory agencies would be required \nto perform and issue risk assessments before issuing major rules. The \nrisk assessments must be based on reliable scientific data and must \ndisclose and explain any assumptions and value judgments. The risk \nassessment must be reviewed by a panel of independent experts and the \nagency must respond to peer reviewers' concerns.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, Federal agencies are required to review all major \nregulations and eliminate all unnecessary regulations. If an agency had \n\n\n[[Page S9990]]\nfailed to conduct a review within the time required by the schedule, it \nwould be required to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to repeal \nthe rule rather than to have the rule automatically sunset.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, Congress would have 45 days before issuance of \nany major rule to review the rule and prevent it from taking effect by \npassing with expedited procedures a joint resolution of disapproval. \nThis would put elected representatives in a position to assure that \nagency rules are consistent with Congress' intent, a power that I have \nfought for since I first ran for the Senate.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, agencies would be required to set regulatory \npriorities to address the risks that are most serious and can be \naddressed in a cost-effective manner. Agencies would be required to \nexplain and reflect these priorities in their budget requests.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, every 2 years the President would be required to \nreport to Congress the costs and the benefits of all regulatory \nprograms and recommendations for reform.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, the Office of Management and Budget would be \nrequired by law to oversee compliance with the bill, would be required \nto review all major rules before issuance, and this would strengthen \nPresidential control over regulatory agencies, particularly the \nindependent agencies.\n  Now, Mr. President, the substitute which we offer, the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute, is a strong and a powerful bill. It is an important reform \nmeasure which, again, just a few months ago had the unanimous, \nbipartisan support of Governmental Affairs.\n  Glenn-Chafee also avoids some problems that are present in the so-\ncalled Dole-Johnston bill. And that is why it represents a balance \nbetween reform, which we need, because we have all seen excessive \nregulatory burdens placed on Americans; we need reform, but we also \nneed clean air and clean water, environmental protection, safe \nworkplaces, safe food, and the other things which a regulatory process \nproduces. We have to have both, and we can have both.\n  There are a number of problems, as I have said, in the Dole-Johnston \nbill. These problems are quite succinctly set forth in a document which \nhas been produced by the OMB with a large number of agencies who are \ninvolved in the regulatory process.\n  I am going to read briefly from that document and just take a couple \nof examples from it and then put the remainder of the document in the \nRecord.\n  It is called, from the Executive Office of the President, ``Statement \nof Administration Policy'':\n\n       The Administration strongly supports the enactment of cost-\n     benefit analysis and risk assessment legislation that would \n     improve the regulatory system. S. 343, however, is not such a \n     bill. Because the cumulative effect of its provisions would \n     burden the regulatory system with additional paperwork, \n     unnecessary costs, significant delay, and excessive \n     litigation, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, Health and \n     Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, \n     Transportation, the Treasury, and the Interior, the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget would \n     recommend that the President veto S. 343 in its present form.\n\n  This letter is dated, by the way, July 10.\n\n       The Administration is particularly concerned that S. 343 \n     could lead to:\n\n  And then they list many of the problems with the so-called Dole-\nJohnston bill. First:\n\n       Unsound Regulatory Decisions. A regulatory reform bill \n     should promote the development of more sensible regulations. \n     S. 343, however, could require agencies to issue unsound \n     regulations. It would force agencies to choose the least \n     costly regulatory alternative available to them, even if \n     spending a few more dollars would yield substantially greater \n     benefits.\n\n  I want to stop there and just use an example of what that document is \nreferring to. The language in the bill requires that the rule adopt the \nleast-cost alternative of the reasonable alternatives that are \navailable. That may sound good at first blush. The problem is we do not \nalways want to buy a Yugo. A Yugo may get you to where you are going, \nbut it may be that you want airbags or it may be that you have five \nkids or it may be that you want other kinds of features that are not \navailable on a Yugo. That is why Yugos are not selling that well, \nbecause even though it may be classified as a car, it still does not do \nwhat we want to be done, which we need to have done in a cost-efficient \nway.\n  I have a chart behind me which gives an example of what I am \nreferring to. Let us assume that we pass a statute which says that we \nwant a certain toxic substance in the air to be reduced to no more than \n10 parts per million. That is what our instruction is to the agency. We \ndecide as a Congress no more than 10 parts per million of a certain \nsubstance. We also authorize the agency, based on a cost-benefit \nanalysis, waiving the cost of the benefits of going further, that they \ncan be more restrictive than 10, should that cost-benefit analysis \nindicate to them that it makes common sense and it is cost-effective to \ndo so.\n  So the agency makes a study, and that study is that for $200 million, \nyou get to 10; for $400 million, you can get to 7. And from that point \non, the line becomes kind of flat and you are not going to be really \nachieving an awful lot more, although you are going to be spending an \nawful lot more money.\n  If you can get to 7 parts per million of a toxic substance, the \nagency may decide that you are going to quadruple the number of lives \nthat you are going to save--not the agency deciding, but it could be a \ncost-benefit analysis decides--that for the extra dollars you are going \nto have a huge return.\n  Do we have to go with the cheapest, even though it might be the \nstatutory requirement? Or could we, for some additional dollars if \nthere is a huge return, allow the agency to impose the additional \ndollars? If the cost-benefit analysis tells us that for a relatively \nfew percentage points of additional expenditures, we can gain a huge \nincrease in safety or reduce the loss of human lives by a huge \npercentage, are we going to say, ``You can't do that, you have to go \nwith the cheapest alternative''? Is that what we want to do?\n  The sponsors of the amendment say there is an escape clause from \nthat. The sponsors of the amendment say that if nonquantifiable \nbenefits to health and safety are such that you can make significant \nadditional gains in health and safety, then you are allowed to go with \nsomething more than the least-cost alternative. You are not limited to \nthe cheapest. You do not have to buy the Yugo if the nonquantifiable \nbenefits to health, safety, and the environment make a more costly \nalternative that achieves the objectives of the statute appropriately.\n  The problem with that is what happens if the benefits are \nquantifiable, like on this chart? In my hypothesis, these are not \nnonquantifiable benefits, these are quantifiable benefits that make it \nappropriate to go to a more--or might make it more appropriate--to go \nto a more costly alternative that achieves the objectives of the \nstatute.\n  Why preclude an agency from using a slightly more expensive \nalternative if there is a huge benefit? What is cost-benefit all about, \nexcept to do that, to analyze cost and benefits? Why are we putting \nagencies to this requirement, except that we will allow them some \nflexibility to use the results of the cost-benefit analysis? And if the \nresults of that analysis are that for a relatively small increase in \ncost we get a relatively large gain, why are we going to say, ``Sorry, \nyou can't do that unless the benefits are nonquantifiable''?\n  We have urged the sponsors of this amendment to make the change to \nwhere the benefits are either quantifiable or nonquantifiable. We ought \nto allow the cost-benefit analysis to be considered, and where a more \ncostly approach will give us a significant gain, we ought to do so.\n  But we have not been successful in getting an agreement to make that \nchange.\n  The administration document says that S. 343:\n\n       . . . would also prevent agencies responsible for \n     protecting public health, safety, or the environment from \n     issuing regulations unless they can demonstrate a \n     ``significant'' reduction in risk . . .\n  Now, if the cost-benefit analysis that we are requiring, that \neverybody, I think, in this Chamber wants to require to be done, \ndemonstrates that there is a reduction in the risk for almost no cost, \nwhy do we want to put in law that you cannot do that? The reduction has \nto be significant before it \n\n[[Page S9991]]\nis allowed. Why are we precluding reductions in risk to health, safety, \nand the environment if the cost-benefit analysis, which we, in both \nversions of the bill, are requiring to be made indicate that it is \nworthwhile doing?\n  Why preclude reductions in risks to our health, our children's \nhealth, our children's safety, and our environment unless it rises up \nto the level of significant if the cost of reduction is minute? I do \nnot see any logic in insisting on the word ``significant,'' once we \nhave a cost-benefit analysis requirement. I think that word should be \nstricken. We have proposed that it be stricken. In our version, there \nis no such limitation.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremainder of the statement of administration policy which sets forth \nmany of the problems in the Dole-Johnston bill, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n          S. 343--Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995\n\n       The Administration strongly supports the enactment of cost-\n     benefit analysis and risk assessment legislation that would \n     improve the regulatory system. S. 343, however, is not such a \n     bill. Because the cumulative effect of its provisions would \n     burden the regulatory system with additional paperwork, \n     unnecessary costs, significant delay, and excessive \n     litigation, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, Health and \n     Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, \n     Transportation, the Treasury, and the Interior, the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget would \n     recommend that the President veto S. 343 in its present form.\n       The Administration is particularly concerned that S. 343 \n     could lead to:\n       Unsound Regulatory Decisions. A regulatory reform bill \n     should promote the development of more sensible regulations. \n     S. 343, however, could require agencies to issue unsound \n     regulations. It would force agencies to choose the least \n     costly regulatory alternative available to them, even if \n     spending a few more dollars would yield substantially greater \n     benefits. It would also prevent agencies responsible for \n     protecting public health, safety, or the environment from \n     issuing regulations unless they can demonstrate a \n     ``significant'' reduction in risk--even if the benefits from \n     a small reduction in risk exceed the costs. Both of these \n     features would hinder, rather than promote, the development \n     of cost-beneficial, cost-effective regulations. In addition, \n     S. 343 could be construed to constitute a supermandate that \n     would override existing statutory requirements \n     indiscriminately.\n       Excessive Litigation. While it is appropriate for courts to \n     review final agency action to determine whether, taken as a \n     whole, the action meets the requisite standards, S. 343 would \n     increase opportunities for lawsuits and allow challenges to\n      agency action that is not yet final. Further, by needlessly \n     altering numerous features of the Administrative Procedure \n     Act, S. 343 could engender a substantial number of \n     lawsuits concerning the meaning of changes to well-\n     established law.\n       A Backdoor Regulatory Moratorium. S. 343 would take effect \n     immediately upon enactment, consequently leading to an \n     unnecessary and time-consuming disruption of the rulemaking \n     process. It would require proposed regulations that have \n     already been through notice and comment, and are based on \n     cost-benefit analysis, to begin the process all over again \n     because of an agency's unknowing failure to follow one of the \n     many new procedures in the bill.\n       The Unproductive Use of Analytic Resources in Issuing New \n     Rules. Since the mid-1970s, Presidents of both parties have \n     selected $100 million as the line of demarcation between that \n     which warrants full-blown regulatory analysis and that which \n     does not. Because cost-benefit and risk analyses can be \n     costly and time-consuming, the Administration believes that \n     $100 million continues to be the appropriate threshold. S. \n     343, however, has as its threshold $50 million--a decision \n     that would require agencies to use their resources \n     unproductively and that therefore cannot itself withstand \n     cost-benefit scrutiny.\n       Agencies Overwhelmed with Petitions and the Lapsing of \n     Effective Regulations. S. 343 creates numerous, often highly-\n     convoluted petition processes that, taken together, could \n     create opportunities for special interests to tie up an \n     agency in additional paperwork and, in the process, waste \n     valuable resources. Several of these processes allow agencies \n     inadequate time to conduct the required analyses and prepare \n     the required responses to petitions; contain inadequate \n     standards against which the adequacy of petitions can be \n     judged; contain inadequate limitations on who may properly \n     file petitions; and contain inadequate safeguards against an \n     agency becoming overwhelmed by large numbers of petitions. \n     These problems are exacerbated by provisions providing for \n     the sunsetting of regulations according to arbitrary \n     deadlines, which could cause effective regulations to lapse \n     without going through the notice and comment process.\n       Inappropriate Use of Risk Assessment and Peer Review. S. \n     343's risk assessment and peer review provisions are overly \n     broad in scope and would introduce unnecessary\n      delays into the regulatory process. They would \n     inappropriately subject all health, safety, and \n     environmental regulations to risk assessment and peer \n     review, regardless of whether such regulations are \n     designed to reduce risk or whether a risk assessment and a \n     peer review would, from a scientific perspective, be \n     useful or appropriate.\n       Slowed Environmental Cleanups. S. 343 could needlessly slow \n     ongoing and planned environmental cleanup activities, \n     including those at military installations necessary to make \n     the installations being made available for productive non-\n     military use. It would also invite attempts to renegotiate \n     cleanup agreements, thereby hampering enforcement efforts and \n     increasing public and private transaction costs.\n       A Less Accountable and Less Transparent Regulatory Process. \n     Any regulatory reform bill should bring ``sunshine'' to the \n     regulatory review process. Executive Order No. 12866, \n     ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' provides both for \n     centralized Executive branch review of proposed regulations \n     and for the disclosure of communications concerning pending \n     rulemakings between persons outside the Executive branch and \n     centralized reviewers. S. 343, however, contains no such \n     sunshine provision and could consequently remove \n     accountability and transparency from the regulatory process.\n       An Unduly Lengthy Congressional Layover. S. 343 includes a \n     provision for a congressional layover of 60 days that goes \n     beyond the provisions of S. 219, which provided for a 45-day \n     layover. S. 219 passed the Senate by a vote of 100-0, with \n     Administration support.\n       Unrealistic, Unmanageable Studies. S. 343 would require a \n     comprehensive study of and report on all risks to health, \n     safety, and the environment addressed by all federal \n     agencies. It would also require the President to produce \n     annually a highly detailed estimate of and report on the \n     costs, benefits, and effects of virtually all existing \n     regulatory programs. Such studies would not only be \n     unmanageable to conduct and costly to produce, but would \n     require scientific and economic analytical techniques that go \n     beyond the state of the art.\n       Unnecessarily Hindered Enforcement of Regulations and Out \n     of Court Settlements. S. 343 could create disincentives for \n     regulated entities to bring potentially conflicting \n     regulations to the appropriate agencies' attention. It could \n     also make it unnecessarily difficult for agencies to settle \n     litigation out of court.\n       Significant Changes in Substantive Law Without Proper \n     Consideration. S. 343 goes beyond attempting to reform the \n     regulatory process by making changes in substantive law--\n     altering, for example, the Delaney Clause and the Community \n     Right-to-Know Act. Whether such changes are appropriate \n     should be decided only after full hearings in the committees \n     of jurisdiction and full debate on the merits.\n       The Administration is as concerned with the cumulative \n     effect of S. 343 as with its particular features. The \n     Administration remains committed, however, to improving the \n     regulatory process, both administratively and through \n     legislation.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are major problems in judicial \nreview. It appears as though there are as many as 140 additional items \nwhich can be litigated under S. 343 because of some of the language in \nit beyond items which can be litigated today.\n  Now, we want to try to fix this thing. We do not want to make it \nworse. We have a regulatory system which needs to be repaired. We do \nnot want to make it more cumbersome, more confusing, more difficult to \noperate under. And one of the difficulties with the bill is that it \nopens the door to so many--indeed over 100, probably--areas of \nreviewable issues to be litigated. It may be a lawyer's dream, but it \nis a business person's nightmare, and I think it is a nightmare for the \ncountry.\n  So we have significant problems in the judicial review area, which \nare also partly set forth in the letter of the administration.\n  Finally, let me say this: We have worked about a week on this bill. I \nthink we have made some progress this week, and I commend Senator Hatch \nand others. So many have worked on this during this week, and I thank \nthem for the progress which has been made in the bill.\n  For instance, in one of the decisional criteria areas, I think we \nmade progress. We added sunshine last night, so that we now have in the \nunderlying Dole-Johnston bill requirements that the process, right up \nto the OMB, be open, so that when a rule that is going to affect your \nbusiness or your life is being reviewed in the White House, there is \nnotice in the public file that that is where the review is taking \n\n[[Page S9992]]\nplace. It no longer is in the agency; now it is in the White House. An \nawful lot of people are affected by these rules, and the public has a \nright to know when it is no longer the agency making the decisions that \naffect their lives or pocketbooks; it is now the White House and OMB.\n  Under the sunshine provision, now incorporated in Dole-Johnston and \nwhich was part of the Glenn-Chafee bill, we are going to have that kind \nof sunshine. There have been other improvements in this bill. We have \nbeen working on them one by one. This has been time, I think, usefully \nspent. It is a very serious effort which affects the air we breathe and \nthe water that we drink and commerce and business and everybody's \npocketbook. It affects the safety of our children. It affects almost \neverything that we do. The costs can be immense. We have to try to keep \nthem down. But the losses will be immense to life and safety if we do \nthis thing wrong.\n  So we have taken some time. It has been time well spent. I thank my \nfriend from Utah and all of the others who have been involved in the \nlast few weeks in trying to work through this process to come up with a \nbill, if possible, on which there can be a broad consensus and, if not, \nto at least come up with two alternatives which reflect differences \nwhich can be readily understood and voted on profitably by the Members \nof the body.\n  (At the request of Mr. Levin, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have talked for many days on the \nvery real need for regulatory reform. While I recognize the tremendous \nvalue of many rules in protecting public health, safety, and the \nenvironment, I also understand that Federal agencies too often ignore \nthe costs of regulation on businesses, State, and local governments, \nand individuals. Through sensible, balanced reform, we can restore \ncommon sense to government decisions and thereby improve the quality \nand reduce the burdens of Federal regulations.\n  Over the past few weeks, and the past few days, we have worked in \ngood faith to explain why we think S. 343 as currently drafted is not \nthe kind of regulatory reform we can support. The majority leader has \noffered amendments that have indeed made some improvements in his own \nbill. The threshold for a major rule is now $100 million. We have added \nin a statement clarifying that the cost-benefit test shall not be \nconstrued to override any statutory requirements, including health, \nsafety, and environmental regulations. The provision covering \nenvironmental management activities has been dropped.\n  But these changes alone do not make for balanced regulatory reform. \nWe are still faced with a bill loaded with petitions that would let \ninterested parties tie up agencies in knots. We are still faced with a \nbill that is a dream for lawyers and special interests. We have stated \nall of these and other concerns very clearly to the proponents of S. \n343. We have worked in good faith to make this a workable bill. In the \nend, we still feel that there are too many problems with the bill \nbefore us. And clearly the proponents of S. 343 also realize the \nproblems with their bill, as shown by the amendments they have been \noffering themselves to improve their own bill. That is why I am \noffering the Glenn-Chafee amendment as a substitute for S. 343.\n  This substitute is based on the bill reported out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee on a bipartisan basis, 15 to 0. Like the Governmental \nAffairs bill, the amendment I am offering to S. 343 has bipartisan \nsupport. I am offering the amendment on behalf of myself, Senators \nChafee, Levin, Lieberman, Cohen, Pryor, Kerry, Lautenberg, Daschle, \nBoxer, Kohl, Simon, Kennedy, Dodd, Murray, Akaka, Jeffords, Biden, \nDorgan, Baucus, and Kerrey.\n  I am offering this legislation because I believe the reforms \ncontained in the Dole-Johnston bill are outweighed by the creation of \nnew opportunities to stop environmental and health and safety \nprotections for the American people. It is time to directly compare \nthese proposals and to ask which proposal better fulfills the dual \ntasks of eliminating unnecessary regulatory burdens on business and \nindividuals while at the same time providing no diminution in the \nability of Government to protect the health, safety, and environment of \nthe American people.\n  I believe that our substitute provides the best answer. It is a very \nstrong reform proposal. It requires cost-benefit analysis, risk \nassessment, peer review, congressional review of significant rules, and \nreview of existing rules. It provides much-needed reform without \nparalyzing agencies. Issues--such as how much judicial review is needed \nand how we should handle existing rules--are critical in this debate.\n  Our principles for regulatory reform are the following:\n  First, cost-benefit and risk assessment requirements should apply to \nonly major rules, which has been set at $100 million for executive \nbranch review since President Reagan's time. While S. 343 has increased \nits threshold to $100 million, it also contains an amendment that was \naccepted on Monday that would include any rules subject to Regulatory \nFlexibility analysis as a ``major'' rule. What we have improved on the \none hand by increasing the threshold to $100 million, we have taken \naway with the other hand by increasing the number of rules that would \nfall under the requirements of this bill by up to 500 rules. It's too \nmuch.\n  Second, regulatory reform should not become a lawyer's dream, opening \nup a multitude of new avenues for judicial review.\n  Our amendment limits judicial review to determinations of: First, \nwhether a rule is major; and second, whether a final rule is arbitrary \nor capricious, taking into consideration the whole rulemaking file. \nSpecific procedural requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment are not subject to judicial review except as part of the \nwhole rulemaking file.\n  S. 343 will lead to a litigation explosion that will swamp the courts \nand bog down agencies. It would allow review of steps in risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis, in addition to the determination \nof a major rule and of agency decisions to grant or deny petitions. It \nallows interlocutory judicial review for the first time--letting \nlawyers sue before the final rulemaking. It alters APA standards in \nways that undermine legal precedent and invite lawsuits. And it seems \nto limit agency discretion in ways that will lead inevitably to \nchallenges in court.\n  Third, this legislation should focus on regulatory procedures and not \nbe a vehicle for special interests seeking to alter specific laws \ndealing with health, safety, the environment, or other matters.\n  Our amendment focuses on the fundamentals of regulatory reform and \ncontains no special interest provisions.\n  S. 343 provides relief to specific business interests that should not \nbe considered in the context of regulatory reform. I am referring to \nprovisions, for example, where the bill restricts the toxic release \ninventory [TRI], limits the Delaney Clause. Yesterday, the proponents \nof S. 343 voted once again for the special interests and against the \npublic interest in refusing to protect the TRI.\n  Fourth, regulatory reform should make Federal agencies more efficient \nand effective, not tie up agency resources with additional bureaucratic \nprocesses.\n  Our amendment requires cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment for \nmajor rules, and requires agencies to review all their major rules by a \ntime certain.\n  S. 343 covers a much broader scope of rules and has several \nconvoluted petition processes for ``interested parties''--for example, \nto amend or rescind a major rule, and to review politics or guidance. \nThese petitions are judicially reviewable and must be granted or denied \nby an agency within a specified time frame. The petitions will eat up \nagency resources and allow the petitioners, not the agencies, to set \nagency priorities.\n  Fifth, regulatory reform legislation should improve analysis and \nallow the agencies to exercise common sense when issuing regulations.\n  Our amendment requires agencies to explain whether benefits justify \ncosts and whether the rule will be more cost-effective than \nalternatives.\n  S. 343 has two separate decisional criteria that control agency \ndecisions--for cost-benefit determinations and for regulatory \nflexibility analyses. The reg flex override actually conflicts with the \ncost-benefit decisional criteria. \n\n[[Page S9993]]\nAnd the cost-benefit test limits agencies to the cheapest rule, not the \nmost cost-effective one.\n  Sixth, there should be sunshine in the regulatory review process.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted my amendment to S. 343 \nto ensure sunshine in the regulatory review process. I am only sorry \nthat it took so long for the proponents of S. 343 to accept it. We \noffered it several times in the negotiations, and they rejected it each \ntime. At least now, there will be sunshine.\n  As I have said before, the text of this alternative bill is almost \nidentical to S. 291, except in three main areas. First, it limits the \ndefinition of major rule to $100 million impact this, there is no \nnarrative definition, such as ``substantial increase in wages''; \nsecond, we have changed the review of rules in a way that makes more \nsense and that does not automatically sunset rules that have not been \nreviewed; and, third, it covers only particular programs and agencies \nfor risk assessment requirements and it makes other technical changes \nin line with the National Academy of Science approach to risk \nassessment.\n  In addition, our substitute reflects positive changes that have been \narrived at through negotiations on the underlying bill.\n  I believe this is a very strong and balanced approach to regulatory \nreform. It passes the two tests I believe any regulatory reform \nlegislation must achieve: First, it will provide regulatory relief for \nbusiness, State and local governments, and individuals. And, second, at \nthe same time, it protects the health, safety and environment of the \nAmerican people.\n  Let me conclude by saying that same progress has been made over the \npast few weeks in improving S. 343. But let us not leave the impression \nthat the bill is close to being acceptable. This is not the case. There \nremain substantial issues, which we have communicated on numerous \noccasions to the proponents of this bill and on which no agreement has \nbeen forthcoming. These issues are satisfactorily addressed in the \nGlenn-Chafee substitute amendment. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment as a substitute to S. 343.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me spend a few minutes addressing the \nmerits of S. 343 and the Glenn amendment. Let me say that, in our \nopinion, the Glenn amendment is reg lite. It is a somewhat weaker \nversion of S. 291, which was the compromise bill, and for that reason \nvoted out of the Governmental Affairs Committee under my close friend, \nBill Roth, my comanager on this bill. As Chairman Roth pointed out, S. \n343 is a truly superior vehicle for achieving meaningful and effective \nregulatory reform than either S. 291 or the Glenn-Chafee substitute.\n  S. 343, unlike the Glenn bill, is a product of the collective wisdom \nof three committees--Judiciary, Governmental Affairs, and Energy and \nNatural Resources--and many Senators, including Senators Johnston, \nHeflin, Dole, and others in addition. It has undergone 100 substantive \nand technical changes over the last 4 months. We have tried to \ncooperate with the White House. Many of the changes have been requested \nby them, and we have to say we have been very cooperative in the \nprocess.\n  I know that just the Judiciary Committee version of S. 343 \nencompassed helpful changes suggested by the majority and minority \nstaffs of the committee working as a task force, the administration, \nand various representatives of Federal agencies after lengthy meetings \nlasting days. These changes are reflected in the final version of S. \n343 that is before this body. So, too, are modifications made to the \nbill before the July 4 recess, which were the product of fruitful \nnegotiations among Senators Kerry, Levin, Biden, Johnston, Roth, \nNickles, Murkowski, Bond, Dole, and myself.\n  S. 343, you see, represents the aggregate acumen of many viewpoints. \nIt is a workable, balanced, and fair approach to the nettlesome issue \nof regulatory reform, and it is far preferable to the Glenn substitute.\n  Here are just some of the principal reasons why. Both bills contain \nvarious elements that are important for effective regulatory reform. S. \n343 contains cost-benefit requirements that have substantial effect as \nto which agencies can be held accountable through an effective \ndecisional requirement section enforced through judicial review.\n  The Glenn substitute's cost-benefit provision is much weaker, and its \njudicial review provision is ambiguous at best. The Glenn substitute \nrequires ``that the benefits of the rule justify the costs of the \nrule.'' And that ``the rule will achieve the rulemaking objectives in a \nmore cost-effective manner than the alternatives described in the \nrulemaking.''\n  However, unlike the Glenn substitute, S. 343 contains a decisional \ncriteria section that is far more sophisticated and efficacious. First \nof all, the decisional criteria section mandates that no rule shall be \npromulgated unless the rule complies with this section. That \nrequirement will act as a hammer to assure agency compliance with the \nstandards set forth in the decisional criteria section 624 of S. 343.\n  Now, some will say that this is overkill, that agencies will abide by \ncost-benefit standards without section 624's hammer. Yet, President \nClinton's Executive order on regulations contains a hammerless cost-\nbenefit analysis requirement which is routinely ignored by agencies and \nOMB--very similar to what the Glenn substitute is. According to an \nApril 1995 study by the Institute for Regulatory Policy, of the 222 \nmajor EPA rules issued from April to September 1994, only 6 passed \ncost-benefit analysis muster.\n The rest were promulgated anyway. In other words, the President's own \nExecutive order is ignored by OMB and other agencies, and the EPA in \nthis particular case.\n\n  Of the 510 regulatory actions published during this period, 465 were \nnot even reviewed by OMB, and of the 45 rules that were reviewed, not \none was returned to the agency having failed the obligatory cost-\nbenefit analysis test.\n  They call this regulatory reform? That is what we would get with the \nGlenn substitute.\n  Moreover, section 624 not only requires, like the Glenn substitute, \n``the benefits of the rule justify the costs of the rule;'' but unlike \nGlenn, it also requires that the rule must achieve the ``least cost \nalternative,'' of any of the reasonable alternatives facing the agency. \nOr if the ``public interest'' requires it, the lowest cost alternative, \ntaking into consideration scientific or economic uncertainty or \nunquantifiable benefits.\n  This does two things. First, it assures that the least burdensome \nrule will be promulgated; Second, that agencies are not straight \njacketed when facing scientific or economic uncertainties, or benefits \nthat cannot be quantified into promulgating a rule based on an option \nthat is only the least costly in the short term.\n  In the latter situation, agencies may explicitly take these factors \ninto account when considering the least cost alternative when \npromulgating the rule.\n  What about the effect on existing law? Section 624 of S. 343 provides \nthat its cost-benefit decisional criteria supplement the decisional \ncriteria for rulemaking applicable under the statute, granting the \nrulemaking authority, except when such an underlying statute requires \nthat a rule to protect health, safety, or the environment should be \npromulgated, and the agency cannot apply the standard in the text of \nthe statute, satisfy the cost-benefit criteria.\n  In such a case, under S. 343, the agency taking action may promulgate \nthe rule but must choose the regulatory alternative meeting the \nrequirements of the underlying statute that imposes the lowest cost.\n  In this way, agencies are given great latitude in promulgating cost \neffective rules. Thus, S. 343 strongly supplements existing law but \ndoes not embody a supermandate. This was made absolutely clear in a \nbipartisan amendment adopted just a few days ago.\n  In contrast, the Glenn amendment only requires agencies to justify \ncosts in those situations where such requirement is not expressly or \nimplicitly ``inconsistent with the underlying statute.'' This allows \nagencies to select any costly or burdensome option allowable under the \nunderlying statute.\n  What about judicial review? Could not it be argued that the Glenn \nbill's judicial review provision assures that agencies will comply with \nthat bill's albeit weak cost-benefit analysis requirement? \n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\n  While both S. 343 and the Glenn bill basically only allow for APA, \nthe Administrative Procedure Act ``arbitrary and capricious'' review of \nthe rule, and not independent review of the cost-benefit analysis and a \nrisk assessment.\n  The Glenn judicial review section contains a provision that could be \nconstrued to prohibit a court from considering a faulty cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment in determining if a rule passes arbitrary \nand capricious muster.\n  That provision states ``If an analysis or assessment has been \nperformed, the court shall not review to determine whether the analysis \nor assessment conforms to the particular requirements of this \nchapter.''\n  This literally means that a poorly or sloppily done cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment could avoid judicial scrutiny even if \nmaterial to the outcome of the rule, because the Glenn requirements for \nanalysis and assessments are not reviewable.\n  A significant reform contained in S. 343, missing in the Glenn bill, \nis the petition process. While critics of S. 343 contend that the \nbill's petition processes are too many and overlapping, I believe that \nthe bill's petition provisions are workable, not at all burdensome, and \nempower that part of the American public effected by existing \nburdensome regulation, to challenge rules that have not been subject to \nS. 343's cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment requirements.\n  For instance, in section 623, the requirement for agency review of \nexisting rules, the petition provision allows for either placing a rule \non the agency's schedule for review, or in effect to accelerate agency \nreview of rules already on the agency scheduled for review.\n  The petitioner has a significant burden to justify that the requested \nrelief is necessary. I might add that this provision was a product of \nnegotiations among Senators Kerry, Levin, Biden, Johnston, Roth, \nNickles, Murkowski, Bond, Dole, and myself.\n  One other provision that I want to mention is section 629, which \nallows for the petitioner to seek alternative means to comply with the \nrequirements of the rule. This allows for needed flexibility and will \nsave industry untold amounts of money in having to comply with \nsometimes irrational requirements, without weakening the protections \nfor health, safety, or the environment.\n  In this way, agencies are given great latitude in promulgating cost-\neffective rules. In this way, agencies are given great latitude that \nthey need to have.\n  Moreover, the following provisions of S. 343 are much better than \ntheir counterpart provisions in Senator Glenn's, the risk assessment \nprovisions. S. 343 applies its risk assessment and risk \ncharacterization principles to all agency major rules. The Glenn \namendment limits the applicability of risk assessment and risk \ncharacterization principles to major rules promulgated by certain \nlisted agencies, contains no decisional requirements for risk \nassessments.\n  Definition of cost of benefits. S. 343 makes absolutely clear that \nthe definition of cost of benefits includes nonquantifiable factors \nsuch as health, safety, social, and environmental concerns.\n  This is extremely important because not all benefits are \nquantifiable. You may not be able to place numbers on good health or \nthe beauty of a national park, for instance. The Glenn bill, on the \nother hand, does not make this clear. When a cost-benefit analysis is \ndone under Glenn, these benefits may be undervalued.\n  Emergency provisions. The Dole-Johnston bill contains exemptions for \nimposition of the notice and comments, cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment requirements. When an emergency arises or a threat to public \nhealth and safety arises, these provisions will allow for a rule that \naddresses these concerns to promptly go into effect. There is no delay. \nThe Glenn substitute, on the other hand, only contains one exemption \nfor risk assessments.\n  Is this not ironic? The supporters of the Glenn measure complained \nendlessly how S. 343 would prevent the agencies from protecting the \npublic for E. coli bacteria present in bad meat, or cryptosporidium in \ndrinking water, and have screamed that rules addressing these problems \nbe exempt from S. 343. Of course, S. 343's emergency provisions \nadequately deal with these problems. But Glenn does not.\n  Where are the equivalent provisions in Glenn? Does Glenn exempt these \ntypes of rules from cost-benefit analysis? No.\n  I find it almost disingenuous, the arguments that were made by many \non the other side, about how they were trying to protect the health of \nthe public from E. coli and from cryptosporidium, when their own bill \ndid not even provide a means to do so, and our bill does, and has from \nthe beginning.\n  All of that rhetoric that was used was what we call bull corn in \nUtah. This bill takes care of it. It is apparent, Mr. President, that \nthe Dole-Johnston measure is a superior vehicle for regulatory reform.\n I also want to say that I am one who does not spend a lot of time \nfinding fault with the media, although I have from time to time. \nNaturally all of us have done that, as Senators. But I have to say that \nthere have been some major media presentations this week that have been \nso scurrilous they do not belong in regular journalism.\n\n  One of our networks has put out two of the most scurrilous, \nindefensible, factually lacking segments that have maligned my \ncolleague, Senator Dole, in an unjustifiable way that I consider to be \ndespicable.\n  Talking about despicability, the July 6 Public Citizen news \nconference in Washington, DC--we are used to the Ralph Nader gang being \nout of line and using poor judgment and using bludgeoning tactics, and \nmisrepresenting, and not telling the truth, and using the Ethics \nCommittee to malign people. But even they, as low as they stoop all the \ntime, have stooped to one of the lowest points in the history of \nlegislation when, at a news conference, Joan Claybrook said that cost-\nbenefit analysis was akin to what the Nazis did to prisoners in \nconcentration camps during World War II.\n  Both parties ought to be outraged at this type of irresponsibility. \nThis group of people has been given much too much consideration by the \npress through the years.\n  Joan Claybrook said at that conference:\n\n       Recently, in the New York Times, there was a very \n     interesting letter to the editor commenting on this issue of \n     cost and benefit analysis. And it is taken from a table of \n     profits per prisoner that the SS (Nazi Storm Troopers) \n     created in concentration camps, trying to decide whether or \n     not the holding of the prisoners, the use of prisoners, the \n     renting out of the prisoners, and the killing of the \n     prisoners, was cost beneficial to the SS.\n\n  Joan Claybrook went on to say:\n\n       That is what I think of cost-benefit analysis, because you \n     never can have the benefits fully developed in terms of the \n     impact on human life, the trauma and the enjoyment of life.\n\n  Maybe it was a mistake. I like Miss Claybrook and I know she is very \nsincere, albeit radical. And I like her personally. But that type of \nlanguage just does not belong in this debate.\n  Unfortunately, some of us have been putting up with this for years \nfrom this group of people. I just cannot allow it to stand. It has been \na matter of, I think, just total bad taste and really a matter of great \nirritation to anybody who is a fair-thinking person.\n  With that, I will reserve the remainder of my remarks until we get \ninto this debate on Monday. But it is clear that we have, still, with \nall the work we have done--and I want to compliment my friend from \nMichigan, and certainly Senator Glenn, on the other side of this issue, \nand Senator Kerry has worked on it, Senator Baucus has worked on this \nmatter, and others--I want to compliment them for trying to see that we \ncan get together and have a bill that everybody can support. \nUnfortunately, I do not think we are going to be able to do that, but \nwe have come a long way in trying to accommodate the other side on this \nbill.\n  I have worked very long and hard to do that, as have others. I hope \nwe can continue that spirit of bipartisanship up through--hopefully we \nwill have final passage of this bill on Tuesday. And hopefully we will \nvote sometime, on the substitute, on Monday or early Tuesday. But I \nhave to say I want to compliment the intelligence of my colleagues on \nthe other side of this issue. They know what they are talking about. \nEven though we differ on some \n\n[[Page S9995]]\nof these points, I have to say it has been very interesting working \nwith them and I appreciate the good faith that they have put forth.\n  Mr. President, I would like to change the subject if I can. Hopefully \nthat will end the debate. As soon as we can, I would like to wrap up \nand let everybody go for the day.\n  I understand Senator Murkowski will be coming over. I assure the \nother side we are not going to talk any more on this, unless Senator \nMurkowski is. I do not know. But if he is, it will only be another \nstatement or so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9988-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JUDICIARY HEARING ON THE EVENTS IN TENNESSEE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I informed everybody that I was going to \nmake a statement on the Tennessee situation.\n  Mr. President, ours is a Nation of laws. We are a Nation that \nguarantees liberty and justice to all people. Our Nation is only as \nstrong as our commitment to justice is strong. When the public's faith \nin the arm of Government responsible for safeguarding our liberty and \nour democratic Government is threatened, then we have to do something \nabout it.\n  So I rise to announce that 1 week from today, on Friday of next week, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee will convene a hearing on the appalling \nevents which took place in Tennessee, the so-called ``Good Ol' Boys \nRoundup.''\n  If newspaper reports are accurate, several Federal law enforcement \nagents from among other agencies, the ATF, FBI, DEA, Secret Service, \nand Customs participated in a so-called Good Ol' Boys Roundup, an event \nthat is alleged to have involved hateful, racist, ugly conduct.\n  After consultation with the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, \nSenator Biden, and fellow committee members--especially Senator \nThompson, who wants to make sure the great State of Tennessee plays a \nrole in resolving this matter--I have decided it would be best for the \nSenate to move expeditiously on this matter.\n  Accordingly, I have informed the Directors of the ATF, FBI, and \nDeputy Attorney General Gorelick--I have personally informed them of my \nplan to hold a hearing next Friday. Witnesses I plan to call include \nthe Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the Directors of the FBI, ATF, DEA, and others. I can only \nexpress my outrage and anger that Federal law enforcement officials \nwould allow themselves to be compromised in such a way, and to \nparticipate in such conduct. I am sure that the Clinton administration \nofficials that I have mentioned share my contempt for what has gone on. \nI expect this hearing will provide the American people with an \nopportunity to hear from our top law enforcement leaders, the plans \nthey have to root out this racism.\n  Those who engaged in this conduct, who have stood by, knowing of it, \nand did nothing, must be held accountable. When a person who is clothed \nwith the authority of the people engages in hateful conduct, that \nconduct must be condemned by the people. I condemn this conduct. The \nSenate condemns it.\n  This hearing will, hopefully, provide the American people with an \nexplanation, detailing what the Clinton administration plans to do \nabout it.\n  Attorney General Reno, Director Louis Freeh, and others have made \ngreat strides in improving the efficiency, fairness, and operation of \nour law enforcement agencies. These acts of prejudice, if true, and I \nhave been led to believe that many of them are true, threaten to \nundermine the strides they have made to date.\n  It is in their interests, the interests of African Americans and \nother people of color, and the public, that we hold these hearings. In \nfact, it is in the interest of all Americans that we hold these \nhearings.\n  We must not stand by while Government officials betray the public's \ntrust. These events, if true, disgraced Federal law enforcement and the \nUnited States. It is Congress' obligation. After all, I have to say all \nof us are directly accountable to the people. But it is Congress' \nobligation to hold the executive branch accountable. And I intend to do \nso.\n  Now, I have to say in conclusion that these leaders have all \nexpressed a desire to clear up this matter and to stop it and to make \nsure that this never happens again. These are fine people who lead \nthese organizations. They have made strides in some of these areas and \nI want to continue those strides and we want to stop this type of \noffensive, racist, despicable conduct now and we intend to do so, and \nwe hope these hearings will be efficacious in helping us to get there. \nHaving said that, we look forward to those hearings next Friday and I \nhope all of our Judiciary members will be able to participate.\n  I see the Senator from Alaska is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9995-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9995-S9996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah and wish \nthe Chair a good day. I know it is late in the afternoon. I just wanted \nto make a few remarks with regard to the status of our regulatory \nreform debate that has been going on for an extended period of time.\n  There is no question, Mr. President, that we all want to see \nregulatory reform legislation passed by this Congress for two very, \nvery important reasons. They are simply fairness and common sense.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we passed \nout a bill that would accomplish fairness and common sense, and in so \ndoing address corrections needed in our regulatory process. We passed a \nbill that was easily understood. And, as a consequence, we find \nourselves immersed now in almost a legal discussion of various types of \nbinding conditions associated with what was generally understood to be \na high degree of frustration among the public, a public which was \nfrustrated over policies of the Environmental Protection Agency such as \nthe one that occurred in the largest city of Alaska, Anchorage, AK, \nwhere the city was notified that the water that accumulated after rains \nin the drains that ordinarily went out in Cook Inlet for disposal. Cook \nInlet has some 30-foot tides twice a day.\n  Suddenly, the city was advised that they were in violation because, \nprior to discharging that water, 30 percent of the organic matter had \nto be removed. In testing the water they found there was no organic \nmatter to be removed, and they appealed to the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Surprisingly enough, the EPA simply came back and said, ``You \nare out of compliance and subject to fine.'' As a consequence, some \nenterprising member of the city council suggested that they add some \nfish guts to the drainage system so that they would have something to \nremove that was organic and, therefore, comply.\n  Finally, the issue got so much publicity, Mr. President, that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency saw fit to, so-called, ``clean their \nskirts.'' So they wrote a letter saying, ``Yes, these were the \ncircumstances, but they did not make the city of Anchorage put the \norganic matter, the fish guts, into the water system.'' People of \nAlaska understood that. They understood the lack of sense that such a \nmandate made.\n  We have these horror stories. We have heard them on the floor.\n  Another concern that was expressed from time to time was the \nrealization that citizens will not be asked to pay huge amounts of \nmoney to have trace amounts of arsenic or radon or chloroform removed \nfrom their drinking water when there was absolutely no evidence of any \nadverse health affects, no scientific proof of any kind.\n  We heard cases where workers who have rushed to rescue a colleague \nfrom a collapsed ditch are subject to fines, subject to penalties for \nnot having a hard hat on in the first place.\n  We had a situation in Fairbanks--where it does snow occasionally in \nFairbanks, AK--where the city was in violation of a wetland permit \nbecause they moved the snow off one lot where the city barn is to the \nnext lot which was classified as a wetlands.\n  These are things people understand. These are issues of frustration \nthat \n\n[[Page S9996]]\nhave been expressed time and time again. But we find ourselves \nembroiled in a controversy on this legislation that has gotten beyond \nthe ability of the general public to grasp why we are not getting on it \nand making the corrections that are needed.\n  We passed a bill that would put consistent procedures for risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis in place for all agencies and make \nagencies accountable for the actions taken in reliance on those \nagencies.\n  Why does this procedure lead to fairness and common sense? Very \nsimply, because they ensure that regulations will direct our limited \nresources to the substance or activities that are most likely to harm \nus and prevent that harm in a cost-effective way. It is simply that \nsimple.\n  We find that we have an ally in this process. Let me quote from the \nstatement of the President. I have this chart here, Mr. President, \nwhich I will read very briefly. It is from the President. I quote:\n\n       The American people deserve a regulatory system that works \n     for them, not against them: a regulatory system that protects \n     and improves their health, safety, environment, and well-\n     being and improves the performance of the economy without \n     imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society; \n     regulatory policies that recognize that the private sector \n     and private markets are the best engine for the economic \n     growth; regulatory approaches that respect the role of State, \n     local, and tribal governments; and regulations that are \n     effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable. We do \n     not have such a regulatory system today.\n\n  Those are the words of our President. But in spite of what the \nPresident, what the Congress and what the American people all know, \nthis legislation has been bogged down in discussions designed to play \non emotions. It has become complex. It has become almost a lawyer's \ndelight to deliberate the application.\n  We went through it the other day on the issue of the Mammogram \nQuality Standards Act. We all know that this legislation would not in \nany way have interfered with the promulgation of the rules under that \nact.\n  I have had some familiarity with that, Mr. President, because my wife \nand a group of women in Fairbanks, AK in the mid-1970's started a \nbreast cancer clinic. They purchased a mammogram machine, and, as a \nconsequence, provided free services to the women of interior Alaska for \nan extended period of time. However, 2 years ago, under the Mammogram \nQuality Standards Acts procedure, that particular machine became \noutdated. And in order to comply with the quality standards, it was \nnecessary that a new machine be ordered.\n  So a number of us got together and raised approximately $150,000 and \nbought a new machine. This year we are raising some more money to buy a \nmobile mammogram machine. This is done without any Federal Government \nassistance of any kind, and provides the service to the women of the \ninterior who are on the road systems of Alaska, and it will be further \nextended to the villages because this unit will fit inside the National \nGuard C-130 aircraft. So when they go into the villages, the vehicle \ncan be backed out and made available to serve women that otherwise \nwould not be available for this type of care.\n  So the point is, Mr. President, that we have a system under the \nMammogram Quality Standards Act that works. Not only does this \nlegislation that we are contemplating have an exemption for health \nemergencies, but it also specifically recognizes that risk and cost-\nbenefit analysis should only be done at the level of detail necessary, \ntaking the need for expedition into consideration.\n  So, as a consequence, we found ourselves spending a good deal of time \ndebating whether or not--by not excluding mammograms--we were somehow \nrisking the health of women in the United States. And while that \nargument was voiced extensively on this floor, there was absolutely no \njustification in my mind, or others who have examined the application \nof existing laws and regulations that were covered under this \nlegislation, that indeed these services were in jeopardy.\n  So what this bill does, Mr. President, under Executive Order 12866 \nissued in 1983, there is a requirement for cost-benefit analysis for \nmajor regulations and the use of risk as a basis for regulating.\n  There are 25 high priority actions which were initiated this past \nMarch to reinvent environmental regulations in recognition that the \ncurrent regulatory system is broken.\n  Further, after several years of no action, the Environmental \nProtection Agency recently decided to change a longstanding food safety \npolicy related to residual levels of pesticides that treated flour and \ntomato paste as ready to eat.\n EPA has already compiled a list of obsolete, duplicative, or \nunnecessary regulations and obtained concurrence from States on planned \nrevisions and terminations that would eliminate 16,000 pages from the \nCode of Federal Regulations.\n\n  The administration is planning a project known as XL that would, for \nthe first time, allow pollutant trading among different media such as \nair and water, as part of the President's plan to emphasize market-\nbased regulation.\n  A high-level Clinton administration working group has crafted a far-\nreaching set of proposed administrative, regulatory and legislative \nchanges to reform cleanups under Superfund and the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act, including provisions that elevate the \nconsideration of risk and cost in cleanup decisions.\n  EPA has launched a major effort to review, streamline, and offer new \nflexibility for states in implementing the agency's Clean Water Act \nPermit Program. This is considered a key proposal in the initiative to \nmodify or delete duplicative, burdensome, or obsolete rules.\n  EPA is moving to pare back routine inspection and enforcement \nrequirements, particularly for industrial wastewater and hazardous \nwaste disposal facilities, to shift agency resources to focus \nenforcement efforts on high risk facilities or activities.\n  EPA has changed its position from a December preproposal and decided \nnot to regulation low-level radioactive waste storage sites already \noverseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a position taken by six \nSenators that such regulation would be a wasteful duplication of \neffort.\n  A major Clean Air Act rulemaking was initiated in January to allow \nStates to automatically implement broad trading programs in emission \nreduction credits on the open market. In addition, a model rule \nallowing banking of credits is under consideration.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that each of \nthese proposals covers areas addressed already in S. 343, so one has to \nask why are some Members of this body, why are some of those at the \nWhite House fighting this legislation when we all know that we need \nthis bill. The American people know we need this bill. We also know \nthat we should not have to stand here and continually recite day after \nday, hour after hour, horror stories and examples of regulatory excess \nto get this legislation passed. We all know it has to be done, and it \nshould be done without further delay.\n  So it is my hope that the leadership on both sides of the aisle can \nget a handle on this legislation and recognize that the American people \nwant efficiencies in Government; they want efficiencies in regulation; \nthey want efficiencies in oversight; and they want to be able to \nunderstand the process that is occurring. They want it based on \nfairness, and they want it based on common sense, and they want it now.\n  I thank the Chair. I wish my colleagues a pleasant weekend.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S9995-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a moratorium for the excise tax on diesel fuel sold for or used in \nnoncommercial diesel-powered motorboats and to require the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to study the effectiveness of procedures to collect excise \ntaxes on sales of diesel fuel for noncommercial motorboat use; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  diesel fuel excise taxes legislation\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nhelp solve a problem that has made it difficult for recreational \nboaters to obtain diesel fuel on our Nation's waterways. This bill \nwould correct the significant unintended problems created by the \nfederally mandated diesel fuel dyeing scheme contained in the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1993. These problems are national in scope \nand affect every area of the country with significant boating activity.\n  Under the 1993 changes, fuel that is subject to taxation is clear and \nfuel that is exempt from taxation is dyed. The problem for boaters \narises because while most marinas have only one fuel tank, they provide \nfuel to both recreational and commercial boats. Commercial boat fuel is \nexempt from any tax and therefore commercial boat operators seek to \npurchase dyed fuel. Recreational fuel is taxable and recreational \nboaters want to purchase clear fuel. Diesel fuel retailers have been \nforced to choose either one, to incur the significant costs and \nregulatory burdens of having separate fuel storage tanks from which to \npump untaxed--dyed--and taxed--undyed--diesel fuel or two, to pump only \none type of diesel fuel. Many marina operators can only afford to \nmaintain one storage tank. Most marina operators in my State of \nLouisiana find that their primary customer base is made up of \ncommercial boaters and they are choosing to sell the dyed fuels. Thus, \nrecreational boaters have no place to purchase the clear fuel.\n  With diesel fuel unavailable for recreational boaters, there is a \nserious danger that some of these boaters may run out of fuel and \nbecome stranded before they are able to find a marina that sells clear \nfuel. As a further consequence, many marina operators are finding that \ntheir diesel fuel sales have declined significantly because they are \nnot allowed to sell dyed diesel fuel--the only fuel they have--to \nrecreational boaters.\n  Mr. President, this is a clear case of unintended consequences. The \nboaters are willing to pay the tax, they simply cannot find a place to \nbuy the fuel and pay the tax. The bill I am introducing today addresses \nthis problem in a practical manner by:\n  Having the Treasury Department asses the effectiveness of various \nprocedures for collecting excise taxes on diesel fuel sold for use, or \nused, in recreational boats and report to Congress within 18 months the \nresults of the study, including any recommendations.\n  Suspending collection of the tax for 2 years while the Treasury \nDepartment conducts this study.\n  Reinstituting the current collection procedure at the end of the 2-\nyear suspension period if Congress has not enacted legislation to \ncreate a new collection procedure.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation is necessary to \nincrease the availability of diesel fuel to recreational boaters across \nthe country. Passage of this legislation will ultimately lead to \nimproved collection of the diesel fuel tax, prevent a potentially \ndangerous safety hazard to recreational boaters, and improve the \neconomic viability of many marine fuel retailers. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in moving this bill forward as soon as possible.\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Breaux, in introducing legislation imposing a \n2-year moratorium on the collection of the boat diesel fuel tax. this \ntax has caused diesel fuel shortages across this country.\n  The Omnibus budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 changed the collection \npoint for the excise tax on diesel fuel. Imposition of the tax was \nmoved from the producer or importer to the terminal rack--the place in \nthe distribution chain where fuel retailers, for example, service \nstations and boat docks, get their fuel. This change made collecting \nthe diesel fuel tax similar to the system used for gasoline taxes. The \nintent in making this change was to improve taxpayer compliance and \nassist the Internal Revenue Service with administering the diesel fuel \ntax.\n  Mr. President, collection the tax at the terminal rack works well for \ngasoline because all of the uses of that fuel are taxable. That is not \ntrue for diesel fuel. Home heating oil, which is essentially diesel \nfuel, is not taxable. Also, diesel fuel used by commercial boaters is \nnot subject to the tax.\n  Together with moving the collection point of the tax, a dyeing scheme \nwas set up to differentiate diesel fuel on which tax has been paid from \nfuel which has not been taxes. Dyeing is an important enforcement tool \nbecause of the variety of uses of diesel fuel.\n  Mr. President, I fully support efforts to increase compliance with \nour tax laws. However, in administering our tax laws, we must be aware \nof the problems we create. Let me give you a real life example of the \nproblem this tax has created.\n  Diesel fuel powers many types of boats, the vast majority being \ncommercial boats--such as fishing vessels. Diesel fuel sold to \ncommercial boaters is exempt from the tax, but the same fuel used in a \nrecreational boat is taxable. Under the current collection scheme, fuel \nsold to the recreational boater must be clear because tax has been paid \non that fuel. Fuel sold to the commercial boater must be dyed to show \nthat no tax has been paid. Under no circumstances may dyed fuel be sold \nto \n\n[[Page S9999]]\nsomeone who is subject to the tax, even if the retailer collects the \ntax and remits it to the Federal Government.\n  The obvious problem created by this arrangement is that a marina or \ndock that services both commercial and recreational boaters must have \ntwo separate storage tanks to service these customers. It may not be \neconomically feasible to install a new tank, and often it is physically \nimpossible to do so. The marina has few options available to it to get \naround this problem. One solution is to buy dyed fuel for its \ncommercial boaters and forfeit the pleasure boat business. An \nalternative is to buy undyed--taxed--fuel, pass the tax on to all of \nits customers and leave it to those who are exempt from the tax to \napply for a refund. Commonly cash flow problems associated with this \nsecond option cause undue economic hardship for commercial boaters.\n  The anecdotal evidence suggests that marinas simply are dropping \ntheir recreational boat fuel business, because sales to commercial \nboaters dominate the market. It is this reality of the marketplace that \nhas sent recreational boaters scrambling to find fuel.\n  The legislation introduced by Senator Breaux and me imposes a 2-year \nmoratorium on the collection of the boat diesel excise tax. It also \nrequires the Treasury Department to study the various options for \ncollecting the tax and to report its findings to the Ways and Means and \nFinance Committees. In performing this study, Treasury is specifically \ninstructed to consult with boat owners and diesel fuel retailers. It is \nour hope that this study will identify ways to modify the current \ncollection system in a way that will ensure compliance without creating \nthe problems boaters are facing today.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Pell, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1035. A bill to permit an individual to be treated by a health \ncare practitioner with any method of medical treatment such individual \nrequests, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                  the access to medical treatment act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Access to \nMedical Treatment Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dole, \nHarkin, Hatch, Grassley, Pell, Hatfield, Simon, and Reid in this effort \nto allow greater freedom of choice in the realm of medical treatments.\n  I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to mention one other \nperson, someone who has been instrumental in sparking my interest in \nthis issue. That person is Berkley Bedell, a former congressman from \nthe Sixth District of Iowa. His story was one of the main catalysts in \nmy decision to develop the Access to Medical Treatment Act, and \nprovides powerful testimony to the need for this type of legislation.\n  As did a number of us in the Senate, I had the privilege of serving \nwith Congressman Bedell for several years in the House of \nRepresentatives. During his tenure in the House, he acquired a well-\nearned reputation for intellectual honesty and commitment to principle, \nas well as for tilting at the occasional windmill. In more than one \ninstance, he appeared out of step with conventional opinion and \nsubsequently proved to be ahead of his time.\n  As some may remember, Congressman Bedell was ill with Lyme disease \nwhen he left the House at the end of the 100th Congress. Having tried \nseveral unsuccessful rounds of conventional treatment consisting of \nheavy doses of antibiotics, the cost of which ran in the thousands of \ndollars, he turned to an alternative treatment that he believes cured \nhis disease. This treatment, which is actually a veterinary treatment, \nconsisted on its most basic level of nothing more than drinking \nprocessed whey from a cow's milk. After approximately 2 months of \ntaking regular doses of this processed whey, his symptoms disappeared. \nHe estimates that the total cost for this alternative treatment was a \nfew hundred dollars.\n  In spite of Congressman Bedell's amazing recovery, and the fact that \nthis same treatment appeared to be effective in some cases of Lyme \ndisease, the treatment can no longer be administered because it has not \ngone through the FDA approval process.\n  Not long after he recovered from Lyme disease, Congressman Bedell \ndiscovered he had prostate cancer. He again found conventional \ntreatments to be unsuccessful and turned to alternative medicine. This \ntime he had to leave the country to obtain his treatment. Once again, \nhowever, alternative therapy appears to have been successful thus far--\nhe has been free of cancer for 5 years.\n  Mr. President, there are people in our country who are desperate, as \nwas Berkley Bedell, for cures that conventional medicine simply does \nnot seem to be able to provide. It is a tragedy that, in a nation that \nconsiders itself a world leader in the area of health care, many \npotentially helpful alternative treatments remain unavailable to those \nwithout the financial resources to seek them out abroad.\n  The Access to Medical Treatment Act attempts to address this \nsituation. Is intent is twofold: First, to allow increased access to \nalternative treatments; and second, to allow increased opportunities \nfor the trial of alternative treatments that may prove to be extremely \neffective.\n  It will be asked why this legislation is necessary. If a particular \nalternative treatment is so effective, then why can't it simply go \nthrough the standard FDA approval process?\n  The answer is that the time and expense currently required to gain \nFDA approval of a treatment makes it very difficult for all but large \npharmaceutical companies to undertake such an arduous and\n costly endeavor. The heavy demands and requirements of the FDA \napproval process, and the time and expense involved in meeting them, \nserve to limit access to the potentially innovative contributions of \nindividual practitioners, scientists, smaller companies, and others who \ndo not have the financial resources to traverse the painstakingly \ndetailed path to certification. This system not only forgoes untold \npotential for exploring life-saving treatments, but also serves to \nprevent low-cost treatments from gaining access to the market.\n\n  I want to be absolutely clear, however, that this legislation will \nnot dismantle the FDA, undermine its authority, or appreciably change \ncurrent medical practices. It is not meant to attack the FDA or its \napproval process. It is meant to complement it.\n  The FDA should--and would under this legislation--remain solely \nresponsible for protecting the health of the Nation from unsafe and \nimpure drugs. The heavy demands and requirements placed upon treatments \nbefore they gain FDA approval are important, and I firmly believe that \ntreatments receiving the Federal Government's stamp of approval should \nbe proven safe and effective.\n  The intent of my legislation is merely to extend freedom of choice to \nmedical consumers under carefully controlled situations. I believe that \nindividuals, especially individuals who face life-threatening \nafflictions for which conventional treatments have proven ineffective, \nshould have the option of trying an alternative treatment, so long as \nthey have been fully informed of the nature of the treatment and are \naware that it has not been approved by the FDA. This is a choice that \nis rightly left to the consumer, and not dictated by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The Access to Medical Treatment Act will allow individuals, under \ncertain carefully circumscribed conditions, to obtain medical \ntreatments that have not yet been approved by the FDA. The medical \ntreatments prescribed under this bill cannot be dangerous to the \npatient. However, given the fact that the very intent of the bill is to \nallow treatments that have not necessarily undergone extensive testing, \nit is possible that a treatment administered under the bill could turn \nout to be a danger to the patient. In such cases, the treatment and its \nadverse effects must be immediately reported to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, who must disseminate that information, and the \ntreatment cannot be utilized again.\n  The bill requires full disclosure to the patient of the treatment's \ncontents, potential side effects, and any other information necessary \nto fully meet FDA informed consent requirements. The patient must also \nbe informed of the fact that the treatment \n\n[[Page S10000]]\nhas not been proven safe and effective by the Federal Government, and \nis required to sign a written statement indicating that he or she has \nbeen made aware of this information.\n  Finally, no advertising claims can be made about the efficacy of a \ntreatment by a manufacturer, distributor, or other seller of the \ntreatment. Claims may be made by the practitioner administering the \ntreatment, but only so long as he or she has not received any financial \nbenefit from the manufacturer, distributor, or other seller of the \ntreatment. Lastly, a statement made by a practitioner about his or her \nadministration of a treatment may not be used by a manufacturer, \ndistributor, or other seller to advance the sale of such treatment. I \nask that the text of the bill be placed into the Record upon the \ncompletion of my remarks.\n  Concerns have been voiced about how this proposal safeguards consumer \nprotections. I take seriously these concerns. Individuals are often at \ntheir most vulnerable when they are in desperate need of medical \ntreatment, and that is why it is absolutely critical that a proposal of \nthis nature include strong protections to ensure that consumers are not \nsubject to charlatans who would prey on their misfortunes and fears for \npersonal gain. The Access to Medical Treatment Act is armed with these \nprotections.\n  The bill requires that a treatment be administered by a properly \nlicensed health care practitioner who has personally examined the \npatient. It requires the practitioner to comply fully with FDA informed \nconsent requirements. Most importantly, however, the bill strictly \nregulates the circumstances under which claims regarding the efficacy \nof a treatment can be made. It is designed to prohibit all claims by \nindividuals for whom the underlying intent of promoting the treatment \nmight be linked to personal financial gain.\n  What this means is that there can be no marketing of any treatment \nadministered under this bill. As such, I see very little incentive for \nanyone to try to use this bill as a bypass to the process of obtaining \nFDA approval. Also, because only properly licensed practitioners are \nable to make any claims at all about the efficacy of a treatment, I see \nvery little room for so-called quack medicine. In short, if an \nindividual or a company wants to earn a profit off their product, they \nwould be wise to go through the standard FDA approval process rather \nthan utilizing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I fully realize that there will be significant debate \nover both the concept and content of this legislation. I welcome this \ndebate, and am open to changes. If this bill generates the serious \ndiscussion that I believe these issues merit, then we will have made \nmuch-needed progress. If that discussion results in action, then I \nbelieve we will offer hope to thousands who feel they have run out of \noptions.\n  In essence, this legislation addresses the fundamental balance \nbetween two seemingly irreconcilable interests: The protection of \nconsumers from dangerous treatments and those who would advocate unsafe \nand ineffective medicine--and the preservation of the consumer's \nfreedom to choose alternative therapies.\n  Some may say that reconciling these two interests is an impossible \ntask. I am not convinced of that.\n  In any case, the complexity of this policy challenge should not \ndiscourage us from seeking to solve it. I am convinced that the public \ngood will be served by a serious attempt to reconcile these \ncontradictory interests, and I am hopeful the discussion generated by \nintroduction of this legislation will help point the way to its \nresolution. I welcome anyone who would like to join me in promoting \nthis important debate to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that our health care delivery system \nshould be more receptive to alternative treatments. I am also sensitive \nto the fact that how we accomplish that goal has important \nramifications that must be thoroughly explored. It is my hope that the \nAccess to Medical Treatment Act, and the debate it engenders, will \nserve those ends.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1035\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Access \nto Medical Treatment Act. This legislation is very simple--it would \nallow individuals to access, under certain carefully circumscribed \nconditions, medical treatments not approved by the FDA.\n  The Access to Medical Treatment Act gives an individual the freedom \nto choose any licensed health care practitioner with any method of \nmedical treatment the individual desires as long as the treatment is \nnot dangerous and the patient is fully informed of its side effects.\n  Other consumer protections in the bill include a prohibition against \nadvertising claims of efficacy. In addition, the labels on the \ntreatment cannot be false or misleading.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would not dismantle the Food and Drug \nAdministration or allow pharmaceutical companies to circumvent the FDA. \nThe FDA would retain responsibility for certifying treatments as safe \nand effective. What this legislation does allow is for a bypass for the \nFDA approval process for alternative medicines that may be the only \nhope for some individuals.\n  Mr. President, many times in this Chamber I have applauded the \nquality of American health care. No doubt about it--it is by far the \nbest in the world. And, although maintaining quality standards is a \nhigh priority, there are times when conventional medicine offers \nlimited hope for some life-threatening diseases. While the role of the \nGovernment is to ensure quality, denying access to a treatment that may \nbe the only hope for a patient is not the role of the Government.\n  And, while I support this legislation, I can empathize with those who \nfear the quality of care will suffer as a result of bypassing the FDA. \nFor this reason, and since there is little data so far on alternative \nmedicines, I would strongly encourage a thorough hearing process on the \nefficacy of these medical treatments.\n  Mr. President, no doubt about it, the Food and Drug Administration \nplays an essential role in evaluating the safety and efficacy of \nmedical treatments to protect our citizens. However, in a free market \nsystem, it seems to make sense to make available nonharmful alternative \nmedical treatments to individuals who desire such treatments, without \nthe Federal Government standing in the way.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \ntoday in introducing S. 1035, the new and improved version of a very \nimportant bill, the Access to Medical Treatment Act, drafted last year \nby our colleague, the distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  At the outset, let me underscore how committed I am to efforts such \nas this which will allow Americans the freedom to take advantage of the \nmedical treatments they want and need.\n  I think that the two big lessons many learned last year from our \nsuccess on the dietary supplement legislation is that American \nconsumers want the freedom to use products and procedures that improve \ntheir health and that we cannot always count on the Food and Drug \nAdministration to foster those freedoms. These consumers spoke out \nvigorously for their rights.\n  If any Member doubts this, he or she should simply recall the piles \nof mail they received on our Dietary Supplement Health and Education \nAct. I know I received more grassroots constituent communications on \nthis topic than on any other.\n  I recall a hearing held by our colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, another \nleader in the alternative medicine community, last year on the subject \nof alternative medicine. This was an important hearing; and, as I \nrecall, our colleague Senator Daschle took time from his busy schedule \nto sit in even though he was not a member of the committee.\n  At that hearing, we heard very compelling testimony from Hon. Berkley \nBedell, whose own experience with Lyme disease is quite a testimonial \nto the need for this legislation. I was very impressed by his knowledge \nand dedication to this legislation.\n  However, many of us at the hearing were taken aback, quite frankly, \nby the FDA's intransigence in refusing to recognize congressional \ninterest in providing Americans with the freedom to choose alternative \nmedicine. Unfortunately, that mindset and lack of leadership at the \nagency make legislation such as this necessary.\n  In fact, I recall vividly the testimony of FDA Deputy Commissioner \nMary Pendergast--an eloquent spokesperson, albeit one who does not seem \nto recognize a speeding train when she sees one--when she told the \ncommittee that, in essence, all the FDA wanted was for products to be \nstudied. Her concern was that in allowing free use of safe products, \nthe FDA approval--study--process would be circumvented.\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\n  Ms. Pendergast's presentation was noticeably lacking in that it did \nnothing to reassure the committee that FDA has any interest whatsoever \nin making sure that consumers are able to use these products, or, \nindeed, in our agenda. The agency was only concerned with the process \nrather than the outcome.\n  It is that kind of shortsighted thinking which has made FDA reform \nincreasingly popular on Capitol Hill.\n  Before I close, I wanted to cite some important modifications that \nSenator Daschle has made to this bill.\n  First, the new legislation specifically references our work last year \nand the new dietary supplement law by explicitly stating that the \ndefinition of food includes dietary supplements.\n  I want to commend Senator Daschle and his staff for this \nmodification.\n  Second, the bill now requires the practitioner administering the \ntreatment to personally examine the patient; I think this is an \nimportant consumer protection.\n  Third, the patient must be informed in writing before administration \nof the treatment that it has not been approved by the Government. \nAgain, I agree that this is important information for consumers.\n  Fourth, following the precedent we set with dietary supplements, the \nrevised bill prohibits any product labeling which is false or \nmisleading. The FDA, of course, wants to approve each and every label. \nThis is a degree of control which is simply not possible if we are to \nmake alternative treatments available.\n  Fifth, the language explicitly states that no health care \npractitioner, manufacturer, or distributor may use this bill to \ncircumvent the Controlled Substances Act. This is a provision I had \nsuggested, and I am glad to see that my colleagues agreed with me that \nit should be incorporated in the legislation.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I again want to thank my colleague for his \nforesight in sponsoring this legislation and for being such an \neffective advocate for its passage. I am pleased to join him as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1036. A bill to provide for the prevention of crime, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the juvenile crime prevention and reform act\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, when reflecting upon the condition \nof American society as we move into the next century, there are few \nfeatures of our social fabric that give rise to more concern than the \nviolence that is plaguing our major urban centers and creeping into our \nsuburbs and rural areas as well. By far, the most troubling aspect of \nour culture of violence is that young people, some not old enough to be \ncalled adolescents, are armed, dangerous, and committing heinous crimes \nat an increasing rate in each passing year.\n  To make matters worse, as the number of young males aged 14 to 17 \ngrows over the next 5 years, we can expect record levels of juvenile \ncrime. One expert estimates that this demographic trend will produce \n``a minimum of 30,000 more muggers, murders, and chronic offenders'' \nthan we have now.\n  There is no single Government policy or program that will solve our \njuvenile crime epidemic in the long or short run. Our approach must be \ncomprehensive. First, punishment for violent crime must be swift and \ncertain. We must dedicate adequate resources for police to catch \ncriminals, for prosecutors to convict them, and for prisons to house \nthem. Violent criminals must remain behind bars for a long time, as \nthis is the only way to ensure that they do not victimize other \ninnocent, law-abiding citizens.\n  While adequate resources for police, prosecutors, and prisons are \nvitally necessary, we must acknowledge the limitations of the criminal \njustice system. For the most part, the criminal justice system is \nreactive--that is, it only engages after a crime has been committed. \nSince only a small percentage of crimes actually lead to arrests, and \nan even smaller percentage lead to conviction and punishment, the \nextent to which the criminal justice system can actually deter crime is \nlimited.\n  This is especially true with respect to youth from dysfunctional \nfamilies living in communities riddled by gangs, guns, and drugs. I do \nnot believe that we can deter these young people from crime merely by \nincreasing criminal penalties and building more prisons. These youth \nturn to violence because it pervades their environment, because gang \nleaders are their role models, because their lives are filled with \ndespair and hopelessness, and because life in prison is not such a bad \nalternative to their violent, drug-infested communities.\n  Programming designed to prevent at-risk youth from turning to a life \nof crime is an important complement to our criminal justice system. \nWell-designed programs that give children constructive alternatives to \nthe streets and provide youth with exposure to positive adult role \nmodels have made a difference. Over the years, I have met with numerous \nyoung people whose lives have been turned around because someone in the \ncommunity--be it a school principal, police officer, or program \ndirector--has taken an interest in them. Investment in prevention \nprograms can save lives and can reduce crime.\n  Because I believe we must include prevention programming as part of \nour comprehensive approach toward crime, today I am introducing, along \nwith Senator Kohl, the Juvenile Crime Prevention and Reform Act.\n  I am very pleased to be joined by Senator Kohl in this effort. We \nonce served as ranking members of the Juvenile Justice Subcommittee. I \nknow that he continues to share a keen interest in this subject and \ncares a great deal about America's youth.\n  The purpose of the legislation we are introducing is to remedy the \ndefects in the prevention title of last year's crime bill, while \npreserving a meaningful role for prevention programming in our national \ncrime strategy.\n  The problem with last year's crime bill was that it became a vehicle \nfor an assortment of unproven social programs, many of which were not \ndirectly linked to crime prevention. The undisciplined addition of \nthese programs gave rise to the charge the bill was laden with pork and \nthat the programs were nothing more than social experimentation.\n  The proper response to what happened last year, however, is not to \nrepeal all the juvenile crime prevention programs in the crime bill. \nEliminating prevention programming would send the wrong message to \nchildren and parents from distressed, crime-ridden communities who are \ntrying the best they can to lead normal, productive lives.\n  As an alternative, this legislation takes a comprehensive look at \nboth the problems and promise of crime prevention programming.\n  The heart of the bill is a mandate that every program authorized by \nthe legislation be subjected to a rigorous scientific evaluation. This \nis the only way that Congress and the States can begin to determine \nwhich prevention strategies work and which do not.\n  In addition, we require the administration to develop a proposal to \nconsolidate and rationalize the scores of Federal programs designed to \nprovide assistance to at-risk youth. Preliminary results from a study I \nrequested from GAO indicate that there are over 128 Federal programs \nthat target at-risk youth. Most of these programs have tiny budgets and \noverlapping missions. Savings can be gained by consolidating redundant \nprograms and repealing programs that have not proven to be effective or \nhave outlived their usefulness.\n  Third, we start the process of trimming the number of overlapping and \nredundant programs by repealing 12 programs from last year's crime bill \nand other statutes. These repeals result in over $1 billion in savings.\n  Finally, we preserve and streamline four core prevention programs, \neach of which is carefully targeted to address the needs of communities \nthat have been ravaged by crime:\n  One program will provide assistance in the form of a block grant \ndirectly to local governments where the most creative prevention work \nis being done. Local governments are given wide latitude as to how \nthese funds should be spent, so long as they are dedicated to programs \nto prevent juvenile violence and delinquency.\n  Second, the bill authorizes funding for the Weed and Seed Program, a \nBush \n\n[[Page S10003]]\nadministration initiative, which requires local police, prosecutors, \ncorrectional officers, schools, and community organizations to \nintegrate law enforcement efforts and prevention programming.\n  Third, the bill preserves the bipartisan Community Schools Program, \nwhich provides funding to keep school and other community facilities \nopen in the afternoon, weekends, and summers, to serve as community \ncenters. This program is designed to meet what a school principal from \nWestbrook, ME has described to me as ``our young people's desperate \nneed for quality after-school programs that address both their \nacademic, social, and recreational development.''\n  Finally, the bill will address the pervasive problem of youth gangs \nby consolidating the Federal Government's fragmented gang intervention \nefforts and creating a unified antigang program with sufficient funding \nto have an impact.\n  The total cost of the four programs is $3 billion, approximately $1 \nbillion less than the amount of funds dedicated to youth prevention \nprogramming in last year's crime bill.\n  One of the Nation's leading experts on crime, James Q. Wilson has \ntestified this year that ``I believe we should continue to test \npromising crime prevention strategies, building on such leads as we now \npossess and subjecting each strategy to rigorous, external \nevaluation.'' That is exactly what this bill accomplishes.\n  This package is comprehensive, it addresses both the strengths and \nweaknesses of the Federal Government's crime prevention efforts, and it \nis sensitive to the genuine needs of our communities.\n  We owe it to the Nation's youth to continue searching for ways to \neffectively prevent crime and make our communities safer. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1036\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

FURTHER CONSOLIDATION OF PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK \n                   YOUTH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Ounce of Prevention Council shall \n     submit to Congress a report regarding the elimination of \n     duplication and inefficiency in the structure and operation \n     of Federal juvenile crime and delinquency prevention \n     programs.\n       (b) Requirements.--The report required under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) discuss the extent to which programs in different \n     Federal agencies serve similar purposes and target \n     populations;\n       (2) discuss whether multiple Federal program structures, \n     each receiving limited appropriations, deliver services to \n     at-risk youth (as defined in section 30201(1) of the Violent \n     Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (as amended by \n     section 201)) in an optimal, cost-effective fashion; and\n       (3) make specific recommendations regarding the \n     elimination, consolidation, and modification of crime and \n     delinquency prevention programs in all Federal agencies and \n     departments.\n                                                                    ____\n\n            Juvenile Crime Prevention and Reform Act of 1995\n\n       Sections 1-2. Short Title and Table of Contents.\n       Section 3. Purposes. The Act is intended to consolidate and \n     streamline juvenile crime prevention programs under the 1994 \n     Crime Act and other authorizing statutes. These programs \n     include the following:\n       Ounce of Prevention Grant Program.\n       Model Intensive Grants.\n       Family and Community Endeavor Schools (FACES).\n       Police Recruitment Grants.\n       Local Partnership Act.\n       National Community Economic Partnership.\n       Urban Recreation.\n       Family Unity Demonstration.\n       Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT).\n       Juvenile Mentoring Program.\n       National Youth Sports.\n       HHS Youth Drug/Gang Prevention Grant Program (repealed in \n     Sec. 501 of the Act).\n\n\n   title i--evaluation of programs and development of national crime \n                    prevention and research strategy\n\n       This title requires that the Attorney General (with respect \n     to Titles II, III, and V of the Act) and the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (with respect to Title IV) evaluate \n     all programs funded under the Act. They are also responsible \n     for formulating a comprehensive national evaluation strategy.\n       The Act requires rigorous, independent evaluation of each \n     and every prevention program funded by the Act, and grantees \n     must collect the data necessary for thorough evaluations to \n     occur. These evaluations will be funded with 3-5% of the \n     moneys allocated for each program.\n\n\n          title ii--local crime prevention block grant program\n\n       This title amends subtitle B of Title III of the Crime Bill \n     (the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant Program) to increase \n     funding over five years to $1.5 billion (from $377 million), \n     by reallocating Local Partnership Act funding. By \n     consolidating these block grants, significant savings are \n     achieved.\n       Under the new block grant program, the Ounce of Prevention \n     Council is authorized to provide technical assistance to \n     local governments that receive payments.\n\n\n         title iii--weed and seed community anti-crime program\n\n       This title funds targeted anti-crime and anti-drug \n     partnerships between law enforcement agencies and schools, \n     social service providers and community organizations. These \n     programs are designed to mobilize communities in a joint \n     effort to weed out violent crime and drug crime through \n     community policing and coordinated law enforcement, while \n     seeding targeted areas with crime and drug prevention \n     programs.\n       Through an Executive Office of Weed and Seed, the Attorney \n     General is responsible for making grants to State and local \n     governments, as well as private non-profit organizations. \n     Funding for weeding activities is provided through the \n     Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, while \n     funding for seeding is provided through this Act, at $500 \n     million over five years.\n\n\n        title iv-community schools and safe places grant program\n\n       The Act retains the bi-partisan (Danforth-Bradley) \n     Community Schools program which helps communities maintain \n     ``safe havens'' in high risk neighborhoods. The community \n     centers funding by the Act will provide children at-risk of \n     violent victimization with shelter and support after school, \n     on weekends, and during the summer. The program is jointly \n     administered by the Secretaries of HHS and Education, who \n     provide grants in consultation with the Attorney General. The \n     proposed funding is $800 million over five years.\n\n\n           title v-consolidation of gang prevention programs\n\n       The Act consolidates three distinct gang prevention \n     programs currently in the federal budget--one in HHS and two \n     in DOJ--creating, instead, one comprehensive federal anti-\n     gang effort administered jointly by the Office of Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention and HHS. By placing this \n     component within the prevention compromise, the federal \n     government's anti-gang effort will be subject to the research \n     and accountability provisions of the Evaluation Mandate. The \n     proposed funding level is $125 million over five years.\n\n\n     title vi--further consolidation of programs for at-risk youth\n\n       Under this title, the Ounce of Prevention Council is \n     charged with providing Congress with a report regarding the \n     elimination of duplication and inefficiency in the structure \n     and operation of Federal juvenile crime and delinquency \n     programs, including specific recommendations for eliminating \n     these problems.\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce the Juvenile Crime \nPrevention and Reform Act of 1995, which I am proud to cosponsor with \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Cohen. Our legislation offers the \nmiddle ground: it will help stop violence before it starts, and make \nFederal prevention programs work more efficiently and effectively.\n  The good news, Mr. President, is that overall crime rates have bucked \nthis trend. So we need more police officers on the streets, and more \ncertainty of punishment. Nevertheless, prevention must also be part of \nour strategy--because we cannot afford to lay aside any weapons in the \nbattle for safe streets. After all--what kind of reasonable society \nwould pay billions for prisons, while doing nothing to prevent crime in \nthe first place?\n\n[[Page S10009]]\n\n  Prevention is essential because there is empirical evidence \nindicating that many prevention programs now on the chopping block do \nstop crime before it happens. For example, a Milwaukee program, called \n``Summer Stars,'' combining recreation,\n employment counseling and coaching resulted in a 27-percent decrease \nin robberies and a 40-percent reduction in auto thefts in targeted \nareas. And in Madison, WI, President Bush's ``weed and seed'' program \nreduced serious crime by almost 20 percent. Moreover, Lansing MI found \nthat crime fell by 60 percent in two troubled neighborhoods after a \ncooperative effort among local law enforcement officers, schools, and \nsocial service agencies began.\n\n  Yet despite the success of crime prevention efforts--and past \nbipartisan support led by Senator Biden--the 1995 prevention debate has \nbeen skewed by overblown rhetoric. While some opponents of prevention \nhave simplistically labeled all programs ``pork,'' some defenders of \nprevention have fought only for the status quo, without answering the \nlegitimate questions about whether each prevention program actually \nworks--and whether all programs target those most in need.\n  Mr. President, neither side is right. While we must not reject all \nprevention, there is considerably more research to be done before we \ncan confidently assert exactly which prevention strategies work best. \nAnd there is waste and duplication among prevention programs created \nand expanded upon in the crime act.\n  Our proposal takes the sensible middle ground. While preserving \nessential prevention programs, the bill also consolidates and \neliminates others, and requires all prevention programs to prove \nthemselves. Specifically, the bill will achieve these results in three \nways.\n  First, because there is much more we need to know about prevention \nprograms, the evaluation mandate in our bill requires rigorous, \nindependent evaluation of each and every prevention program funded in \nthe compromise package; and it will require grantees to collect the \ndata necessary for thorough evaluations to occur. In other words, you \ndon't collect the data, you don't get the funds.\n  Second, too much duplication has resulted in a multitude of programs \nwhere fewer could do the job. For example, the local partnership act \nfunds largely the same kinds of programs as the local crime prevention \nblock grant. By consolidating these programs, and eliminating the \nadministrative structure for the local partnership act, we can save \nmillions of dollars.\n  Finally, in an effort to target at-risk juveniles, and in recognition \nof our responsibility to the American taxpayer, this legislation will \neither eliminate or consolidate 12 Federal crime prevention programs. \nThe remaining programs are redirected to one of four core prevention \ninitiatives. The net fiscal result: a cut of more than $1 billion from \ncurrent crime act prevention funding levels. While I am not entirely \nhappy about pursuing this cut in prevention funds, I propose it only as \na reasonable alternative to the Republican plan for outright \nelimination of crime prevention funding.\n  Mr. President, I reject the elimination of prevention because we must \nnot give up on our young people, and resign ourselves to more victims, \nmore criminals, and more prisons. We must ensure community safety, but \nmerely building more prisons is like paying billions for ambulances at \nthe bottom of a cliff yet spending nothing to build guardrails at the \ntop. That just doesn't make sense.\n  We must also be sure, however, that the guardrails we invest in do \nthe job efficiently and effectively. While continuing the fight to \nprevent crime, our legislation will also give us more bang for our \ncrime prevention buck. I hope that my colleagues will join Senator \nCohen and myself in this effort.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 1037. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide \nthat the requirement that U.S. Government travel be on U.S. carriers \nexcludes travel on any aircraft that is not owned or leased, and \noperated, by a U.S. person; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                 the fly america amendments act of 1995\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fly America \nAmendments Act of 1995. As the workers of our country know, the Fly \nAmerica Act is an indispensable element of American aviation policy. \nThe act was intended to ensure that to the extent service is available \non U.S. carriers, employees of the Federal Government must use that \nservice.\n  On May 3, 1994, the General Services Administration issued a request \nfor proposals [RFP] for 1 year requirement contracts for carriers to \nprovide air transportation services to Government employees traveling \non U.S. official Government business. The RFP contained more than 5,000 \ncity-pairs, of which approximately 1,114 involved international routes. \nAmerican Airlines protested, because the RFP allowed U.S. carriers to \nbid on routes where the services was actually being provided by a \nforeign airlines under a code-sharing arrangement.\n  On December 29, 1994, the Comptroller General of the United States \nheld that code-sharing did not violate the Fly America Act. What the \ndecision means is that a U.S. airline may submit the bid to GSA for an \ninternational route, but the actual travel is on a foreign airline. To \nput this more directly, Lufthansa is the designated provider of United \nStates Government travel from Atlanta to Germany. Lufthansa and United \nAirlines are code-sharing partners, and United won the Atlanta bid. As \nfar as I can tell, Lufthansa is not a United States citizen, is not a \nUnited States flag carrier, does not participate in the civil reserve \nair fleet [CRAF] program, and but for the Comptroller General \nmisinterpretation, would not be able to bid on carrying United States \nGovernment employees on United States Government business.\n  The bill I am introducing today essentially overturns the \nComptroller's misinterpretation. The bill will restore the requirement \nthat U.S. Government travel be provided on an aircraft that is owned or \nleased by a U.S. citizen and operated by a U.S. citizen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1037\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of American in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fly America Amendments Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. UNITED STATES AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Travel Preference for Aircraft Owned and Operated by \n     United States Citizens.--Section 40118(a) of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended by inserting after ``title'' the \n     following: ``on an aircraft that is owned or leased by a \n     United States citizen and operated by a United States \n     citizen''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to transportation originating more \n     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 1038. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \na 15-percent tax only on individual taxable earned income and business \ntaxable income, to repeal the estate and gift taxes, to abolish the \nInternal Revenue Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                        the flat tax cut of 1995\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in sending to the desk a bill entitled \n``The Flat Tax Act of 1995,'' my hope is that this legislation will \nhelp stimulate further interest and understanding regarding the \nreplacing of the present cumbersome and complex Tax Code with a simple \n15-percent flat tax. It also, by the way, provides a standard deduction \nof $10,000 for individuals and an extra $5,000 for each child.\n  This means that a family of four would not pay taxes on its first \n$30,000 of income.\n  The bill also requires a 15 percent across-the-board reduction in \nFederal spending; it cuts foreign aid by 50 percent; and eliminates the \nIRS entirely, thereby giving millions of taxpayers a tax cut and \nsharply reducing Federal spending at the same time.\n  Now, the flat tax has been discussed many, many times. Thus far, it \nhas not advanced to any extent measurable, but it is fair, it is \nsimple, and it will eliminate the myriad of loopholes that presently \nriddle the Tax Code. In contrast to the existing system, a flat tax \n\n[[Page S10010]]\nwould save billions of dollars each year in time and paperwork. It will \nspur massive economic growth.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Congress absolutely must overhaul the \nFederal income tax system and, at the same time, overhaul the Federal \nGovernment. Any flat tax proposed must be based on three fundamental \nprinciples: First, it must be simple and pure--there should be no \nexceptions or deductions other than a standard personal deduction; \nsecond, it should provide Americans with a tax cut; third, it should be \ncoupled with a meaningful cut in spending.\n  On the first point, it is abundantly clear that the Federal tax laws \nare too complex, unfair, and unworkable. There are more than 480 tax \nforms confronting the taxpayers of the United States. I have copies of \nall of the tax forms at my desk, and I ask Senators, at some convenient \ntime, to contrast that pile of forms to the flat tax postcard which I \nhave in my hand.\n  Incidentally, I ask unanimous consent that this proposed tax postal \ncard be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Helms 15 Percent Flat Tax\n\n\n                   form 1--Individual Wage Tax--1995\n\n       Your first name and initial (if joint return also give \n     spouse's name and initial), last name.\n       Your social security number.\n       Home address (number and street including apartment number \n     or rural route).\n       Spouse's social security number.\n       City, town, or post office, state and ZIP code.\n       1. Wages, Salaries, and Pensions.\n       2. Personal Exemptions: a. $20,000 for married filing \n     jointly, b. $10,000 for singles, c. $15,000 for single head \n     of household.\n       3. Number of Dependents, not including spouse.\n       4. Personal Exemptions for Dependents (line 3 multiplied by \n     $5,000).\n       5. Total Personal allowances (line 2 plus line 4).\n       6. Taxable Wages (line 1, less line 5, if positive, \n     otherwise zero).\n       7. Tax (15% of line 6).\n       8. Tax already paid.\n       9. Tax due (line 7 less line 8, if positive).\n       10. Refund due (line 8 less line 7, if positive).\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, U.S. taxpayers spend 5.4 billion hours and \n$192 billion every year trying to fill out these tax forms. One can \nonly imagine how easy it would be simply to submit this postcard in \nlieu of the existing paperwork.\n  Mr. President, taxpayers spend a lot of money trying to comply with \nor to avoid the tax laws. We all know that.\n  A study by James Payne of Lytton Research estimates that the Tax Code \ncosts $593 million every year, which includes tax avoidance, tax \ncompliance, paperwork, and lost production. The flat tax would save \ntaxpayers an enormous amount of time and money.\n  Now, the second benefit of the flat tax proposal that I just sent to \nthe desk would provide millions of Americans with a tax cut. Over the \nyears, taxpayers have been taken to the cleaners by the Federal \nGovernment, a government which has taken more and more money away from \nthe American workers every year.\n  I noticed in a report from the Heritage Foundation recently that in \n1948 the average family of four paid 2 percent of its income to the \nFederal Government. In 1992, that same family of four would pay 24.5 \npercent of its income to Uncle Sam. That is only Federal taxes.\n  Third, we should dramatically reduce the size of the Federal \nGovernment by eliminating every dollar of Federal spending that is not \nabsolutely essential. Entire programs should be abolished or reformed, \nincluding the Internal Revenue Service itself. With a flat tax, those \ncountless thousands of IRS agents would no longer be justified in \nharassing the taxpayers.\n  A General Accounting Office study, by the way, Mr. President, \ndisclosed one-half of the 10 million notices sent out by the IRS are--\nquoting the General Accounting Office-- ``incorrect, unresponsive, \nunclear, or incomplete.'' I might add, or all four.\n  Mr. President, the flat tax would have a profound effect on the \neconomy. It will promote growth by increasing incentives for work and \ninvestment and production. It will eliminate the double taxation of \ninterest and dividends and the taxation of capital gains, which will \nincrease savings, of course, and investments, and obviously it will \nstimulate growth and create jobs.\n  The economists have said that a flat tax would increase work output \nby 3 percent, and an additional 3 percent from capital formation. That \ntranslates into about $1,900 extra for every American worker by the \nyear 2002.\n  Furthermore, increased savings will push interest rates down and thus \nreduce the cost of capital and the cost of homes, cars, and college \neducations for American families.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill provides a transition rule for home \nmortgage. I thought about this a lot. I came to the conclusion that \nthose families who have existing home mortgages should be allowed to \ndeduct the interest for the duration of that existing mortgage. This is \nonly a transition rule and applies only to existing home mortgages.\n  Now, I recognize that the concept of flat tax is not new. As a matter \nof fact, I offered my first flat tax bill, S. 2200, back in 1982, March \n15. It called for a 10-percent flat tax.\n  Needless to say, I commend Representative Armey for his having put \nforward a solid proposal. He is doing the Nation a great service and I \nplan to support his version, cosponsor it, when it comes over to the \nSenate.\n  Our tax system has become so complex and so economically \nunproductive, outmoded, and riddled with exceptions that it is no \nwonder that the American people have lost faith in their Government to \nsuch a high degree.\n  Mr. President, a flat tax is based on equity, efficiency, and \nsimplicity. I think the American people want a flat tax because they \nunderstand that it is fair. They understand that it will save billions \nof dollars and that it will be a spark plug for the economy.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. Dole, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nHatfield, Mr. Pell, Mr. Helms, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mrs. \nHutchison, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. D'Amato) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; ordered to be held at the desk:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 21\n\n       Whereas in 1995, women of America are celebrating the 75th \n     anniversary of their right to participate in our government \n     through suffrage;\n       Whereas Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. \n     Anthony were pioneers in the movement for women suffrage and \n     the pursuit of equal rights; and\n       Whereas, the relocation of the ``Portrait Monument'' to a \n     place of prominence and esteem in the Capitol Rotunda would \n     serve to honor and reserve the contribution of thousands of \n     women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Architect of the Capitol shall restore \n     the ``Portrait Monument'' to its original state and place it \n     in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to call attention to the Senate \nthat on August 26, Americans will celebrate the 75th anniversary of \nwomen's suffrage.\n  On August 26, 1920, the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution \ngranting women the right to vote was ratified in the State legislatures \nof the country after having been sent to the States by the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  Alaska was in the forefront of the suffrage movement. Few people know \nthat during the mining days that preceded this century, in the last \npart of the last century and the early part of this century, women \nvoted in the mining camps in the organization of local governments in \nour territory.\n  As a matter of fact, the first act of the first territorial \nlegislature in Alaska was to grant women the right to vote. That 1913 \nresolution said that:\n\n       In all elections that are now or may hereafter be \n     authorized by law in the Territory of Alaska or any \n     subdivision or municipality thereof, the elective franchise \n     is hereby extended to such women as have the qualifications \n     of citizens required of male electors.\n\n  It just so happens that E.B. Collins, who was my first senior partner \nwhen I went to Alaska and practiced in Fairbanks, was the speaker of \nthe first house of representatives in that territorial legislature. He \nsaid to me that he felt like giving women the right to vote was one of \nhis greatest victories in the days of the Territory of Alaska. I am \nsure he would be pleased to know today, that his position as speaker of \nthe State of Alaska is held by an Alaskan woman, Gail Phillips of \nHomer, AK, and the president of our Alaska State Senate is Drue Pearce, \nanother successful Alaska woman.\n  Unfortunately, history has not fully recognized the role that these \ncourageous suffragists have played in our history. While a statue was \ncommissioned to honor those women involved in the process, it has been \nrelegated to the basement of the Capitol and faces a back wall. At one \ntime, the inscription was actually painted over with whitewash.\n  In our Rotunda, most of the statues honor Presidents, and as we know, \nall to date have been men. Someday I hope the Rotunda will be graced \nwith a statue of the first female President. Until then, it is my hope \nto honor the role women have played by moving the women's suffrage \nstatue up to the place of honor it should have in the Rotunda. So today \nI am sending to the desk a resolution directing the Architect of the \nCapitol to move the women's statue from the basement into the Rotunda \nbefore August 26.\n  Mr. President, this concurrent resolution is cosponsored by Senators \nDole, Ford, Hatfield, Pell, Helms, Moynihan, Kassebaum, Hutchison, and \nMikulski.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be held at the desk until the close \nof business Monday so all Senators who may wish to do so may cosponsor \nit, and then having cleared this with the minority and majority, I ask \nthat it be held on the calendar until such time as the leadership will \nbring it to a vote, which I hope will be very soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank this young lady, Sherry Little, \nwho works on the Rules Committee staff, who brought this statue to my \nattention.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for his courtesy.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10011-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10011-S10066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n       THE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       HARKIN AMENDMENT NO. 1541\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HARKIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 1487 proposed by Mr. Dole to the bill (S. 343) to reform \nthe regulatory process, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Omnibus Property Rights Act \n     of 1995''.\n\n                     TITLE I--FINDINGS AND PURPOSES\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the private ownership of property is essential to a \n     free society and is an integral part of the American \n     tradition of liberty and limited government;\n       (2) the framers of the United States Constitution, in order \n     to protect private property and liberty, devised a framework \n     of Government designed to diffuse power and limit Government;\n       (3) to further ensure the protection of private property, \n     the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution was \n     ratified to prevent the taking of private property by the \n     Federal Government, except for public use and with just \n     compensation;\n       (4) the purpose of the takings clause of the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution, as the Supreme \n     Court stated in Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 \n     (1960), is ``to bar Government from forcing some people alone \n     to bear public burdens, which in all fairness and justice, \n     should be borne by the public as a whole'';\n       (5) the Federal Government has singled out property holders \n     to shoulder the cost that should be borne by the public, in \n     violation of the just compensation requirement of the takings \n     clause of the fifth amendment of the United States \n     Constitution;\n       (6) there is a need both to restrain the Federal Government \n     in its overzealous regulation of the private sector and to \n     protect private property, which is a fundamental right of the \n     American people; and\n       (7) the incremental, fact-specific approach that courts now \n     are required to employ in the absence of adequate statutory \n     language to vindicate property rights under the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution has been \n     ineffective and costly and there is a need for Congress to \n     clarify the law and provide an effective remedy.\n\n     SEC. 102. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to encourage, support, and \n     promote the private ownership of property by ensuring the \n     constitutional and legal protection of private property by \n     the United States Government by--\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n\n       (1) the establishment of a new Federal judicial claim in \n     which to vindicate and protect property rights;\n       (2) the simplification and clarification of court \n     jurisdiction over property right claims;\n       (3) the establishment of an administrative procedure that \n     requires the Federal Government to assess the impact of \n     government action on holders of private property;\n       (4) the minimization, to the greatest extent possible, of \n     the taking of private property by the Federal Government and \n     to ensure that just compensation is paid by the Government \n     for any taking; and\n       (5) the establishment of administrative compensation \n     procedures involving the enforcement of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 and section 404 of the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act.\n\n              TITLE II--PROPERTY RIGHTS LITIGATION RELIEF\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) property rights have been abrogated by the application \n     of laws, regulations, and other actions by the Federal \n     Government that adversely affect the value of private \n     property;\n       (2) certain provisions of sections 1346 and 1402 and \n     chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as \n     the Tucker Act), that delineate the jurisdiction of courts \n     hearing property rights claims, complicates the ability of a \n     property owner to vindicate a property owner's right to just \n     compensation for a governmental action that has caused a \n     physical or regulatory taking;\n       (3) current law--\n       (A) forces a property owner to elect between equitable \n     relief in the district court and monetary relief (the value \n     of the property taken) in the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims;\n       (B) is used to urge dismissal in the district court on the \n     ground that the plaintiff should seek just compensation in \n     the Court of Federal Claims; and\n       (C) is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal \n     Claims on the ground that plaintiff should seek equitable \n     relief in district court;\n       (4) property owners cannot fully vindicate property rights \n     in one court;\n       (5) property owners should be able to fully recover for a \n     taking of their private property in one court;\n       (6) certain provisions of section 1346 and 1402 and chapter \n     91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     Tucker Act) should be amended, giving both the district \n     courts of the United States and the Court of Federal Claims \n     jurisdiction to hear all claims relating to property rights; \n     and\n       (7) section 1500 of title 28, United States Code, which \n     denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain \n     a suit which is pending in another court and made by the same \n     plaintiff, should be repealed.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) establish a clear, uniform, and efficient judicial \n     process whereby aggrieved property owners can obtain \n     vindication of property rights guaranteed by the fifth \n     amendment to the United States Constitution and this Act;\n       (2) amend the Tucker Act, including the repeal of section \n     1500 of title 28, United States Code;\n       (3) rectify the constitutional imbalance between the \n     Federal Government and the States; and\n       (4) require the Federal Government to compensate property \n     owners for the deprivation of property rights that result \n     from State agencies' enforcement of federally mandated \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a number of Federal environmental programs, \n     specifically programs administered under the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and section 404 \n     of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344), \n     have been implemented by employees, agents, and \n     representatives of the Federal Government in a manner that \n     deprives private property owners of the use and control of \n     property;\n       (2) as Federal programs are proposed that would limit and \n     restrict the use of private property to provide habitat for \n     plant and animal species, the rights of private property \n     owners must be recognized and respected;\n       (3) private property owners are being forced by Federal \n     policy to resort to extensive, lengthy, and expensive \n     litigation to protect certain basic civil rights guaranteed \n     by the United States Constitution;\n       (4) many private property owners do not have the financial \n     resources or the extensive commitment of time to proceed in \n     litigation against the Federal Government;\n       (5) a clear Federal policy is needed to guide and direct \n     Federal agencies with respect to the implementation of \n     environmental laws that directly impact private property;\n       (6) all private property owners should and are required to \n     comply with current nuisance laws and should not use property \n     in a manner that harms their neighbors;\n       (7) nuisance laws have traditionally been enacted, \n     implemented, and enforced at the State and local level where \n     such laws are best able to protect the rights of all private \n     property owners and local citizens; and\n       (8) traditional pollution control laws are intended to \n     protect the general public's health and physical welfare, and \n     current habitat protection programs are intended to protect \n     the welfare of plant and animal species.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide a consistent Federal policy to encourage, \n     support, and promote the private ownership of property; and\n       (2) to establish an administrative process and remedy to \n     ensure that the constitutional and legal rights of private \n     property owners are protected by the Federal Government and \n     Federal employees, agents, and representatives.\n\n     SEC. 502.

as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end, add the following new title:\n\n               ``TITLE II--URBAN REGULATORY RELIEF ZONES\n\n     SECTION 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n     comply with regulations is inversely related to the length of \n     time over which a site has been utilized for commercial and/\n     or industrial purposes, thus rendering older sites in urban \n     areas most unlikely to be chosen for new development and \n     thereby forcing new development away from the most needy \n     areas; and\n       (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended social \n     and economic consequences in urban areas where such \n     regulations, among other things--\n       (A) offend basic notions of common sense, particularly when \n     applied to individual sites;\n       (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n       (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing jobs and \n     businesses;\n       (D) undermine new economic development, especially in \n     previously used sites;\n       (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n     significantly to protect human \n\n[[Page S10065]]\n     health, particularly in areas where economic development is urgently \n     needed in order to improve the health and welfare of \n     residents over the long term; and\n       (F) contribute to social deterioration to such a degree \n     that high unemployment, crime, and other economic and social \n     problems create the greatest risk to the health and well-\n     being of urban residents.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this tile are to--\n       (1) empower qualifying cities to obtain selective relief \n     from Federal regulations that undermine economic stability \n     and development in distressed areas within the city; and\n       (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n     specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas--\n       (A) upon application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget by an Economic Development Commission established by a \n     qualifying city pursuant to section 205; and\n       (B) upon a determination by the appropriate Federal agency \n     that granting such a waiver will not substantially endanger \n     health or safety.\n\n     SEC. 204. ELIGIBILITY FOR WAIVERS\n\n       (a) Eligible Cities.--The mayor or chief executive officer \n     of a city may establish an Economic Development Commission to \n     carry out the purposes of section 205 if--\n       (1) the city has a population greater than 200,000 \n     according to the U.S. Census Bureau's latest estimates for \n     city populations.\n       (b) Distressed Areas.--Any census tract within a city shall \n     qualify as a distressed area if--\n       (1) 33 percent or more of the resident population in the \n     census tract is below the poverty line; or\n       (2) 45 percent or more of out-of-school males aged 16 and \n     over in the census tract worked less than 26 weeks in the \n     preceding year; or\n       (3) 36 percent or more families with children under age 18 \n     in the census tract have an unmarried female as head of the \n     household; or\n       (4) 17 percent or more of the resident families in the \n     census tract received public assistance income in the \n     preceding year.\n     SEC. 205. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The mayor or chief executive officer of a \n     qualifying city under section 204 may appoint an Economic \n     Development Commission for the purpose of--\n       (1) designating distressed areas, or a combination of \n     distressed areas with one another or with adjacent industrial \n     or commercial areas, within the city as Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zones; and\n       (2) making application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget to waive the application of specific Federal \n     regulations within such Urban Regulatory Relief Zones.\n       (b) Composition.--to the greatest extent practicable, an \n     Economic Development Commission shall include--\n       (1) residents representing a demographic cross section of \n     the city population; and\n       (2) members of the business community, private civic \n     organizations, employers, employees, elected officials, and \n     State and local regulatory authorities.\n       (c) Limitation.--No more than one Economic Development \n     Commission shall be established or designated within a \n     qualifying city.\n\n     SEC. 206. LOCAL PARTICIPATION\n\n       (a) Public Hearings.--Before designating an area as an \n     Urban Regulatory Relief Zone, an Economic Development \n     Commission established pursuant to section 205 shall hold a \n     public hearing, after giving adequate public notice, for the \n     purpose of soliciting the opinions and suggestions of those \n     persons who will be affected by such designation.\n       (b) Individual Requests.--The Economic Development \n     Commission shall establish a process by which individuals may \n     submit requests to the Economic Development Commission to \n     include specific Federal regulations in the Commission's \n     application to the Office of Management and Budget seeking \n     waivers of Federal regulations.\n       (c) Availability of Commission Decisions.--After holding a \n     hearing under paragraph (a) and before submitting any waiver \n     applications to the Office of Management and Budget pursuant \n     to section 207, the Economic Development Commission shall \n     make publicly available--\n       (1) a list of all areas within the city to be designated as \n     Urban Regulatory Relief Zones, if any;\n       (2) a list of all regulations for which the Economic \n     Development Commission will request a waiver from a Federal \n     agency; and\n       (3) an explanation of the reasons that the waiver of a \n     regulation would economically benefit the city and the data \n     supporting such a determination.\n\n     SEC. 207. WAIVER OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Selection of Regulations.--An Economic Development \n     Commission may select for waiver, within an Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zone, Federal regulations that--\n       (1)(A) are unduly burdensome to business concerns located \n     within an area designated as an Urban Regulatory Relief Zone; \n     or\n       (B) discourages new economic development within the zone: \n     or\n       (C) creates undue economic hardships in the zone; or\n       (D) contributes to the social deterioration of the zone; \n     and\n       (2) if waived, will not substantially endanger health or \n     safety.\n       (b) Request for Waiver.--(1) An Economic Development \n     Commission shall submit a request for the waiver of Federal \n     regulations to the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (2) Such request shall--\n       (A) identify the area designated as an Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zone by the Economic Development Commission;\n       (B) identify all regulations for which the Economic \n     Development Commission seeks a waiver; and\n       (C) explain the reasons that waiver of the regulations \n     would economically benefit the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     and the data supporting such determination.\n       (c) Review of Waiver Request.--No later than 60 days after \n     receiving the request for waiver, the Office of Management \n     and Budget shall--\n       (1) review the request for waiver;\n       (2) determine whether the request for waiver is complete \n     and in compliance with this title, using the most recent \n     census data available at the time each application is \n     submitted; and\n       (3) after making a determination under paragraph (2)--\n       (A) submit the request for waiver to the Federal agency \n     that promulgated the regulation and notify the requesting \n     Economic Development Commission of the date on which the \n     request was submitted to such agency; or\n       (B) notify the requesting Economic Development Commission \n     that the request is not in compliance with this Act with an \n     explanation of the basis for such determination.\n       (d) Modification of Waiver Requests.--An Economic \n     Development Commission may submit modifications to a waiver \n     request. The provisions of subsection (c) shall apply to a \n     modified waiver as of the date such modification is received \n     by the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (e) Waiver Determination.--No later than 60 days after \n     receiving a request for waiver under subsection (c) from the \n     Office of Management and Budget, a Federal agency shall--\n       (A) make a determination of whether to waive a regulation \n     in whole or in part; and\n       (B) provide written notice to the requesting Economic \n     Development Commission of such determination.\n       (2) Subject to subsection (g), a Federal agency shall deny \n     a request for a waiver only if the waiver substantially \n     endangers health or safety.\n       (3) If a Federal agency grants a waiver under this \n     subsection, the agency shall provide a written statement to \n     the requesting Economic Development Commission that--\n       (A) describes the extent of the wavier in whole or in part; \n     and\n       (B) explains the application of the waiver, including \n     guidance for the use of the waiver by business concerns, \n     within the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone.\n       (4) If a Federal agency denies a waiver under this \n     subsection, the agency shall provide a written statement to \n     the requesting Economic Development Commission that--\n       (A) explains the reasons that the waiver substantially \n     endangers health or safety; and\n       (B) provides a scientific basis in writing for such \n     determination.\n       (f) Automatic Waiver.--If a Federal agency does not provide \n     the written notice required under subsection (e) within the \n     120-day period as required under such subsection, the waiver \n     shall be deemed to be granted by the Federal agency.\n       (g) Limitation.--No provision of this Act shall be \n     construed to authorize any Federal agency to waive any \n     regulation or Executive order that prohibits, or the purpose \n     of which is to protect persons against, discrimination on the \n     basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin.\n       (h) Applicable Procedures.--A waiver of a regulation under \n     subsection (e) shall not be considered to be a rule, \n     rulemaking, or regulation under chapter 5 of title 5, United \n     States Code.

Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate \nArmed Services Committee did not include funding for additional B-2 \nbombers in the National Defense authorization bill that was filed \nyesterday. In my view, this was a short-sighted decision, one which I \nhope can be reversed. Today, Mr. President, I want to enter into the \nRecord two recent editorials and a letter, all of which, I believe, \nhelp Members to understand the importance of continuing the B-2 \nprogram.\n  The first editorial comment was authorized by Paul Wolfowitz, and \nappeared in the June 12 edition of the Wall Street Journal. Mr. \nWolfowitz points out that the DOD-IDA bomber study had assumed enough \nwarning time for over 500 U.S. tactical aircraft and many other assets \nto arrive before the war started. He notes, and I quote, ``Not \nsurprisingly, the contribution of additional B-2's would not be cost-\neffective in those hypothetical circumstances.'' Mr. Wolfowitz goes on \nposit the importance of the B-2 bomber in less favorable scenarios and \ncircumstances, noting its independence from foreign bases; its value in \npossible East Asian scenarios, where neither land-based nor carrier air \nhave the needed range; and its ability both to deter and to retaliate \nwhile placing few Americans in harm's way. After noting the advantages \nof stealth, Mr. Wolfowitz goes on to note, and I quote:\n\n       With more than 30 wings of traditional fighter aircraft and \n     only one wing of B-2's and two wings of F-117's it could \n     hardly be said that the U.S. is overemphasizing stealthy \n     attack capability.\n\n  The second editorial comment is by Charles Krauthammer, and is in \ntoday's Washington Post. Mr. Krauthammer notes that, and I quote:\n\n       There are three simple, glaringly obvious facts about this \n     new era: (1) America is coming home; (2) America cannot \n     endure casualties; (3) America's next war will be a surprise. \n     * * *\n\n  He goes on to note that the B-2 is not a partisan project, that today \nit is supported by,\n\n       Seven Secretaries of Defense representing every \n     administration going back to 1969. They support it because it \n     is the perfect weapon for the post-cold war world.\n\n  Mr. Krauthammer goes on to note that the so-called Republican cheap \nhawks, concerned about high costs, hold the future of the program in \ntheir hands. He notes, and I quote,\n\n       But the dollar cost of a weapon is too narrow a calculation \n     of its utility. The more important calculation is cost in \n     American lives. The reasons are not sentimental, but \n     practical. Weapons cheap in dollars but costly in lives are, \n     in the current and coming environment, useless. A country \n     that so values the life of every Captain O'Grady is a country \n     that cannot keep blindly relying on nonstealthy aircraft over \n     enemy territory.\n\n  My third submission, Mr. President, is a letter to me from recently \nretired Air Force Gen. Chuck Horner, who was the overall air commander \nduring Operation Desert Storm. He begins by noting that his career was \nspent in operations and that in his entire career, he had never \nadvocated buying any specific weapons system. Having said that, \n\n[[Page S10067]]\nGeneral Horner begins by saying, and I quote:\n\n       As the former commander of Operation Desert Storm, I feel a \n     duty to put the B-2 debate in perspective, and sound a \n     warning on any recommendation to stop production of this \n     aircraft. To put it bluntly, halting this Nation's B-2 \n     production capability is dangerously short-sighted, and would \n     lead ultimately to the extinction of the long-range bomber \n     force, at the very time when bombers are emerging as \n     America's most critical 21st Century military asset.\n\n  General Horner goes on to note that the B-2 program and America's \nbomber production capability are one and the same, and that starting a \nnew bomber program a few years hence would require 10 to 15 years to \nfield, and cost countless billions to develop. He further notes that \neven if a new bomber were started a few years hence, most of our \nnonstealthy bombers would be obsolete. He then writes, and I quote:\n\n       The next Desert Storm Air Commander could be sending \n     Americans into war aboard a 70-year-old bomber, an act I find \n     unconscionable.\n\n  General Horner goes on to discuss the value of the combination of \nlong-range, large-payload, precision weapons, and stealth, and \nconcludes by stating, and I quote:\n\n       It is important to understand the long-term national and \n     international security ramifications of the quantum leap in \n     military capabilities offered by the B-2. If we don't, it may \n     disappear when we need it most, and can buy it most cheaply. \n     Make no mistake about this: the B-2 is designed to extend \n     America's defense capabilities into the next century. Can we \n     afford to do less?\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that these three items be printed in the Record. \nI commend the substance of all three of these thoughtful pieces to my \ncolleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The material follows:\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 12, 1995]\n\n                      A Bomber for Uncertain Times\n\n                          (By Paul Wolfowitz)\n\n       It has been nearly 30 years since Robert McNamara left the \n     Pentagon. Yet, from what has been made public about the \n     systems analysis behind the decision to halt production of \n     the B-2 bomber, one can only conclude that Mr. McNamara's \n     influence lingers.\n       As Congress deliberates the question of whether to halt \n     production of the B-2 bomber, it needs to have a healthy \n     respect for the fundamental uncertainty of the world of the \n     next century.\n       Just one year before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Adm. \n     William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had \n     proposed eliminating the Persian Gulf from U.S. Military \n     planning on the grounds that the Soviet threat to the region \n     had gone away. In the end, Secretary of Defense Richard \n     Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell overruled the Joint Staff and \n     directed the military to begin planning instead for an Iraqi \n     threat to the Arabian Peninsula. Yet no one expected such a \n     threat to materialize as quickly as it did.\n       In fact, none of the major threats we have faced in this \n     century were foreseen even five years before they appeared. \n     None of the smaller wars we have fought for the past 50 years \n     were foreseen clearly even one year before. Certainly no one \n     would have dreamed of suggesting in 1945 that five years \n     later we would almost be driven off the Korean Peninsula by a \n     third- or fourth-ranked military power.\n\n\n                          a mcnamara technique\n\n       In an old joke, a befuddled drunk searches for his keys \n     under the street light even though he knows he dropped them \n     somewhere else, because ``that's where the light is.'' So it \n     is with the Pentagon's decision to stop production of the B-\n     2, which can deliver precise conventional weapons with great \n     accuracy at extraordinary distances, with surprise, and with \n     unprecedented safety for its crew of two pilots.\n       In an apparent inability to take account of uncertainty, \n     the Defense Department justifies its decision based on a \n     systems analysis of a hypothetical future war with Iraq. \n     Systems analysis--a technique that Mr. McNamara so proudly \n     introduced to the Pentagon and which I, myself, have had many \n     occasions to use--is a powerful tool for certain limited \n     purposes but useless for others. Sometimes, like a bright \n     light in a murky room, its very power leads analysts to focus \n     on those questions that the technique can illuminate, whether \n     or not they are the right ones.\n       According to congressional testimony, the Defense \n     Department analysis assumes that there would be enough \n     warning, and sufficient bases made available in the region, \n     to enable the U.S. to deploy 500 tactical aircraft before the \n     war begins and before our bases come under attack. Not \n     surprisingly, the contribution of additional B-2s would not \n     be cost-effective in those hypothetical circumstances.\n       Not only are the analysts refighting the last war, but they \n     are making assumptions about warning time and the \n     availability of bases that did not apply in the Gulf five \n     years ago and may no longer be valid five years from now. \n     Worst of all, those assumptions may bear little relation to \n     the much broader range of unpredictable circumstances that \n     could confront us in a post-Cold War world--contingencies in \n     which the B-2 would be uniquely valuable:\n       The B-2's exceptionally long range makes it much less \n     dependent on access to overseas bases. Even after Iraq \n     invaded Kuwait, it took the Saudis several days to decide to \n     permit American use of their bases--and they agreed only \n     because of their high level of confidence in President Bush. \n     A future president may need to act unilaterally. In fact, we \n     are more likely to get multilateral cooperation if we have \n     that ability--a paradox still poorly understood by many in \n     Washington.\n       The B-2 can attack nuclear and other high-value targets. In \n     an era of nuclear proliferation, this capability appears \n     particularly important. In a letter to President Clinton, \n     seven former secretaries of defense--of both Democratic and \n     Republican administrations--urged the continuation of low-\n     rate production of the B-2, calling it ``the most cost-\n     effective means of rapidly projecting forces over great \n     distances,'' able ``to reach any point on earth'' within \n     hours, ``to destroy numerous time-sensitive targets in a \n     single sortie,'' and do so ``without fear of interception.''\n       The B-2's range would be invaluable in large regions, such \n     as East Asia, where the potential distances are far greater \n     than the effective range of conventional fighter aircraft. \n     Though it is hard at the moment to envision an Asian scenario \n     (outside of Korea) requiring long-range conventional strike \n     capability, the point is that by the time such requirements \n     become clear, it would almost certainly be too late to \n     acquire the capabilities.\n       The B-2 is effective for deterrence and retaliation. Forces \n     may be used not only to defend but, for example, to punish or \n     deter acts of state terrorism against the U.S. or its \n     citizens. The B-2's range and stealth characteristics make it \n     a particularly useful instrument of deterrence.\n       The B-2 can operate from secure bases. Future aggressors \n     may draw a lesson from the Gulf War and attack nearby bases \n     from the outset, perhaps even using ballistic missiles and \n     chemical weapons. In those circumstances, additional B-2 \n     bombers, operating from bases beyond the reach of enemy \n     missiles or aircraft, would be far more valuable than they \n     were in the Pentagon study.\n       No systems analysis can assess the value of the B-2's \n     enormous flexibility. Nor can a systems analysis assess the \n     importance of the B-2 for maintaining the U.S. lead in a \n     revolutionary new technology. Being the first country to \n     develop stealth technology does not guarantee continued \n     American leadership. In the further development of both \n     tactics and technology, of counter-measures and counter-\n     counter-measures, the U.S. needs to capitalize on its lead in \n     stealth development.\n       With more than 30 wings of traditional fighter aircraft and \n     only one wing of B-2s planned (in addition to two wings of \n     the shorter-range, first generation F-117s), it could hardly \n     be said that the U.S. is overemphasizing stealthy attack \n     capability.\n       It is difficult to imagine any other country, having \n     developed an advanced capability like the B-2, halting \n     production after just 20 aircraft because of an unwillingness \n     to allocate 1% of its defense budget or 5% of its combat \n     aircraft budget for the next few years. It is a system that \n     excels in two dimensions that are hard or impossible to \n     evaluate in a systems analysis, but that are of central \n     importance for defense planning in the post-Cold War world: \n     flexibility to deal with a world that has become even more \n     unpredictable; and innovation to deal with the consequences \n     of revolutionary technological change.\n\n\n                       congressional intervention\n\n       Only through congressional intervention was Adm. Hyman \n     Rickover able to build the nuclear submarine program that \n     eventually became the pride of the Navy. At a later time, \n     when the military was more interested in the development of \n     manned aircraft, congressional pressure kept U.S. \n     conventional cruise missile options from being given away in \n     arms-control negotiations, thus protecting the extraordinary \n     capability for accurate long-range conventional delivery that \n     the Tomahawk cruise missile demonstrated during the Gulf War. \n     And, were it not for the intervention of Sen. Sam Nunn and \n     the House and Senate Armed Service committees, the U.S. would \n     have had only one squadron of F-117 bombers in that war, \n     rather than two.\n       Let us hope that Congress intervenes again. As the seven \n     former defense secretaries said: ``It is already apparent \n     that the end of the Cold War was neither the end of history \n     nor the end of danger. We hope it will also not be the end of \n     the B-2.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 13, 1995]\n\n                    The B-2 and The ``Cheap Hawks''\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       We hear endless blather about how new and complicated the \n     post-Cold War world is. Hence the endless confusion about \n     what weapons to build, forces to deploy, contingency to \n     anticipate. But there are three simple, glaringly obvious \n     facts about this new era:\n       (1) America is coming home. The day of the overseas base is \n     over. In 1960, the United States had 90 major Air Force bases \n     overseas. Today, we have 17. Decolonization is \n\n[[Page S10068]]\n     one reason. Newly emerging countries like the Philippines do not want \n     the kind of Big Brother domination that comes with facilities \n     like Clark Air Base and Subic Bay. The other reason has to do \n     with us: With the Soviets gone, we do not want the huge \n     expense of maintaining a far-flung global military \n     establishment.\n       (2) America cannot endure casualties. It is inconceivable \n     that the United States, or any other Western country, could \n     ever again fight a war of attrition like Korea or Vietnam. \n     One reason is the CNN effect. TV brings home the reality of \n     battle with a graphic immediacy unprecedented in human \n     history. The other reason, as strategist Edward Luttwak has \n     pointed out, is demographic: Advanced industrial countries \n     have very small families, and small families are less willing \n     than the large families of the past to risk their only \n     children in combat.\n       (3) America's next war will be a surprise. Nothing new \n     here. Our last one was too. Who expected Saddam to invade \n     Kuwait? And even after he did, who really expected the United \n     States to send a half-million man expeditionary force to roll \n     him back? Then again, who predicted Pearl Harbor, the \n     invasion of South Korea, the Falklands War?\n       What kind of weapon, then, is needed by a country that is \n     losing its foreign basis, is allergic to casualties and will \n     have little time to mobilize for tomorrow's unexpected \n     provocation?\n       Answer: A weapon that can be deployed at very long \n     distances from secure American bases, is invaluable to enemy \n     counterattack and is deployable instantly. You would want, in \n     other words, the B-2 stealth bomber.\n       We have it. Yet, amazingly, Congress may be on the verge of \n     killing it. After more than $20 billion in development \n     costs--costs irrecoverable whether we build another B-2 or \n     not--the B-2 is facing a series of crucial votes in Congress \n     that could dismantle its assembly lines once and for all.\n       The B-2 is not a partisan project. Its development was \n     begun under Jimmy Carter. And, as an urgent letter to \n     President Clinton makes clear, it is today supported by seven \n     secretaries of defense representing every administration \n     going back to 1969.\n       They support it because it is the perfect weapon for the \n     post-Cold War world. It has a range of about 7,000 miles. It \n     can be launched instantly--no need to beg foreign dictators \n     for base rights; no need for weeks of advance warning, \n     mobilization and forward deployment of troops. And because it \n     is invisible to enemy detection, its two pilots are virtually \n     invulnerable.\n       This is especially important in view of the B-2's very high \n     cost, perhaps three-quarters to a billion dollars a copy. The \n     cost is, of course, what has turned swing Republican votes--\n     the so-called ``cheap hawks''--against the B-2.\n       But the dollar cost of a weapon is too narrow a calculation \n     of its utility. The more important calculation is cost in \n     American lives. The reasons are not sentimental but \n     practical. Weapons cheap in dollars but costly in lives are, \n     in the current and coming environment, literally useless: We \n     will not use them. A country that so values the life of every \n     Capt. O'Grady is a country that cannot keep blindly relying \n     on non-stealthy aircraft over enemy territory.\n       Stealth planes are not just invulnerable themselves. \n     Because they do not need escort, they spare the lives of the \n     pilots of the fighters and radar suppression planes that \n     ordinarily accommodate bombers. Moreover, if the B-2 is \n     killed, we are stuck with our fleet of B-52s of 1950s origin. \n     According to the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, \n     the Clinton administration assumes the United States will \n     rely on B-52s until the year 2030--when they will be 65 years \n     old.\n       In the Persian Gulf War, the stealthy F-117 fighter flew \n     only 2 percent of the missions but hit 40 percent of the \n     targets. It was, in effect, about 30 times as productive as \n     non-stealthy planes. The F-117, however, has a short range \n     and thus must be deployed from forward bases. The B-2 can \n     take off from home. Moreover, the B-2 carries about eight \n     times the payload of the F-117. Which means that one B-2 can \n     strike, without escort and with impunity, as many targets as \n     vast fleets of conventional aircraft. Factor in these costs, \n     and the B-2 becomes cost-effective even in dollar terms.\n       The final truth of the post-Cold War world is that someday \n     someone is going to attack some safe haven we feel compelled \n     to defend, or invade a country whose security is important to \n     us, or build an underground nuclear bomb factory that \n     threatens to kill millions of Americans. We are going to want \n     a way to attack instantly, massively and invisibly. We have \n     the weapon to do it, a weapon that no one else has and that \n     no one can stop. Except a ``cheap hawk,'' shortsighted \n     Republican Congress.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Shalimar, FL, June 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: Earlier this month I wrote to your \n     colleagues in the House of Representatives about the need to \n     continue the B-2 program. The debate has now shifted to the \n     Senate and my concern with our future security compels me to \n     share the same thoughts with you. This is a difficult letter \n     for me to write as in more than thirty years of service in \n     the Air Force, I have always concentrated on military \n     operations, and refrained from commenting on issues such as \n     whether or not to purchase a specific aircraft. However, the \n     Pentagon recently released a study based on assumptions, \n     constraints, and methodology that can lead to the conclusion \n     that the United States can safely terminate B-2 stealth \n     bomber production at 20 aircraft. As the former Air Commander \n     of the Desert Shield/Desert Storm Air Forces. I feel a duty \n     to put the B-2 debate in perspective, and sound a warning on \n     any recommendation to stop production of this aircraft. To \n     put it bluntly, halting this nation's B-2 production \n     capability is dangerously short-sighted and would lead \n     ultimately to the extinction of the long-range bomber force, \n     at the very time when bombers are emerging as America's most \n     critical 21st Century military asset.\n       Since the B-2 is the only bomber in production or \n     development, and the Pentagon has no plans for a new bomber \n     program in the future, the B-2 program and America's bomber \n     production capability are one and the same. If this sole \n     remaining bomber capability is lost, replacing our aging \n     bombers will become unaffordable. Inevitably, the nation may \n     lose its manned bomber force, and the unique capabilities it \n     provides. A new bomber would take from 15-20 years to go from \n     the drawing board to the battlefield and cost tens of \n     billions of dollars just to design. With the current \n     administration balking at spending a fraction of this amount \n     on a finished, proven product, there is little likelihood of \n     a future government sinking many times that amount into a new \n     program. Even if a new program was initiated in the near \n     term, most of our existing bombers would be obsolete before \n     the first ``B-3'' entered service. The next Desert Storm Air \n     Commander could be sending Americans into war aboard a 70-\n     year old bomber, an act I find unconscionable.\n       In my opinion, the B-2 is now more important than ever. \n     Heavy bombers have always possessed two capabilities--long \n     range and large payload--not found in other elements of our \n     military forces. As we base more and more of our forces in \n     our homeland, the bomber's inter-continental range enables us \n     to respond immediately to regional aggression with a rapid, \n     conclusive military capability. Just as important, this \n     capability may deter aggressors even as the bombers sit on \n     the air base parking ramps in the United States. In war, the \n     large bomber payloads provide a critical punch throughout the \n     conflict--just ask General Schwarzkopf what he wanted from \n     the Air Force when he was under attack in Vietnam, or \n     whenever our ground forces faced danger during Desert Storm.\n       What the B-2 adds to this equation are two revolutionary \n     capabilities not available in any other long-range bomber--\n     precision and stealth. The Gulf War showed how precision \n     weapons\n      delivery from stealthy platforms provides a devastating \n     military capability. The F-117 stealth fighter proved its \n     effectiveness on the first day of the war when 36 aircraft \n     flew just 2.5% of the sorties, but attacked almost 31% of \n     the targets.\n       In the past, employing bombers for critical missions \n     against modern air defenses required large, costly packages \n     of air escort and defense suppression aircraft. The B-2's \n     unmatched survivability reduces the need for escorts and \n     defense suppression aircraft. As we found in the Gulf War \n     with the F-117, stealth allows the U.S. to strike any target \n     with both surprise and near impunity. Analysis of the Gulf \n     War air campaign reveals that each F-117 sortie was worth \n     approximately eight non-stealth sorties. To put B-2 \n     capabilities into perspective, consider that the B-2 carries \n     eight times the precision payload of the F-117, has up to six \n     times the range, and will be able to accurately deliver its \n     weapons through clouds or smoke. What does all of this mean? \n     It means that a single B-2 can accomplish missions that \n     required dozens of non-stealthy aircraft in the past.\n       Many may wonder why the Department of Defense would \n     advocate terminating the most advanced weapon system ever \n     developed. The B-2 program was cut by the Bush Administration \n     for budget-related political reasons, and some concern that \n     the program would not meet expectations. Since then, \n     delivered aircraft have demonstrated, without qualification, \n     that the B-2 is a superb weapon system--performing even \n     better than expected.\n       Yet, defense spending has declined, bomber expertise has \n     been funded out of the Air Force, and people's careers have \n     been vested in other programs. Unfortunately, some in the \n     Army and Navy believe the B-2's revolutionary capability is a \n     threat to their own services' continuing relevancy. Just the \n     opposite is true, long-range, survivable bombers will \n     contribute to the effectiveness of the shorter range carrier \n     air by striking those targets which pose the greatest threat \n     to our ships. The troops on the ground have long recognized \n     the value of air support, especially the tremendous impact \n     that large bomb loads have on enemy soldiers. This was again \n     demonstrated by the B-52 strikes used to demoralize the Iraqi \n     Army. If anyone needs B-2s, it's our soldiers and sailors. \n     Some people harp on the issue of the B-2's cost. The Air \n     Force, at times, seems at odds about asking for this much \n     needed aircraft because they fear it could endanger their \n     number one priority program, the F-22. All miss the point. \n     True the B-2 has a high initial cost, but its capabilities \n     allow it to accomplish mission objectives at a lower total \n     cost than other alternatives. And keep in mind, the true cost \n     of any weapons system is how many or how few lives of our \n     service personnel are lost. The B-2 lowers the risk to our \n     men and women. The B-2 will allow us to \n\n[[Page S10069]]\n     accept lower levels of overall military spending without compromising \n     our security.\n       As we approach this year's critical defense budget \n     decisions, it is important that we understand the long-term \n     national and international security ramifications of the \n     quantum leap in military capabilities offered by the B-2. If \n     we don't, it may disappear when we need it most, and can buy \n     it most cheaply. Make no mistake about this: the B-2 is \n     designed to extend America's defense capabilities into the \n     next Century. Can we afford to do less?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles A.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the \nleaders of the community of Frankenmuth, MI. Edwin Zehnder is owner of \nZehnder's of Frankenmuth restaurant, one of the top ten independent \nrestaurants in total sales in the United States. July 25, 1995 will \nmark Edwin's 75th birthday. The city of Frankenmuth will be honoring \nEdwin on his birthday by naming a park located near his restaurant in \nhis honor. This event is especially significant because 1995 also marks \nthe 150th anniversary of the city of Frankenmuth. It is only fitting \nthat this great citizen's 75th birthday happens to coincide with the \n150th anniversary of the community to which he has given so much.\n  Frankenmuth is a unique community and one of Michigan's largest \ntourist attractions. It is a quaint Bavarian village which maintains a \nfestival atmosphere year-round. Everything from its authentic \narchitecture to the popular Frankenmuth Bavarian and Oktoberfest \ncelebrations make this community a special place to live in and visit. \nAt the center of it all is Zehnder's of Frankenmuth restaurant. The \nrestaurant serves traditional Bavarian cuisine as well as American \nfare. However, most visitors come to Zehnder's for its famous \nFrankenmuth-style chicken dinners.\n  Edwin and his wife Marion have four children--L. Susan, Albert, \nCatherine, and Martha. Family has always been an important part of this \ngentleman's life. The family business was started in 1927, when Edwin's \nfather, William, bought the circa 1856 Exchange Hotel. The Zehnder \nfamily then began work on building the restaurant into the institution \nit is today. Edwin and his wife Marion assumed ownership of the family \nbusiness in 1965. The couple were able to cater to the growing numbers \nof tourists visiting the city by continually expanding the restaurant. \nThey added a retail gift store, retail food store, and a coffee shop in \n1977. In 1983, the family broke ground for a 5,000-square-foot addition \nwhich now houses a bakery. Zehnder's of Frankenmuth today is a 84,000 \nsquare-foot, 1,500 seat establishment.\n  Edwin Zehnder graduated from Valparaiso University in 1942, and later \nwent on to do graduate work at the University of Chicago and the \nUniversity of Michigan. Edwin served his country in World War II with \nthe U.S. Navy. Edwin was stationed in the Marshall Islands in the South \nPacific.\n  Edwin maintained his commitment to service after the war by becoming \na vital member of the community. He is a member of St. Lorenz Lutheran \nChurch and sits as a member of the board of Concordia Theological \nSeminary in Fort Wayne, IN. He was also director of the Michigan State \nChamber of Commerce and has served as president and director of the \nFrankenmuth Chamber of Commerce. In 1982, he received the 4-H Friend \nAward, which is the highest award given by the organization for support \nof its many causes.\n  On the basis of his expertise in restaurant management, he was \nelected director of the Michigan Restaurant Association and the \nNational Restaurant Association. He has also served as a circuit \nspeaker for the Michigan and National Restaurant Associations. In 1975, \nhe received the Excellency Award of the restaurant association.\n  I know thousands of people in Michigan and around the Nation join me \nin congratulating Edwin Zehnder for the fine work he has done and also \nin wishing him a happy 75th birthday.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10069-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10069-S10070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     REGULATORY REFORM DISTORTIONS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in their ongoing efforts to frighten the \nAmerican people, the opponents of regulatory reform continue to spread \ntheir distortions through the media.\n  Last night, in a report on ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' President \nClinton's EPA Administrator, Carol Browner, made the following \noutrageous statement about our regulatory reform bill. That is the one \nwe are considering right now.\n\n       If these provisions had been in place over the last 10 \n     years, EPA would not have been able to ban lead in gasoline, \n     and a whole generation of children would have suffered real \n     and permanent brain damage.\n\n  Now, that is a catchy sound bite, but it is flatly false, and it went \nunchallenged in the report.\n  Here are the facts viewers did not get last night. When a rule on \nlead phaseout was being considered in 1982, EPA resisted doing a cost-\nbenefit analysis. However, when a cost-benefit analysis was performed, \nit demonstrated the benefits outweighed the costs of eliminating lead \nfrom gasoline. Only then did EPA issue a rule providing for quick \nphaseout of lead. And in fact, as a result of that analysis, EPA issued \na tougher standard than it would have previously. So getting lead out \nof gasoline occurred precisely because a cost-benefit analysis \nsupported doing so.\n  Rather than undermining our reform effort, as Ms. Browner suggests, \nthis example actually validates it.\n  This is not the first time we have heard this phony story from the \nadministration. Even though we have set the record straight on that \npoint during this debate, the EPA and some folks in the media do not \nseem to notice.\n  Mr. President, I am hardly the only one who has been disappointed by \nthe spread of distortions about this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I \nreceived from the Governor of Ohio, George Voinovich, and the Governor \nof Iowa, Terry Branstad, taking exception to another ABC report last \nnight that framed the debate on environmental regulations in \nWashington-knows-best terms.\n  Mr. President, this is certainly a complicated piece of legislation, \nbut sometimes the facts are very simple. And dealing in facts is not \ntoo much to ask even for the media.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: As strong supporters of your efforts to \n     pass regulatory reform legislation, we were very disappointed \n     with an ABC News report last night on environmental \n     regulation.\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\n       We are dismayed by the suggestion that enhanced flexibility \n     for states in making environmental and regulatory decisions \n     would inherently harm the environment. In essence, their \n     coverage seems to propose that regulatory reform should not \n     be pursued because states cannot be trusted as regulators. As \n     you well know, Mr. Majority Leader, states and local \n     governments already are responsible for implementing and \n     overseeing these laws.\n       ABC is correct in noting that ``dirty air travels.'' \n     However, the proposition that regulatory and environmental \n     reform supported by governors would allow states to ``set \n     their own environmental standards'' is patently false. \n     Governors and other state and local officials do not seek to \n     set our own environmental standards, nor would pending \n     legislation permit us to do so. rather, we support enhanced \n     flexibility to implement remedies specific to our states and \n     communities to meet federally established standards.\n       EPA Administrator Carol Browner's assertion that reforms \n     would lead states to ``race to lower standards'' is \n     particularly insulting. It is typical beltway arrogance to \n     presume that state and local elected officials are somehow \n     less interested in protecting the environment than officials \n     in Washington. We are truly puzzled that a former state \n     environmental director would say such a thing.\n       We also want to point out that environmental reform is a \n     partisan issue only in Washington. Across the country \n     Republican and Democrat governors, state legislators, county \n     officials, and mayors support environmental and regulatory \n     reform legislation to provide greater flexibility and \n     unfunded mandate relief for states and local governments. In \n     fact, a bipartisan meeting of state and local government \n     officials last month in Baltimore determined that \n     environmental reform legislation is the top priority of the \n     state-local government coalition in the 104th Congress.\n       Thank you for your leadership in support of environmental \n     and regulatory reform. We look forward to continuing to work \n     with you to enact reform legislation that ensures that new \n     regulations justify their costs and provides states and local \n     governments with enhanced flexibility to meet the federal \n     standards.\n           Sincerely,\n     George V. Voinovich, Governor of Ohio.\n     Terry E. Branstad, Governor of Iowa.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10069-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF WHITE EAGLE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. My State of South Dakota is small in population but \nlarge in spirit. This is particularly true of the native American \npopulation that calls South Dakota home. Indian people have blazed \ntheir way into American history in countless ways. Even their names \nconvey poetry and magic: from great leaders like Sitting Bull, Crazy \nHorse, and Black Elk, to modern day role models like Billy Mills and \nJim Thorpe.\n  White Eagle--Wanblee Ska--was a Rosebud Sioux who soared on the wings \nof classical music. Last week, at his parents' home in Mission, SD, \nWhite Eagle died at the age of 43. In spite of his untimely death, he \nleft a legacy that will live on for generations.\n  In a State where country/western music is heard on most radios, White \nEagle turned his natural gift for song into a polished operatic tenor \ntalent. He sang for the inauguration of a President and at Carnegie \nHall. Despite his relative youth, he had already been enshrined in the \nSouth Dakota Hall of Fame at the time of his death.\n  Dennis Holub, director of the South Dakota Arts Council, says that \nWhite Eagle was ``the epitome of a great artist * * * [he] sang in some \nof the world's finest halls but also brought his songs home so South \nDakotans could enjoy them, too.''\n  But it was not only his gift of song that made White Eagle rise on \ncurrents of critical and public acclaim. It was his courage in \novercoming obstacles and misfortune, his ability to make himself \ncontinually better while remaining utterly human, that made him an \ninspiration to the people of South Dakota.\n  Although he began singing as a child and achieved some success as a \nchurch soloist and musical performer, he stopped singing after \ndeveloping nodes on his vocal cords. Nevertheless, when he was \nsubsequently asked by a friend to help out the Mile High Opera Workshop \nafter the company lost its tenor, it became clear that White Eagle had \nfound his true vocation.\n  His 30th birthday was already behind him when he began voice lessons. \nHe continued his studies and graduated from the San Francisco Opera's \nMerola Opera Program. He went on to work in New York City, and with the \nPennsylvania Opera Theater, the Cleveland Opera, and others.\n  White Eagle developed AIDS in the late 1980's. In a State where AIDS \nis even rarer than classical concerts, he became the human face of the \ndisease. He could have hidden; instead, he became a powerful force for \nunderstanding and compassion.\n  White Eagle overcame many obstacles in his tragically short life. He \nsucceeded, but fate decreed he would not have enough time to fully \nsavor his success. Nor did we have enough time to enjoy his gift.\n  But White Eagle left an enduring legacy. Many who otherwise might not \nhave been exposed to classical music became devotees because of White \nEagle's gift. Many who might never have seen the human face of AIDS \ngained understanding through his courage and dignity.\n  My connection to White Eagle stems not only from my love of his \nmusic, but also from the fact that his brother, Robert Moore, is a \nformer member of my Washington staff. I know I speak for my office, and \nall of South Dakota, as I offer our condolences and prayers of support \nfor his family in this difficult time. We join them in mourning the \nuntimely death of White Eagle. But, even as we mourn, we celebrate his \nlife and his gift of music, and we remember his courage and compassion.\n  White Eagle will be missed, but he will not be forgotten, for the \nspirit of his gifts will endure for generations to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10070-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10070-S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          UNFUNDED MANDATES UNDER SENATE FINANCE WELFARE BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday we had a very productive \nmeeting with the President, a number of my colleagues here in the \nSenate, Governor Carper, Mayor Archer of Detroit, County Executive Rick \nPhelps of Dane County, WI, and Bill Purcell, majority leader of the \nTennessee House of Representatives.\n  It is clear that the Work First Coalition is growing. Government \nleaders at all levels agree that we need to move forward with welfare \nreform--that we can't let extremists hold this very important reform \nhostage.\n  We have a plan. It is about work. It is about ending the cycle of \ndependency and helping single mothers and unemployed fathers become \nself-sufficient and stay that way.\n  The bill that was reported from the Finance Committee is not about \nwork. It's a huge unfunded mandate to the States.\n  In fact, the head of the bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors may \nhave put it best when he called the Republican welfare reform plan the \n``mother of all unfunded mandates.''\n  It's ironic that S. 1, the first bill the Republican leadership \nintroduced this Congress, was a bill to stop unfunded mandates. Now \nthey want to dump a $35 billion unfunded mandate on the States.\n  Why is the welfare reform bill as reported from the Finance Committee \nan unfunded mandate? The reason is simple.\n  The bill as reported by the committee freezes Federal funding to the \nStates at the fiscal year 1994 level in each of the next 7 years. At \nthe same time, the bill requires an increasing percentage of welfare \nrecipients to participate in the current-law JOBS Program, which offers \neducation or training or other work opportunities to welfare \nrecipients.\n  But, participation in the JOBS Program is not free. There is a cost \nto providing education or job training. In addition, when we talk about \nwelfare recipients, we are usually talking about single mothers raising \nchildren, many of them small children or infants.\n  To enable a single parent to participate in an education or training \nprogram, someone has to care for her child during that time period. She \nmay be lucky; perhaps a relative will watch her child for free. But, \nchances are, she will not be lucky. She, like the majority of working \nparents today, will have to pay for child care--will have to pay \nsomeone to take care of her child while she is away from home.\n  The cost of child care is not cheap. In fact, today the cost of child \ncare is often a low-income family's largest expense--larger even than \nrent.\n  And, the problem for parents of very young children is that the cost \nof child care is greatest for toddlers and infants.\n  Certainly, if we want to put the parents of these young children to \nwork--\n\n[[Page S10071]]\nif we want them to stay in the workforce and become truly self-\nsufficient--then we need to help them afford quality day care.\n  I do not think any Member of the Senate would suggest that we promote \na policy that would result in infants and toddlers being left home \nalone--even in the name of requiring parents to work or participate in \nthe JOBS Program. I do not believe any Senator truly wants that.\n  However, it needs to be clearly understood that, in order to avoid \nthat result and, at the same time, comply with the participation rates \nin the Finance Committee bill, States will have to pay for increased \nJOBS Program participation and child care to enable mothers to \nparticipate. Otherwise, participation in the JOBS Program simply won't \nhappen, and/or mothers will be forced to leave young children and \ninfants alone.\n  The Finance Committee bill provides no funds to help States comply \nwith this mandate.\n  What will States have to pay? About $35 billion over the next 7 \nyears.\n  Now, one begins to understand why this bill has been called the \nmother of all unfunded mandates.\n  Who will pay that $35 billion? I'll tell you if you haven't already \nfigure it out. The States. The counties. The cities. And, last, but \ncertainly not least, the local taxpayers will have to pay. That's who.\n  If a mandate is enacted and resources aren't provided to facilitate \ncompliance with that mandate, someone will have to foot the bill. \nThat's a simple fact that we cannot afford to overlook in the welfare \ndebate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two charts I have be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the charts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Mr. President, the first chart, entitled, ``Unfunded \nMandates to the States (or Counties, Cities, Local Taxpayers) Under the \nSenate Finance Committee Welfare Bill (FY1966-FY2002).'' is a State-by-\nState breakdown of the unfunded mandates under the legislation over the \nnext 7 years.\n  The analysis was prepared by the staff of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee based on HHS data on JOBS participation and the cost of such \nparticipation.\n  The second chart is entitled, ``The Top Ten States With the Largest \nUnfunded Mandates Under the Senate Finance Committee Welfare Bill.''\n  South Dakota didn't make the top 10 list, but anyone in our small \nState will tell you that an unfunded mandate of $20.5 million is a lot \nof money. I suspect people in the other 39 States facing similar \nshortfalls would react the same way.\n  I am disappointed that so few Members have focused on the unfunded \nmandate aspect of this legislation. Instead, they have chosen to focus \non the size of the slice of pie they expect to get.\n  During the last several weeks, I have read on numerous occasions that \none of the largest reasons the Senate Republicans have not brought the \nlegislation to the floor for consideration is that there is a formula \nfight brewing in their caucus.\n  What's the fight about? The distribution of money. Under a frozen \nblock grant as proposed in the Finance Committee bill, funds are really \nfrozen. Despite your circumstances, that's it. You get one piece of the \npie each year.\n  The problem is that a number of Members have looked ahead and seen \ntheir slice of the frozen pie, and they don't know if they're so hungry \nfor block grants anymore. What about population growth? What about \ntimes of recession or economic downturn? Unemployment? Natural \ndisaster?\n  Perhaps there ought to be adjustments they say. Adjustments for these \nuncontrollable things or events. Southern States don't want to be \npunished just because their populations are growing.\n  Mr. President, I agree with them. That's why our plan isn't a frozen \npie that locks States into the same size piece each year for the next 7 \nyears.\n  Our plan abolishes AFDC, but continues a matching share partnership \nwith the States so that, as need rises, the Federal Government will be \nthere to remain a partner. So we don't have a formula fight over our \nplan.\n  We recognize that, to put welfare recipients to work, to end the \ncycle of dependency, we must first make some initial investments to get \nwelfare recipients into the work force.\n  Our plan cuts existing welfare programs and reinvests those funds in \nthe effort to putting welfare recipients to work, and in day care to \nenable these mothers to go to work without abandoning their children.\n  I have said it before and I'll say it again. Senate Democrats are \nready to debate welfare. Senate Republicans have delayed that debate \ntime and again. I call on the other side not to let extremists hold \nwelfare reform hostage. Join with us. Work with us. It's not too late.\n  We can enact a bipartisan welfare reform plan. A plan that is truly \nabout \n\n[[Page S10072]]\nputting welfare recipients to work and enabling them to become self-\nsufficient.\n  We support that. Able-bodied welfare recipients ought to work. As \nsome have said, they need to get out of the cart and help pull it. But, \nbabies and toddlers shouldn't be thrown out of the cart. That kind of \nextremism aims at the mother and hits the child.\n  We believe the Senate can enact a welfare reform plan that is not \nextreme, but that is fair and requires work and personal \nresponsibility. Rhetoric is fine, but the reality is that a small \nminority support the extreme approach and are using their power to \nblock real reform.\n  If the rest of us join together, we can have a pragmatic, sensible, \nrealistic plan to reform welfare.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10070-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS OF STUDENTS FROM THE SOUTH DAKOTA SCHOOL OF MINES \n                             AND TECHNOLOGY\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

On Thursday, \nJune 29, the SDSM solar motion team placed 16th in Sunrayce '95, a \nsolar-powered car race from Indianapolis, IN to Golden, CO. Then, on \nJuly 1, SDSM engineering students captured the national title at the \neighth annual National Concrete Canoe Competition here in Washington, \nDC.\n  Sunrayce '95 was a 10-day, 1,150-mile cross-country race. Despite the \ncloudy and rainy conditions they experienced, the SDSM team still \nmanaged to better all other rookie teams with their solar-powered car, \nthe Solar Rolar. On the last day of the meet, the team finished the 53-\nmile race in seventh place, passing several top-ranked rivals. The \nteamwork and endurance demonstrated by this first-year team is \nadmirable. They are sure to be contenders in the years to come.\n  Last month, I had the privilege to visit with the SDSM concrete \ncanoe team before their competition. The school was represented by a \ngroup of hard-working and dedicated individuals. After last year's \nfourth-place finish in the competition, these engineering students \ndevoted much time to training and fine-tuning their 92 pound canoe, the \nPredator. Their efforts paid off as they competed in various divisions \nagainst 21 other colleges from across the country.\n  Taking the first-place trophy was not all fun and games for the South \nDakota team. The recent flooding which took place in Virginia sent \ndebris floating down the Potomac River. The Predator was struck by a \nlog and sustained minor damage, but repairs were made and the canoe \nremained in the competition.\n  Muscle and boat design were not the only factors that determined the \nfinal outcome of the competition. A majority of team points were \ncaptured in verbal and written presentations about the canoe. When all \nwas said and done, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology team \naccumulated the most team points, receiving a $5,000 scholarship for \ntheir efforts.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely proud of the students from the School \nof Mines and Technology. They have proven that South Dakota students \ncan compete--and be front-runners--in the field of civil engineering.

I wish them continued success in the future.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Rapid City Journal, July 5, 1995]\n\n                         A Banner Week for Tech\n\n       Teams from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology \n     displayed the quality of the schools's technical expertise \n     and people.\n       Last week, people across America, particularly those in \n     circles of higher education, were finding out something that \n     people in our community already know but sometimes take for \n     granted:\n       South Dakota School of Mines & Technology is an outstanding \n     institution of higher learning that attracts quality students \n     and faculty.\n       On Saturday, Tech won the 8th annual National Concrete \n     Canoe Race put on in Washington, D.C., by the American \n     Society of Civil Engineers. Among the 22 competing schools, \n     Tech was the champion.\n       On Thursday, Tech's Solar Motion team finished 16th in the \n     grueling Sunrayce '95, a solar-powered vehicle race from \n     Indianapolis, Ind., to Golden, Colo.\n       On Friday, Tech's effort in Sunrayce '95 was rewarded with \n     a pair of honors that typify the best of Tech.\n       The quality of the school's engineering expertise was \n     recognized in the awarding of a plaque and a $1,000 cash \n     prize for the best overall use of technology in its Sunrayce \n     vehicle.\n       The quality of the school's people was recognized in a \n     humanitarian award to Ragnar Toennessen, race manager for \n     Solar Motion, for going above and beyond the call of duty. On \n     the race's final leg, Toennessen and communications \n     specialist Zach Spencer left Tech's chase vehicle to help \n     Iowa State team members after their car blew a tire and \n     wrecked. Toennessen was still directing traffic around the \n     wrecked vehicle when Tech's entry crossed the finish line \n     almost an hour later.\n       Tech's efforts in both the concrete canoe race and Sunrayce \n     '95 showed that the school is achieving its mission to \n     prepare students to meet the demands of the coming century--\n     demands that will require not only a high level of technical \n     expertise but also a sensitivity for human needs.\n       Thanks to the work of these two teams, more people across \n     America now know what people here have known for a long time: \n     Tech is an outstanding school.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10072-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10072-S10075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           CHINA AND VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last month, William Ketter, vice \npresident and editor of the Patriot Ledger of Quincy, MA, traveled to \nChina and Vietnam to observe first hand the rapid economic and social \nchanges taking place in those countries. At this crucial juncture in \nour relations with both nations, Mr. Ketter's articles provide \ninteresting insights into China and Vietnam. I ask unanimous consent \nthat his articles may be printed in the Record, along with his \neditorial on the importance of normalizing relations with Vietnam.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Patriot Ledger, June 19, 1995]\n\n                        Young Want a Better Life\n\n                         (By William B. Ketter)\n\n       Buoyed by the opportunity to practice his English, the \n     Beijing University graduate student reeled in his year-of-\n     the-pig kite from high above Tiananmen Square and motioned \n     for me to step closer.\n       ``The most important thing to young people in China today \n     is a better economic future--for themselves, for their \n     family, for their friends,'' he whispered. ``Politics is \n     politics. . . . We don't try to influence it.''\n       Our conversation occurred a few days before the sixth \n     anniversary of the anti-government uprising of workers and \n     students in this very square, a convulsive episode in the 46-\n     year history of communist China.\n       Yet this young man, who identifies himself as Li Zeng, a \n     23-year-old master of science student, appeared uninspired by \n     the significance of that defining event. What's more, he \n     seemed to represent the prevailing mood in today's China: a \n     changed attitude that places the pursuit of material well-\n     being over the fight for democracy.\n       ``How can I put it? Li Zeng continued, ``Protesting in the \n     streets, yelling slogans, causing rebellion doesn't work. We \n     are more interested in buying a car and getting ahead. \n     There's no future in worrying about what happens after Deng \n     Xiaoping or what Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zeming \n     might think.''\n       His predication that few people would gather in Tiananmen \n     Square of June 4 to mourn the massacre of 500 demonstrators \n     on that fateful day in 1989 proves correct. The cry for \n     political reform in China has been muted by the heavy hand of \n     the government (a dozen dissidents were detained in advance \n     of the anniversary) and by the sprouting riches of a market \n     economy.\n       Marxism is still central to the political process, but it \n     is fading fast from the economic scene as farmers and city \n     dwellers are encouraged to improve their individual lot and \n     not to rely entirely on the state. Free market offer \n     everything from antique furniture to bicycles to exquisitely \n     carved Buddha statues to fresh turnips.\n       Furthermore, there is evidence this strange mix of \n     political communism and market capitalism is working, at \n     least to some degree. Gone are the drab-looking Mao suits \n     nearly everybody wore eight years ago when I was last in \n     China. Designer jeans, Western suits, formfitting skirts, and \n     Italian shoes are the dress of the day.\n       Gone too, is the sight of boulevards filed only with \n     bicycles.\n       Motorscooters and motorcycles are quickly becoming the \n     Great Wheels in China. There are also many more cars on the \n     road, especially taxicabs. The consequence: cram-jammed \n     streets and rush-hour gridlock.\n\n[[Page S10073]]\n\n       High-rise apartments, office buildings and hotels are \n     multiplying as fast as you can say Mao Tse-tung, creating \n     dazzling towers of steel, glass and chrome over the dusty \n     plains of Beijing.\n       ``Does all this surprise you?'' asked Li Jianping, deputy \n     director of the U.S. Division of the Chinese People's \n     Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. He was \n     host to the group of American newspaper editors I joined for \n     a week in China as part of an Asia tour.\n       ``It shouldn't,'' he continued. ``We even have a McDonald's \n     and a Hard Rock Cafe not far from Tiananmen Square.''\n\n\n                          a buck for a big mac\n\n       A visit to both confirms that the Chinese are no different \n     than Americans when it comes to Big Macs and ear-numbing \n     music. Only the prices are lower: 25 cents for a plain \n     hamburger, $1 for the Big Mac, and Beijing beer goes for 75 \n     cents a glass at the Hard Rock. Save The Planet T-shirts sell \n     for $6.\n       The disco in the China World Hotel features American songs, \n     strobe lights and hip-hop dancers. So, too, the hottest \n     nightspot in Beijing, The NASA. It features a helicopter \n     jutting from the wall and prostitutes that slink after \n     businessmen on expense accounts. The hookers make more in a \n     week ($500) than the average person takes home in a year. But \n     if they get caught, the penalty is an automatic year in jail \n     for first-time offenders, longer for repeaters.\n       One club-hopping beauty, who identified herself only as \n     ``Winnie,'' said the risk is worth it. ``I can buy what I \n     want: clothes, makeup, CD-player, color TV,'' she said. ``I \n     live the good life.''\n       And if the long arm of the law should tap her bare \n     shoulder, she has cash reserves to pay off the police. ``They \n     like money, too,'' Winnie laughed.\n       Indeed they do. Corruption and nepotism are widespread in \n     China despite efforts to curtail them. The daughter and son \n     of Deng Xiaoping, the ailing paramount leader, who is 90, \n     hold high government jobs, as so the children of most other \n     senior officials.\n       It is nearly impossible, government leaders admit, to keep \n     track of the multitude of underpaid bureaucrats who approve \n     licenses and the cadres that enforce loose laws in the \n     overpopulated cities and provinces. They consider gifts and \n     payoffs part of their compensation. So do some high \n     government officials because of the system of low pay. The \n     premier and president of China make only $125 per month in \n     salary. The perks are generous, however. Free food, housing, \n     transportation, medical services and vacations.\n       Taxi drivers aren't as fortunate, and so they regularly \n     overcharge unsuspecting foreigners by speeding up their \n     meters or driving around in circles. A 10-mile ride from my \n     hotel in Central Beijing to visit a friend on the northern \n     edge of the capital cost $3 out, $7 back. Complaining to the \n     Beijing Taxi Control Bureau brings a shrug and the excuse \n     that there aren't enough inspectors to control the 60,000 \n     licensed cabs on the streets of Beijing.\n       And while China has eliminated the two-currency system--one \n     for foreigners, another for natives--that encouraged black \n     market money dealers, outsiders still pay inflated prices for \n     many goods and services.\n\n\n                       ethics rules for officials\n\n       Vice Premier Lo Lanqing, a dour hardliner, stiffened at the \n     suggestion that China's move to a market economy has created \n     greater corruption and brought Western vices to the land \n     known as the Middle Kingdom.\n       ``Oh, yes, we have (corruption) problems with some \n     people,'' he said during an interview in the Great Hall of \n     the People overlooking Tiananmen Square. ``Our problems, \n     though, are no greater than others, and we are dealing with \n     them through reform. Certainly your country has this \n     problem.''\n       Among the reforms are new rules requiring government and \n     party officials to disclose their sources of income and \n     banning gifts and favors that might influence their \n     decisions. The regulations even apply to the children of \n     senior party leaders.\n       Disclosing sources of income and prohibiting conflict-of-\n     interest gift-giving ``will keep clean and honest \n     organizations of the Communist Party and government bodies \n     and strengthen their ties with the people,'' the official New \n     China News Agency declared.\n       The unanswered question is whether the government will ever \n     enforce the new ethics rules. Similar crackdowns in years' \n     past were never fully implemented.\n       Vice Premier Lanqing was more forthcoming when the \n     conversation turned to Chinese-American relations. He said \n     China needs U.S. technical know-how and access to our markets \n     to develop into a world economic power.\n       ``We have a long way to go to catch up to the United \n     States, and we may not even be able to do so by the end of \n     the next century,'' he said. ``You are our most important \n     international trading partner. We only wish you would see us \n     that way.''\n       U.S.-China trade currently amounts to $50 billion per year, \n     with imports from China accounting for 65 percent of the \n     total. China's major exports to the United States are \n     electrical machinery, footwear, clothing, toys and sports \n     equipment. The fastest growing U.S. exports to China are \n     aircraft, cotton, fertilizer and wood pulp.\n       One thing Lanqing does not want from America is ``your \n     violent and pornographic culture of movies and music. This is \n     bad for our people, and we won't allow it.''\n       The reality is that what Lanquing fears is already there. \n     Hollywood movies and music are pirated by unscrupulous \n     businesses and sold on the black market throughout China. So, \n     too, computer software, textbooks, sneakers and watches. \n     They're called knockoffs, and they are a major concern of \n     corporate America.\n       Lanquing admitted that piracy of American goods occurs, but \n     he said U.S. business interests in southern China, not \n     Chinese nationals, are primarily responsible for the illegal \n     activity.\n       ``We have courts to deal with this,'' he said, pointing out \n     that China recently established a copyright law designed to \n     punish knockoff manufacturers and distributors.\n       And, in fact, during our visit a Beijing court issued a \n     verdict under the new law against three Chinese publishing \n     houses that had published a series of Disney-character \n     children's books without permission from the Walt Disney \n     Company.\n       The court fined the defendants $26,100, ordered them to \n     stop selling the books, and required them to issue an apology \n     to Disney through the news media.\n       Mickey Mouse punishment for years of profit at the expense \n     of the Disney Company, but an American official in Beijing \n     said it was an important step toward establishing some \n     semblance of legal protection against trademark \n     counterfeiters.\n       ``We would like to see greater punishment of these knockoff \n     artists,'' the U.S. official said. ``But something is better \n     than nothing, and it does appear the Chinese government is \n     trying to stop the piracy.''\n\n\n                         curbing the birthrate\n\n       It is also trying to stop the runaway birthrate--without \n     great success. China is now home to 1.2 billion or one-fifth \n     of the world's people. And the population is growing at the \n     rate of 15 million a year. That's more than twice the \n     population of Massachusetts.\n       Thus there's enormous pressure on the women of China to \n     have just one child, and abort subsequent pregnancies, even \n     up to the eighth month. But the Confucian tradition of ``the \n     more sons, the more blessings'' dies hard in the countryside, \n     where 80 percent of China's population lives. There the \n     government allows two children; many families have five or \n     more.\n       There are substantial economic incentives to restrict \n     family size. One-child families get priority in new housing, \n     medical care for children, and education. Mothers who sign a \n     pledge to have only one baby get generous maternity leave.\n       But first you must apply to the government for permission \n     to have a child. If approved, you are given 12 months to get \n     pregnant or go to the back of the line. Permission is denied \n     to anyone who is not married. Or if you are under 25 years \n     old.\n       Divorce is legal in China, but not an easy option out of an \n     unhappy marriage. Chinese culture frowns on divorce and less \n     than 1 percent of the marriages are dissolved. Yet our guide, \n     Li Jianping, conceded that more than half the couples would \n     probably call it quits if Chinese attitudes on marriage were \n     similar to those in the United States.\n       ``I would guess that one-third of the families are happy, \n     one-third want a divorce now, and one-third have at least \n     thought about divorce,'' he said. ``It is not a simple social \n     question now. Maybe it will change in time.''\n\n\n                         credit cards unwanted\n\n       Like the use of credit cards. They were unknown in China \n     until recently. Now, ordinary folk can apply for one from the \n     Bank of China. All you need is proof of employment, an above-\n     average income, and a person of means to vouch for your \n     trustworthiness.\n       ``Image the potential for the credit card companies,'' \n     smiled Jianping. ``More than a billion prospective card \n     holders. But they shouldn't hold their breath waiting or \n     they'll turn blue. This is not something we want or need.''\n       The reason: Save and pay-as-you-go remain valued economic \n     traits among the Chinese masses, a holdover tradition from \n     the days of a managed economy and central control of their \n     lives.\n       And the millions of unemployed, unskilled peasants who roam \n     the big cities are obviously not candidates for credit cards. \n     They are desperate for work. But the Chinese economy \n     struggles to keep up with the crush of population growth and \n     the ranks of the jobless grow ever more crowded. Some experts \n     estimate that 200 million Chinese will be unemployed within \n     the next 5 years.\n       In an effort to create more jobs, the government recently \n     changed the work week from 60 hours over six days to 40 hours \n     in five days. The change applies to everyone but doctors, \n     nurses and other medical personnel; they still work six and \n     sometimes seven days per week.\n       ``We don't have enough medical people to handle the \n     country's medical needs,'' Jianping explained. ``Training \n     more doctors and nurses has become a priority.''\n                           Colleges need cash\n\n       But huge obstacles lie between that goal and the desired \n     result. Only 5 percent of China's high school graduates are \n     allowed to go on to college because of limited classroom \n     capacity. The elite are chosen through a rigorous series of \n     tests. Those who don't pass are sent to vocational schools or \n     left to fend for themselves.\n       If the University of International Business and Economics \n     in Beijing is typical, the colleges of China need an infusion \n     of cash. A visit to the campus turned up outdated \n\n[[Page S10074]]\n     equipment, tattered textbooks, sweltering classrooms, and too few \n     faculty members. Even university President Sun Weiyan is \n     required to teach four hours a week. He doesn't complain. Nor \n     do the students. They're just happy to be in school.\n       Small wonder. During China's Cultural Revolution of 1966-\n     76, the university was closed down. Millions of Chinese \n     scholars, including President Weiyan, were exiled from their \n     life's work. Many had to work on farms and in factories. He \n     was relegated to teaching English to Vietnamese students in a \n     rural high school and tending to a flock of ducks after \n     classes.\n       Now, he speaks optimistic of the future. ``The leaders of \n     the country are very much aware that education is critical to \n     progress,'' he said. ``They are planning to broaden the \n     higher education system. This can and will happen as we move \n     toward a socialist market economy.''\n       Just who are the leaders of China now that Deng Xiaoping, \n     the resilient compatriot of the late Chairman Mao, has been \n     incapacitated by advanced Parkinson's disease and no longer \n     holds sway?\n       No one knows for sure. Chinese political experts look for a \n     generational change in leadership over the next several years \n     and the shifting of more authority to the National People's \n     Congress, or national legislature. The Communist Party, while \n     gradually losing membership, will continue to set the agenda, \n     including any political reform that might occur.\n       President Jiang Zemin, at 69, has been consolidating his \n     power since Deng's illness forced him to curtail his role two \n     years ago. He was Deng's choice as his successor. But there \n     has been growing criticism of Deng's reform movement lately, \n     and Zemin, who is also general secretary of the party, has \n     been among the principal detractors.\n       ``He's trying to assert himself as his own leader,'' an \n     American official in Beijing said. ``If he gets the support \n     of the army, he will be the next Deng Xiaoping.''\n       Prime Minister Li Peng, 66, is perhaps the best known \n     senior Chinese official to the outside world. His future was \n     clouded by his role in the Tiananmen massacre, and China \n     experts say he does not enjoy the support of economic \n     reformers.\n       Such is political life in today's China. Even Chairman Mao, \n     who overthrew Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 and made China a \n     communist nation, is falling from favor. His massive statue \n     at the entry to Beijing University has been removed. The only \n     prominent image left of the once ubiquitous Great Helmsman, \n     who died in 1976, hangs in Tiananmen Square. Only foreigners \n     bother to photograph it.\n       ``Mao represents the past,'' said the Beijing University \n     graduate student in Tiananmen Square. ``We're more interested \n     in the future--and with making money--than the teachings of \n     Mao.''\n       In these and other ways, China is undergoing transformation \n     from a command-and-control government to a land of economic \n     opportunity. That, one can hope, will also eventually result \n     in a Western-style political system.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the Patriot Ledger, June 20, 1995]\n\n                  In Vietnam, Only the Future Matters\n\n                         (By William B. Ketter)\n\n       The story of Miss Saigon, that popular musical about doomed \n     romance between a Vietnamese bar girl and an American \n     soldier, has taken a new and happy twist on Vietnam's real-\n     life stage.\n       Miss Saigon of 1995, Nguyen My Hanh, dances for tips in a \n     karaoke bar by night, scoots to college and modeling gigs on \n     her Honda Dream motorcycle by day, and cheerfully flips pizza \n     dough at her family's hole-in-the-wall eatery ``Manhattan'' \n     on weekends.\n       She doesn't have time to pine for anyone--and certainly not \n     a GI lover. At 19, she wasn't even born when American troops \n     fought in Vietnam. Nor does she ask her mother and father \n     about that sorry era.\n       ``Why bother?'' she asks. ``That's the past. I have other, \n     more important things to do. These are exciting times.''\n       Welcome to today's Vietnam, where more than half the \n     population is under 30 and too young to know or care about \n     the war that still haunts the American psyche. Economic \n     success through individual ingenuity is Vietnam's top \n     priority--and no wonder. The average income is only $450 a \n     year in this ancient land of mythical dragons.\n       ``Oh, yes, our history courses cover the American war, and \n     all the other wars against Vietnam, from the perspective of \n     our long struggle for liberation,'' Hanh says.\n       ``I've seen the American war movies. You know, `Deer \n     Hunter,' `Platoon,' `Born on the Fourth of July.' But that's \n     about it. No big deal. OK?''\n       And so it goes during a week of talking with government \n     leaders, military heroes, journalists, businessmen and \n     ordinary people. Twenty years after their civil war ended, \n     the Vietnamese give the impression they are not bitter; they \n     just want to get on with improving their lot.\n       ``Well, we like Americans,'' smiled Nguyen The Quynh, vice \n     director of the official Vietnam News Agency. ``You come from \n     a rich and successful country. You won't find hard feelings. \n     You will find people who want to get ahead . . . to be \n     successful--like you.''\n       With that goal in mind, communist Vietnam has initiated a \n     radical economic development program called doi moi, or \n     renewal. It is designed to breathe life into this enfeebled \n     socialist society by loosening restrictions on free \n     enterprise and introducing the profit principle to state-\n     owned industries.\n       Slowly, a tradition-bound culture is acceding to modern \n     ways. On city streets you see hip, fashion-conscious young \n     people bustling by old women in conical hats sweeping \n     sidewalks with twig-bundle brooms. At night the streets come \n     alive with heavy-metal music and T-shirted rogues peddling \n     fake American dog tags. At dawn aging war veterans practice \n     tai chi and play badminton in the parks. In the cities \n     motorcycles rule the road; in the country the water buffalo \n     is still king.\n       Will a new age of prosperity for Vietnam emerge from this \n     paradoxical blend of the old and the new?\n       Perhaps.\n       Office buildings, hotels and restaurants are sprouting like \n     rice grass in Hanoi, the national capital and home\n      to 3 million people. Even the notorious Hoa Lo prison, known \n     to American prisoners of war as the Hanoi Hilton, is \n     changing into an office building-hotel complex. A small \n     section will be preserved for a monument to the most \n     famous prisoner, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He spent \n     5\\1/2\\ years there after parachuting into Hanoi's West \n     Lake from his disabled Navy fighter jet on Oct. 26, 1967.\n       Construction cranes also loom over Saigon, which is \n     officially called Ho Chi Minh City but which everybody refers \n     to by its old name. Rooms at the Floating Hotel on the Saigon \n     River go for $200 a night. Small merchants do a brisk \n     business, selling their wares at free markets and in street \n     stalls. Whole blocks boast tinseled stores displaying TV \n     sets, stereos, VCRs.\n       But beggars and pickpockets also roam the streets, and \n     malnutrition afflicts 40 percent of the nation's children, \n     many of whom wander about hawking stamps, gum, postcards. \n     Anything they can get their hands on.\n       And boat people still set sail for refugee camps in Hong \n     Kong and Malaysia, fleeing not from political oppression but \n     rather from starvation, even though Vietnam is the world's \n     third-largest producer of rice.\n\n\n                      french, u.s. movies popular\n\n       Economic liberalization is fast changing the colonial \n     character of Hanoi, the drab citadel of communism. Movie \n     theaters feature French and American fare, including ``True \n     Lies'' and ``The Fugitive.'' A national TV channel plays pop \n     music videos a la MTV. Karaoke clubs thrive, as do the \n     attractive young ladies who gladly dance and sing with the \n     patrons for $5 an hour and tips. Prostitution has become a \n     national worry because of a dramatic increase in AID--20,000 \n     cases reported last year alone. Breweries work overtime to \n     keep up with the consumption of Tiger and ``333'' beer.\n       Much of this buzz is old hat to Saigon, a larger, more \n     colorful and livelier city. It experienced free-wheeling \n     commercialism during the American presence in Vietnam and \n     obviously hasn't forgotten how to enjoy it. Successful \n     enterprises from the war years are back in business, sharing \n     their expertise and helping to stimulate economic growth.\n       But the centerpiece of national reverence is not the \n     American dollar or the Vietnamese dong. It is Ho Chi Minh's \n     waxen body, lying in serene attentiveness in a neo-Stalinist \n     marble mausoleum in the heart of Hanoi. Lines of people file \n     into the tomb, paying respects to the whispy-bearded man who \n     brought communism to Vietnam. His remains are mechanically \n     raised from a freezer for viewing in a glass-enclosed casket, \n     the lowered again at night. Once a year the body is shipped \n     to Moscow for touching up. Russia, home to Lenin's tomb in \n     Red Square, is apparently the expert on embalmed patriots.\n       A Sunday visitor to Ho's tomb allowed that he would surely \n     roll over in his grave--If he were in one--at the thought of \n     the government touting his body and modest nearby home as \n     prime tourist shrines. Yet every cent counts in a cash-poor \n     Third World country.\n       More than anything, the doi moi policy is aimed at enticing \n     foreign investors and tourists to Vietnam. And the primary \n     target in America.\n       ``Vietnam needs many things from the United States--\n     technology, machinery, medicine, consumer goods,'' \n     acknowledged Luu Van Dat, a government trade expert. ``We are \n     a poor, backward country. You are the most advanced nation in \n     the world.''\n       And what can Vietnam offer in return?\n       ``The short answer is cheap labor,'' Dat said. ``We also \n     have rice, seafood, leather goods. And we do have some of the \n     best beaches in the world.''\n       So good that an American company, BBI Investment Group of \n     Chevy Chase, Md., plans to build a $250 million resort and \n     golf complex on China Beach along the South China Sea near \n     the spot where the U.S. Marines first landed in 1965. And \n     Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola fight for the soft drink market. The \n     Boston-based Gillette Company sees gold in the faces and legs \n     of 75 million Vietnamese.\n       ``There are encouraging signs of real progress,'' reports \n     Nguyen Xuan Oanh, the Harvard-educated Saigon businessman, \n     who was the chief architect of doi moi.\n       ``Inflation is under control. And the reform policy has \n     transformed Vietnam into a market mechanism that's allowed to \n     operate freely and efficiently. The growth rate, which has \n     been some 3 percent for several decades, has jumped to 9 and \n     10 percent per year. What's more, the best is yet to come.''\n\n\n                        u.s. companies cautious\n\n       Oanh's optimism springs from his personal experience. Twice \n     the acting prime minister \n\n[[Page S10075]]\n     of South Vietnam, he was placed under house arrest for ``re-education'' \n     when the communist North captured Saigon in 1975. But later \n     he emerged as the principal economic adviser to the unified \n     government, was allowed to set up an international management \n     and finance company, and eventually became a millionaire \n     again.\n       ``I gambled (by not fleeing Vietnam), and I won,'' he said. \n     ``My message to American business is you can also win.''\n       Still, most U.S. companies are cautious about investing in \n     Vietnam right now. For one thing, we do not have full \n     diplomatic ties with the government. The 19-year American \n     embargo was lifted 15 months ago, and this has led to the \n     opening of diplomatic liaison offices in Hanoi and \n     Washington. But further thawing of relations could be delayed \n     by the American presidential campaign.\n       There are other concerns, too--trademark and patent \n     protections, an uncertain legal environment, inadequate \n     infrastructure, and rampant corruption among government \n     officials. Bribery is the best way to fast-track an \n     application to do business in Vietnam. But American companies \n     are prohibited by U.S. law from offering money or gifts in \n     return for regulatory favors.\n       U.S. business interests, with an aggregate outlay of $525 \n     million per year, rank eighth among Vietnam's foreign \n     investors. Taiwan is No. 1 at $2.5 billion. Hong Kong, \n     Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Australia and Malaysia rank \n     ahead of us.\n       All of which frustrates the Vietnamese leaders to no end.\n       ``We want to close the past with America, and build \n     cooperatively with you for a better future,'' said Communist \n     Party General Secretary Do Muoi during an interview of his \n     Hanoi headquarters, a lifesize bust of Ho Chi Minh casting a \n     shadow in the background.\n       ``Why can't you do that? Why does your government put up \n     roadblocks? This is not helpful to you or to us--and we both \n     know we need each other for economic opportunity.''\n                      attitude called wrong-headed\n\n       Muoi, considered Vietnam's shrewdest senior official, noted \n     that the United States has been reluctant to normalize ties \n     with Vietnam until more progress is made on accounting for \n     the 1,648 American military listed as missing in action in \n     Vietnam.\n       To him, and other Vietnamese leaders, this is wrong-headed.\n       But the question persists: Are there any still any American \n     MIAs living in Vietnam?\n       ``No,'' replied retired Gen. Nguyen Giap. ``If there were, \n     we would have turned them over to your government long ago. \n     The war is over. We have no reason to hold anyone against \n     their will.''\n       Furthermore, Muoi said, Vietnam has ``cooperated \n     completely'' with U.S. officials in searching for the remains \n     of the MIAs, including turning over military records and \n     digging up grave sites.\n       Vietnam, he said, long ago gave up looking for its 300,000 \n     missing soldiers.\n       ``This is not entirely a humanitarian issue with the United \n     States,'' the 78-year-old Muoi said. ``This is linked to \n     politics--and we are very sad about that.''\n       To underscore his point, he mentions that the United States \n     had thousands of MIAs in Korea and World War II and ``no \n     similar conditions were placed on diplomatic relations with \n     Germany and Japan.''\n       Because of the MIA issue, Vietnam has been deliberately \n     downplaying the military side of the war of late. That \n     includes renaming the House of American War Crimes in Saigon \n     to simply the War Museum.\n       But the reminders of horror have not been toned down. An \n     oversized Life magazine photograph of the March 16, 1968, My \n     Lai massacre that shocked the conscience of America adorns \n     one wall. Other photos show the deforming effects of U.S. \n     bombs and the defoliant Agent Orange on the women and \n     children of Vietnam.\n       There are, of course, no similar photos of the hurt and \n     sorrow caused by the North Vietnamese military. To the victor \n     goes the privilege of selecting which images of war's hell go \n     on public display.\n       American planes, tanks, bombs and other war materials \n     captured or abandoned prominently occupy the museum grounds \n     and viewing rooms.\n\n\n                          why we lost the war\n\n       Such an impressive collection of modern-day weaponry begs \n     the question of how we could lose a war against a lesser-\n     armed enemy. The answer comes into focus the next day during \n     a trip to the famous Cu Chi tunnels. Communist North Vietnam \n     used narrow passageways--just 3 feet high and across--to wage \n     a relentless guerrilla war that baffled, enraged and \n     ultimately defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese \n     government.\n       More than 100 miles of the underground network stretch from \n     northwest to Saigon to the Cambodian border and functioned as \n     subterranean Viet Cong villages--with kitchens, dormitories, \n     hospitals and command posts.\n       They were cleverly defended: Americans small enough to \n     descend into them were often trap-doored to death over pits \n     of razor-sharp poles.\n       Burrowed three stories deep into rock-like soil, the \n     tunnels were the most bombed, gassed and defoliated section \n     of Vietnam. Yet they withstood the heavy assault and serve as \n     a monument to man over machine.\n       Gen Giap, the mastermind of the communist victories over \n     the French and the Americans, said it was far more than \n     tunnel soldiers that resulted in America's defeat in the only \n     war it has ever lost. Resiliency, a history of nationalism \n     and the will to win at any cost were the real keys to \n     victory, he said.\n       ``Our weapons were not as good as yours,'' the 84-year-old \n     general said in an interview. ``But your human factor was not \n     as good as ours. We had a popular patriotic cause; you had \n     confusion over why you were in Vietnam. We had patience; you \n     wanted instant victory.''\n       Now Vietnam is counting on that same purposeful spirit and \n     unswerving focus to win its economic struggle. But no one \n     really expects significant progress until the government \n     invests billions of dollars in highways, bridges, railroads, \n     commercial port facilities--and public education.\n       Five decades of war have left Vietnam with a large \n     unskilled labor force and growing illiteracy. The population \n     is exploding and the school system is ill-equipped to \n     respond. Even health care is a touch-and-go matter.\n       As the deputy minister of education, Tran Xuan Nhi, put it: \n     ``We are learning the lessons of the free market, and one of \n     those is the need to train and educate our people so we can \n     build our country into an industrialized society. The future \n     will belong to the educated.''\n       Like Miss Saigon 1995, who is driven by a passion ``to \n     study and learn so I can make more money and buy the things I \n     want. OK?''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Ties That Bind Us to Vietnam\n\n       Fifteen months ago, President Clinton lifted the trade \n     embargo against Vietnam. Now he should establish full \n     diplomatic relations with this important Southeast Asia \n     country.\n       Twenty years have passed since the Vietnam war ended. It is \n     time to replace bitterness and recrimination with peace and \n     reconciliation.\n       Private visits and business relationships are pushing the \n     process along. Just this week, a Massachusetts trade \n     delegation led by Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci is talking business \n     in Vietnam--business that can create local jobs. And the U.S. \n     already has opened a diplomatic liaison office in Hanoi.\n       The next logical step is to exchange ambassadors, and \n     there's little to be gained by waiting. The sooner we open an \n     embassy, the better we'll be positioned to expand trade, \n     investment and influence in this vibrant nation of 75 \n     million.\n       Vietnam is a young, eager and changing society which \n     harbors no grudge against the United States despite our \n     decade-long involvement in their civil war. That's over, as \n     far as most Vietnamese are concerned. And that's the word \n     from the top: ``We want to close the past with America, and \n     build cooperatively with you for a better future,'' Communist \n     Party General Secretary Do Muoi recently told a group of \n     visiting American editors.\n       The welcome mat is out and the timing is fortuitous. \n     Vietnam has launched a radical economic development program \n     that relaxes restrictions on free enterprise and encourages \n     state industries to be profitable. Political change will \n     surely follow.\n       Vietnam, moreover, wants and needs American know-how and \n     investment in order to modernize and raise living standards. \n     This is a process in which the United States, with its \n     sizable Vietnamese population and experience in the region, \n     should want to participate. But we need to get going to make \n     the most of the opportunity. American business ranks only \n     eighth among foreign investors there. Establishing full \n     diplomatic ties would give U.S. companies greater support and \n     confidence in doing business with Vietnam. It also would put \n     us in a better position to influence Vietnam's policies.\n       Normalizing relations does not mean abandoning our efforts \n     to get as full an accounting as possible from Vietnam about \n     Americans still listed as missing from the war years. And, in \n     fact, the Vietnamese are trying to help us do that. They have \n     no real reason to detain Americans against their will or \n     withhold information about MIAs.\n       Congressman Bill Richardson, D-N.M., for one, is convinced \n     that's the case. He recently returned from Vietnam with more \n     than 100 pages of material relating to American MIAs, and \n     found no traces of alleged underground prisons or other \n     places of detainment. He thinks it's time to normalize \n     relations. So does U.S. Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher.\n       So President Clinton should act now--and avoid the risk of \n     making recognition a political football in next year's \n     election campaign. Hesitating can only work against our \n     interests in the region, leaving other countries to gain from \n     Vietnam's budding economy at our expense.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10072-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10075-S10076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             GEORGE SELDES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, George Seldes, who died Sunday in Vermont \nat the age of 104, was literally, a Witness to a Century--the title of \nhis autobiography.\n  A true investigative reporter who refused to accept the subtle \npressures imposed upon journalists by publishers, editors, and \nadvertisers--he was uncompromising in reporting what he saw and heard, \nand printed those observations in his own independent publication--In \nFact.\n  Izzy Stone called Seldes the ``granddaddy'' of investigative \nreporters--high \n\n[[Page S10076]]\npraise from another great independent journalist of our century.\n  My visits and frequent correspondence with George rank among the \nhighlights of my Senate career. He never intruded, but did on occasion \noffer some very good advice to this senator--and most times, I was \nsmart enough to recognize good counsel when I heard it. I had the great \npleasure of joining him at his 100th birthday party in Vermont--an \nevent that became a public celebration of his life.\n  Here was a man who interviewed William Jennings Bryan, Theodore \nRoosevelt, Eddie Rickenbacker, Generals Pershing, Patton, and \nMacArthur; a personal observer of Lenin and Mussolini and a confidant \nof Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Sinclair Lewis.\n  One of the great lives of our century has passed--but George Seldes \nleft behind a recorded history to guide our understanding of the \nturbulent time.\n  I attach an editorial that appeared in the July 8, 1995 edition of \nThe Burlington Free Press, and a column written by Colman McCarthy that \nappeared in the July 11 edition of The Washington Post.\n  They capture the spirit and dogged pursuit of truth that marked \nGeorge Seldes' lasting contribution to journalism and the history of \nour age. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 8, 1995]\n\n                            A Contrary Voice\n\n       George Seldes, who died Sunday at 104, was a journalist and \n     harsh critic of mainstream journalists who might be best \n     remembered by Vermont newspaper editors and reporters from an \n     appearance before the Vermont and New Hampshire Press \n     Associations in the late 1980s.\n       Except for a slowed step and a bit of a stoop, nothing in \n     Seldes' appearance betrayed his exceptional age, nor hints of \n     any mellowing on matters he found important--beginning and \n     invariably ending with a journalist's responsibility to tell \n     it straight.\n       What bothered this long-time resident of Hartland Four \n     Corners most during his 86 years of covering historic events \n     was not so much what got into newspapers of his day but what \n     didn't--especially immediately preceding and following World \n     War II. Errors of omission.\n       It was a time when some journalists doubled as government \n     informers for U.S. intelligence agencies as a gesture of \n     patriotism; when the Washington Press Corps kept many elected \n     officials' personal foibles and peccadillos a secret; and \n     powerful publishers ran newspapers more like personal \n     fiefdoms in pursuit of selective causes than purveyors of the \n     larger truth.\n       Like I.F. Stone, Seldes figured if mainstream newspapers \n     wouldn't print what he wrote for fear of riling advertisers \n     or powerful news sources, he would print it in his own \n     publication. In Fact, it was called, and it took on, among \n     many powerful interests, the tobacco industry and its ability \n     to keep damaging health data out of newspapers--a \n     consequence, Seldes was never shy about charging, or \n     newspapers' heavy reliance on cigarette advertising.\n       In some cases, he was acting on tips from mainstream \n     reporters who knew their own papers would never print what \n     they'd dug up. They would leak the news to Seldes who would \n     print it. In other cases, In Fact became a more reliable \n     source of news for mainstream newspapers than their own \n     sources--the ultimate flattery for any newspaper person, and \n     ultimate indictment of those who missed the news.\n       In his later years, Seldes was always careful to note \n     improvements in the objectivity of today's newspapers--while \n     holding firm to the belief that when newspapers forget their \n     responsibility to truth, they risk retreat into those bad old \n     days.\n       Nor was his burr-under-the-saddle style without fault--his \n     muckraking, make-waves narrowness of vision caused him to \n     miss some of the bigger picture, too; a heavy dose of Seldes \n     at this prime could be hard for any average reader with \n     broader interests to take.\n       What seemed most striking about his comments at that \n     appearance in Hanover, N.H. however--just as it does now--is \n     the diminished capacity of contrary voices like his to be \n     heard today in the din of the modern information age.\n       Today, so many loud, contrary voices compete for listeners' \n     ears, with so many public outlets for spreading their views, \n     the problem is no longer an absence of facts, in some cases \n     it's too many facts--and too few people taking the time to \n     make sense of them.\n       More big-picture wisdom and few disconnected facts in every \n     type of media today would go a long way--a need that's grown \n     wider with George Seldes' passing.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 11, 1995]\n\n                   George Seldes: Giant of Journalism\n\n                          (By Colman McCarthy)\n\n       As a traveling companion, George Seldes didn't believe in \n     letting you rest. In the spring of 1982 when he was 91 and in \n     New York to collect a George Polk Award for a lifetime of \n     contribution to journalism, I took the Fifth Avenue bus with \n     him for a 30-block ride between the ceremony and his nephew's \n     apartment. We would have taken a cab but he preferred the \n     bus: a better way to get the feel of the city and its people.\n       Along the jostling way, Seldes threw at me a half-dozen \n     story ideas, mingled with sidebars of his opinions, plus \n     advice on how not merely to gather facts but to cull the \n     useless from the useful, and then a string of mirthful \n     recollections from his newspapering days going back eight \n     decades. If we were the boys on the bus, George Seldes was \n     some boy.\n       He died on July 2, in his 104th year and only a half-decade \n     or so after retiring from a reporting career that began in \n     1909 with the Pittsburgh Leader.\n       It's well within the bounds of accuracy to say of Seldes--\n     and this isn't the kind of gassy praise that's the customary \n     sendoff for the deceased--that for much of the 20th century \n     he stood as a giant and a pilar of journalism, a reporter's \n     reporter. He had the subverse notion that investigating the \n     press--the money-saving schemings of the publishers of his \n     day, editors cowering before advertisers, reporters \n     fraternizing with the pashas they write about--should be as \n     vital a beat as skeptically covering politicians.\n       At the Polk ceremony, the citation of the awards committee \n     succinctly summarized the spirit of intellectual independence \n     Seldes committed himself to: ``By mutual agreement, George \n     Seldes belonged not to the journalism establishment, nor was \n     he tethered to any political philosophy. With a gimlet eye \n     ever fixed upon transgressors, he soared above the \n     conventions of his time--a lone eagle, unafraid and \n     indestructible. He is 91 now and still a pretty tough bird.''\n       Seldes lived in Hartland Four Corners, Vt. Until recently, \n     he was self-sufficient at home and ever delighted to receive \n     such pilgrims as Ralph Nader, Morton Mintz and Rick \n     Goldsmith, a California filmmaker who is completing a \n     documentary on Seldes's life. The film will include \n     references to I.F. Stone, who credited Seldes' newsletter \n     ``In Fact''--which had 176,000 subscribers for a time in the \n     1940's--as the model for his own carefully researched I.F. \n     Stone's Weekly.''\n       The titles of some of Seldes's books give a hint of the \n     fires that burned within him: ``You Can't Print That: The \n     Truth Behind the News'' (1928). ``Never Tire of Protesting'' \n     (1986), ``Tell the Truth and Run'' (1953), ``Lords of the \n     Press'' (1935). In the 1980s, he wrote his memoir ``Witness \n     to a Century'' and edited ``The Great Thoughts,'' the latter \n     a thick and rich collection of ideas Seldes had gathered \n     throughout a lifetime of reading and listening.\n       ``Sometimes in isolated phrase or paragraph,'' he said of \n     his selections from Abelard to Zwingli and from Ability to \n     Zen, ``will work on the reader's imagination more forcefully \n     than it might when buried in a possibly difficult text.

Omitting \n     the news is as vile a sin as slanting the news, he believed. \n     Too many papers avoid stories that might upset the powerful \n     or the majority, while printing news on safe subjects and \n     editorializing to bloodless conclusions.\n       In ``freedom of the Press,'' Seldes recalled how he was \n     compromised while covering World War I: ``The journals back \n     home that printed our stories boasted that their \n     correspondents had been at the fighting front. I now realize \n     that we were told tonight but buncombe, that we were shown \n     nothing of the realities of the war, that we were, in short, \n     merely part of the Allied propaganda machine whose purpose \n     was to sustain morale at all costs and help drag unwilling \n     America into the slaughter. . . We all more or less lied \n     about the war.''\n       If so, that was to be the last time Seldes shied from \n     getting the whole story. For the rest of his long life, his \n     reporting on what were often no-no subjects--workers' rights, \n     public health and safety, press sellouts, corporate and \n     government lies--was the essence of truth-telling.

Mr. President. Yesterday, the President transmitted to the \nSenate the annual report for 1994 of the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency. In addition to detailing the Agency's many activities during \n1994, the report includes a major section on the adherence by the \nUnited States to its arms control obligations and the compliance of \nother nations with their arms control obligations.\n  This compliance report, which was provided in both classified and \nunclassified versions, is the most detailed annual compilation of arms \ncontrol issues available to us. It has been required of the agency for \na number of years, and it is particularly thorough and detailed in this \nyear's iteration. I believe that \n\n[[Page S10077]]\nmy fellow Senators should avail themselves of the opportunity to obtain \nthe report from ACDA and to review both the Agency's activities and the \nnumerous arms control compliance questions addressed in the report.\n  This year's unclassified report is remarkably open with regard to the \nkind of problems that we must address, and it represents a serious \neffort by ACDA Director, John Holum, and his staff to be informative \nand clear-headed in their analysis and judgments.\n  Let me give you several examples of the kind of information included \nin the report:\n  With regard to Russia's compliance with the 1972 Biological and Toxin \nWeapons Convention, the report says:\n\n       Previous assessments of Russian compliance have highlighted \n     the dichotomy between what appears to be the commitment from \n     President Yeltsin and other members of the Russian leadership \n     in attempting to resolve BWC issues and the continued \n     involvement of ``old hands'' in trilateral BW discussions and \n     in what Russia describes as a defensive BW program.\n       With regard to former Soviet biological weapons related \n     facilities, some research and production facilities are being \n     deactivated and many have taken severe personnel and funding \n     cuts. However, some facilities, in addition to being engaged \n     in legitimate activity, may be maintaining the capability to \n     produce biological warfare agents. The Russian Federation's \n     1993 and 1994 BWC data declaration contained no new \n     information and its 1992 declaration was incomplete and \n     misleading in certain areas. With regard to the trilateral \n     process that began in 1992, while there has been progress \n     towards achieving the openness intended in the Joint \n     Statement, the progress has not resolved all U.S. concerns.\n\n\n                               next steps\n\n       The United States remains actively engaged in efforts to \n     work with the Russian leadership to ensure complete \n     termination of the illegal program and to pursue a number of \n     measures to build confidence in Russian compliance with the \n     BWC.\n\n  With regard to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and \nChina, the report says:\n\n       The United States believes that China had an offensive BW \n     program prior to 1984 when it became a Party to the BWC.\n\n\n                                finding\n\n       The United States Government believes that based on \n     available evidence, China maintained an offensive BW program \n     throughout most of the 1980s. The offensive BW program \n     included the development, production, stockpiling or other \n     acquisition or maintenance of biological warfare agents. \n     China's CBM mandated declarations have not resolved U.S. \n     concerns about this program and there are strong indications \n     that China\n      probably maintains its offensive program. The United States \n     Government, therefore, believes that in the years after \n     its accession to the BWC, China was not in compliance with \n     its BWC obligations and that it is highly probable that it \n     remains noncompliant with these obligations.\n\n  The report is quite forthcoming and realistic with regard to some of \nthe serious problems regarding compliance with the Nuclear Non-\nproliferation Treaty. For example, the report says this about the Iraqi \nsituation:\n\n       Iraq's nuclear weapons program violated Article 11's \n     requirement that Parties not * * * manufacture or otherwise \n     acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; \n     and not * * * seek or receive any assistance in the \n     manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive \n     devices. Iraq's construction of secret facilities, including \n     its construction of a facility for nuclear weapons \n     development and assembly, contributed to its violation of \n     Article 11. Iraq's failure to apply safeguards to its \n     clandestine program also constituted a violation of Article \n     111, which requires that safeguards be applied with a view to \n     preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful purposes \n     to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n       The war and inspections have significantly set back Iraq's \n     program to develop a nuclear weapon. Nonetheless, Iraq almost \n     certainly intends to continue nuclear weapons related \n     activities and to build a nuclear weapon as soon as domestic \n     and international circumstances permit.\n\n\n                                finding\n\n       The United States Government has determined that Iraq \n     violated its Safeguards Agreement when it pursued an active \n     nuclear weapons development program and that this program \n     violated its obligations under Article 11 and 111 of the NPT. \n     The United States Government has further determined that \n     Baghdad is continuing its effort to undermine the UNSCOM/IAEA \n     inspection process by withholding relevant information, and \n     to preserve as much nuclear-related technology as possible \n     for a renewed weapons effort.\n\n\n                               next steps\n\n       The United States plans to continue to support UNSCOM/IAEA \n     inspections in Iraq and the long-term monitoring of Iraq's \n     nuclear program in accordance with UNSCR 687 and 715.\n\n  Mr. President, I have something of an ulterior motive in bringing \nthis report to the Senate's attention at this time. As most of you \nknow, there is a movement afoot to abolish the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency and make it a part of the Department of State. I \nhave opposed that effort in the Committee on Foreign Relations, and I \nintend to oppose it on the floor when the relevant legislation is \nbefore the Senate. I am not going to make a case here for ACDA because \nI deeply believe that any Senator reading this report and getting a \nsense of the tenacity and seriousness that ACDA brings to these \ncrucially important national security issues is quite likely to reach \nthe judgment that the modest number of dollars necessary to keep ACDA \nas an independent agency are among the best spent dollars in the \nFederal budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from President \nClinton transmitting the ACDA annual report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am pleased to transmit the 1994 Annual \n     Report of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament \n     Agency (ACDA).\n       The ACDA was established in 1961 in part because Dean Rusk, \n     Secretary of State at that time, believed the President \n     needed access to unfiltered arms control analysis.\n       After a comprehensive review in 1993 and a second review in \n     early 1995, it is clear to me that Secretary Rusk was \n     correct: sound arms control and nonproliferation policy \n     requires an independent, specialized, and technically \n     competent arms control and nonproliferation agency.\n       In the absence of such an agency, neither I nor any future \n     President could count on receiving independent arms control \n     advice, unfiltered by other policy considerations. A \n     President would thus at times have to make the most \n     consequential national security decisions without the benefit \n     of vigorous advocacy of the arms control point of view.\n       Moreover, I have found that ACDA's unique combination of \n     single-mission technical expertise with its painstakingly \n     developed capability for multilateral negotiation and \n     implementation of the most intricate arms control and \n     nonproliferation agreements could not be sustained with equal \n     effectiveness outside of a dedicated arms control agency.\n       The ACDA's first major success was the establishment of the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Twenty-five years later, \n     its most recent major success is its long-term effort \n     culminating in permanent and unconditional extension of that \n     same Treaty. On both counts, America and the world are far \n     more secure because of the ability and dedication of ACDA's \n     leadership and professional staff.\n       I have therefore decided that ACDA will remain independent \n     and continue its central role in U.S. arms control and \n     nonproliferation policy.\n       Whether the issue is nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear \n     missile reduction, chemical weapons elimination, or any of \n     the other growing arms control and nonproliferation \n     challenges America faces, ACDA is an essential national \n     security asset.\n       In that spirit, I commend this report to you.\n           Sincerely,\nWilliam J. Clinton.  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/14/senate-section/article/S10076-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Born in the city, she was graduated from both the prestigious \nprepatory school Ashley Hall and Chevy Chase Junior College, and she \nattended the College of Charleston. A dedicated member of her \n\n[[Page S10078]]\ncommunity, Mrs. Turnage was active in a number of civic organizations, \nincluding the Junior League; the Ivy Garden Club; the Association of \nthe Blind; and Grace Episcopal Church. Her efforts and work greatly \nbenefitted her hometown and helped to make it such a special place to \nlive.\n  Mrs. Turnage led a full and rewarding life. She will be greatly \nmissed by all those who had the pleasure of knowing her and my \ncondolences go out to her husband, retired Maj. Gen. Benjamin O. \nTurnage, Jr.; her children, C.M. ``Chipper'' Allen, Ann A. Harris, \nFrances A. Sadler, Robin A. Rodenberg; her stepsons, Col. John O. \nTurnage and Rev. Benjamin W.
