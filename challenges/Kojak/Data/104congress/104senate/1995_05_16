Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquick question. It is my understanding that this amendment she filed is \nthe same as the one she previously circulated, except the previous one \nhad in it additional waste besides solid waste. I \n[[Page S6704]] think it had construction debris; is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment that I sent to the desk is \nslightly modified and has been worked out with the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this morning I rise with my colleague \nfrom Washington, Senator Gorton, to offer an amendment to the \nInterstate Transportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act of 1995.\n  Let me begin by saying that I appreciate the attempts the managers of \nthis bill have made to accommodate the wide array of waste management \nsystems there are around the country. My colleagues from Connecticut, \nFlorida, Virginia, Delaware, and most recently, from Vermont have found \nways to amend this legislation so that the uniqueness of their local \nsystems is recognized within the scope of this legislation. Senator \nGorton and I want to ensure that Washington's communities have the same \nlatitude to continue progressively implementing solid waste management \nsystems.\n  Washington's municipal solid waste management system is a good one. \nAll municipal waste systems comply with the States' comprehensive waste \nmanagement plan. This plan delegates authority over solid waste \nmanagement to the State's counties, cities, and towns. These entities, \nin turn, manage public systems or contract with private industries to \nhandle all municipal solid waste and recycling.\n  The specifics of each system differ, from county to county, and from \ncounty to city, and from city to town; but all share the common \nelements of minimizing costs and adhering to the State's mandated \nrecycling goals.\n  In Washington, according to our State plan, local governments manage \nsolid waste, including recyclables, by way of an integrated system of \nfacilities. The city of Seattle, King County, Spokane County, Snohomish \nCounty, Clark County, and Okanogan County, and other jurisdictions use \nflow control authority in their systems. In this arrangement, the \ninterplay between county ordinances, town and city ordinances, health \ndistrict regulations, local agreements, and private contracts all play \na role.\n  Although the Supreme Court's decision sent a new wave of insecurity \nabout the future rippling through the public sectors of waste \nmanagement, Washington State actually began thinking about these issues \nlong ago. We have set a progressive waste management agenda for \nourselves that has been nationally heralded and emulated.\n  In 1989, while I was a State senator, we embraced the growing crisis \nover solid waste management when we passed the Waste Not Washington \nAct. Among other things, this plan established the statewide goal of 50 \npercent recycling. Now, we have the lowest cost recycling systems in \nthe country and the lowest cost disposal systems in the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  In Washington State, we are on the cutting edge of recycling. Let me \ngive a few examples of what this means in terms of the waste stream. \nStatewide, we recycle 56 percent of all newspaper, 57 percent of high \ngrade paper, 52 percent of cardboard, 50 percent of all yard waste, and \nabout 73 percent of all metals.\n  The city of Seattle's residential recycling rate was 48 percent in \n1993. The commercial recycling rate was 45 percent. Eighty-three \npercent of all newspapers are recycled in Seattle, as is 70 percent of \nall\n cardboard, 77 percent of all high grade paper, 68 percent mixed paper, \n70 percent of all aluminum, and over 50 percent of all glass recycled.\n\n  Curbside programs are currently available to over 70 percent of \nWashington State's population; and in urban counties and cities, there \nis almost 100 percent available curbside recycling. The city of Seattle \nhas had a curbside recycling program since 1987.\n  Not only does Washington State exceed current national standards, it \nis well beyond the targets of this bill.\n  The ways we got there were by allowing local communities the \nflexibility to establish the waste systems they needed. In the future, \nattaining our recycling goal of 50 percent will depend on the ability \nto continue managing our waste systems as well as we do now.\n  Our amendment is for Washington. It would ensure that Washington's \ncounties, towns, and cities will be able to meet the commitments they \nmade when they understood that flow control was a legitimate power.\n  Millions of dollars' worth of bonds, issued for facility development, \ncould be defaulted upon if Washington's local communities lose the \nability to service their waste management debts due to the loss of \nflexibility to guarantee a reliable waste stream.\n  In Washington, many communities have issued municipal bonds to pay \nfor the construction of solid waste facilities. These bonds are \noutstanding. The committee's substitute only partially protects the \ncommitments in communities like these.\n  In Snohomish County, for instance, improvements to the system were \nfinanced through a combination of revenue bonds and general obligation \nbonds. These debts were assumed with the expectation that solid waste \nrevenues would be used to service them. As of 1995, Snohomish County \nhas issued $26.7 million in general obligation bonds, scheduled to be \npaid back by 2007. As the bill is currently written, only the revenue \nbonds of Snohomish could be paid back.\n  The burdens of these debts will fall on the users of the system--the \ntaxpayers. As we at the Federal level of Government are shifting more \nand more financial responsibility on local governments, restricting the \nability of local governments to manage their solid waste systems is not \na good solution.\n  As it is written, this bill steps all over the jurisdictions of our \nlocal authorities. It will raise taxes. It will ruin one of the most \neffective recycling programs in the Nation, and it will throw many \ncommunities in our State into financial jeopardy. This one-size-fits-\nall approach will not work.\n  Our amendment is within the scope of this bill--it only grandfathers \nexisting systems and facilities. We do not ask for any extension of the \nsunset of flow control.\n  I encourage the passage of this amendment, and in turn, the passage \nof this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am puzzled, perhaps even bewildered at \nthe necessity to speak here on behalf of an amendment for my State and \nSenator Murray's--an amendment designed under the parameters of a bill \nsimply to allow the continuation of a flow control regime in our State \nwhich may very well have been the most successful of any State in the \nUnited States of America in reducing the amount of solid waste which is \nnot recycled.\n  This bill, of course, responds to a decision of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. That decision invalidated flow control regimes all across \nAmerica on the grounds that a State or municipality which directed or \nfunneled the flow of its waste materials violated the dormant \nprovisions of the interstate commerce clause. That is to say, States \nand local communities could not impact interstate commerce by flow \ncontrol regimes in the absence of authority from the Congress of the \nUnited States. The Supreme Court, of course, invited the Congress to \nlegislate in this area, and that is precisely what this bill does.\n  The bill attempts to recognize the fact that many States already have \nflow control regimes. And while it wishes to move them out of those \npresent regimes toward a greater degree of competition in the private \nsector, it nonetheless recognizes many, but not all, existing \nobligations. And that is the defect which leads to this amendment.\n  While the bill recognizes and grandfathers for an extended period of \ntime of up to 30 years regimes for single facilities financed by \nrevenue bonds, it does not exempt systems of facilities financed in \nwhole or in part by general obligation bonds. Beginning long before \nthis bill was thought of, that was the method adopted by the State of \nWashington's system of facilities, generally speaking, financed by \ngeneral obligation bonds; that is, bonds which were a call or a lien on \ntaxpayers through the property that they own in particular counties.\n  So all Senator Murray and I propose to do is to provide a narrowly \ndefined fix by defining the nature of the State \n[[Page S6705]] statute that covers, in a way, only the State of \nWashington and allow the continuation of its present regime for roughly \nthe same period of time that it has allowed for other States in this \nbill.\n  Nothing, Mr. President, could be more reasonable. One size does not \nfit all when we are legislating in a field which the States have \noccupied. One size certainly does not fit all when we are dealing with \na State that has been as progressive and as successful with its flow \ncontrol regime as has the State of Washington.\n  Now, at one level this debate has already taken place. It took place \nlast Thursday at the beginning of the discussion of this bill with the \namendment proposed by the two Senators from Vermont for a special \ncircumstance found in Vermont. This body accepted that Vermont \namendment by a relatively close rollcall vote.\n  This proposal is considerably narrower than that proposed by the two \nSenators from Vermont, because theirs talked about prospective systems \nnot in existence at the present time; ours talks about existing systems \nwhich are in place, in operation, and have already been financed.\n  Ours requires that significant financial commitments have been made \nor bonds have been issued, a major portion of which were used for the \nconstruction of solid waste facilities--a much more specific definition \nthan that in the Vermont amendment. Nor can we come up with a single \nexception for a single county. Our counties and cities have been given \nfairly broad discretion in this field, and different metropolitan \ncounties in the State of Washington have had subtle but distinct \ndifferences in the way in which they exercise flow control \nrequirements.\n  But I can say, Mr. President, that for those who feel that this \nshould be a competitive field, not single-source contracts, that is \nexactly what the State of Washington does. The management of our solid \nwaste is conducted on a competitive bid basis.\n  So, Mr. President, we, the two Senators from Washington, are here \nsimply to request the right to continue to do what we have already been \ndoing so successfully--to pay off our bonds and to be subject to the \nprovisions of this bill under essentially the same circumstances as are \nallowed other States, States to which the members of the committee paid \nsome attention in drafting the bill in the first place.\n  Mr. President, just as this was appropriate for those that were \nincluded in the bill in the first place on single State bases, those \nwhich have been added without controversy, that which was added by the \namendment of the Senators from Vermont, we wish not to have the Federal \nGovernment interfere with us, to tell us that everything we have done \nin the past is wrong, that in spite of the success of our program, I am \nsorry, we do not fit into the exceptions and therefore we cannot have \none.\n  Mr. President, we should be allowed to have this exception. We should \nbe allowed to continue a regime which has worked so successfully in our \nState in the past.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to make the record clear right from \nthe very beginning that this is not a case of the Federal Government \ninterfering in the affairs of any State. The current law of the United \nStates that is defined by the Constitution and the Supreme Court is \nthat you cannot have flow control. That is not the EPA or the \nEnvironment Committee or anybody else saying that. The Federal \nGovernment is not interfering. The law of the land is that they cannot \nhave flow control in the State of Washington or anywhere in the United \nStates. So we came forward with this legislation.\n  Why are we here? We are here because of the Carbone decision just a \nyear ago. In that decision, they said having flow control interferes \nwith the commerce clause. However, the Congress of the United States \ncan make arrangements in its acts and they can do something about the \nso-called flow control.\n And we have.\n\n  We realize that there are lots of communities across the country--or \nseveral, anyway--that were caught. They had flow control and they had \ncommitted money for a facility that bonded indebtedness or general \nobligation bonds and that facility was dependent upon the municipal \nsolid waste that would come to it, pursuant to flow control that had \nbeen enacted.\n  So we are taking care of that. Indeed there is one county in \nWashington that appears to fall within that category. That does not \nsatisfy the folks from Washington. Indeed, it is not restricted to the \nState of Washington.\n  I suppose the argument could be made, ``Well, under the act, when \ncertain things have to be enacted, it is solely Washington,'' but there \nis no restriction solely to Washington. We do not know how many other \nareas in the country might qualify under this. They are saying, ``We \nnever had flow control. However, we would like to be given that \nprivilege for the future. And we do not even have to have had bonded \nindebtedness.''\n  Indeed, if we read the amendment, it says ``Bonds have been issued or \nsignificant financial commitments have been made.'' Actually, it is the \nother way around--``Significant financial commitments have been made or \nbonds have been issued.''\n  Now, what does it mean by ``Significant financial commitments have \nbeen made?'' They spent some money on some trucks, for example. But \nthey want that to qualify them to have an exception to the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Where do we draw the line? Clearly, this is a place that does not \nqualify, it does not even come close to qualifying now, under the rules \nthat we have set forth, after a lot of deliberation.\n  Now, they have pointed out that they have had wonderful success in \nrecycling. That is great. They did not need flow control for that \nbecause they never had it. In some communities, yes. But they did not \nhave it in these other communities, and they had the successes of the \nrecycling that the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray pointed out.\n  Mr. President, this just goes too far. Clearly, if this amendment \nprevails we might as well say all across the country, forget the \nConstitution. We make an exception to it--not an exception. We just say \nin the whole Nation of the United States we can have flow control. \nCalifornia is next up.\n  Mr. President, I just think it is very unfortunate that they are \npursuing this amendment. After long discussions we worked out what \nseemed to me to be a fair compromise. It took care of the specific \nsituation where they had flow control but they had some commitments, \ngeneral obligation bonds, have made a commitment, but this is not \nsimilar to that.\n  Mr. President, I hope very much that the amendment would not be \naccepted.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am truly puzzled. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland says we ought to be satisfied because 1 county out of 39 in the \nState of Washington might possibly qualify under a general bill that he \nhas written to continue its present system.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island says, ``They say the Constitution be \ndamned, we just want to go ahead.'' He is entirely correct when he says \nthat a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court stated that under the dormant \nreading of the interstate commerce clause, flow control regimes all \nacross the United States were invalid.\n  That same Supreme Court decision asked the Congress if it wished to \ndo so to legislate in this area, pointing out that it could grant \nStates full authority if it wished to do so, to continue forever all of \ntheir existing or any future regime.\n  Now, the Senator from Rhode Island has done that. He is passing \nlegislation which under certain circumstances States can exercise flow \ncontrol regimes. One might ask, why does he not just simply allow it to \nthe full extent that the Constitution would allow it, but he has not. \nHe wants a certain pattern, but he has made exceptions to that certain \npattern and we would like such an exception.\n  Ours is all retrospective. Unless financial obligations have been \nundertaken or bonds sold, unless there is a system in place by a State \nstatute that is some 5 years old or more, the exception does not apply. \nIt does not apply in any other State, Mr. President.\n  Why should a community be penalized because it had enough money to \npay for these facilities in cash? Why should it be penalized if it pays \nfor \n[[Page S6706]] them by general obligation bonds which cover other \nfacilities as well, rather than a specific revenue bond for one \nspecific facility?\n  Now, Mr. President, this committee did not have to bring a bill out \non this subject at all. It could just have told the country that it had \nto live with this Supreme Court decision. The committee decided that \nthe Supreme Court decision mandated legislation. The legislation does \nhave differences from one State to another. This body has adopted an \namendment for Vermont which is infinitely broader than the amendment \nproposed for the State of Washington.\n  Why in the world these people sitting here in this body have to tell \nthe State of Washington, ``Sorry, you did it wrong and we are not going \nto let you do it anymore,'' is simply beyond the understanding of this \nSenator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, several times the Senator has said he is \npuzzled.\n  First of all, with regard to Vermont, there are exceptions in the \nVermont situation, and I might point out that this Senator, nor the \ncommittee, did not support the Vermont amendment.\n  Was it adopted? Yes, by a vote, over the objections of this Senator \nand others who are managing the bill.\n  To take a whole State such as Washington that has never had flow \ncontrol--they are seeking something they never had--talk about \npuzzlement. I wish the Senator from Washington would explain why he \nneeds flow control.\n  Why is he here? Because they had this remarkable record as recited of \nthe recycling and they have achieved all of that without flow control.\n  Now, once again, why did we bring this bill to the floor? The Senator \nsays, why did they bring it up? We brought it up to take care of those \ncommunities that were truly hurt by the Carbone decision. Those \ncommunities had enacted flow control, had issued bonds, usually revenue \nbonds, to pay for either an incinerator or very carefully planned \nlandfill. They wanted to pay it off, and they are planning to pay off \ntheir bonds through the flow control that required all the trash within \nthe municipality or the county--wherever it is--to come to a central \nplace.\n  That is not the situation with the Senator and the State of \nWashington at all.\n  If there are explanations that are needed here, I think they are \nneeded from the Senator, or the prime sponsor of the amendment, if she \nwould say what they need these for. They had all these wonderful \nrecycling achievements without flow control, so now they are in here \nasking for an exception to an entire State.\n  By the way, in all fairness, there is some difference between the \npopulation of Vermont, which is relatively modest, and the population \nof the State of Washington and what this will trigger, should this \namendment be adopted.\n  Mr. President, I suggest during these pauses that the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me again stress in no way does the \nState of Washington in the proposed amendment come close to meeting the \nexceptions that were provided for in this legislation. First, they do \nnot have flow control; and, second, under the amendment as submitted it \ndoes not require there be outstanding bonded indebtedness.\n  The Senator from Washington has frequently mentioned to us they have \ngeneral obligation bonds, but that is not what this amendment says. \nThis amendment says, ``significant financial commitments have been \nmade.'' That could be the community had spent some money, as I say, on \nsome trucks, to haul garbage. So it does not even come close to the \ncriteria that we have set forth in the bill and I just think it is a \nvast overreaching.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray-Gorton \namendment. We worked on it hard to try to craft a compromise to \naccommodate as many people as possible on this legislation. The \namendment of Senators Gorton and Murray would simply open up the \ncurrent provisions under S. 534 and would allow prospective flow \ncontrol for areas that currently do not have flow control, and some \nareas that do flow control but do not have bonds and currently need to \nbe paid off.\n  The whole spirit of the compromise worked out so carefully as we put \nthis legislation together was we would not do things prospectively, \nthat the intent here was to protect those people who had made financial \ncommitments. Most specifically, they had let bonds or contracts that \nwould require substantial losses possibly, conceivably, to the \ninvestment. That was the purpose. We were not trying to pass a bill \nhere that would open up the whole interstate commerce issue again and \nallow States to prospectively implement flow control anywhere or any \ntime for whatever reason, no matter how small the cost, whether it be \nthe purchase of a truck or some minor item of cost.\n  Local flow control laws are by their very nature monopolistic and \nthey are anticompetitive. I have stated numerous times during the \ncourse of this debate that I personally do not favor flow control, but \nin working with my colleagues I tried to help out some of the States \nthat had very, very significant financial commitments, most \nspecifically bonds, or in the case of a State like New Jersey, where \nthey had an entire system for flow control and we wanted to try to \naccommodate them, we put a grandfather clause in here that would say \nthat all flow control would be by the boards after 30 years. That was \nto allow for any bonds that may have been let to run out and then it \nwould be entirely the free market system.\n  This amendment just flies in the face of the entire bill, the entire \ncompromise. It is very important that my colleagues understand that if \nyou support the free enterprise system and want to see less flow \ncontrol in the future--not more--then you would be opposed to this \namendment.\n  The Supreme Court ruled last year that these types of flow control \nlaws are a violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Yet, \nit can be argued that governments that issued bonds--and the key here \nis bonds--to build facilities in reliance on flow control should be \nallowed to continue flow control only until these bonds are repaid. \nAfter this, the free market should prevail.\n  The purist argument would be they knew what they were doing when they \nlet the bonds, and the free market ought to prevail anyway. Frankly, \nthat is my position. But in an effort to compromise on this, Senator \nChafee and I and others agreed that we would allow this grandfather, \nthat it would be restrictive, that it would not be an open-ended \ngrandfather that would simply allow prospectively anybody to think, \n``Well, I might have an opportunity in 10 years to implement flow \ncontrol and, you know, we might want to sign a contract, or we might \nwant to let a bond, or prospectively, we may want to do it in 10 \nyears.'' That is not the intent of this legislation. It would not be in \nthe best interests of those who want to see flow control restricted \nrather than increased.\n  So the key here is that this amendment vastly expands the universe of \ncommunities that would be allowed the flow control--I mean vastly. This \nis not just Washington State. This is an open end that is going to \nallow flow control, and it would be flow control allowed not on the \nbasis of financial need, not on the basis of financial commitments, not \nat all; just maybe we will have some financial commitments, or maybe in \nthe future we would like to pass a bond, or maybe we would like to sign \na contract, or maybe we would like to build a facility sometime in the \nfuture. That defeats the entire purpose of the legislation. I cannot \nemphasize that strongly enough.\n  This amendment goes beyond the principles that only those facilities \nthat incurred bonded indebtedness should be grandfathered and instead \nit \n[[Page S6707]] grants flow control authority to a large universe of \nlocal governments who are simply implementing a State solid waste \nmanagement plan.\n  Again, I go back to the hearing that we held in the subcommittee on \nflow control when we heard from New Jersey and other units which were \naffected by this. We heard that bond holders were going to be harmed \nand even some of us felt that they knew what they were doing or should \nhave known what they were doing when they let the bonds and invested in \nthe bonds. We decided, be that as it may, to be as fair as possible, we \nwere going to allow the grandfather to kick in. A 30-year period gives \neverybody a chance to recoup any losses that they might have as a \nresult of investments in the bonds. That was a compromise. It was very \ncarefully struck. It was not my position. It was not the position of \nSenator Lautenberg or others on the committee who supported flow \ncontrol. But it was a compromise. As compromises are, you give a little \nbit and you take a little bit. And that is the way it works.\n  But now to say we are down to the end, or very close to where we want \nto have a vote on this bill, to say now we are going to open this whole \nthing up prospectively to any locality or any community whatsoever \nanywhere which may want to have flow control is basically undoing the \nbill.\n  It is an anti-free-market amendment. It opens up flow control to a \nvariety of communities that currently do not practice it, and it will \nshut out private companies that could meet the solid waste disposal \nneeds of these areas. What we are hoping will happen in States like \nWashington and other States is that the free market will kick in; that \nover the next 30 years as we grandfather those who are currently \nimplementing flow control, we will see the free market kick in in \nStates like this where there is no flow control now, and it will work \nand it will work very well, and the free market frankly usually works, \nif not always works.\n  So I think that is the approach we ought to take. To just now come in \nwith an anti-free-market amendment is a serious mistake. Recent studies \nindicate that flow control jurisdictions charge, on average, 40 percent \nhigher rates than non-flow-control jurisdictions--40 percent higher.\n  This amendment goes against the spirit of the bill, the intent of the \nbill, and it should be defeated.\n  Flow control is not necessary for recycling, according to a recent \nEPA report called ``Report to Congress--Flow Controls and Municipal \nSolid Waste'':\n\n       There are no data showing that flow controls are essential \n     for the development of new solid waste capacity or for the \n     long-term achievement of State and local goals for source \n     reduction, reuse, and recycling.\n\n  That is a quote from that report. Thus, even the EPA has demonstrated \nthat there is no need for flow control to meet State recycling goals.\n  The bottom line, as has been said before, my colleagues, is that this \nis a killer amendment. It kills the bill. It guts the bill. It makes \nthe bill totally worthless, and it should not be passed.\n  I hope my colleagues will think very carefully and weigh this very \ncarefully before the vote.\n  I call attention to item three in the amendment, which says \nsignificant financial commitments have been made. What is a \n``significant financial commitment''? Is it a few dollars, $10, $15, or \n$20? Maybe it is a fee to buy a license or a permit. We are not talking \nabout that. We want to limit future flow control in this legislation. \nWe want it to end in 30 years. We do not want it to begin in States \nthat do not have it. We are just allowing the exception or the \ngrandfather in the States that do.\n  So, Mr. President, with the greatest respect to my colleagues who \nhave offered the amendment, it is ill advised. It will hurt what we are \ntrying to do in this compromise, and frankly if this is passed, this \ncould lead to the very defeat of the flow control bill, which will hurt \nthose people, those very people out there, the bond holders who are \nsitting there now worried about whether or not they are going to get \nrelief.\n And if the bill is defeated or somehow taken down because of this, \nthen those people are not going to get relief.\n\n  So I hope this amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, who has control of the time, and how much \ntime is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes for the Senator from Rhode \nIsland; 14 minutes for the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I assume I have the time of the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. I yield myself a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, it is with some reluctance that I oppose the Murray-\nGorton amendment. I have the highest regard for the Senators from \nWashington, both Senator Murray and Senator Gorton. They are trying to \nprotect their State.\n  I must reject their amendment and oppose it, Mr. President, very \nsimply because the approach that they are coming up with to meet the \nconditions in their State is much too broad, is much too general, and \nit goes much, much beyond the intent of the bill.\n  The intent of the bill is to protect those communities which, \nessentially, prior to a certain date--May 15, 1994--had flow control \neither by regulation or by ordinance or by State law. It is not, \nfrankly, to protect those communities which did not have any kind of \nflow control; that is, that had not designated certain sites where \ntrash would go.\n  The amendment offered by the Senators from Washington essentially \nsays that flow control is OK if there had been a plan, a general plan \nto deal with trash in the State of Washington. The amendment by the \nSenators from Washington does not say that there was in some case flow \ncontrol but rather, essentially, there is a waste management plan. For \nthat reason it is much, much too broad. It is very unfair to other \nStates, frankly, who would like to do the same thing.\n  If this amendment passes, there is a good argument it should apply to \nevery other State in the Nation. And if it applies to every other State \nin the Nation then we might as well pull down this bill. Because the \ncompromise that has been reached, one between free enterprise hauling \nthe trash according to the wishes of different communities and trash \nhaulers across State lines, combined with the other, that \nmunicipalities control their own trash, that compromise would fall \napart. There would be no compromise. We would have no bill.\n  I, therefore, suggest to the Senators from Washington that if the \namendment is rejected--and I very much hope it is rejected--that they, \nthe Senators from Washington, work in conference, and the conferees \ncome up with a generic approach to address the kinds of problems that \nare raised by the Senators from Washington.\n  This is a very complicated matter. I wish I could support the \namendment offered by the Senators from Washington, but, in good faith, \nI cannot. And I cannot because it goes way, way beyond the compromise \nreached in the bill. It is way beyond the provision we adopted to deal \nwith the situation in the State of Vermont just a few days ago.\n  And I must say that if this amendment passes, every other Senator can \nstand up on this floor and very legitimately say, ``Well, gee, it \nshould apply to my State.'' And if that is the case, the bill falls \napart and it will not pass. I guarantee it will not pass. I guarantee \nthere are going to be Senators whose other points of view will stand up \non the floor and prevent its passage.\n  Basically, Mr. President, I believe, for those reasons, that the \namendment should be soundly rejected and we can work in conference to \ncome up with a solution that might deal with some of these problems, if \nnot all.\n  Mr. President, if a community does not need flow control, I think we \nshould let the private market work and not just rely on Government \nregulation. This amendment is a Government regulation amendment which \nbasically says we want more Government on your backs, we want more \nregulation, we want more control. I think that there are a good number \nof people in this country, particularly this body, that might have some \nreservations about adding more control, more regulations, more laws on \nthe backs of the American people.\n  [[Page S6708]] Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time on \nthis side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, again, as I have stated, I am completely \npuzzled by the nature of the argument of those a committee and on a \ncommittee staff, who worked in a committee without a Member from the \nState affected by this amendment and who presume to know much more \nabout the desires of the people of the State represented by Senator \nMurray and myself than they themselves do, and who continue to use \nlanguage such as ``prospective'' and ``wide open'' and ``applicable to \neveryone.''\n  Well, Mr. President, we have offered to make a specific reference to \nthe revised code of Washington, if they want to make certain that this \napplies only to the State of Washington. They are not interested, \nbecause, of course, such an amendment would be useless. The description \nwe have in here now is single State in nature. We have offered to put \nin ``continue to exercise flow control'' in this amendment, but they \nare not interested because they know that this is not a prospective \namendment as it is.\n  Mr. President, this requires the State to have had a law before the \nyear 1990 and it requires the plans to have been in existence in \nparticular communities before May 15, 1994. Now, what is prospective \nabout that?\n  These are existing plans. These are existing systems of facilities in \none single State.\n  Now, if the bill is dead because one single State is permitted to \ncontinue to do what it wishes to do, it is already dead by reason of \nthe Vermont amendment last week, which is much more broad and is \nprospective and does allow that State to go forward with plans in the \nfuture.\n  The answer, Mr. President, is that this is just something that this \ncommittee did not consider and does not want to consider now.\n  Senator Murray and I are asking for the continuation of an existing \nsystem in various counties of our State which has resulted, I believe, \nin more recycling and less disposal of solid waste perhaps than any \nother State in the United States of America. That is all we are asking \nfor.\n  It is not prospective. It does not allow new counties and new \ncommunities even in our State who already had these ordinances and \nthese obligations underway a year ago yesterday, May 15, 1994, to do so \nat some time in the future. It is State-specific and it is system \nfacilities-specific. That is all there is to it. And there is no reason \nin the world for this amendment to be turned down.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not want to get into an argument with \nmy good friend, the Senator from Washington. But the fact is, the \ncommittee very directly considered these points, contrary to the \nstatement of the Senator from Washington. Second, contrary to the \nstatement of the Senator from Washington, the amendment is prospective.\n  He talks about a solid waste plan. Mr. President, a plan is so \ngeneral. We are not talking about plans in this bill. We are talking \nabout whether a specific flow control ordinance passed, and if a \nspecific indebtedness was created. We are talking about a specific \ncontract where people are obligated. That is what we are talking about.\n  We are not talking about providing flow control authority if a State \nonly has a solid waste plan. But that is what this amendment does. It \nwould allow a State to use flow control if the State has a solid waste \nplan even if the State has not relied on flow control in the past. \nWashington only has only a general solid waste plan. If Washington was \na lot more specific, and had relied on flow control in the past then \nWashington would be covered.\n The problem is Washington is not specific as a general plan, and that \nis why this is prospective.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Gorton, in \nbeing perplexed at the reasons for not accepting this amendment. I go \nback to the fact that my colleagues from Connecticut, Florida, \nVirginia, Delaware, and Vermont have come to the committee with \nspecific concerns from their States that have been worked out to this \npoint in this debate and in this bill. The concerns from Washington \nState are just as needy.\n  I was in our State senate back in 1989 when we passed the Waste Not \nWashington Act. We were ahead of this country in how to deal with our \nwaste management. It is a very effective piece of legislation. We do \nnot want it undermined now by actions on this Senate floor.\n  We have offered to the committee words that will deal with their \nconcerns about being prospective. We have offered to put in language \nthat makes it Washington State specific by referencing the Waste Not \nWashington Act. I assure my colleagues there is no intent to open \nloopholes. The intent is to allow the waste management in our State of \nWashington to work well, as it is currently doing.\n  I invite any of my colleagues to my hometown of Seattle and to take a \nlook at the curbside recycling program that exists there. We recycle \neverything. We put out our pop bottles. We put out our plastic. We put \nout our newspaper. We separate our paper into different colors. It is \ndone on every street in the city of Seattle. We do not want to see it \nundermined. People are very proud of that program there.\n  I think it is absolutely critical that this Senate does not go on \nrecord undermining a very progressive recycling program in the State of \nWashington. I assure you that I did not know the rest of the Nation was \nso far behind us until I moved here 2\\1/2\\ years ago, and my children \nsaid, ``What is with the garbage cans here that are so full?'' They \ncould not believe what was not recycled here on this coast.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to take a look at this legislation, \nto allow Washington State to continue to be progressive, to be an \nexample for the rest of the Nation, and to not undermine us by \nexempting us within the legislation that is before us. Our amendment \nvery simply allows the State of Washington to continue doing what it is \ndoing. I ask and encourage all of our colleagues to allow local control \nto exist on this very serious problem in my home State of Washington.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opposition has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators from Washington yield back \ntheir time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Not quite yet. How much time is remaining to the Senator \nfrom Washington?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would like to speak for perhaps 2 of those minutes, Mr. \nPresident, I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, and then I think \nhis motion will be in order.\n  My colleague from Washington reminds me of my own experience. I, too, \nlive in the city of Seattle. I hear a great deal about monopolies and \ncompetition and the like. I can assure my colleagues I pay much less \nfor a much more efficient system at home than I do in the District of \nColumbia by a long shot.\n  What we are saying is that if we had a plan that was in place a year \nago on which there is a contract--not some amorphous future plan, Mr. \nPresident. The municipality not only had to have a plan a year ago; it \nhad to obligate itself by a contract--it has to be undertaking this \nprocess right now. It has to be in place. It is not in the future. And \nit has to have cost money.\n  Now, somehow or another we are criticized because some of our \ncommunities were wise enough and responsible enough to pay for these \nmajor facilities out of cash, that they did not have to bond, but for \nsome reason or other to this committee that is a terrible thing.\n  A responsible municipality which has paid for these facilities \nalready cannot recover for them. Now, that is another part of the \nabsurdity of this amendment. This is State specific, Mr. President. It \nis not prospective. It deals only with things that are already in \nplace. And it is in pursuance of a system which has worked very well \nand very effectively and should be allowed to be \n[[Page S6709]] continued. It is not as broad as amendments which are \nalready a part of this bill for other States.\n  Mr. President, with the permission of the other Senator from \nWashington, I will yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my deep dismay \nover the defeat of the Murray-Gorton amendment.\n  Frankly, it was my intention if the Murray-Gorton amendment were \nsuccessful, to move an amendment which would be a slight change to take \nCalifornia's situation into consideration.\n  I cannot help but note that there have been a number of specific \namendments to deal with a number of States. Nine States have received \nsome preferential treatment in this bill. For my State, and I speak for \nSenator Boxer, as well, California has a unique situation.\n  We have a State law which mandates a 50-percent reduction in solid \nwaste by the year 2000. How can a State do that if it does not have \nsome flow control over its waste?\n  Eight local governments in my State, based on last year's bill, made \nagreements and incurred debts totaling $125 million which are \nunaddressed by this bill. Those counties are very concerned.\n  The California Association of Counties had asked that if the Gorton-\nMurray amendment were successful, an amendment be introduced based on \nthat amendment which would clarify certain gray areas in the bill. The \ngray areas are contracts and franchises that have been consummated \nafter the grandfather date, but based on last year's bill.\n  I very much regret that these issues are not taken into \nconsideration, particularly by a Congress that is very concerned about \nStates' rights.\n  I, for one, and Senator Boxer as well, will have to vote against this \nbill, based on the fact that we believe our State is seriously \ndisadvantaged by it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I gather from what the Senator said she, \ntherefore, will not proceed with the amendment?\n  We had a reserve amendment slot for the Senators from California, and \nI gather the Senators will not proceed on that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I could have a couple of minutes to think about \nthis I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1083\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Kempthorne, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. \n     Kempthorne, proposes an amendment numbered 1083.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 35, line 5, after the word ``agreements'', insert \n     the words, ``or permits authorizing receipt of out-of-State \n     municipal solid waste''.\n       One page 45, lines 15 and 16, after the word, ``tax'', \n     strike the words, ``assessed against or voluntarily''; on \n     lines 16 and 17, after the word, ``subdivision'', insert the \n     following: '', or to the extent that the amount of the \n     surcharge is offset by voluntarily agreed payments to a State \n     or its political subdivision''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is a technical amendment that has \nbeen cleared with the other side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  We have reviewed this amendment and we find it acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1083) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, here is the situation now.\n  We have two more amendments that were provided for, and then we would \nhope be able to go to final passage. One is the Levin amendment and the \nother is the Domenici amendment. We are working on both of those.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Levin \namendment is withdrawn and Senator Levin will not offer his amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right, that takes care of that.\n  I received word that the Senator from California will withdraw the \nso-called Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, that is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished managers of \nthe bill are in the process of working on what may come next. While \nthat is going on, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak in \nmorning business. I assure the distinguished managers when they reach a \npoint where they want to interrupt, I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6703-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6709-S6712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       IS AMERICA GOING TO LEAD?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is an important question hanging over \nus like Damocles' sword today. It will loom over us as we consider the \nbudget. It will confront us directly as we debate the reorganization of \nour foreign affairs agencies. The question is ``Is America going to \nlead?''\n  This is not a question that keeps people awake at night anymore. \nAfter all, \n[[Page S6710]] people ask, ``We won the cold war, didn't we? There is \nno longer any real threat to America's security, is there?''\n  Mr. President, there have been few times in history when the United \nStates can less afford to be complacent. The world today is anything \nbut a predictable, peaceful place. While we are fortunate that the \nmilitary threat to our security has receded, it is more true today than \never that American prosperity is linked to conditions in the rest of \nthe world.\n  Millions of American jobs depend upon persuading other countries to \nopen their borders to U.S. exports, and helping them raise their \nincomes so they can afford to buy our exports. Ensuring that we have \nclean air and clean water depends upon international action to protect \nthe environment. Keeping Americans healthy depends on joint action to \nfight the spread of infectious diseases in other countries. Imagine if \nwe are unable to contain the recent outbreak of a deadly virus in \nZaire--very quickly you would see Senators clamoring for more aid to \nstop it from reaching our shores.\n  Stemming the flow of illegal immigrants and refugees to the United \nStates depends on promoting democracy and economic development in the \ncountries from which the refugees are fleeing. These are just a few \nexamples of why we continue to have an enormous stake in what happens \nin the rest of the world.\n  Fortunately, the United States, the only remaining superpower with \nthe largest economy and the most powerful military, can influence what \nhappens in the rest of the world.\n  But influence is not automatic. It requires effort, and it costs \nmoney.\n  Perhaps most important, the United States needs to maintain its \nleadership in and its financial contributions to the international \norganizations that make critical contributions to promoting peace, \ntrade, and economic development. Organizations like the United Nations, \nthe World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank, to name a few. These organizations are the glue that holds \nour international system together. They may not always act in precisely \nthe way we would like, but they are dedicated to spreading the values \nthat Americans hold dear--freedom, democracy, free enterprise, and \ncompetition.\n  The American people also want to help alleviate the suffering of \npeople facing starvation or other calamities, like refugees fleeing \ngenocide in Rwanda, or the\n hundreds of thousands of victims of landmines--the people who are \ninjured and killed every 15 minutes around the clock, around the world, \nfrom the 80 to 100 million antipersonnel landmines spread in 60 to 65 \ncountries.\n\n  Finally Mr. President, the polls show that most Americans believe we \nshould help developing countries and countries making the transition \nfrom communism to democracy and market economics. It is through this \naid that we fight poverty, that we stabilize population growth, that we \neducate people who have never known anything except tyranny in the \nbasics of representative government, and that we encourage countries to \nopen their economics to trade and competition.\n  We do these things, not out of a sense of altruism, but because it is \nin our national interest. Yet, in the rush to reduce Federal spending, \nsome are dismissing spending on international affairs as a luxury we \ncannot afford, or even a waste.\n  The United States cannot pay these costs alone, but no one is asking \nus to. The United States now ranks 21st among donors in the percentage \nof national income that it devotes to development assistance. Twenty-\nfirst. Right behind Ireland. We are not even the largest donor in terms \nof dollar amount anymore. Japan, which has a keen sense of what is in \nits national interest, has passed us. They passed the United States in \nthis area. Do you think Japan is doing this out of a sense of altruism? \nHa. They do it because they know it creates jobs and it helps their \neconomy.\n  Six years ago, when I became chairman of the Foreign Operation \nSubcommittee, the foreign operations budget was $14.6 billion. We cut \nthat budget by 6.5 percent, not even taking into account inflation, \nwhile the remainder of the discretionary spending in the Federal budget \nincreased by 4.8 percent. Those cuts were a calculated response to the \nend of the cold war. Foreign aid today is substantially less than it \nwas during the Reagan and Bush administrations. Our entire foreign aid \nprogram, including funding for the Eximbank and foreign military \nfinancing and other activities that have as much to do with promoting \nU.S. exports as with helping other countries, today accounts for less \nthan 1 percent of the total Federal budget.\n  We must recognize that there is a limit to how far we can cut our \nbudget for international affairs, and still maintain our leadership \nposition in the world. Just when many people though U.S. influence was \nreaching new heights, we are seeing the ability of the United States to \ninfluence world events eroding.\n  This budget proposal amounts to a classic example of penny-wise and \npound-foolish. Our allies are scratching their heads, wondering why the \nUnited States, with the opportunity to exercise influence in the world \nmore cheaply than ever before, is turning its back and walking away.\n  We are inviting whoever else wants to--friend or foe--to step into \nthe vacuum and pursue their interests at our expense.\n  Mr. President, the United States stands as a beacon of liberty and \nhope for people throughout the world. But we should be more than a \nbeacon. A beacon is passive. We should be proactive, reaching out to \ndefend our interests and to help our less fortunate neighbors. We \nshould continue to invest in the world. We should continue to lead.\n  If there is going to be a leader for democracy, if there is going to \nbe a leader for economic development, if there is going to be a leader \nfor human rights, if there is going to be a leader setting the goal, as \nan American I prefer that it be our country. And as a U.S. Senator I \nknow of no country better suited to do that.\n  Mr. President, I want to say a few words about Republican proposals \nto reform the U.S. foreign affairs agencies. Senator Helms, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has \nlaunched a broad proposal to reform foreign policymaking in the Federal \nGovernment. This proposal includes provisions for completely \nrestructuring the way we administer our foreign aid programs. Senator \nHelms asserts that U.S. foreign policymaking has become so \ndecentralized that it no longer serves the national interest. He \nproposes to merge most foreign affairs functions into the Department of \nState.\n  As the former chairman and now ranking Democrat on the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, I have had some opportunity to be involved in \nthe U.S. Government's conduct of foreign policy, and I have some \nthoughts about Senator Helms' proposal.\n  While I have long advocated better coordination among the executive \nbranch agencies in foreign policymaking, I believe Senator Helms' \nproposal would result in U.S. national interests being less well, not \nbetter, served.\n  Why is the Foreign Agricultural Service administered by the \nDepartment of Agriculture and not by the State Department? Because \nfarmers know they can count on USDA to represent their interests better \nthan the Department of State and all experiences have proven that.\n  Why, 15 years ago, did we take the commercial function away from the \nState Department and create a Foreign Commercial Service in the \nDepartment of Commerce? It was because State had for years neglected \nexport promotion, sacrificed export interests to its foreign policy \npriorities, and treated its commercial officers as second-class \nemployees. It was because the American business community was clamoring \nfor something better,\n knowing that if we could increase our exports we would increase jobs \nhere in the United States.\n\n  The reason we have separate foreign service bureaucracies is that \nmany of our foreign policy interests are actually domestic policy \ninterests that are best pursued abroad by technical experts from \ndomestic policy agencies, not be foreign policy generalists from the \nState Department. I do not know about farmers from other States, but I \ncan tell you that Vermont farmers are not at all anxious to see the \nState Department expand its influence over \n[[Page S6711]] U.S. foreign agricultural policy. They fear that \nshifting power from domestic agencies to the State Department will not \nstrengthen representation of United States interests in United States \npolicy but rather will strengthen representation of French interests \nand Argentine interests and Russian interests.\n  Let me focus on the specific question of restructuring America's \nforeign assistance program. I have been advocating reform of our \nforeign aid program ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall, so I \nwelcome this opportunity for discussion of this issue.\n  Senator Helms says that our foreign aid program should further our \nnational interests. I absolutely agree. I do not know of anyone who \ndisagrees.\n  But I do not agree with his definition of the problem. The problem is \nnot that the Agency for International Development is ignoring America's \nnational interests. The problem is that since 1961 when the Foreign \nAssistance Act was enacted, much of our foreign aid was allocated to \nwinning allies in the fight against communism.\n  All you had to do was say, ``I am anti-Communist, pro-American,'' no \nmatter what kind of a dictator you were, money flowed to you.\n  Billions went to right-wing dictatorships with little or not \ncommitment to democracy or improving the living conditions of their \npeople, or even allowing business competition. Much of that aid failed \nby the standards we apply today. But it is unfair and disingenuous to \njudge AID's effectiveness today against the failures of the past when \nour goals were fundamentally different.\n  AID needs a new legislative mandate. We meet to get rid of cold war \npriorities and replace them with priorities for the 21st century.\n  The Secretary of State has full authority under statute to give \npolicy direction to AID, and the State Department influences AID's \nactivities every day. If AID's projects deviate from State Department \npolicy, it is not because AID is out of control, it is because the \npeople at State are not paying enough attention to what AID is \nproposing to do.\n  Senator Helms also does not give sufficient credit to the Clinton \nadministration for its efforts to improve AID performance. Over the \npast 2 years, we have seen dramatic progress at the Agency for \nInternational Development and the Treasury and State Departments in \nredefining our foreign aid priorities and focusing resources where they \ncan achieve the most in advancing U.S. interests abroad, in spite of \nthe constraints of an obsolete Foreign Assistance Act.\n  AID Administrator Brian Atwood has made\n   extensive changes at AID. He initiated an agency-wide streamlining \neffort that has resulted in the closure of 27 missions and a reduction \nof 1,200 staff. He is installing state-of-the-art data processing \nsystems that link headquarters in Washington with project officers in \nthe field in real time. This will ensure that information available at \none end of the management pipeline is also available at the other, \nincreasing efficiency and improving decisionmaking.\n  Mr. Atwood has decentralized decisionmaking so the people closest to \nproblems have a full opportunity to design solutions. AID is improving \nits performance because, for the first time since the mid-1980's, it \nhas hands-on leadership that is committed to making our foreign aid \nprograms effective.\n  Can AID improve its management performance further? Yes. But would \nthe State Department do better? I doubt it. I believe that abolishing \nAID and asking regional assistant secretaries at the State Department \nto manage its functions would be a serious mistake. These assistant \nsecretaries are chosen for their expertise in broad foreign policy. \nMany do not have experience managing money and programs. And they are \noverworked now trying to deal with the daily emergencies and \ncomplexities of our political relationships with countries in their \nregions.\n  Even former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, a Republican \nwhom I respect and whose counsel I have sought, expressed doubt about \nthis proposal in his testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee \non March 23. ``The State Department is not well suited, either by \nhistorical experience or current bureaucratic culture, to assume many \nof these new responsibilities,'' Secretary Eagleburger said. And he was \ntrying to be supportive of the Helms proposal.\n  I would put the matter a little less delicately: The State \nDepartment's specialty is making policy; it has never and probably \nnever will manage programs well. Secretary Eagleburger offered the hope \nthat, with every careful selection of Under Secretaries, it might do \nbetter. I am reluctant to trade a bureaucracy that is doing reasonably \nwell and getting better at delivering foreign aid for one that has no \ncompetence on the outside chance that it might get better. If we \ndisperse responsibility for foreign aid among assistant secretaries of \nState, I bet that we will start hearing more stories about misguided \nand failed projects, not fewer, and more questions about why we have \nforeign aid, not fewer.\n  AID today is performing a wide array of tasks that enjoy overwhelming \nsupport among the American people:\n  Every year, AID manages programs worth a billion dollars aimed at \nprotecting the Earth's environment. Does protecting the Earth's \nforests, oceans, and atmosphere matter to us? Does it further our \nforeign policy interests? A century from now we are not going to have \nany foreign policy if we do not join with other countries today to \nprotect the environment.\n  Every year, AID manages hundreds of millions of dollars in \ninternational health programs. Is this money wasted? We might as well \nask whether AIDS and tuberculosis are infectious.\n  Every year, AID commits a large part of its budget to promoting free \nmarkets and democratic development in countries where the United States \nhas important interests. This is not diplomacy. It is hands-on \nassistance that requires people with special expertise on the ground \nwho can get the job done. Working with foreign governments and private \norganizations on the nuts and bolts of solving real problems. That is \nwhat AID does.\n  Mr. President, we have a strong need to rewrite the Foreign \nAssistance Act to redefine the framework for foreign aid. AID can \ncontinue to downsize and improve its efficiency. But we should not \nabolish an agency that is aggressively adapting itself to the changed \nworld we live in and to the shrinking foreign aid budget.\n  Let me close with this, a personal observation.\n  I have served here during the administrations of President Ford, \nPresident Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton. Each one of \nthose, each President, Republican and Democrat alike, has come to \nMembers of the Congress, Republican and Democrat alike, and sought \nbipartisan support on foreign policy. We follow the dictates of Senator \nVandenberg that politics end at the water's edge.\n  We have had some major debates on this floor, and we have had major \ndebates in the Cabinet room of the White House. But we have come \ntogether. We have observed a number of things, not the least of which \nis that the President of the United States is our chief foreign policy \nspokesperson.\n  Throughout all of my years in the Senate, it has been an unwritten \nrule that, when the President of the United States is abroad, when he \nis making foreign policy or conducting foreign policy, he receives \nsupport at home. If we disagree with him, we wait until he gets home \nand we tell him so. I am concerned, when the President of the United \nStates recently went abroad for meetings in Russia and Ukraine, that \nmany would not wait until he came back but had to take to the floors of \nthe House and the Senate to criticize what he was doing. I think that \nis wrong. We never did that with President Bush. We never did that with \nPresident Reagan. We never did that with President Carter. We never did \nthat with President Ford. And we never did that before I was here, to \nmy knowledge, with other Presidents. It is wrong. It gives the wrong \nsignal. It does not mean that we passively agree with everything and \nanything that any President says. Of course not. We wait until he at \nleast gets back to the country to tell him so. We do not undermine him \nor say things here in this country that almost guarantees that he \ncannot be successful in the other country.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, the President of the United States and the \n[[Page S6712]] President of Russia ought to meet on a regular basis \nevery year concerning the nuclear warheads of both sides. We should not \nset as a standard that the only time they can meet is if they come back \nwith some enormous agreement. As a practical matter, that guarantees \nfailure. They have to meet with or without agreement because there is \ntoo much at stake, and we ought to take the lessons of those Congresses \nin the past to at least let the President come home before we tell him \nwe disagree with him. Let us not have foreign leaders when he is \nmeeting with them see a cacophony of criticism coming, often from those \nwho are not really fully informed of what is going on.\n  Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues for allowing me to \nhave this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6709-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have now reached a point where the \nSenate is about to give our small towns the right to say no. I hope the \nHouse will follow suit quickly so that we can send the bill to the \nPresident this year.\n  We have debated this bill extensively. We have heard a lot of \nstatistics. We have heard a lot about policy. So I would like to use a \nsmall example to remind the Senate of why this is so important.\n  Miles City, MT, is a small prairie town of 8,500 people on the \nYellowstone River. Not too long ago, its people faced the prospect of \nwhat was probably a Noah's flood of garbage imports. A garbage \nentrepreneur from Minneapolis came out to look them over. He had a \nrather remarkable plan: Empty coal trains run out of Minneapolis. Each \none of them has about 110 cars--open-roofed cars, 50 feet long, 10 feet \nwide, 11 feet high. He wanted to fill them to the brim with garbage and \nbring all that garbage to Miles City and dump it in Miles City. Think \nof it. A giant garbage snake over a mile long ripening in the sun for \nanywhere up to 5 days on the run out of Minneapolis, shedding rotten \nfood, broken glass, and used diapers into the Yellowstone River at \nevery bend in the track, steaming into town on a hot summer day with as \nmuch trash in one single trip as Miles City throws out in a whole year.\n  It is crazy; it is humiliating; and Miles City should have the right \nto say no. So far, the people of Miles City and their representatives \nin the Montana Legislature have been able to stop these plans. But, \nwith no disrespect to the legislature, it is a weak reed.\n  Every time waste companies have challenged State laws restricting \nout-of-State waste, the State laws have been overturned by the courts. \nSo we cannot rely on State legislatures. We need a Federal law. Without \ncongressional action, according to the Supreme Court, neither the \npeople of Montana nor of any other State can stop these garbage trains.\n  Some interstate movement of garbage makes sense. In Montana, two \ntowns have made arrangements to share landfills with western North \nDakota towns and some trash from Wyoming areas of Yellowstone Park is \ndisposed in Montana. These arrangements save money for the communities \ninvolved and shared regional landfills can be a policy that makes \nsense. But it only makes sense when the communities involved agree to \nit. No place should become an unwilling dumping ground. Nobody should \nhave to take garbage they do not want from another community-- not \nMiles City, not anybody.\n  This bill is a very good start, and I strongly support it. But like \nany other bill, it is not perfect. In particular, I am concerned that \nit would allow waste to be imported until a community gets wise to it \nand has to say no.\n  I believe we should take a good-neighbor approach. Waste from big \ncities should not be allowed into our communities until the people \nagree to accept it. I do not want the people of Miles City to wake up \none morning with a garbage train in the station. I want the garbage \nbroker to come to town first and ask the people's permission before \nusing the community as a trash dump. That is just common courtesy.\n  I hope we can move in that direction as the bill goes ahead, and for \nnow I urge the Senate's support for this critical new law.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senators who have \nworked so very hard over the years in finally developing a balanced \nbill. Senator Coats from Indiana has been a bulldog, and Senators \nLautenberg and Smith, and our new chairman, Senator Chafee, have worked \ntirelessly. Brokering the agreements that brought the bill to this \npoint was not easy, but they met the challenge.\n  In closing, let us stand up for small towns and give them the right \nto protect their people from unwanted trash.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6712-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6712-S6714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nRATIFICATION OF THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION WILL PROMOTE THE ECONOMIC \n                     INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the Law of the Sea Convention entered into \nforce on November 16, 1994, and was transmitted to the Senate for its \nadvice and consent on October 6, 1994 [Treaty Document 103-39]. On this \noccasion I applauded the President's transmittal of this historic \ntreaty and spoke to the ways in which it will protect the economic, \nenvironmental, scientific, and most importantly, the national security \ninterests of the United States (Congressional Record, Vol. 140, No. \n144, p. 14467). On March 14, 1995 I addressed the importance of \nratification of the Convention to the fishery interests of the United \nStates (Congressional Record, Vol. 141, No. 47, p. 3862). Today I would \nlike to address how ratification of the convention will best serve U.S. \neconomic interests.\n  The Third U.N. Conference on the Law of the Sea was initiated as \nearly as 1973 by the United States and the U.S.S.R. to protect \nnavigation rights and freedoms, at a time where coastal States were \nclaiming excessive areas of jurisdiction. Most of the provisions of the \nconvention have long been supported by the United States, and at the \nconclusion of the law of the sea negotiations in 1982, the Reagan \nadministration indicated that it was fully satisfied with, and \nsupported the entire convention, except for the deep seabed mining \npart. The recently negotiated part XI implementation agreement, which \nis also before the Senate [Treaty Document 103-39] addressed all the \nreservations that the United States and other industrialized countries \nhad. I will speak to the deep seabed mining issues in a forthcoming \nstatement.\n  The convention directly promotes United States economic interests in \nmany areas: It provides the U.S. with exclusive rights over marine \nliving resources within our 200 miles exclusive economic zone; \nexclusive rights over mineral, oil and gas resources over a wide \ncontinental shelf that is recognized internationally; the right for our \ncommunication industry to place its cables on the sea floor and the \ncontinental shelves of other countries without cost; a much greater \ncertainty with regard to marine scientific research, and a \ngroundbreaking regime for the protection of the marine environment. \nWith regard to national security, the Department of Defense has \nrepeatedly expressed its strong support for the ratification of the \nconvention because public order of the oceans is best established by a \nuniversally accepted Law of the Sea Treaty that is in the U.S. national \ninterest.\n  The extension by other nations of their national claims were not \nalways limited to matters of resources use but also represented a \npotential threat to our interests as a major maritime nation in the \nfreedom of commercial and military navigation and overflight. The \nUnited States is both a maritime power and a coastal Stage and, as \nsuch, it benefits fully from the perfect balance that the convention \nstrikes. It gives extensive rights to States over the resources located \nwithin their EEZ's, but also recognizes the need to maintain freedom of \nnavigation on the high seas, \n[[Page S6713]] through archipelagic waters thanks to the concept of \ntransit passage and even through the territorial seas of other States \nbased upon the principle of innocent passage.\n  Mr. President, seaborne commerce represents 80 percent of trade among \nnations and is a lifeline for U.S. imports and exports. Ninety-five \npercent of U.S. export and import trade tonnage moves by sea. With \ncontinuing economic liberalization occurring globally, exports are \nlikely to continue to grow as a percentage of our economic output. In \naddition, on some sectors, such as oil, our dependence on imports will \ncontinue to grow. Thus our economic well being--economic growth and \njobs--will increasingly depend on foreign trade. Without the stability \nand uniformity in rules provided by the convention,we would see an \nincrease in the cost of transport and a corresponding reduction of the \neconomic benefit currently realized from an increasingly large part of \nour economy.\n  Consequently, the United States would stand to lose a great deal if \nit was no longer assured of the freedom of navigation: trade would be \nimpaired, ports communities would be impacted and our whole maritime \nindustry could be put in jeopardy. The convention addresses these \nconcerns and failure of the United States to ratify would impose a \ntremendous burden on this industry.\n  Within its EEZ, the United States has exclusive rights over its \nliving marine resources. Foreign fleets fishing in our waters can be \ncontrolled or even excluded, and our regional management councils are \nin a position to adopt the best management plans available for each of \nthe fisheries on which our industries depend. The settlement of \ndisputes provisions of the convention do not apply to the measures \ntaken by the coastal State within its EEZ. Consequently, the United \nStates has discretionary powers for determining the allowable catch, \nits harvesting capacity, the allocation of surpluses to other States \nand the terms and conditions established in its conservation and \nmanagement measures.\n  The provisions of the convention generally reflect current U.S. \npolicy with respect to marine living resources management, conservation \nand exploitation. As such, they incur little new U.S. obligation, \ncommitment, or encumbrance. The U.S. Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act of 1976, commonly referred to as the Magnuson Act, was \ncrafted to parallel closely most of the law of the sea's provisions for \nliving resources. But the convention also ensures that some of the \nstricter measures that the U.S. has adopted, precautionary in nature, \nare also incumbent on other States, in their EEZ's and, more \nimportantly, on the high seas. As such, some measure of increased \nstability in international living marine resources policy can be \nanticipated as a beneficial aspect of U.S. participation of the law of \nthe sea regime.\n  The convention also provides a jurisdictional framework for the \nnegotiation of a new regime for straddling stocks and highly migratory \nfish stocks on the high seas. A conference is currently under way at\n the United Nations to establish such a regime, and I am happy to note \nthat at the last session, held a few weeks ago in New York, the U.S. \ndelegation expressed its satisfaction at the progress already achieved. \nThe negotiators involved are cautiously optimistic that an agreement \nwill be reached by the end of this year, which should help prevent the \nkind of incidents that recently pitched Canada and the European Union \nin the latest case of gunboat diplomacy. The convention will provide \nboth the basis and the framework for this new agreement.\n\n  Representatives of the oil and gas industry served as active advisers \nto the U.S. Government throughout its negotiation of the convention. In \n1973 the National Petroleum Council published a detailed analysis of \nindustry objectives in relation to this treaty, all of which have been \nachieved. The National Petroleum Council determined that it was \nimportant to its industry that the convention reflect the following \nprinciples:\n  Confirmation of coastal State control of the continental shelf and \nits resources to a distance of 200 nautical miles, and beyond to the \nedge of the continental shelf;\n  Establishment of a continental shelf commission to advice States in \ndelimiting their continental shelves in order to promote greater \ncertainty and uniformity regarding resources ownership;\n  A constructive mechanism for the settlement of disputes;\n  And guarantees that the principles of freedom of navigation essential \nto the movement of tankers and other commercial vessels will not be \nundercut by the extension of coastal State jurisdiction.\n  Working in close coordination with our offshore oil and gas industry, \nour negotiators successfully obtained convention provisions that serve \nU.S. interests both in regards to development of energy resources off \nour coasts as well as the interests of our nationals operating abroad. \nThe convention goes further than the Truman Proclamation, in which our \ncountry asserted our rights over oil and gas resources on the \ncontinental shelf, because it specifies the outer limits of the area.\n  This new certainty is very important for our oil and gas industry \nbecause offshore development is enormously capital intensive and \nsecurity of tenure is the key. The convention's standards and \nprocedures avoid uncertainty and disagreement over the maximum seaward \nextent of our jurisdiction. The resulting clarity advances both our \nresource management and commercial interests, as well as our interest \nin stabilizing claims to maritime jurisdiction by other States.\n  At the same time, the convention ensures the protection of the marine \nenvironment in relation to pollution, including the allocation of \nenforcement responsibility between flag, port, and coastal States. It \nhere again strikes the right balance between the need to ensure the \ndevelopment of the oil and gas industries and greater certainty that \nthe environment is adequately protected.\n  The convention also provides significant benefits to the \ncommunication industry. As we know, our country is a proud leader in \nthe technology and communication revolution. In that respect, we depend \nupon ships to carefully lay fiber optic cables on the sea floor. When \nthese cables are broken, U.S. companies and consumers incur huge repair \ncosts. For example, one such cable, connecting the United States and \nJapan, can carry up to 1 million simultaneous telephone calls and is \nvalued at over a billion dollars. As one of our major growth \nindustries, telecommunication firms have ambitious plans for replacing \nexisting coaxial cable on our ocean floor and expanding the existing \ncable network globally.\n  Our telecommunication industry had long suffered from the poor legal \nprotection afforded to cables laid\n on the seabed. The Geneva Convention on the High Seas of 1958 provided \nthat the laying of cables and pipelines is a high seas freedom, and \nthat coastal States may not impede laying or maintenance of cables on \nthe continental shelf. Yet it did not contain clear provisions designed \nto prevent mariners from working dangerously close to cables.\n\n  The Convention on the Law of the Sea incorporates the language and \nprinciples of the 1958 Geneva Convention. Most important, it also goes \nfurther in providing that States are to make it a punishable offense, \nnot only to break a cable, but to engage in conduct likely to result in \nsuch breaking or injury. For the first time, cable owners and \nenforcement authorities are able to act to prevent cable breaks from \noccurring. Consequently, the protection afforded submarine cables is \nsubstantially increased by the convention.\n  Mr. President, the negotiations on this new ``Constitution for the \nOceans'' took more than 9 years, and when the first version, open for \nsignature in 1982, did not meet all our concerns, the Democratic and \nRepublican administrations refused to sign it. It was only after 12 \nmore years of negotiations that all the concerns of the United States \nwere addressed. Significant U.S. economic interests are now protected \nby this convention and we now need to reap the benefits of these long \nyears of negotiations.\n  President Clinton said it best in his transmittal letter to the \nSenate, ``Early adherence by the United States to the Convention and \nthe Agreement is important to maintain a stable legal regime for all \nuses of the sea, which \n[[Page S6714]] cover 70 percent of the surface of the globe. \nMaintenance of such stability is vital to U.S. national security and \neconomic strength.''\n  I strongly agree and look forward to the Senate giving its advice and \nconsent to this historic convention during the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a minute or so, I am going to send an \namendment to the desk. But so as to not waste time, let me take a few \nminutes to talk before it is submitted.\n  First of all, I understand the managers of this bill want to get it \nfinished today, and I gather the leader wants to do it quickly. I want \nto be cooperative. Essentially, I am not going to say a great deal, \nother than, first, I compliment Senator Kempthorne on language in this \nbill that I call commonsense language that relates to small and arid \nlandfills. They are relieved of some very expensive monitoring, and I \ncompliment the Senator for that.\n  Second, I would like to go a little further, because I want to add a \nlittle more common sense. I think common sense, with reference to \nregulatory processes, was part of the last election. You do not hear me \ncome to the floor trying to second-guess what the election was about. \nBut I am convinced that as to people regulated, be it cities, counties, \ntiny communities, small business people, the election was about common \nsense.\n  So I am going to send an amendment to the desk which would allow \nStates to promulgate their own regulations with regard to small \nlandfills, provided that those regulations are sufficient to protect \nhuman health and environment.\n  In my amendment, small landfills are those which receive 20 tons or \nless of municipal waste per day based upon an annual average. Such \nlandfills, as the occupant of the chair, the former Governor of a great \nState would know, serve very small communities. In my State of New \nMexico alone there are 50 such small community landfills. Let me \nsuggest that they are not next door to anything. Those landfills are \nout in a huge, huge open space surrounded, in most instances, by \nhundreds, if not thousands, of acres of unused land, public or private.\n  So we are not talking about these small landfills in my 50 small \ncommunities as, per se, bothering anyone. The question is, are they \nsafe? Do they protect the health and environment? Frankly, I believe \nthat our States are sufficiently different, and that States ought to be \nable to determine the regulations that these small landfill operators, \nsmall communities, must comply with in order to meet the standards of \nour law. I believe States are totally capable of drafting the \nregulations for safe and healthy small landfills in rural America and \nin rural New Mexico.\n  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, these small \nlandfills make up 50 percent of the total number of landfills and \ncontribute only 2 percent in terms of the total cumulative waste--2 \npercent.\n  Now, I realize that some argue that EPA does give States flexibility \nwith regard to landfill management, and I assume the managers might \neven say that they believe it has already been done. I also know, \nhowever, that my State's environment department has not experienced \nthis purported flexibility on EPA's part.\n  Frankly, I believe we ought to make it clear that the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall give this authority to the States to draw up \ntheir own regulations with reference to small community landfills so \nlong as the regulation adequately protects human health and the \nenvironment. That is very simple.\n  I have seen small communities attend meetings for 3 years in New \nMexico. They are looking for a regional landfill, I say to Senator \nSmith, and they are going to meetings for 3 years, trying to figure out \nhow to have this big regional landfill and how this little small town \ncan buy into that. And it is not getting done yet. The little towns are \nworried about it, and they are out telling their 100 citizens, or 300, \nwhat they might have to pay, what they might have to do. And many of \nthem are not even cities, as the occupant of the chair knows. They are \nvillages. They are less than municipalities, many of them.\n  So I believe common sense says as to those small, but very important, \ncommunity landfills that we ought to make it mandatory that they can be \noperated pursuant to State regulations in terms of their adequacy.\n  With that I yield the floor. I hope I have not taken too much time. I \nhope the managers will accept this amendment, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1092\n\n     (Purpose: To revise guidelines and criteria for the Resource \n                     Conservation and Recovery Act)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Smith, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1092.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, line 22, strike ````.''\n       On page 69, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following \n     new provision:\n       ``(5) Further revisions of guidelines and criteria.--Not \n     later than April 9, 1997, the Administrator shall promulgate \n     revisions to the guidelines and criteria promulgated under \n     this subchapter to allow states to promulgate alternate \n     design, operating, landfill gas monitor, financial assurance, \n     and closure requirements for landfills which receive 20 tons \n     or less of municipal solid waste per day based on an annual \n     average, provided that such alternate requirements are \n     sufficient to protect human health and the environment.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to compliment the Senator from \nNew Mexico. I think his amendment is helpful. I intend to support it. \nIt provides additional flexibility for the States to more closely \ntailor their own individual problems. One-size-fits-all Federal \nregulations do not always work. Many times they do not work. I think \nthe Senator has hit on an area here that improves the bill. It would be \nhelpful, certainly, for very small communities in very remote areas, \nwhich we find everywhere in almost every State in the country.\n  One area the Senator did not mention which would have a positive \nimpact on his amendment is many rural areas used to burn their garbage, \na lot of it. Of course, when it is burned and not buried, we do not \nhave the methane buildup. So this would give those communities great \nflexibility because you do not need to monitor where you did not bury \nand you did burn.\n  So I think that is another dimension which is really attractive and, \nfrankly, the main reason I support this amendment.\n  So this Senator will be voting for the amendment, and I congratulate \nthe Senator on his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is attempting \nto address the concerns of small communities, a concern which we all \nshare. Under the bill before us, and according to pursuant regulations, \ngenerally the State of New Mexico can already now do what this \namendment asks EPA in to do. That is quite clear.\n  The Senator from New Mexico thinks there is some ambiguity, and I \nrespect the Senator's view there might be some ambiguity, although we \nchecked with the EPA and checked the regulations and today they can do \nalready what New Mexico wants to do.\n  I am in a bit of an awkward position because the State of Montana, \nfrankly, sent me a letter expressing their reservations about this \namendment. Their reservations generally revolve around the following \npoint; namely, that when the landfill regulations went into effect in \n1991, States acted pursuant to these regulations. And under these \nregulations virtually all authority was \n[[Page S6715]] delegated to the States--43 States have approved plans, \nthe State of Montana is one, the State of New Mexico is another--and \nthey began to plan.\n  One of the goals under each of the State plans is to not only be sure \nsmall, local communities are able to develop their landfills in a \ncommonsense way, but also to consolidate landfills where, in the \nopinion of the State, it makes sense.\n  So the State of Montana is saying this is probably not a great \nproblem, this amendment. However it is changing horses in the middle of \nthe stream. It has the effect of changing regulations after 1991. The \nState of Montana is doing fine with the 1991 regulations, and they are \nalso working with some communities, small communities, to keep their \nlandfills open but consolidating other landfills because you need \nvolume to make landfills economically feasible. This amendment might \nhave the effect of disrupting those States' efforts to try to get some \nconsolidation.\n  It is not a major point. I do not mean to raise it in any serious \ndegree, but it is a consideration I think all States have when they are \nadopting their plans. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on the Domenici amendment there appears to \nbe no further debate. I support the amendment and also want to say the \nviews of the Senator from Montana were certainly worthy of \nconsideration. We are ready to go forward with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator \nKempthorne and Senator Smith be shown as original cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the floor managers. With regard to the \nambiguity as to whether States are currently given adequate flexiblity \nover their regulation of small landfills, I might say to my friend from \nMontana we received a call the day before yesterday from New Mexico's \nenvironmental department asking us to do this. They, and I, are still \nconvinced that this amendment will help States with their small \nlandfill problems. But I very much appreciate clarifying this, and I \nthank my friend for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? All the time has \nbeen yielded back.\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1092) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                           states' authority\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto clarify the meaning of language contained in title I of S. 534, \nregarding the Governors' authority to ban interstate waste shipments. \nSection 4011(a)(4)(A) limits that authority when its exercise would \n``result in a violation of, or would otherwise be inconsistent with, \nthe terms of a host community agreement or a permit issued from the \nState to receive out-or-State municipal solid waste.''\n  During the committee markup on this title, the chairman of the \ncommittee and I engaged in a colloquy in the business meeting of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on March 23, 1995, regarding the \nmeaning of this provision in the case of a host community agreement \nthat contains no tonnage limitation. The chairman agreed with me that \nwhere there is no specified tonnage amount in a host community \nagreement, a Governor's ban of interstate waste shipments to a facility \ncovered by such an agreement would be in violation, or inconsistent \nwith, the terms of the host community agreement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee whether this colloquy still reflects the committee's \nunderstanding about how the 4011(a)(4)(A) limitation should be \ninterpreted when a host community agreement contains no specified \ntonnage amount?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from Idaho is correct. Where a host community \nagreement contains no specified tonnage, a Governor's use of his \nauthority to ban interstate waste shipments would be in violation of, \nor inconsistent with, the terms of the host community agreement.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If a Governor imposes a cap at 1993 tonnage levels on \nwaste received, affecting a facility with a host community agreement \nthat does not have a tonnage limitation, would the cap be considered to \nbe inconsistent with the host community agreement?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct, a cap would be inconsistent with \nsuch an agreement.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Does the provision, as interpreted, apply only \nprospectively, or is it intended to cover host community agreements \nentered into, or permits issued by a State, both before and after \nenactment of section 4011?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The provision applies both retroactively and \nprospectively to those host community agreements that were in effect \nbefore and after the date of enactment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Has anything happened during the course of this floor \ndebate on the bill to change this understanding as to the \ninterpretation of this provision, section 4011(a)(4)(A)?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No. But it is this Senator's view that this colloquy \nconfirming our understanding of section 4011(a)(4)(A), as previously \nset forth in the committee business meeting, does not apply to \namendment 1077, an amendment that was offered by Senator Coats and only \naffects the State of Indiana.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We are once again trying to pass legislation dealing \nwith the export of solid waste from one State to another. This issue \nhas become a concern because some of the large Northeastern States have \nbeen shipping large amounts of garbage to States such as Indiana, \nPennsylvania, and Virginia for disposal. This waste is being exported \nin part because the cost of disposing of this waste in another State, \neven after figuring in shipping costs, is less than the cost of \ndisposal in the home State.\n  We find that high population States such as New Jersey and New York \nhave been running short of landfill capacity. That has been caused by a \nshortage of usable land and more importantly because State and local \ngovernments have not been building new landfill capacity or new \nincinerators. Local citizens in these area have opposed such efforts. \nThis is a classic example of the ``not in my back yard'' or ``NIMBY'' \nprinciple. The citizens in States generating the waste oppose the \nconstruction of new incinerators. With proper environmental controls \nincinerators may be one of the best methods of disposal. Heat energy \ncan be recovered from burning trash and we do not end up with the huge \nvolume that must be buried in a landfill. Without local disposal \noptions the next option becomes shipping trash somewhere else and \ndisposing of it in a neighbors back yard. Now the folks who have been \nreceiving trash from out of State are finding their landfill capacity \nbeing used up by citizens who live hundreds of miles away. They are \nsaying ``not in my backyard either'' and I can understand their \nfrustration.\n  The people of Wyoming do not want trash being brought in from other \nStates in large quantities because others will not make the tough \npolitical decisions needed to expand landfill capacity or to build \nincinerators. Wyoming is the largest coal producing State in the \nNation. We have large open pit coal mines. We had a proposal floating \naround in my State at one time to bring empty coal train cars back into \nthe State loaded with garbage to be dumped in the old open pit mines. \nSomeone thought that was a marvelous idea. The people of Wyoming did \nnot think it was a marvelous idea though. There was a hue and cry \nacross the land when that trial balloon was floated. The opposition to \nthis proposal was vocal and near unanimous. So I am pleased that we are \ngranting Governors authority to limit the importation of waste from out \nof State. I understand the issue with the commerce clause. But we do \nneed to ensure \n[[Page S6716]] that some States will not just take the easy way out and \nsend their problems down the road to someone else. This is not about \ninterstate commerce--this is about States and counties failing to face \nup to their own problems and responsibilities.\n  We see some of the same issue when dealing with low level nuclear \nwaste. We have set up a system of compacts where States join together \nand make group decisions about where to locate low level waste disposal \nsites. Every State generates low level waste and it must be disposed of \nin a thoughtful manner. But the State compact system does not work well \nfor interstate trash because there are just a few States with huge \nvolumes of waste and no place to put it. So we are letting individual \nStates limit or accept out of State waste as they see fit.\n  I trust that this legislation will ensure that the exporting States \nwill take a more constructive approach to this problem in the future. \nCitizens of every State must recognize that as consumers they are \nresponsible for the waste they generate and they must bite the bullet \nand deal with it locally.\n  I trust we can get this bill through conference and to the President \nin a timely fashion. We came very close last year to getting it done \nbut the bill died the last day of the session. Senator Chafee and \nSenator Smith have done yeoman work on this bill and I commend them for \ntheir efforts and I look forward to the passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill, S. 534, as \namended.\n  Let me first thank Senator Chafee, the chairman of the full \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Smith, the chairman \nof the subcommittee, for their assistance to Senator Cohen and me on \nseveral amendments of great importance to the people of Maine. We \noffered three amendments to this bill, and all of them have been \naccepted, for which I am very grateful. The amendments relate to put-\nor-pay contracts, the term ``original facility'' on page 58 of the \nbill, and to the ``substantial construction'' requirement on page 56.\n  I would also like to thank the ranking members of the full committee \nand the subcommittee, Senator Baucus and Senator Lautenberg, for their \ncooperation and acceptance of our amendments.\n  And finally, I would like to thank my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCohen, for working with me on these amendments on behalf of the State \nof Maine.\n  Mr. President, Maine has had a keen interest in the issue of flow \ncontrol since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in C Carbone, \nInc. versus Town of Clarkstown, New York almost 1 year ago today, on \nMay 15, 1994. That ruling, which invalidated municipal solid waste flow \ncontrol ordinances across the country, threatened to unravel the \npainstakingly crafted waste management systems of local governments in \nMaine and many other States. Over 200 municipalities in my State made \nexpensive investments in modern waste-to-energy facilities based on the \nassumption that flow control authority would be available to them. As a \nresult of the Carbone decision, they now fear for their future \nfinancial well-being.\n  S. 534 focuses primarily on municipalities that issued bonds to pay \nfor the construction and operation of designated waste management \nfacilities like waste-to-energy plants. These municipalities relied on \nflow control ordinances to meet their financial obligations and to \nrepay the bonds. The bill contains a grandfather provision that allows \nthese communities to continue using flow control as long as they \nenacted their original flow control ordinances and designated their \nwaste management facilities before May 15, 1994.\n  At first glance, the bill's grandfather provision would appear to \nprotect the communities associated with the Regional Waste Systems \nwaste-to-energy plant in Portland, ME, and the Mid-Maine Waste Action \nCorp. plant in Auburn, ME. These\n municipalities banded together in the 1980's to construct the \nfacilities, and they issued bonds to pay for that construction. Flow \ncontrol ordinances were enacted to guarantee delivery of sufficient \namounts of waste to the facilities. But separate provisions in the bill \nwould unintentionally and unfairly exclude many of these communities, \nand Senator Cohen and I offered amendments to rectify these problems.\n\n  The first problem relates to the bill's use of the term ``original \nfacility'' when it defines the duration of the flow control authority \navailable to qualified political subdivisions in the future. Title II, \nsubsection (b)(4)(C) allows qualified municipalities to continue using \nflow control through the end of the remaining useful life of the \noriginal waste management facilities that had been designated. The \nproblem with the term ``original facility'' is that it could be \ninterpreted to exclude facilities that had been the subject of the \noriginal designation by a group of municipalities, but that had also \nbeen overhauled prior to the Carbone decision.\n  The MMWAC facility in Auburn, ME, is one facility that could have \nbeen unintentionally excluded from S. 534's grandfather provisions by \nthis language. Due to significant deficiencies, the MMWAC plant, which \nhad been constructed in 1988, was temporarily shut down in 1990, and \nsubsequently overhauled. The plant resumed operations in 1992, and it \nhas functioned well since that time. Under the original language of the \nbill, a party could have argued that because of the renovations, MMWAC \ncould not be considered an original facility, and therefore flow \ncontrol would not be available to its member municipalities through the \nplant's remaining useful life.\n  The amendment that I offered with Senator Cohen, and which has been \naccepted, deletes the word ``original,'' and ensures that \nmunicipalities whose designated waste management facilities were in \noperation as of May 15, 1994, will be able to continue using flow \ncontrol through the remaining useful life of the facility.\n  Another problem in S. 534 relates to the `substantial construction'' \nrequirement found in title II, subsection (b)(1)(B). This provision \nStates that qualified municipalities would only be able to use flow \ncontrol if the ordinance or legally binding provision in existence \nbefore Carbone had been enacted or signed before ``substantial \nconstruction'' of the designated facility had been completed. \nUnfortunately, more than 61 municipalities in Maine had enacted flow \ncontrol ordinances or legally binding provisions after the substantial \nconstruction of their designated facilities had been completed.\n  Even more problematic, this provision requires the ``substantial \ncontruction'' to have been completed after the ``effective date'' of \nthe ordinance or provision, rather than the date of enactment. As a \nresult of this language, most of the municipalities in Maine that would \notherwise qualify for S. 534's grandfather provision would be denied \nthe bill's protection. Municipalities in Tennessee, Michigan, and other \nStates would be similarly affected.\n  In recognition of the unintentional problems that this language poses \nfor so many otherwise qualified municipalities, I joined Senators \nCohen, Smith, and Thompson in offering an amendment to strike this \nlanguage. As I noted earlier, that amendment has been accepted by the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  The last amendment that Senator Cohen and I offered relates to put-\nor-pay contracts. Municipalities that signed put-or-pay contracts with \ndesignated facilities prior to Carbone, but that did not enact flow \ncontrol ordinances before that date, do not qualify for flow control \nauthority in S. 534 as written. Under a put-or-pay contract, a \nmunicipality agrees to deliver a specified amount of waste to the \ndesignated waste management facility every month. If the muncipality \ncannot deliver the required amount of waste, then it must pay the \nfacility for the waste that was not delivered.\n  In Maine, 160 communities in the sparsely populated central, eastern, \nand northern parts of the State determined that the put-or-pay approach \nwas the best one for them, and they signed contracts with the Penobscot \nEnergy Recovery Corp. [PERC] in Orrington, a $100 million waste-to-\nenergy plant.\n  These cities and towns signed long-term contracts with PERC in \nresponse to the same policy signals from the Federal and State \ngovernments as communities that actually issued bonds to pay for \nmunicipally-owned facilities. The difference is that the PERC towns \nchose a somewhat different route. They \n[[Page S6717]] decided to sign put-or-pay contracts with a privately \nowned waste-to-energy plant that was created in response to a request \nfor proposals from these communities.\n  The original contracts, which were 30-years long and set a tipping \nfee at $10 a ton, were signed in 1988. Due to financial difficulties \nthat threatened the plant in 1989, however, the contracts were \nrenegotiated.\n  The new contracts increased the tipping fee fourfold, to $42 a ton. \nThe municipalities agreed to sacrifice in the short-term and pay such a \nlarge fee increase for two reasons: to finance essential capital \nimprovements to the plant to help it run more efficiently; and to \nensure a stable tipping fee over the life of the contract.\n  In addition, the new contracts not only required each municipality to \ndeliver a specified amount of waste, but they included a kind of \naggregate put-or-pay provision which allows the PERC facility to void \nthe existing contracts if the total amount of waste from all member \ncommunities declines below a specified minimum tonnage. Finally, the \nnew contracts provided that the cities and towns that signed would \nreceive 50 percent of any distributable profits earned by the plant.\n  After signing the contracts, some of the larger cities in this region \nof Maine like Waterville, and Bangor--cities that have a council form \nof government--enacted flow control ordinances to ensure that they \ncould deliver the minimum amount of waste specified in the contract. \nBut most of the 160 towns are very small, and they rely on town \nmeetings for public decisionmaking. As anyone familiar with the town \nmeeting form of government knows, the meetings are held infrequently, \nand the towns generally do not vote on measures unless they must be \naddressed at that particular time.\n  Consequently, after signing the put-or-pay contracts, a lot of the \nMaine towns deferred passage of flow control ordinances in the hope \nthat they could deliver the required amount of waste without having to \ngo through the process of formally enacting a flow control ordinance. \nBut these towns always believed that, if necessary, they could resort \nto flow control to guarantee delivery of the amount of waste specified \nin their contracts. If they had known that flow control would not be an \noption, most, if not all, of them would not have signed these \ncontracts. The Carbone decision eliminated the flow control option, \nchanging the rules in the middle of the game, and leaving these \ncommunities vulnerable to significant financial hardship if they being \nto have trouble delivering the amount of waste required in their \ncontracts.\n  Without flow control, these towns may not only find it more difficult \nto meet their individual contractual obligations, however. They could \nfail to meet their aggregate tonnage requirements as well, giving \nPERC's owners the right to void all 160 of the contracts and to \ninitiate a new round of negotiations.\n  The current contract provide stable tipping fees and terms for the \nmember municipalities. And it allows them to receive half the profits \ngenerated by the facility--which is only reasonable since the \ncommunities have paid for necessary capital improvements through the \nhigher tipping fees negotiated in 1989 and 1990.\n  These cities and towns cannot afford to lose this arrangement. \nBecause they are dispersed across a large, rural region, and because \nnearly all of the local landfills have had to close due to Federal and \nState mandates, the PERC waste-to-energy plant is the only real waste \ndisposal option for most of the 160 towns. Under a renegotiation, these \ntowns, tucked away in the far northeastern corner of the United States, \nwill find themselves facing what amounts to a waste disposal monopoly.\n  Needless to say, in such a weak negotiating position, the towns could \nsee their waste disposal costs rise sharply, despite having already \ninvested so much money to make the plant viable.\n And they could lose the opportunity to get a return on the substantial \ninvestment that they made in this facility through the higher tipping \nfees negotiated in 1990.\n\n  Mr. President, this elaborate but workable waste disposal system for \ncentral, northern, and eastern Maine was predicated on the \nunderstanding that flow control would be available to all participating \ncommunities. Since flow control was overturned by Carbone, the \ncommunities of the region have been placed in a very vulnerable \nposition, one which they would not have placed themselves in had flow \ncontrol not been an option.\n  In order to avoid substantial financial hardship in the future, put-\nor-pay communities that signed contracts before Carbone must retain the \nauthority to enact flow control ordinances if they need to. The net \neffect of the Carbone decision on these communities is not dramatically \ndifferent from the decision's effect on other communities that actually \nissued bonds for their own facilities. In both cases, a court decision \nleaves the communities dangerously exposed to financial hardship. In \nboth cases, the communities designed new waste systems in response to \nFederal and State policies that encouraged them to do so. And in both \ncases, the systems were predicated on access to flow control. \nConsidering these similarities, the put-or-pay communities do not \ndeserve to be treated differently and excluded from the flow control \ngrandfather in S. 534.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Cohen and I simply clarifies that \nthe term ``legally binding provision'' in title II, subsection (b) of \nthe bill, includes put-or-pay agreements of the kind negotiated in \nMaine. As a result of this clarification, the municipalities that have \ncontracted with the PERC facility will continue to have access to flow \ncontrol, and their intricate but successful waste management system \nwill remain intact. I am very pleased that the managers of the bill \nagreed to accept this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, with these amendments, S. 534 treats all deserving \nmunicipalities equitably, without creating loopholes for other \nmunicipalities that did not rely on flow control before the Carbone \ndecision. The bill as amended restores fairness for local governments \nthat acted and invested in good faith, according to the rules that \nexisted before May 15, 1994,\n  Senators Chafee, Smith, Baucus,  and Lautenberg deserve credit for \ncrafting a reasonable and balanced compromise bill, and I am happy to \nannounce my support for it.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, over the past several years the Senate has \ndiscussed the issue of interstate trash and has passed two interstate \ntrash bills. The provisions contained within those bills were the \nresult of significant efforts and provided authorization for an \nintegrated approach to interstate trash control. The bill before us \ntoday accomplishes similar goals, but also addresses flow control and \nreinstates the ground water monitoring exemption for small landfills.\n  I commend the efforts of Senator Coats who has worked so hard for the \npast several years to pass such a bill. Senator Chafee, Senator Smith, \nand others have all worked extensively on this legislation. I believe \nthe authority granted to Governors provides the right flexibility, with \nlocal community participation being an important part of this \nlegislation. While I remain concerned about long term implications of \nthe flow control provisions, I believe the committee sought to achieve \na balance that provides security for existing flow control authorities \nwhile providing for a competitive marketplace in the future.\n  Public and private authorities need to work together in a free market \nsystem to address waste management concerns. Congress should only work \nto assist these decisions, not impede sound environment practices, by \nproviding flexibility to State and local governments to their waste \nmanagement needs.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of passage of the \nInterstate Transportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act of 1995. \nAlthough I support more stringent restrictions on waste imports, I \nbelieve that this legislation is a necessary tool for Ohio and other \nimporting States for implementation of their solid waste management \nplans.\n  The accumulation of solid waste in municipal landfills is one of the \nmost urgent and fundamental environmental problems facing Federal, \nState, and local officials today. According to the Ohio Environmental \nProtection Agency [OEPA], all the landfills in Ohio \n[[Page S6718]] could be full by the year 2000. For several years, I \nhave supported and voted for measures to stem the tide of interstate \nwaste, and I commend my colleague, Senator Coats, for his perseverance \non this important issue. In 1992, I voted for the Interstate \nTransportation of Municipal Waste Act which passed the Senate on a vote \nof 89-2. In 1993, I was an original cosponsor of legislation to \nrestrict imported waste. I am pleased that the Senate is again acting \nto address this issue, and it is my hope that this year these \nrestrictions will be enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, Ohio currently receives about 1.7 million tons of \nmunicipal solid waste annually from other States. As old landfills are \nclosed or reach capacity, Ohio has reached the point where 28 of the 88 \ncounties have no landfill, and 35 have 5 years or less capacity \nremaining. Clearly, my State cannot implement its environmental \nobjectives and deal with thousands of tons of imported trash at the \nsame time.\n  The increasing flood of waste imports from out-of-State is a serious \nthreat to the health and safety of Ohioans and to the environment in my \nState and the other States that receive vast quantities of imported \nwaste. Ohio has taken strong and effective actions to reduce its waste \ngeneration and to recycle waste. However, my State's efforts are being \noverwhelmed by trash from other States.\n  Mr. President, this bill takes several steps that will reduce the \namount of out-of-State waste coming into Ohio and other States. The \nbill will allow Governors to immediately freeze out-of-State waste at \n1993 levels at facilities that received imported waste in 1993. In \naddition, the bill contains strengthened authority to impose an import \ncontrol, or ratchet, on out-of-State waste. I worked with my colleagues \nfrom the other largest importing States--Michigan, Pennsylvania, and \nIndiana--to make this ratchet more effective by placing tougher \nlimitations on waste exports.\n  This legislation also contains provisions to restore local authority \nto control the flow of municipal solid waste. Many county commissioners \nand solid waste district managers have expressed concerns to me about \nthe need for flow control authority to enforce solid waste planning \ngoals as well as recycling mandates. Although this bill does not \naccommodate each individual situation in Ohio, it is a strong statement \nabout the necessity of local flow control authority, and I will \ncontinue to work through the House-Senate Conference to ensure that \nOhio's specific needs are met.\n  Mr. President, a national solution to the problem of interstate waste \nis long overdue. We must act decisively, and we must act now to avert a \nnational crisis in solid waste disposal. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate is about to pass S. 534, the \nInterstate Transportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act of 1995. I am \npleased that the Senate is moving early in this session toward \nresolving this important matter.\n  This bill is a positive step in the right direction. It has been much \nimproved during the amendment process on the floor, particularly with \nrespect to the provisions on flow control authority. The bill now more \nclearly provides counties in Michigan with the ability to protect \ninvestments they have made in recycling and waste reduction programs, \nor disposal facilities, using their previously existing authority to \ncontrol the out-flow of municipal solid waste and recyclables from \ntheir jurisdiction.\n  Several amendments, in particular, should alleviate local government \nconcerns about the effects of the Supreme Court's Carbone decision. \nThese amendments provide the Grand Traverse, Clinton, and other \nMichigan counties, should be able to continue to use flow control to \ngenerate revenue to fund waste management programs, including \nrecycling. And, Kent County, MI, is more clearly grandfathered to \ncontinue to exercise its flow control authority.\n  The bill also provides States and local governments with the ability \nto control the importation of municipal solid waste into their \njurisdiction. At the request of local governments, Governors would be \nable to half the shipment of waste to disposal facilities in their \nStates that did not receive out-of-State waste in 1993. Governors will \nbe able to freeze shipments of waste to landfills and incinerators at \n1993 levels. And, Governors would also be authorized to gradually limit \nimports of waste from States that did not reduce the amounts of waste \nthey exported.\n  I offered an amendment to clarify that the definition of ``out-of-\nState municipal solid waste'' should include out-of-country waste, \nbecause of Michigan's experience with Canadian waste. I also supported \nanother amendment that authorized the EPA to conduct a study of solid \nwaste management issues associated with increased border movement of \nwaste due to NAFTA.\n  Mr. President, I would prefer that the Senate's's bill include a \nrequirement that halted all waste imports until such time as a host \ncommunity agreement could be negotiated between a local government and \na waste exporter. Such an agreement would specify the quantities out-\nof-State municipal solid waste that would be acceptable to the local \ngovernment for disposal in their jurisdiction.\n  Also, construction and demolition debris has been a problem at \nMichigan disposal facilities for some time. I would hope that the \nconferees could find a way to include this waste in the definition of \nmunicipal solid waste or otherwise provide local governments with some \nmeasure of control over its disposal. I cosponsored Senator DeWine's \namendment to do this, but the amendment was ultimately not offered \nbecause of the threat of a filibuster for States that export large \nquantities of this waste.\n  Michigan is a net importer of municipal solid waste [MSW]. We receive \nMSW from sources all over the country and Canada. For many years, \nMichigan had a model comprehensive solid waste management and planning \nsystem that provided for long-term local waste disposal needs. Starting \nwith the Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill case in 1992 and subsequent \nSupreme Court decisions, this system was thrown into disarray. These \ndecisions jeopardized good-faith investments made by State and local \ngovernments in programs and facilities to manage municipal waste in an \nenvironmentally sound, cost-effective manner.\n  Congress should act quickly and explicitly to put municipal solid \nwaste disposal decisions back into the hands of the people most \ndirectly affected by them and best suited to make them--the taxpayers \nof the municipalities that generate the waste and the States.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support for the passage \nof S. 534, the Interstate Transportation of Solid Waste Act of 1995. \nThis legislation is long overdue. For too long States like Kentucky \nhave been forced to deal with the uncontrollable flows of out-of-State \nwaste. I do not need to remind my colleagues of the garbage barge in \n1987 that sailed up and down the east coast looking for a place to \ndeposit its foul load. It came to symbolize our Nation's burgeoning \nsolid waste problem.\n  Since then, States and communities have attempted to manage their own \nwaste flows, but were helpless to stop the flow of out-of-State waste. \nFor the past 6 years, I have worked to provide States the authority to \ncontrol the waste being sent to their State. Finally, we have a bill \nthat allows States to say no to out-of-State trash.\n  It is particularly troubling to think that there are States and \nlocalities that have either been unwilling or unable to dispose of \ntheir own garbage in a responsible manner, forcing it on States like \nKentucky. The disposal of garbage is truly a local concern and should \nbe handled that way. I do not believe States should be forced to share \nvaluable landfill space with out-of-State waste they do not want.\n  Gone are the days of open dumps and multitudes of cheap landfills. in \n1996, new landfill standards will be implemented mandating liners, \nleachate collection and treatment and ground water monitoring. The EPA \nhas estimated that nearly half of the Nation's 6,000 landfills will be \nclosed. This will obviously force many States to rethink their disposal \nneeds. Therefore, it is critical that States are provided the authority \nto control out-of-State garbage.\n  [[Page S6719]] Last week, I offered an amendment that was accepted to \nprotect the authority of States and regional authorities to develop and \nimplement comprehensive waste reduction strategies in an effort to \nconserve costly landfill space.\n  For the past 6 years, I have worked hard to ensure that States and \nlocalities are given the discretion to manage their own waste and to \nprotect themselves from becoming a dumping ground for those States that \ntake the position of ``out of State, out of mind.'' I refuse to allow \nKentucky to become a garbage colony.\n  In 1990, I introduced S. 2691, a bill to give States the ability to \nfight long-haul dumping by charging higher fees for disposal of waste \ncoming from other States. This bill passed the Senate with 68 votes.\n  During the 102d Congress, I introduced S. 197 to once again provide \nStates the authority to impose a fee differential for out-of-State \nwaste. In 1992, Senator Coats and I joined forced and produced \ncomprehensive legislation to provide States the authority to regulate \nwaste. That same year, the Senate passed an interstate waste bill by an \noverwhelming vote of 88-2. Unfortunately, the bill died in the House.\n  During the 103d Congress, I joined with Senators Coats and Boren in \nintroducing S. 439. Although the Senate didn't act until late in the \nsession, Congress came extremely close to passing an interstate waste \nbill. Again, the House stalled long enough to effectively kill the bill \non the last day of the session.\n  I am encouraged by the quick action taken by the committee under the \nleadership of Senator Smith and the chairman, Senator Chafee to address \nthe problem of interstate waste. I am hopeful that the House will work \nexpeditiously to pass their own interstate waste bill so that we can \nfinally give States the authority to control out-of-State waste and \nprotect their own landfill space.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today, for the third time, the Senate is \nattempting to resolve the many difficult issues that are involved with \nmunicipal solid waste flows. For the third time in the last 6 years, I \nhave worked with my colleague on the Environment Committee, Senator \nLautenberg, to defend our home State of New Jersey and the many ways in \nwhich we handle, recycle, or dispose of the tons of municipal solid \nwaste produced every year.\n  Last Congress, we were within a single vote of resolving this issue. \nAll of the relevant parties hammered out a bill that was as fair as it \ncould be to those States that are called waste exporters and those \nStates that are waste importers--actually, most states are both. It \nresponded to the needs of States that tried to manage solid waste flows \nwithin their boundaries. It tried to balance the contradictory impulses \nto create a more competitive waste market or to impose more \nrestrictions on waste flow.\n  It was not a great bill. But it was a pretty fair bill. And it was as \nleast reasonably consistent. When the bill now before us was first \nreported to the Senate floor, it was a poor facsimile of last year's \neffort. Yet, fortunately, the bill's managers were willing to work with \nSenator Lautenberg, State officials, and myself to guarantee New Jersey \nthe security we needed to move forward on this most contentious issue.\n  Mr. President, this is not the easiest bill to support. Title I of \nthis bill will be restrictive of interstate trade. It will give \nGovernors and citizens the real ability to slow and ultimately stop the \nflow of municipal solid waste from State to State. Fundamentally, these \nactions are anticompetitive. They will result in more expensive waste \ndisposal for many Americans and American businesses.\n  Title II, however, has quite a different purpose. Title II responds \nto recent legal decisions that, if left standing, would greatly reduce \nthe ability of a State to manage waste flows within its own borders. \nBecause of this title II, as modified on the Senate floor, New Jersey \nwill be able to continue its efforts to control and reduce the \nmunicipal waste flow.\n  For years, many States have anticipated the need to manage internally \nwaste flows, exactly because of the pressures for and against exports, \nas well as environmental concerns. In my State, we started very early \nto close inadequate landfills and waste facilities. Early on, we \nrealized that to do the job of waste disposal right was neither cheap \nnor easy. New Jersey responded\n with State law setting up a broad program of environmentally \nprogressive waste facilities.\n\n  These facilities were not and are not cheap. Many counties in my \nState were essentially compelled to build facilities that they \nprobably--or certainly--would not have built otherwise. Now these \ncounties depend on mandated trash flows for revenue. Unfortunately, \nwithout some legislative redress, these revenues are at risk for many \nfacilities. Additionally, the potential financial collapse of \nauthorized waste facilities would certainly make it far less likely--\nperhaps exceedingly unlikely--that my State ever develops a truly \ncomprehensive waste management plan again.\n  I have heard the arguments that, in a world of competition, we do not \nneed to allow States flow-control authority. Trash would end up in the \nlowest cost facilities that meet the appropriate environmental \nrequirements. Consumers and businesses would save money and the \nenvironment could be protected in this world. But title I obliterates \nany hope of truly competitive markets in solid waste. Once title I is \nadopted, trash is transformed from an issue of commerce to an issue of \nbaldfaced politics. In such a world, my State has to have effective \nflow-control authority and that authority is provided in title II of \nthis bill.\n  In the best of all worlds, frankly, we probably would not be passing \nany bill. We would simply recognize that trash represents goods in \ncommerce; that a bag of potato chips which moves freely from State to \nState is not mysteriously transformed once the chips are eaten. But all \nof my experience dealing with the interstate waste issue confirms to me \nthat we are not living in that world now. I have seen political \ncommercials run attacking my State. I have seen demagoguery. And I have \nseen efforts that were far more restrictive of interstate waste flows \npass this body with overwhelming support.\n  Mr. President, I have come to conclude that this bill does protect my \nState and will give us the flexibility we need to resolve these waste \nflow issues. To be truthful, I am not wild about this bill. However, it \ncan be the basis for a resolution of this matter and it is a compromise \nthat I will support, notwithstanding my obvious reservations.\n                   flow control and interstate waste\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I voted against final passage of S. 534, which amends the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act, because the final bill does not adequately \naddress the needs of many California cities and counties which have \nincurred debt to achieve California's ambitious integrated waste \nmanagement requirements.\n  From the beginning, I have had concerns about the impact of this bill \non California. California requires its communities to meet stringent \nrecycling and waste reduction goals--a 25-percent reduction by the \nbeginning of this year and 50 percent by the turn of the century. To \nmeet these goals, California communities must aggressively manage their \nmunicipal solid waste.\n  However, California communities do not use statutory flow control \nauthority, as do communities in many other States. Instead, California \ncommunities rely on contracts with private companies to ensure that \ntheir waste goes to a designated recycling plant or other facility. \nConsequently, the California League of Cities and the California State \nAssociation of Counties asked me to try to amend the bill to ensure \nthat it would not restrict their ability to employ these contractual \nagreements.\n  I worked with my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and with Senator Feinstein in the full Senate, to try to \namend the bill to address the needs of California cities and counties. \nUnfortunately, our efforts failed. I understand that the bill moving \nthrough the House of Representatives may be more favorable to interests \nof California cities and counties. If that is the case, and this bill \nis amended in conference to address some of my concerns, I will \nreconsider my position when the Senate votes on a conference report.\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to offer my support for S. 534, \nas amended, and to discuss the importance of flow control to the State \nof Connecticut.\n  I want to thank the chairman, Senator Chafee, and ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, of the Environment and Public Works Committee for \nmoving forward with this important legislation.\n  The bill, as crafted by Senators Smith and Chafee, was much narrower \nthan the compromise legislation agreed to at the end of the 103d \nCongress. The bill before us today, S. 534, seeks to protect only \npublic debt incurred by municipalities to construct waste disposal \nfacilities. Flow control authority would apply to those communities \nthat were operating or constructing their own disposal facilities, or \nhad contracted for such disposal prior to the May 1994, Carbone \ndecision. There is to be absolutely no prospective flow control--flow \ncontrol authority would cease 30 years after enactment of the \nlegislation.\n  Unfortunately not all Connecticut mnnicipalities and public service \nauthorities were protected by the original language in S. 534. \nTherefore, Senator Lieberman and I offered amendments at the committee \nmarkup and on the floor of this body. The Senate agreed to our \namendments which contained technical changes and small provisions \nintended to address situations unique to Connecticut.\n  It is my belief that State and local governments and State-created \nentities have a vested interest in how solid waste produced within \ntheir borders is transported and disposed. Flow control is the backbone \nof Connecticut's integrated waste management plan. Localities made \nsignificant capital investments to construct waste disposal facilities. \nApproximately 86 percent of Connecticut's waste is disposed of in these \nstate-of-the-art facilities. The State, and ultimately the taxpayers, \nare backing nearly $500 million in bonds that were used to finance the \nconstruction of regional waste disposal centers and recycling transfer \nstations. Profits from the facilities, used to pay off the bonds, were \nto be ensured by flow control authority. Without the ability to direct \nwaste to appropriate facilities, these revenue bonds would be in \njeopardy.\n  Again, I thank the managers of this bill for working with staff to \nunderstand and incorporate the needs of individual States. If this \nlegislation passes today, I am confident that Connecticut \nmunicipalities and localities around the Nation will be able to \nadminister their solid waste management systems in environmentally \nsound and fiscally responsible manners. Therefore, I hope my fellow \nSenators will support this bill and I urge the House of Representatives \nto take up this measure in a timely manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the committee \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might inquire of the Chair as to what \nvote it would be proper to request the yeas and nays on. At what stage \nin what vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On final passage.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the committee substitute is \nagreed to.\n  So the committee substitute was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Indiana will be \nhere in a few minutes and would like to make a statement on the bill. \nThat would be the only business in connection with this legislation.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 2:15 today, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on final passage of S. 534, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the staff on both sides of the aisle for their work on this bill. \nThe Senate has been grappling with these issues for several years. They \nare very contentious. They are very arcane. They are hard to understand \nand in many respects they are totally confusing.\n  But, nonetheless, I believe we came out with a bill that is balanced \non the interstate portion of the bill. The bill in effect is divided \ninto three sections, the first being the interstate part. It is very \ndifficult balancing the views of the importing States, those who have \ngarbage shipped into them, and those who are the exporting States who \ndo not want to be cut from exporting their trash. We tried to wrestle \nwith that. I hope and I believe we have been successful.\n  I hope that the package we put together will resolve many of the \ndifferences that have prevented a solution to the interstate waste.\n  The flow control dilemma has been a separate one. We have had several \nvotes in connection with that, not leaving everybody happy, but \nhopefully this will resolve itself in the months and years to come.\n  I want to thank the staffs of Senator D'Amato and Senator Coats who \nlabored hard to develop the compromise on title I, the interstate \nportion of the bill. I would like to thank Jim McCarthy of the \nCongressional Research Service, George Hall of the EPA, and Tim Trushel \nof the Senate Legislative Counsel's office for their work in \nfacilitating passage.\n  On our side of the aisle, the staff, I want to thank John Grzebian \nand Steve Shimberg, and Jeff Merrifield who worked so hard on this.\n  Senator D'Amato's office, Peter Phipps; Senator Coats' office, Sharon \nSoderstrom and Melissa Murrell.\n  Of course, we are deeply indebted for the splendid work of the \nranking member of the committee, the senior Senator from Montana who \nhas always been helpful and knowledgeable on these difficult issues. I \nwant to pay my respects to him for the splendid work he has done, and \nto Cliff Rothenstein and Tom Sliter and Scott Slesinger also.\n  So, Mr. President, we are winding up a long and contentious period. \nIf all goes well, this will be approved at 2:15 this afternoon.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be brief because we have been so \nlong on this bill--it has been 6 years--so that we do not prolong the \nagony and get it passed, and very much hope the House also passes a \nsimilar bill so that we can deal with this in this Congress finally.\n  To follow up on the points of the Senator from Rhode Island, the \nchairman of the committee, John Chafee, it is the staff around here \nthat does the work. All Senators know that. They work very, very hard, \nlong, long hours, know the details, know the substance, and are not \nfrankly sufficiently complimented I think for all the work they do.\n  Mr. President, I think that the most noble human endeavor is service. \nIt is service to friends, it is service to families, to the church, to \nthe community, to the State, and the Nation--service.\n  Some of us who spend our lives in public service get all of the \nattention and the thanks for a lot of what we do. I must say we get a \nlot of a contention and criticism for what we allegedly do and do not \ndo as well. But it is the staff, it is the people around here who do \nthe work who get no attention, who do not get thanked who really \ndeserve it for all the work they do. And to again give the names \nbecause these are the people who did most of the work on \n[[Page S6721]] the majority side, John Grzebian, who was very, very \ndiligent, very helpful. We had many late-night meetings back in the \ncloakrooms trying to work this out, and John is particularly helpful. \nSteve Shimberg, staff director for the committee, we have known Steve \nfor many years, those of us who have been on the committee. He is very \nknowledgeable, very gracious, very helpful; and also Jeff Merrifield \nwho is a bit new to this but nevertheless very, very competent, very \ndiligent, as everyone on the staff working.\n  On the minority side, Tom Sliter, who is the minority staff director, \nvery gracious, and knowledgeable. I have worked with Tom for many \nyears. I know no one who is more competent. Tom is very effective and \nvery knowledgeable and substantive; that is, not acrimonious, not \nbitter, and not nasty but very, very solid and very gracious.\n  The same with Cliff Rothenstein. I frankly do not know anybody not \nonly on Capitol Hill but in this town who knows more about this subject \nthan Cliff. That is because Cliff has been working on it for 6 years. \nCliff is bound to know this subject very well, and does, and frankly \nwhen we got to a lot of the parts of the amendments we were trying to \nwork out, it was Cliff who was able to provide the solution or the idea \nof bringing it together.\n  Mike Evans, who is the minority chief counsel, has also worked on \nthis issue for several years. Mike's knowledge of the issue and his \nadvice was very helpful throughout the course of this bill.\n  Scott Slesinger works for Senator Lautenberg, the ranking minority \nmember of the relevant subcommittee. Scott, too, has added a lot of \nadvice all along every stage of this bill.\n  We compliment the Senators here on the floor very often. I will not \nat this point again compliment all the Senators. I have done so many \ntimes on this bill. But I want to at this time highlight the staff, and \nthose are the key staff that have worked very diligently. I think all \nshould pause for a moment and reflect to thank them for all of their \neffort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the senior Senator from New Hampshire is \nthe chairman of the subcommittee that dealt with this legislation and \nhas done wonderful service here on the floor despite demands on his \ntime with very difficult matters that came up simultaneously.\n  So I want to pay tribute to Senator Smith for his very, very helpful \nsupport on this entire legislation, for his knowledge of it, and the \nfact that he moved along so swiftly in the subcommittee. We would not \nbe here but for Senator Smith taking charge of that subcommittee and \ndetermining that this bill was going to come to the floor in due order \nand in short order.\n  So we are very grateful to Senator Smith for what he has done and \nappreciate it and look forward to continued working with Senator Smith \nas his committee has a series of other bills that will be coming, \nincluding the great big Superfund bill, which is a real challenge.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Chafee first \nof all for his very fine remarks. It has been a delight to work with \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee on this \nlegislation. He several months ago said we want to try to get the flow \ncontrol bill and the interstate waste matter brought up. And I took it \nseriously. We were able to do that. It has been a delight to work with \nhim and his staff as we brought this bill here to the floor for a \nclose, hopefully. It has been a long haul.\n  We tried to accommodate a number of Senators. I had a long list of \nsome 27 or 28 Senators I think that we were able to accommodate that \nhad specific concerns. I know there were some who we were not able to \naccommodate because we felt it would essentially violate the spirit and \nintent of the legislation that we brought forth.\n  But particularly the majority staff, John Grzebian, Steve Shimberg, \nand Jeff Merrifield who were really right there doing a lot of work, \nmost of the work I guess behind the scenes to work on these amendments \nand get the compromise language agreed to. Certainly, Cliff Rothenstein \nand Tom Sliter and Scott Slesinger on the minority staff; and Peter \nPhipps of Senator D'Amato's staff and Melissa Murrell of Senator Coats' \nstaff were all particularly helpful, and as were others.\n  I think we ended up with essentially a good bill. There are some \nthings I would not have put in it, and Senator Chafee would not have \nput in it. There are certain things we wish we had put in. But the \nbottom line is that this legislation is a compromise. We tried to \naccommodate those who brought up concerns that you had not thought of \nor maybe did not realize that needed to be put in there. And they come \nup with these ideas, and we tried to work them out.\n  I think it deals essentially with the issue of flow control. It takes \ncare of those people who made investments, who stood a grave risk had \nwe not passed this legislation. It does grandfather the flow control \nauthority so that it is not a permanent anticompetitive piece of \nlegislation. It does grandfather it. So we went to great lengths to \nreach a compromise.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Chafee for his leadership. It has \nreally been a pleasure to work with him in the position of subcommittee \nchairman.\n He has been 100 percent cooperative every step of the way personally \nand at the staff level. As the Senator said, last week I had a number \nof conflicts. I had three separate subcommittees to chair at the same \ntime, two on Superfund, which is another priority item in our \nsubcommittee, and Senator Chafee was willing to step in and participate \nalmost fulltime on the floor debate and the management of the bill, for \nwhich I am very grateful.\n\n  Mr. President, at this point, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Yogi Berra said, ``It ain't over 'til it's \nover.'' We are not through yet, but it is awful close; we are in the \nbottom of the ninth on this issue I have been working on for 6 years.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] and Senator Baucus, who is not in the \nChamber right now, and others who have joined with me in this effort \nthat started out as a lonely vigil and now has turned into nearly a \nconsensus effort.\n  Senator D'Amato was willing to sit down at the table and negotiate a \nvery difficult problem for his State with those of us who had difficult \nproblems for our States. I believe we reached, last Friday afternoon, a \nsatisfactory resolution of that concern.\n  We have every reason to believe there will be favorable treatment of \nthis in the House. It has been stopped there before. I believe we are \nas close to success there as we have ever been and we can resolve \nwhatever differences may exist between the House and Senate and put \nthis on the President's desk, and finally give the States and \ncommunities we represent a basis for dealing with their own \nenvironmental problems but not having to solve everybody else's \nenvironmental problems--the ability to say that is all we can take, or \nwe cannot take anymore, or you are going to have to find a way to \ndispose of that in your own State. We are doing our share; you do your \nshare.\n  We are that far away, and I am optimistic we are going to finally \ncomplete this effort. A lot of people have participated in it, and I \nthank them for their efforts. I am looking forward to finally putting \nthis issue to rest and then moving on to other concerns before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n                   harrisburg, pa, flow control issue\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a brief discussion \nwith the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the sponsor of \nthis legislation. The city of Harrisburg owns and operates a \nmunicipally financed resource recovery facility that was originally \nconstructed in 1972. Harrisburg has issued $40 million in outstanding \nrevenue bonds and has had a flow control ordinance in place for several \nyears. The facility is required, however, to undergo a substantial \nretrofit pursuant to the Clean Air Act, which will necessitate the \nissuance of an additional $150 million in bonds and a \n[[Page S6722]] new waste stream from nearby counties which have not \npreviously flow controlled to the Harrisburg facility. It would appear \nto me that the existence of outstanding bonds and the unfunded mandate \non Harrisburg under the Clean Air Act would justify the extension of \nflow control authority to the counties that would want to send waste to \nthe Harrisburg facility in the future.\n  Would the distinguished chairman be willing to look closely at this \nissue as this legislation goes forward?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as the Senator from Pennsylvania knows, \nthis legislation provides flow control authority which is predicated on \nmeeting debt obligations. The issuance of new debt at a facility that \nhas operated since 1972 and that would require expanded flow control \nauthority is not one that the committee has had the opportunity to \nexamine in any detail at this time. I would be glad to work with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania as the bill goes forward and to determine \nwhether the Harrisburg facility is or should be covered by this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I share all of the views set forth by the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana. We have all been struggling with \nthis issue for many years, nobody as hard as he has and with more \ntenacity. As he indicated, we are this close. I think he said we are in \nthe bottom of the ninth. I hope we complete the game, and I know we \nwill. Then, of course, comes what the House does and then the \nconference with the House. But all of that we will pursue with great \nvigor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6714-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the Chair calling up the \npending legislation. I have been in conversations with the Senator from \nWashington with regard to concerns that she has expressed, and I am \ntold that there are some amendments that the Senator from Washington is \ninterested in pursuing. I have not had an opportunity to review the \namendments, but I intend to take this opportunity as soon as possible \nand have our staffs attempt to resolve the concerns of the Senator from \nWashington, and it would be my intent to attempt to do this with \ndispatch.\n  Mr. President, currently the staffs are pursuing an evaluation. I \nwant to ask the Chair the pending business before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 395 and the \nSenator's amendment No. 1078.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not on the amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I wonder if the Senator from \nWashington would entertain, for a moment, an opportunity, so that we \nmay try to accommodate the amendments, and if there is any objection if \nI suggest the absence of a quorum, and after we have had a chance to \ntalk, ask that the quorum call be rescinded so that we may move into \nthe bill.\n  I think there is one other Senator who is coming who wishes to speak \nwith regard to an amendment that is pending on our side.

So rather than to take up this time \nthat could be used in negotiating the amendments of the Senator from \nWashington, if there is no objection, I will suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will not object. I want it to be noted that there are \nseveral Senators I need to check with, but we can go ahead and go into \na quorum call and discuss this.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to continue my discussion of \nthe crime bill that I intend to introduce tomorrow. As I pointed out, \nthere are really two basic issues that we always need to address when \nwe look at a crime bill. First, what is the proper role of the Federal \nGovernment in fighting crime in this country, understanding that over \n95 percent of all criminal prosecutions really are done at the local \nlevel? The second question we always have to ask is, what really works? \nWhat matters? What makes a difference?\n  Last Wednesday I discussed these issues with specific reference to \ncrime-fighting technology. We have an outstanding technology base in \nthis country, a technology base that will do a great deal to help us \ncatch criminals. But, quite frankly and candidly, we must expand this \nbase. Technology does in fact matter, but we need the Federal \nGovernment to be more proactive in getting the States on line with this \ntechnology.\n  Having a terrific national criminal record system or huge DNA data \nbase, or an automated fingerprint data base in Washington, DC, is good. \nBut it will not really do the job if the police officer in Henry \nCounty, Trumbull County, Greene County, Clark County, OH, cannot tap \ninto it; if they cannot get into it, put their own information in and \nget the information back out.\n  What my legislation does is drive the money down to the local \ncommunity to help build this database system from the ground up. My \nlegislation would help bring these local police departments on line. It \nwould help them contribute to and benefit from this emerging nationwide \ncrimefighting database.\n  Mr. President, on Thursday I discussed another aspect of my bill. I \ndiscussed what we have to do to get armed career criminals off our \nstreets, to get them locked up and away from our children and our \nfamilies. I talked about a program called Project Trigger Lock that \ntargeted criminals who use guns and targeted them in the Federal court \nand prosecuted them in Federal court. My legislation would bring back \n``Project Trigger Lock.'' Further, it would toughen the laws against \ncriminals who use guns.\n  We have to lock up armed career criminals. If we are trying to figure \nout what works and what does not work, if we are trying to figure out \nwhat is important and what is not important, what priority the U.S. \nAttorney General should place on different types of crime, what the \npriority of U.S. attorneys scattered throughout this country should be, \nI cannot think of anything more important than going after repeat \nviolent offenders who use a gun in the commission of a felony.\n  Mr. President, the third area of the bill that I talked about on \nFriday has to do with crime victims. Quite frankly, in too many ways \nour criminal justice system has treated criminals like they are victims \nand victims like they are criminals. My legislation contains a number \nof provisions that would make the system more receptive to the rights \nand claims of crime victims.\n  Another area: On Monday I turned to another provision of my bill. I \ntalked about what we had to do to get more police officers on the \nstreets, and particularly how we had to get police officers into crime-\ninfested areas and how we had to target the finite tax dollars that we \nhave so that we spend these dollars and that we put these police \nofficers in areas where it would make the most difference, because the \nsimple fact is when you put police officers on the street, when they \nare deployed correctly, crime does go down. My legislation reflects \nthis plain fact. My bill over a 5-year period of time will spend $5 \nbillion on putting police officers on the street. But my bill would \ntarget the money to America's most crime-threatened communities.\n  Further, my bill, unlike the bill that passed last year, unlike the \nPresident's bill, would pay the full cost of these police officers and \nwould pay them for not just 3 years, not just put them out for 3 years, \nbut would do that for 5 years. We target the money to the highest crime \nareas in the country, the 250 highest crime areas. We pay for the \npolice officers to go in there, and we fully pay for them not at 75 \npercent but at 100 percent a year and we do it for 5 years instead of 3 \nyears.\n  Today I would like to discuss another part of my crime bill. That is \nthe need for local flexibility in fighting crime. As I pointed out, 90 \nto 95 percent of the criminal prosecutions in this country do not take \nplace at the Federal level. Rather, they take place at the State and \nlocal level, in communities throughout this country. Crime is a local \ncommunity problem. The late Speaker of the House, ``Tip'' O'Neill, used \nto say that all politics is local. It would not be too much of an \nexaggeration to say the same is true of crime, that all crime is \nlocal--just about anyway. I think that any Federal crime legislation to \nbe truly effective has to take this basic fact into account.\n  Mr. President, this is a historic year. From welfare to health care \nAmerica today is conducting a fundamental debate on the issue of which \nlevel of government is in fact best suited to undertake which \nresponsibilities. What we are frankly seeing this year is a thorough \nreexamination of the meaning of federalism. This historic debate offers \na terrific opportunity to rethink the role of Government and to make \nour Government work better.\n  Mr. President, I think in this historic year when we are having this \nfundamental debate about federalism, the proper role of the Federal \nGovernment, the State government and the local government, I think it \nwould be a terrible shame if we did not extend this debate to the issue \nof crime. We will never have a better opportunity than the present to \nfocus our national attention on crime as a fundamentally local problem; \nthat is, the problem to be dealt with at the local level by local \nauthorities. For this reason my crime legislation applies to the \nprinciple of local flexibility, local flexibility to this fight against \ncrime.\n  Yesterday I talked a little bit about my objections to some of the \nprovisions of the President's plan to put police officers on the \nstreet. Specifically, I pointed out that the President's scattershot \napproach sent police officers, frankly, in too many directions. Some of \nthese places did not need extra police nearly as much as some other \ncommunities. The result of this approach, the Clinton approach, is to \nput too few police officers where the police are the most needed. That \nis why in my crime legislation we spend $5 billion for police but we \ntarget that money. Whereas the Clinton administration spends $8.8 \nbillion, we spend only $5 billion, but we target that money and we \ntarget it into the 250 communities in this country where the crime rate \nis the highest. We do it on a statistical basis, and we do it on a \nbasis that I think makes eminent common sense.\n  I am convinced that by targeting the extra police only to extremely \nhigh-crime areas, we can accomplish a lot more with this $5 billion \nover 5 years than the President can accomplish with his $8.8 billion \nover a 5-year period.\n  The $3.8 billion that is left over, along with an additional $3.2 \nbillion in uncommitted funds provided under my legislation, would be \nturned over to local communities to use as they see fit. Let me stop at \nthis point and make a point that I hope is clear. But I want to make \nsure that my colleagues understand this. Our bill does not spend any \nmore money. Our bill takes the basic $30 billion that we have been \ndebating now for the last several years and spends it differently, \nspends it, I think, more appropriately.\n  The dollar figures I am talking about to my colleagues in the Senate \ntoday I indicate is not one penny more than was indicated under any of \nthe other bills that have been introduced or indicated under the \nPresident's plan.\n  Let me talk a little bit about this discretionary money that we are \ntalking about.\n  I have worked at the local level. I have worked as an assistant \ncounty prosecutor. I have worked as the elected county prosecutor of my \nhome county, worked at the Federal level as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I have been in the \nOhio State Senate, and I have served as Lieutenant Governor. I have had \noccasion to compare the efficiency and effectiveness at all levels of \ngovernment. To be honest, a sheriff or county prosecutor, chief of \npolice, or county commissioner in my home county or your home county, \nMr. President, and many of the home counties of our other colleagues \nknow a lot more about how crime money should be \n[[Page S6730]] spent than does the President of the United States, the \nU.S. Attorney General or this Senator or this body.\n  Under the proposal contained in my crime legislation, local \ngovernment officials will get Federal money, and what they do with it \nwill be up to them. They will be able to spend that money based on \nlocal needs, local concerns, local priorities.\n  Yesterday, I discussed my proposal to pay for extra police officers \nin the highest crime areas in America. The 250 most crime-infested \nareas in America are eligible under my bill for police funding. Other \nareas, areas that are not included in the list of the 250 worst crime \nareas, may decide, if they wish, that they need extra police officers. \nIf that is the case, they may choose to spend the dollars they get from \nthis $7 billion local flexibility fund to pay for the extra police \nofficers. My bill allows them that flexibility. They can use the money \nto hire, train, and employ these police officers, maybe put them out on \nthe street. They can use it to pay overtime for police officers that \nthey already have which, frankly, may, depending on the jurisdiction \nand the economics involved, be the best use of the funds. Or they can \nuse it to buy extra technology that is already covered in this bill. \nThey can use it to beef up school security, either by deploying extra \npolice or adding measures like metal detectors. They can use it to \nestablish and run crime-prevention programs like Neighborhood Watch and \ncitizen patrol programs and programs to combat domestic violence and \njuvenile crime. They can use it to establish early intervention and \nprevention programs for juveniles to reduce or eliminate crime.\n  There was a vigorous debate last year about the issue of crime \nprevention. One thing I have learned in my years in local law \nenforcement is that even more than most programs crime prevention \nprograms really have to be grown locally to be effective.\n  When you travel Ohio, as I have done, or Minnesota, or Wisconsin, and \nyou look at crime prevention programs, I suspect in other States you \nfind what I have found in Ohio, and that is the quality of those \nprograms depends upon the local people. It depends on who is running \nthe program, the dedication of that particular individual. This is not \nsomething that Washington can take a cookie cutter and duplicate, \nreplicate across the country. They have to be grown locally.\n  It is clear that we have to go after those also who have chosen a \nlife of crime. We have to apprehend them. We have to convict them. But \nwe also have to reach out to the young people who are at risk in this \ncountry. We have to reach out to them before--before--they embark on a \nlife of crime.\n  The best ideas on how to do this are not in Washington, DC, \nsurprisingly. It is not with Government bureaucrats, in Washington. It \nis, rather, locally. Government bureaucrats in Washington, Mr. \nPresident, do not know the kids in Greene County, OH. Do you know who \ndoes? The people in Greene County--Jerry Irwin, our county sheriff; the \ncounty prosecuting attorney, Bill Schenck. I could go on and on. That \nis why I wish to empower people such as County Sheriff Jerry Irwin, or \nCounty Prosecutor Bill Schenck through this proposal.\n  Mr. President, to mandate a prevention program from Washington, DC, \nis absurd. Let us trust the people on the ground, the local law \nenforcers who know the young people in their communities.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me say there is a basic insight \nthat the American people imparted to all of us last November. I hope we \nheard the message. That message was fairly simple and basic, that \nGovernment is best which is closest to the people.\n  I have worked to incorporate this basic principle into the \nlegislation that I will be introducing tomorrow.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6728-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6730-S6735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ALASKA POWER ADMINISTRATION ASSET SALE AND TERMINATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1078 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Breaux be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, gross oil imports to the United States \ntoday are over 50 percent, and they are scheduled to be over 60 percent \nby the year 2010. For this reason, in February of this year, President \nClinton announced the President's finding that the Nation's growing \nreliance on imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products \nthreaten the Nation's security because of the increased vulnerability \nof U.S. oil supply disruptions.\n  This being the problem, how do we solve it at a time of growing \ndeficits, at a time of money shortage, at a time when we have no money \nto apply to any kind of energy technology? The way we do it, Mr. \nPresident, is by this amendment, which provides that with respect to \nexisting leases in the Gulf of Mexico in over 200 meters of water, \nwhere the development expenses are very, very great and where wells \notherwise would not be drilled unless given some incentive, there be a \ndiscretionary incentive given for both existing leases and new leases \naccording to a carefully worked out formula, worked out with the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  Mr. President, when I say it is discretionary, it is discretionary in \nthat the Secretary of the Interior must analyze all of these leases and \nwith respect to any lease which he determines would otherwise be \ndrilled, there is no incentive given, there is no royalty holiday \ngiven. It is only with respect to those leases that would not otherwise \nbe drilled, either existing or future leases, that this amendment would \nprovide that incentive.\n  So it is for this reason this amendment has been scored as costing \nzero by CBO and, as a matter of fact, it would make money for the \nAmerican taxpayer and for the budget because, obviously, if you have a \nlease that otherwise would not be drilled, which is drilled, it has \npositive economic impact from the salaries paid to the workers by the \noil company to drill the well, and if oil is found, then there is \nroyalty to be paid even with the royalty holiday because the royalty \nholiday is not complete.\n  This was worked out last year with the Secretary of the Interior. It \ntook us a long time to work out the formulas, the amount of the \nincentive. The Secretary of the Interior wanted the amount of the \nincentive to be sufficient but not too much. That took a lot of \nnegotiating. The whole matter of negotiation took a long period of \ntime. After working it out last year, we introduced the legislation \nthis year as S. 158. The administration has testified on this in an \naffirmative way. It is a piece of legislation that is going to make \nmoney for the Treasury and is going to help our energy balance.\n  According to the Department of the Interior, it should bring on at \nleast two new fields with approximately 150 million barrels of oil \nequivalent from existing leases and it significantly improves the \neconomics of 10 to 12 possible and probable fields.\n  As we know, Mr. President, the OCS in the Gulf of Mexico has been the \nUnited States' most promising region for new discoveries. In 1993, 98 \npercent of new crude oilfields and 76 percent of new gasfields \ndiscovered in the United States were in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a way to offset that $46 billion of \ndeficits which is attributable to net energy imports. It is 40 percent \nof the total U.S. merchandise deficit of $116 billion. For this reason, \nMr. President, I think this is an excellent amendment backed by the \nadministration which will help our energy balance a great deal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Bob \nArmstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior, backing this amendment \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 1995.\n     Hon. J. Bennett Johnston,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Energy and Natural \n         Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnston: I understand that you intend to \n     offer an amendment to S. 395 to provide Outer Continental \n     Shelf (OCS) deep water royalty relief to leases in the \n     Central and Western Gulf of Mexico.\n       We support this amendment and believe it is consistent with \n     the Administration's objectives with respect to OCS \n     exploration and development in the Gulf of Mexico. The deep \n     water areas of the Gulf contain some of the most promising \n     exploration targets in the United States, but industry \n     confronts substantial economic and technological challenges \n     in bringing them into production. The responsible and orderly \n     development of these resources is truly in the national \n     interest.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that it has \n     no objection to the presentation of these views from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Armstrong,\n                                              Assistant Secretary.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum having been suggested, \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the measure before \nus lifting the 22-year-old export restrictions on domestic crude oil \nproduced on Alaska's North Slope.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from Alaska, the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, for bringing this legislation \nto the floor.\n  Clearly, the time has come for Congress to repeal an outdated law \nthat no longer serves its intended purpose. When the export \nrestrictions on Alaskan crude oil were originally enacted, many people \nbelieved that the legislation would enhance our long-term energy \nsecurity.\n  Today, however, we know that restricting the export of Alaskan crude \noil has actually weakened our Nation by undermining our initiative to \nexplore and develop new energy resources, and that is keeping us ever \nmore dependent on foreign oil imports.\n  Some 77 percent of this country's energy consumption is supplied by \nthe oil and gas industry. Yet, the Department of Energy projects that \ncrude oil production will continue to decline over the next decade.\n  Last year, our Nation imported over half our domestic oil \nrequirements. By the year 2005, the United States will be nearly 70 \npercent dependent on imported oil--not because consumption is on the \nrise, but because domestic production continues to fall.\n  Every drop of oil that is produced by somebody else eventually adds \nup to a flood of lost U.S. jobs. Three hundred thousand oil-related \njobs have been lost in the United States since 1985--the steepest \ndecline in U.S. history.\n  With oil production decreasing by 2\\1/4\\ million barrels every day, \nmore job losses are surely ahead.\n  Of course, decreased production means that revenues are down as \nwell--down, in fact, by more than $50 billion in the last decade.\n  To add insult to injury, the U.S. petroleum industry has been forced \nto look beyond American borders when it comes to oil production. We are \nnow putting 65 percent of our exploration and production dollars into \nprojects overseas, at a loss to the U.S. economy of $16 billion \nannually.\n  Within the last few years, Congress has consistently rejected \nregulatory policies that foolishly try to constrain and control the \nnatural flow of goods and services. But there is much more that \nCongress can do to improve the climate for domestic oil production.\n  To that end, S. 395 seeks to replace a failed energy policy with a \nnew strategy based on free-market principles.\n  I am not suggesting that S. 395 will solve this Nation's oil \nproduction woes, but it will have a positive, lasting impact.\n  Nearly every region of the country stands to benefit from lifting the \nexport restrictions on Alaskan crude oil. First and foremost, it would \nmean new U.S. jobs.\n  The Department of Energy estimates that if the export restrictions on \nAlaskan crude oil are lifted, as many as 16,000 new jobs would be \ncreated immediately. Up to 25,000 new jobs are likely by the end of the \ndecade.\n  Lifting the export restrictions would increase oil production in \nCalifornia and Alaska by as much as 110,000 barrels per day.\n  This legislation will stimulate oil exploration and development in \nthe oilfields of Alaska and California, boosting the economy along the \nwest coast and enhancing our national long-term energy strategy.\n  The bill also ensures that the U.S. merchant marine will maintain its \ntraditional role of transporting Alaskan crude oil. This provision \nprotects existing U.S. jobs by requiring that exported Alaskan crude \noil be carried on American-crewed, American-flag tankers.\n  Mr. President, history has taught us that free markets--not \nprotectionism--make our Nation more secure. With this lesson in mind, I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to join in the bipartisan effort to lift \nthe ban on exports of Alaskan crude oil.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, unless there is no other Senator \nseeking recognition, I ask that the amendment pending by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1101) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Alaska, on his good work on the Alaska \nNorth Slope bill, the underlying bill. It is an excellent bill. It will \ngive much more efficiency to our production and sale of crude oil, and \nI think that it is definitely in the interest of the United States. Now \nthat we have the merchant marine problem worked out, I think it will be \nin the interest of everyone and I urge all Senators to adopt the \nunderlying bill.\n  I thank the Senator for his help on this deep water bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my good \nfriend from Louisiana, and he is my friend. I have had the pleasure of \nworking with him for some 15 years. A significant portion of that time \nhe was chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I work \nwith him now, and I think the amendment just adopted is going to be a \nsignificant stimulus to ensuring that we are less dependent on imported \noil by enhancing exploration and, hopefully, development in areas that \notherwise might prove economically prohibitive to the industry.\n  With the amendment just adopted by the Senator from Louisiana, why, \nwe have enhanced our industry's ability to be competitive in the \nproduction of oil. I commend him for his effort and that of his staff, \nand I am very pleased that we adopted the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1102\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may, I have an amendment which I \nsend to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1102.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I offer an amendment to S 395, the Alaska \nPower Administration Sale Act, to make explicit that this legislation \ndoes not in any way set a precedent for the sale of any other Federal \npower marketing administrations.\n  My colleague from Alaska makes a strong case for the sale of the \nAlaska Power Administration. As I understand the situation, the \ncongressional delegation and the Governor of Alaska support the sale, \nand the proposal enjoys broad public support.\n  As we concentrate on this bill and this sale, it is important to keep \nin mind that there is a broader discussion taking place in the Congress \nover the sale of other Federal power administrations, and the case for \nthose sales is by no means as clear cut as that in Alaska.\n  While the privatization of the Alaska PMA is supported in Alaska, \nthere is strong public opposition to the sale of PMA's located in the \nlower 48 States. Moreover, the sale of the Alaska PMA involves a \nrelatively small sum of money, only $83 million. This is a manageable \ninvestment for the State. It ensures that Alaskans will be able to \npurchase the PMA assets and that the purchase will not cause rates to \nrise substantially.\n  This is not the case with the proposed sale of PMA's in the lower 48 \nStates, where far greater sums of money are at stake and where the sale \nlikely would lead to significant rate increases.\n  In South Dakota, the Western Area Power Administration, which markets \npower from the main stem dams along the Missouri River, has ensured a \nconsistent and affordable supply of electricity. The program is being \nrun on a sound financial basis, as it recovers all expenses relating to \nits annual operation and the initial construction expenses, with \ninterest. Under the current system, rates are set at the lowest \npossible cost, consistent with sound business principles, and to ensure \nthat these financial objectives are met.\n  If this power marketing administration is sold, then it is likely \nthat rates will increase substantially. The assets could well be \npurchased by out-of-State financial interests, who likely will set \nrates to maximize profit. Electric rates for existing Federal power \ncustomers will rise as a result. South Dakotans and customers from \nother States served by power marketing administrations will pay higher \ncosts for power, and much of that money will go to the out-of-State \nfinancial interests who bankroll these purchases.\n  The Western Area Power Administration is a program that works. It \nprovides affordable power to states like South Dakota, and it does so \nwithout any subsidy. The Federal Government gets a return on its \ninvestment. In short, it is an unquestioned success. It is a program \nthat we should hold up as an example of how the Federal Government can \nwork for the people and the national economy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the sale of the Alaska Power \nAdministration should not be viewed as a precedent for the sale of \nother power administrations. The situation in Alaska is unique. It is \nvery different from the situation with the other PMA's, such as \nWestern, where there is strong public opposition to the sale and where \nSenators are on record opposing the sale. I have received well over \n10,000 letters in opposition to this sale and 2 in favor of it. And \nwhile sheer numbers can never determine the merits of any program, I am \ninclined to believe that people generally know what is best for \nthemselves.\n  Given the almost certain rate increases that would accompany the sale \nof the Western Area Power Administration and others in the lower 48, \nand the potential for out-of-State ownership and, thus, the export of \nState resources, it is not a policy that I can support. I hope that my \ncolleagues will be willing to recognize that the Alaska sale does not \nset any sort of precedent for the sale of other power marketing \nadministrations, and support my amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON.

In the next several days, we will have on the floor of \nthe Senate a budget resolution. This has been much discussed and \nanticipated because we have had substantial debate here in the Senate \nand in the House of Representatives and in the country as a whole about \nthe need to deal with this country's fiscal policy problems. No one, I \nthink, will deny that our country is off track in fiscal policy. We \nspend more than we have. We routinely charge the balance to our \nchildren and grandchildren, and we must change priorities and fiscal \npolicy to balance the Federal budget.\n  The Federal budget that we deal with and the budget resolution coming \nfrom the Budget Committee is a critically important document. A hundred \nyears from now, if historians then could look back 100 years and view \nus, they could evaluate our priorities by what we spent our money on. \nThey can look at our Federal Government and look at a $1.5 trillion \nbudget and determine what was important to us by how we spent our \nmoney. What did we hold dear? What did we treasure, value, and what \nkind of investments did we think were important? That is what they will \nbe able to tell about us. That is what is in the budget resolution. It \nrepresents our priorities, values, and what we think is important for \nour country.\n  A lot of people view this as just politics, just the same old thing, \nRepublican versus Democrat. It is not that at all. It is much, much \nmore important than that. It is the establishment of a set of \nprinciples by which we determine how we spend the public's money. I \nrecall a story in the Washington Post, I believe, once where two people \nwere quoted from Congress and one said--speaking of some other \ndispute--``This has degenerated into an argument about principle.'' I \nthought to myself, I hope so. That is what this is all about. That is \nwhat the budget resolution ought to be about.\n  I was at the White House this morning with a group of my colleagues \nmeeting with President Clinton. He made a point about the budget \nresolution that I happen to agree with, which is that his problem with \nthe budget resolution that is going to come to the floor of the Senate \nis that the priorities in that budget resolution do not match the needs \nof the country.\n  The budget resolution from the House of Representatives calls for a \nvery large tax cut. The benefits of the tax cut will largely go to the \nwealthiest in America. If you take a look at who benefits from the tax \nbreak by the House of Representatives, the numbers show up like this: \nIf you are a family earning under $30,000 a year, you get a tax break \nof $120. If you are a family over $200,000 a year in income, you get a \ntax break of around $11,000. It is pretty clear who benefits from that \nkind of policy.\n  In order to pay for a very expensive tax break, the bulk of which \ngoes to the most affluent Americans, what do you have to cut in \nspending to do it? Well, they cut Medicare. They make it more expensive \nfor someone to go to college. They cut education. They make it more \ndifficult for the elderly to get health care. They cut earned-income \ntax benefits for the working poor, which means higher taxes for the \nworking poor.\n  I happen to think those priorities do not match what our needs are. \nMy own view is we ought not at this point have \n[[Page S6736]] a tax cut. I would like to see everybody pay far less \ntaxes than they now pay. But the first obligation, I think, for our \ncountry, is to balance the Federal budget.\n  I give credit to the budget resolution and those who framed it \nbecause it includes some recommendations that I support. There is a \npart of the budget recommendation that comes to the floor of the Senate \nthat I think makes eminent good sense, and I support it. I say \ncongratulations. I sent 800 billion dollars' worth of spending cut \nrecommendations to the Budget Committee. I believe in this. We need to \nbalance the Federal budget, and not with smoke and mirrors but with \nreal spending cuts in real ways. And, yes, also in some areas with real \nrevenue. But I believe in some areas you must balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  I do not believe, however, with the kind of deficits we have, the way \nto start balancing the Federal budget is to first start talking about \ntax cuts. I understand the Senate budget resolution does not \nspecifically prescribe tax cuts, but I also understand it specifically \nsets aside $170 billion to be sent to the Finance Committee \nspecifically for cuts. So this budget resolution, like the House \nresolution, will accomplish the same things. It will cut taxes. And it \nwill pay for that tax cut by providing less for Medicare, by cutting \nthe earned-income tax credit and therefore raising taxes on low-income \nworking families, and by slashing spending for education, especially \nthe education money available to help young people go to college.\n  I think those priorities are wrong. There must be spending cuts in a \nwhole range of areas. Will we have to limit the rate of growth in \nMedicare and Medicaid? Yes, I believe we will, in the context of \nreforming the whole health care system in some reasonable way, without \nlimiting people's choice. But the fact is you cannot continue seeing \nskyrocketing health care costs across the country without some \ninterruption. The Federal budget cannot stand that, the family budget \ncannot stand that, nor can a business budget stand that. So we must \nrespond to that problem.\n  But we ought not, under any condition, decide to take several \nhundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicare and Medicaid, both of \nthem, and do that at least in part so we can give a very big tax cut to \nsome of the wealthiest Americans. That makes no sense at all.\n  I would say, on the issue of education, to the extent anything is \nimportant in our country, we must decide as a country to invest so our \nkids can go to school. Investing in education for our children is an \ninvestment in this country's future. It yields dividends of enormous \nimportance to the future of this country.\n  So, when we decide we are going to make a trade here and we are going \nto do classic trickle-down economics, and that means we do not have \nenough money to provide for financial help for somebody going to \ncollege, that is a trade that in my judgment injures our country's \neconomy.\n  Some people say this is new, that this is reform. This is not new. \nThere is nothing new about this. This is 15 years old and it is 50 \nyears old. It is: run an election, win, write a contract, give tax \nbreaks for the rich, and have the rest of us pay for it somehow, with \nless medical care and less help for their kids to go to school and \nhigher taxes for the working poor. That is not new. That is Herbert \nHoover.\n  We have been through this before. Trickle-down economics--that is the \nnotion where you pour the money in at the top somehow and, if you make \nthe top generous enough or affluent enough, somehow it all trickles \ndown and rains on everybody else in America.\n  Another Member who served in this body many, many years ago described \ntrickle-down economics. He said it is the concept that if you feed the \nhorse some hay, sometime down the road the sparrows will have something \nto eat--trickle-down economics. That is not a notion that I think makes \nsense for the economy engine of this country. Our goal is not to make \nthe comfortable more comfortable. It is to provide working people in \nthis country with something to make a good living: jobs, opportunities, \neducation. That is what drives the American economy. It is not trickle-\ndown economics, it is percolate-up economics.\n  I think what we ought to do when we bring this budget resolution to \nthe floor of the Senate, I would like to see on a bipartisan basis for \nall of us to do something very serious and very quickly. I would like \nto see us decide immediately. The first test is to decide to balance \nthe budget using spending cuts. Do that. Debate about the priorities, \nwhat are the values here, what are the things we hold dear, what should \nwe invest in, what about our children--go through that debate. Set the \ntax cuts aside and say, let us not do tax cuts. Let us just deep six \nall that stuff. And then let us do honest, real spending cuts and \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  Then, when we have done that, we have rolled up our sleeves and done \nthe honest work, then we can turn to the other issues. But I think it \nis wrong to engage in a political exercise and balance the budget by \nbeginning with a very large tax cut for the affluent, which means we \nmust take more from Medicare for the elderly, more from programs to \nhelp those who want to go to school, more from the working poor by \nscaling back the earned-income tax credit, and so on. That, in my \njudgment, is not the right way for this country to proceed.\n  I noted some columnists have said the Democrats in the Chamber do not \nseem to be as ambitious in dealing with the budget deficit as some \nothers. I do not think we need to take great instruction from \ncolumnists about our interest in deficit reduction. Those of us who, in \n1993, voted on the floor of this Senate for $500 billion of deficit \nreduction, some of which was very unpopular, all of which was pretty \ncontroversial--those of us who were willing to do that without any help \nat all, not even one accidental vote from the other side of the aisle, \ndo not need lectures about deficit reduction.\n  I believe in deficit reduction. I am glad I voted for it in 1993. I \nwill vote for much more deficit reduction offered by either side of the \naisle. If it is responsible cutting of what represents excesses in the \nFederal budget, count me in and sign me up because I am willing to do \nit.\n  Also, as I said, I sent $800 billion in deficit reduction \nrecommendations to the Budget Committee, mostly spending cuts, some \nadditional revenue increases, saying: Here is a jump start on how we \nought to do this.\n  Much of that is in the mark that will come to the floor by Senator \nDomenici. And I will support those portions of the budget. But I do \nbelieve the broader priorities, especially the priorities these days in \nsomething called the Contract With America, are priorities that I do \nnot share. We must, it seems to me, understand how to provide decent \nhealth care for our elderly in this country and we must understand and \nmake a commitment to provide health care for those in America who are \ndisadvantaged and who are poor.\n  That is not something we ought to debate much about. Yes, we can \ndebate about how to control costs or how to bring down the rate of \nincrease. But we ought not trade off the health care needs of the \nelderly or the health care needs of the American poor with tax cuts for \nthe most affluent Americans. That is not a trade that makes sense for \nthis country.\n  I hope in the coming week, when we resolve this budget issue, that we \nwill on a bipartisan basis decide, in a serious, sober, thoughtful, \nreflective way, to honestly cut Federal spending where we are spending \ntoo much; honestly put this country back on track toward a balanced \nbudget, and do that first by spending cuts and not talk about, again, \ntax cuts for the most affluent Americans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1106 to Murkowski amendment No. 1104.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment add the following new \n     section:\n       Title VI of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-380; \n     104 Stat. 554) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 6005. TOWING VESSEL REQUIRED.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--In addition to the requirements for \n     response plans for vessels established in section 311(j) of \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by this \n     Act, a response plan for a vessel operating within the \n     boundaries of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary or \n     the Strait of Juan de Fuca shall provide for a towing vessel \n     to be able to provide assistance to such vessel within six \n     hours of a request for assistance. The towing vessel shall be \n     capable of--\n       ``(1) towing the vessel to which the response plan applies;\n       ``(2) initial firefighting and oilspill response efforts; \n     and\n       ``(3) coordinating with other vessels and responsible \n     authorities to coordinate oilspill response, firefighting, \n     and marine salvage efforts.\n       ``(b) Effective Date.--The Secretary of Transportation \n     shall promulgate a final rule to implement this section by \n     September 1, 1995.''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  We have been working this afternoon with the Senators from Alaska on \nthe bill before us. One of our main concerns has been the environmental \nissues in Puget Sound in my home State of Washington.\n  I appreciate all of the work that the Senator from Alaska has done in \nhelping to meet one of our concerns on this bill.\n  The amendment in front of us requires that a vessel be in Puget Sound \nthat is paid for by the industry so we can assure that the vessels \nwhich come into Puget Sound are escorted through the Straits of Juan de \nFuca.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska and his committee for all their work \non this and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I respond, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate the cooperative effort as evidenced by \nthe Senator from Washington. It has been a pleasure working with her \nstaff, and we do accept the amendment.\n  I think it is a tribute to the Senator from the State of Washington \nfor addressing obviously an environmental need, and I feel confident \nthat her contribution by this amendment will ensure a greater degree of \nsafety associated with the movement of oil from my State to her \nrefinery. As a consequence, we are pleased to accept the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. One of my main concerns is vessel safety. I want to make \ncertain all vessels transporting oil through the strait of Juan de Fuca \nor Olympic Coast Marine Sanctuary are properly escorted.\n  Under my amendment, the Oil Pollution Control Act would be modified \nto require response plans for such vessels to provide emergency \nresponse within at least 6 hours. This would be a vast improvement over \nthe status quo.\n  However, my State including the Office of Marine Safety, conservation \ngroups, and the Makah Indian nation, would like to see an even shorter \nresponse time.\n  It is my understanding that under this amendment, the State and other \nparties would have the flexibility to negotiate an arrangement that \nwould ensure a response time of 4 hours or fewer. Specifically, the \nState would be able to arrange stationing an emergency response tug \nboat at Neah Bay.\n  If the State, tribe, and tanker operators agree, the Coast Guard \nunder my amendment, should modify the response plans accordingly.\n  Does the chairman concur in this interpretation?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, I have reviewed the language and agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there others who want to be heard? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 1106.\n  So the amendment (No. 1106) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1107 to Amendment No. 1104\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1107 to amendment No. 1104.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, of the pending amendment, insert after line 12 \n     the following:\n       (C) shall consider after consultation with the Attorney \n     General and Secretary of Commerce whether anticompetitive \n     activity by a person exporting crude oil under authority of \n     this subsection is likely to cause sustained material crude \n     oil supply shortages or sustained crude oil prices \n     significantly above world market levels for independent \n     refiners that would cause sustained material adverse \n     employment effects in the United States.\n       On page 3, insert after line 12 after the word \n     ``implementation;'': ``including any licensing requirements \n     and conditions,''.\n       On page 4, line 2, after ``President'' insert ``who may \n     take''.\n       On page 4, line 3, after ``modification'' insert ``or \n     revocation''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as you know, I have very strong \nreservations about the exports of Alaskan North Slope oil. I am \nconcerned about jobs in my State, the price of oil to consumers across \nour Nation, and the environmental impact lifting this ban may produce. \nHowever, after a day of negotiation, I am pleased to offer several \namendments en bloc to the bill that the chairman has agreed to. These \nen bloc amendments will ensure a full review of export impacts.\n  They mandate that the President, along with the Attorney General and \nthe Department of Commerce, will review environmental impacts, consumer \nprice increases, and anticompetitive practices that would hurt \nindependent refineries and shipyards who employ thousands in my region.\n  I believe we have come far to negotiate this agreement that now \nspeaks first for the people of the Pacific Northwest before the \nexporting of this oil begins.\n  I thank the chairman for his work in moving toward this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding we had an \nopportunity to review the amendment and, indeed, the amendment is in \norder, as suggested by the Senator from Washington. I am well aware of \nher concern for her own economic activity associated with Alaskan oil.\n  We find the amendment satisfactory. I am pleased to accept it at this \ntime. It does meet with satisfaction the terms and conditions which we \nagreed to mutually.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there other Senators who want to be heard \nconcerning this amendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment No. 1107 to amendment No. 1104.\n  The amendment (No. 1107) was agreed to.\n  [[Page S6738]] Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the \nvote by which the amendment was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the chairman of the \ncommittee who has worked diligently with me this afternoon. One of my \nmain concerns regarding this proposal to export ANS relates to the \nsupply of Alaskan crude to the Tosco refinery at Ferndale. As I \nunderstand it, Tosco has 3 years and 8 months remaining on a supply \nagreement with BP. I want assurance that BP will honor the contract.\n  I have asked BP to provide me with that assurance, and today I \nreceived a letter from the president of BP Oil Shipping Co., Steve \nBenz, promising to honor the existing contract with Tosco's refinery at \nFerndale.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the letter \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             BP America, Inc.,\n\n                                                     May 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: I am sensitive to your concerns \n     regarding the supply agreement for Alaska North Slope crude \n     oil that BP has with the TOSCO refinery at Ferndale, \n     Washington. While we are under a strict confidentiality \n     agreement with respect to the details of that arrangement, I \n     want to give you my assurance that BP will fully honor the \n     terms and conditions of our current supply agreement with \n     TOSCO for the Ferndale, Washington refinery. This guarantees \n     that BP will be a supplier of Alaska North Slope crude oil to \n     the TOSCO Ferndale refinery through 1998.\n       I hope that this letter satisfies any remaining concerns \n     you may have regarding security of supply to TOSCO.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Steve Benz,\n                                       President, BP Oil Shipping.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I also ask the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy Committee if he can also assure me that he will do \neverything in his power to assure that adequate supplies of Alaskan \nNorth Slope crude continue to be made available to the Tosco refinery.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I fully understand and appreciate the \nconcern of the Senator from Washington in this area. I can assure you, \nbased on information that I have from British Petroleum and others, a \nsecurity of supply to the Northwest independent refiners will not be a \nproblem.\n  I can assure the Senator, if there are supply disruptions, I will \npersonally work with her and other Members of the Washington delegation \nto address that problem to the very best of my ability.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska and would \njust like to notify him that I am working on one more statement for the \nRecord, a few more words to say, and I appreciate all of the work and \nhelp he has been in working toward this agreement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I withhold that request.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I just would like to express my \ngratitude to the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski]. I suppose Mr. Murkowski's diligence and perseverance \nagain proves the old adage that, if you stick with a problem or an \nissue, you get it resolved with patience and forbearance. Certainly, \nthe Senator has demonstrated both those qualities.\n  I also want to express my appreciation for the staff. I do not know \nan issue I have dealt with for a period of time that has not \nincorporated more staff than this one, and they have all been most \ncooperative. Staff of committee, personal office staff people, staff of \nmy colleagues, like the Senator from Washington State--all of the \nstaff--really, again, demonstrated the superiority of our professional \nstaff people, both in the offices and on the committees as well.\n  So I would like to thank the Senator for his cooperation in resolving \none of my problems.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I can respond to my friend from Oregon, his \nparticular reference to patience is one that I have had an opportunity \nto observe, as the Senator from Oregon has displayed this as chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, both as ranking member and as \nchairman, for as long as I have been in this body, some 15 years.\n And he has accumulated an extraordinary ability in negotiation, using \nboth his historical interest of this body as well as a history of many \nof our Presidents and his patience and oftentimes humor in moving along \nproblems and has led me to view him with admiration and respect. I am \nparticularly appreciative of his comments today.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not sure. If I may make an inquiry of the Senator \nfrom Washington, is it her intention to make another statement, or are \nwe perhaps waiting? I did not hear the last reference.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am waiting to clear a colloquy with the Senator's \nstaff which should be done very shortly.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I might ask my \ncolleague from Alaska a question. I am assuming that my colleague \nintends to go to a vote very soon, is that correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Minnesota is correct. I anticipate \nthat we are within 3 or 4 minutes of calling for third reading and a \nrecorded vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder whether I could simply take a minute to speak \nbefore the final vote. My colleague has the floor, so I will wait until \nhe is done.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sure it will be more than a minute or a couple of \nminutes, but I will yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just had a chance to come to the \nfloor now, and I had anticipated that this debate could go on through \ntomorrow. I understand that, for a variety of different reasons, we are \ngoing to go to final vote. I want to go on record--and I will have a \nmore complete statement--I believe that this piece of legislation is \nmisguided. I am in profound disagreement with it. The particular \nproblem I have is that now when we open up the exporting of the oil, I \nthink we get back to all of the ways in which we as a nation still are \nso dependent upon the imports.\n  I worry about this being essentially the first step toward opening up \noil drilling at Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I want to simply say \nthat I think, for some very basic important environmental reasons, this \npiece of legislation is mistaken. I also have some concerns about the \nbasic environmental safety reasons that have to do with the shipping of \nthis oil across the sea. I do not know exactly what protection has been \nbuilt in. All in all, I think it is a mistake. I have to say to you, \nMr. President, that my only regret is that I was at another meeting \ndealing with a piece of legislation that I have been working on for a \ncouple of years.\n  So I was not able to be here during some of the debate and now do not \nreally have time to lay out on the floor a full statement or be \ninvolved in a full debate.\n  I hope colleagues will vote against this. I hope colleagues will vote \nagainst this, I think, on very solid environmental grounds. I hope \ncolleagues will vote against this understanding that I think this is \nthe first step toward opening up ANWR. We went through this last \nCongress. It was very contentious. Maybe it was the Congress before, \nwhen I first came to the Senate. We actually had a filibuster against \noil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I think that is \nwhere we are heading with this legislation. I think it is part of the \neffort to get there.\n  I have appreciation for my colleague from Alaska on a personal level. \nI know him to be incredibly hard working, and he cares fiercely about \nhis State. I am in profound disagreement with this. I hope we will have \nsome strong ``no'' votes.\n  [[Page S6739]] I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intent to advise Senators that \nwe will be calling for a rollcall vote and I will be calling for third \nreading.\n  I do want to thank my friend from the State of Washington, Senator \nMurray, for her concern over the aspects affecting her State with \nregard to the oil that comes down from my State of Alaska.\n  I also want to thank Senator Boxer for her questions and concerns \nreflected in colloquy.\n  I want to thank Senator Johnston for his contribution and concern, \nand particularly with reference to the inclusion of deep water royalty, \nwhich is part of this legislation which I think will benefit--certainly \nlessening our dependence on imported oil and, as a consequence, relieve \nsubstantially our balance of payments by developing our own domestic \nsupply which is so well supported in the Gulf of Mexico and the State \nof Louisiana and others.\n  I want to thank my senior colleague, Senator Stevens. Certainly \nSenator Hatfield has been most cooperative. I am also very sensitive to \nhis concern regarding his shipyard, as well as concern for the \nshipyards in California. Senator Feinstein has also been very \ncooperative.\n  I want to recognize the staff of Senator Johnston, our own staff, \nGregg Renkes, Andrew Lundquist, Gary Ellsworth, Jim Beirne, Howard \nUseem, Mike Poling, and others.\n  If I may just for a moment reflect on a little bit of how I look at \nthis legislation as an Alaskan and how my constituents view it. I think \nit marks another advance in the policies made by the Federal Government \nto Alaska when we accepted the statehood compact back in 1959. Thirty-\nsix years is a long time to wait for the action that is about to be \ntaken today. I think it is certainly historically significant for \nAlaska, if this legislation carries.\n  We have done some significant things. We have authorized the sale of \nthe Alaska Power Administration, the Eklutna hydro project, to the \nmunicipality of Anchorage. That has been 40 years in the making. It was \nfirst proposed back in 1955. It has been 7 years under the stewardship \nof Senator Stevens and myself.\n  The sale of the Snettisham hydro project to the State of Alaska, and \nthe Alaska Power Administration, of course, is also authorized. That \nhas been pending for over 10 years.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that my colleagues will join me in \nacting favorably on this bill. This action by the Senate, if it is \npassed, will ultimately--assuming that it receives the support of the \nHouse of Representatives--allow the export of Alaskan oil.\n  That is the oil that is excess currently on the west coast, oil that \nused to go through the Panama Canal. This action, I might add, is \nsupported by the administration and the President and with the \nconcurrence of this body and, hopefully, the House of Representatives.\n  Now for the very first time Alaskan oil can look forward to a truly \nfree market. While perhaps we Alaskans are still not free from the \nFederal yoke, some of the load has been lifted from the shoulders of \nAlaska, if this passes today. And perhaps this marks a favorable sign \nfor the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1104) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering an \namendment to provide for payment of a certain sum generated by this \nlegislation to retire the debt incurred by citizens of the city of \nPortland, OR, to construct the largest floating drydock on the west \ncoast. On June 1, 1977, Portland taxpayers financed this investment \nbased in large part on the commitment made to keep this Alaska North \nSlope oil supply for domestic production oil only.\n  Alaska oil exploration and the congressional commitment to the \nprohibition on the export of Alaska North Slope crude oil were crucial \nfactors in Portland's decision to expand its publicly owned maritime \nrepair facility. No drydocks on the west coast were large enough to \nhandle the new Alaskan oil ships either in operation or under \nconstruction. Unless this infrastructure deficiency was remedied, these \nvessels would have had to be repaired in foreign shipyards and U.S. \njobs would be lost.\n  Based on the Federal assurances that this oil was for domestic use \nonly and the encouragement by Federal officials for Portland to step \nforward to be part of the infrastructure team required to move this oil \nfrom the end of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline to the lower 48 States, \nlocal voters in Portland strongly supported the expansion of the \nPortland Ship Repair Yard to accommodate these very large oil carrying \nvessels and approved an $84 million bond measure. My amendment is \nintended to cover the remaining debt on these bonds dated June 1, 1977. \nAfter that significant investment, drydock 4 came on line, adding a \nvital component to the stated Federal plan for transporting Alaskan oil \nto domestic markets. Maintaining a ban on the export of this production \nwas an integral part of the agreement to allow construction of the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline, and the citizens of Portland reasonably relied \nupon this agreement.\n  The bill before us today would reverse this 22-year-old commitment, \nto the great detriment of the substantial investments made by the \ncitizens of Portland, OR. If the damaging impact on the Portland Ship \nRepair Yard of exporting Trans-Alaska Pipeline crude oil has not been \nmade perfectly clear prior to this date, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues an article that appeared in the Portland Oregonian today. \nThe article reports that Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp. has withdrawn its \napplication to become the sole contractor at the Portland Ship Repair \nYard. One of the primary concerns noted by Todd in announcing its \nwithdrawal was congressional action to lift the Alaska oil export ban.\n  My amendment seeks to address the unfairness lifting the ban would \nimpose on the taxpayers of Portland. The amendment would require \npayments from the naval petroleum reserve, a primary beneficiary of the \nincreased revenues that the Congressional Budget Office has judged will \nresult from this legislation. These payments would go toward retirement \nof the $50 million in outstanding bonded debt incurred by the taxpayers \nof Portland to acquire Drydock No. 4. An additional $10 million would \nbe made available to improve the shipyard to meet the new market \nconditions in the maritime industry that will result from the repeal of \nthis longstanding export ban. This amendment is consistent with the \npay-as-you-go budget rules currently in force.\n  This amendment will keep faith with the citizens of Portland in the \nface of this dramatic change in Federal policy to allow Alaskan oil \nexports. I thank the Senator from Alaska and others for working with me \nto achieve this important provision to ensure the taxpayers of Portland \nare treated fairly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, section 202 of the substitute amendment to \nS. 395 requires that the administration complete an appropriate \nenvironmental review. Does this mean that National Environmental Policy \nAct applies to this bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, the Senator is correct, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act applies to this bill.\n  Section 202 specifically provides that the President ``shall conduct \nand complete an appropriate environmental review'' of a proposed \nexportation.\n  In addition he must consider appropriate measures to mitigate any \npotential adverse effect on the environment.\n  There is no waiver, repeal, or change to any Federal, State, or local \nenvironmental law, rule or regulation, including the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act.\n  There will be full compliance with all applicable environmental \nprovisions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another matter that concerns me is the recent audit that \nwas performed on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline by BLM that raised several \nconcerns about maintenance and management of the pipeline. Is the \nBureau \n[[Page S6740]] of Land Management in fact following through with the \noversight of the repairs and maintenance of TAPS, and as the chairman \nof the Energy Committee, how are you going to ensure that in fact the \nconcerns raised by the audit in fact will be addressed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In testimony before the House Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations, on November 10, 1993, the chief \nexecutives representing the three major owners of the Trans-Alaska \nPipeline System [TAPS] made specific commitments to correct the \nproblems identified by the various audits of TAPS. Richard Olver of BP \nstated, ``. . . I commit to you today to provide the necessary human \nresources that are required to put this plan into place and to back \nthat up about [sic] all the necessary and appropriate financial \nresources.''\n  The owners have reaffirmed this commitment on several occasions as \ndemonstrated by the number of human and financial resources they have \nprovided Alyeska since those hearings. This commitment was reaffirmed \nagain in meetings that Alyeska and the TAPS owners had just last week \nwith various Congressmen, Senators, and staff in Washington, DC.\n  The most apparent example of the owners commitment is the $220 \nmillion spent to address audit findings in 1994 with an additional $80 \nmillion being spent on findings this year. By the end of 1995, 85 to 90 \npercent of the audit findings will have been addressed. By December \n1996 all but a handful of the audit items will have been resolved. \nPlans are in hand to address outstanding long lead issues, that is, \ncontrol systems.\n  Furthermore BLM has continual and direct oversight of TAPS as a \ncondition of the right-of-way. BLM can in fact shut down the pipeline \nif the oil producers violate the right-of-way agreement and the \nviolations lead to an imminent threat to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n  When these repairs required by the audit are completed at the end of \n1996, as the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources, I will \nrequest the BLM to report to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee on whether the concerns raised by the audit have been \nadequately addressed.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senators from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski and Senator Stevens for their work on the \nbill before us today. This bill accomplishes many good things for the \nState of Alaska and is the culmination of years of work by both these \nSenators on behalf of their State.\n  I am pleased, after many years of effort, that the restrictions on \nthe export of Alaskan oil will be lifted. This legislation represents \nan effort to provide for new economic opportunities for the people of \nAlaska. New job opportunities will be created which will strengthen \nindustries directly and indirectly related to this effort. The bill \nalso provides for a review of the effects of the export sales on \nconsumers, shippers, and other domestic oil producers. We need to \ncontinue to look for ways to assist domestic oil production and ensure \nthat our efforts for production only work to benefit consumers and our \ndomestic industry. This legislation shows what can be accomplished when \nindividuals share common goals for a strong economy.\n  In addition, authorization for the sale of the Alaskan Power \nAdministration is a positive step forward for the State of Alaska. I \nbelieve there is a need to continue to look at opportunities such as \nthis, where Federal Government activities can be better accomplished on \nthe State, local, or private level.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues in support of this \nlegislation.\nKeeping the alaskan north slope oil ban--U.S. dependence on foreign oil\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \nSenator from Alaska and I honor his diligent effort to do what is in \nthe best interests of his great State. I must however oppose this \nlegislation for the reason that I strongly believe it would be damaging \nto U.S. jobs and national security.\n  Mr. President, 22 years ago, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization \nAct of 1973 permitted the building of a pipeline from the North Slope \nproducing fields to Valdez. Through an amendment to section 28 of the \nMineral Leasing Act, Congress placed strict prohibitions on exporting \nAlaskan oil due to the energy crisis.\n  Mr. President, in 1992, this Senate addressed the Nation's \noverreliance on foreign oil and voted 94 to 4 to reduce the Nation's \ndependence on imported oil in order to provide for the energy security \nof the Nation. I have always opposed lifting the Alaskan North Slope \n[ANS] oil export ban for two reasons: national energy security and the \nprotection of U.S. jobs.\n  Mr. President, since 1973 when the ban was enacted, things have \ndramatically changed--for the worse in terms of our energy dependence. \nThe situation is not improving. During the early 1970's, the United \nStates imported roughly 22 percent of our total oil consumption; in \n1990, imported oil accounted for 39 percent of our oil consumption. The \nEnergy Information Administration recently forecasted that our \ndependence on foreign oil will exceed 60 percent by the year 2010. \nConsidering the current situation in the Middle East, specifically with \nregard to Iran, our Nation's continued reliance on foreign oil \nconstitutes a serious threat to our national security as well as to our \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, Iran is a terrorist regime intent on aggression in the \ngulf. In the past few weeks reports have surfaced suggesting that the \nregime is stationing more troops, Hawk missiles, and chemical weapons \nin the Straits of Hormuz. Mr. President, this represents a major threat \nto the flow of oil to the West. It is clear to all, that the disruption \nof the flow of oil could be devastating.\n  It is because of the nature of the Iranian threat that I introduced \ntwo pieces of legislation, S. 277 and S. 630, which effectively place a \ntotal United States trade embargo on Iran, in the case of the first \nbill, and a global embargo in the second bill. The President's recent \nExecutive order effectively implements my first bill and is a positive \nstep toward cutting off Iran, but we have more to do.\n  When we conduct business with Iran, we are subsidizing Iran's \nterrorist activities with hard currency. Because of this, we have to \ncut off our purchases of Iranian crude. Because of the nature of the \nIranian, Iraqi, and Libyan regimes, we are currently closed out of 10 \npercent of the world's oil production by Iran, Iraq, and Libya. Iran's \nactions in the Middle East may result in a further reduction in our \naccess to oil from this region. The volatile Middle East situation only \nmakes our country's supply of domestically produced oil more essential.\n  Mr. President, not only is our heavy dependence on foreign oil \ndangerous but it also damages our economy. Boone Pickens, president of \nMesa, Inc., of Dallas, TX, testified before the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, on March 27, 1995, that,\n\n       The two oil shocks of the 1970's reduced U.S. gross \n     national product by 3.5 percent, increased unemployment by 2 \n     percent, increased interest rates by 2-3 percent, and added 3 \n     percent to the general rate of inflation.\n\n  He added that,\n\n       Taken together, the combined impact of these effects on the \n     U.S. economy in the decade following the 1973 Arab oil \n     boycott totaled $1.5 trillion!\n\n  Mr. President, lifting the ANS oil export ban would not only export \noil, it would also export U.S. jobs. Current statutory restrictions on \noil exports result in the employment of U.S.-built, U.S.-manned \nvessels--that is Jones Act tankers--to\n transport most ANS crude. Under U.S. law, Jones Act tankers must be \nbuilt in the United States and manned with American crews. However, if \nANS exports were allowed, the oil would probably be transported to the \nFar East on U.S.-flag, non-Jones Act ships. U.S.-flag vessels can be \nforeign-built and transferred to U.S. registry. Foreign subsidies make \nit cheaper to build ships abroad than in U.S. yards with American \nworkers.\n\n  The consequences of Alaska oil exports to the Jones Act tanker fleet \nwould be devastating. ANS exports would result in approximately 20 \nJones Act tankers being scrapped and roughly 651 seagoing jobs lost. \nAgainst this structural collapse, there would be a modest offset of \nabout 225 new American seagoing jobs on six foreign-built very large \ncrude carriers operating under the U.S. flag from Alaska to Japan in \nexport service.\n  The most significant development in the likely ANS export proposal \nwould \n[[Page S6741]] be the ability to transport Alaska oil on foreign built \ntankers. This change would accomplish a longstanding objective of North \nSlope producers who want to avoid replacing their Jones Act fleets in \nthe United States due to the higher costs of domestic construction. If \nsuch export authority were granted, ever-increasing volumes of Alaska \noil would be carried to the Far East on foreign built bottoms, thereby \neliminating the need to construct replacement tonnage in U.S. yards. \nProspective employment losses resulting from ANS exports are estimated \nto be 7,500 U.S. shipbuilding and allied industry jobs.\n  Mr. President, exporting ANS crude oil would also be catastrophic to \nthe west coast ship repair business. Negative consequences are certain \nto result because foreign sales of Alaska oil will: First, reduce the \noverall size of the ANS fleet as well as the number of vessels that \nmust be repaired; and second, make it economically attractive for all \nU.S. tankships employed in Alaska oil service to have repairs done in \nless expensive yards located in the Far East.\n  A study concluded that removing the statutory restrictions on the \nexport of Alaska North Slope crude oil will cause the loss of 10,000 \nU.S. jobs in the maritime shipyard sector alone. Thus, exporting ANS \ncrude will result in measurable harm to this important sector at the \nvery time domestic shipyards are attempting to make the difficult \ntransit from Navy to commercial construction.\n  The U.S. ban on ANS oil exports was done to ease the country's \ndependence on foreign oil. Today, however, the United States is more \ndependent on foreign oil than in 1973. Lifting this ban would only \nserve to increase our vulnerability to blackmail by Iran, who could use \noil to hold the United States and the world hostage. Moreover, the \nUnited States can ill-afford to ship United States produced oil \nelsewhere when we are trying to compensate for the loss of Iranian, \nIraqi, and Libyan oil. Lifting the ban would export thousands of jobs \nto foreign countries. It is imperative that we keep the ban on ANS oil \nexports for the sake of U.S. jobs and our national security.\n  For these reasons, I must respectfully disagree with the honorable \nSenator from Alaska and oppose his legislation, S. 395.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern--my \nprofound concern and disquiet--about what appears to be a campaign to \nrush a bill through the Senate, and by so doing deprive this body--and \nthe American people--of a full and sober accounting of what this bill \nwould do.\n  Of course, I am referring to Senate bill 395, the Alaska Power \nAdministration Asset Sale and Termination Act. And right there in the \ntitle--``Asset Sale''--we have what this bill is all about. Let me be \nblunt; this bill is about one thing: Selling off as much of America's \nstrategic natural resources as fast as we can in the interest of \nchasing a quick buck.\n  I understand there are important issues in this bill that deserve \ndiscussion--and I have been prepared to have that discussion here on \nthe Senate floor. It should be a complete and thorough discussion and \nclearly we are not in a position to do that now.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is about to begin work on one of the most \ncritically important tasks that it has--that is the debate over the \nbudget. The Sunday talk shows and newspaper opinion columns recently \nhave been filled with news about the budget--the programs that may get \ncut, the poor and underserved who will suffer under those cuts, how \nmuch the rich would get even richer under certain tax-cut proposals. I \nam reasonably sure that all my colleagues, like myself, are spending \nmost of their time these days in preparation for the budget debate--and \nwell they should.\n  That is precisely why, Mr. President, I am puzzled--and troubled--\nthat the majority leader should at this particular moment have brought \nSenate bill 395 up for consideration. It is not like the Senate has not \nbeen working steadily--for example, as soon as we finished up what was \na rigorous debate on product liability reform, we turned to the \nimportant matter of interstate waste disposal which we have just \nreached agreement on. And its not as if this bill were one that could \nbe easily or quickly disposed of--for it should not.\n  Mr. President, I may wonder out loud about the timing of bringing \nthis bill up at this time. With the media and most Member's attention \nfocused on more important matters--the Nation's budget--is now the time \nto move on a bill that will send American oil overseas? Because that is \nexactly what this bill will do--by lifting the long held ban on \nexporting Alaskan oil, it will allow the oil companies to take American \noil and sell it to the highest bidder overseas.\n  Is now the time to move on a bill that will increase pressure to open \nup one of the only remaining pristine wilderness areas in the United \nStates--the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--to big oil and gas \ndrilling? Because that is exactly what this bill will do--it will \ndeplete our national oil reserves by sending American oil to other \ncountries, and increase the pressure to open up the ANWR. The \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska and bill author Senator Murkowski \nadmitted as much when he told the Anchorage Daily News on February 20 \nof this year that if we do not open up the ANWR, ``the oil on the West \nCoast is going to come from Colombia and it is going to come in on \nforeign vessels.'' And even yesterday on the floor, my distinguished \ncolleague again said that lifting the export ban will increase pressure \nto open up new potential fields for drilling.\n  Mr. President, is now the time to move on a bill that could make the \nUnited States even more dependent on foreign oil? At time when this \ncountry is importing record amounts of oil, is now the time to move on \na bill that would likely increase our oil imports? Does that sound like \na long-term strategy to make the United States more secure, more \nprepared, more energy-independent? I do not think so.\n  Mr. President, what is being asked for here is a special exemption \njust for the state of Alaska. By law, no State--let me repeat, no \nState--may export oil unless it is found to be in the national interest \nto do so. Is exporting Alaskan oil in the Nation's best interest? On \nthis matter I prefer to recall the words of my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens]. In response to a \nquestion, Senator Stevens on the floor of this body on July 12, 1973, \nsaid: ``I will assure the Senator from New Hampshire that so long as I \nam in the Senate, I will oppose the sale of Alaska's oil to Japan.'' \nThe position of the distinguished Senator from Alaska was correct then, \nand it is correct now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 395, \ntitle II, which would allow for the first time the export of Alaska \nNorth Slope crude oil to foreign markets.\n  Mr. President, I have struggled long and hard over this bill. \nConstituents from my State have mixed views on the benefits of \nexporting ANS crude oil abroad.\n  After discussing this bill with all affected parties and weighing the \npros and cons, I am convinced that this legislation, as now drafted, \nsatisfies the problems that have been identified and, on balance, \npresents a win-win solution.\n  Let me briefly go over the concerns I have had, including the \npossible impacts on jobs, on crude oil supplies for the west coast, and \non the environment.\n\n\n                                  jobs\n\n  First, for this legislation to be a success, it must not eliminate \njobs in one place while adding them somewhere else. That is why I \nsupport its requirement that any ANS crude exported abroad must be \ncarried in American-flagged and American-crewed ships. Otherwise, crude \noil that now comes to American refineries in American ships would \ninstead be going to overseas refineries in foreign ships.\n  But I am also concerned that the ships carrying this crude be built \nin American yards. While I understand why such a requirement cannot be \nincluded in this bill, I have received assurances from BP America, the \ncompany that is most likely to be exporting the crude overseas, that it \nis committed to building any new ships needed for this trade in \nAmerican yards. I received the following letter from BP America on this \nissue:\n\n                                [[Page S6742]] September 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Further to discussions with you \n     held September 30, 1994, if the ban on Alaska exports is \n     lifted, BP will commit now and in the future to use only \n     U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed ships for such exports. \n     We will supplement or replace ships required to transport \n     Alaskan crude oil with U.S.-built ships as existing ships are \n     phased out under the provisions in the Oil Pollution Act of \n     1990.\n       I hope that this commitment satisfies your request that \n     Alaska oil exports be carried on U.S.-built, U.S.-flag ships, \n     manned by U.S. crews.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                                  Steven Benz,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                     BP Oil Shipping Company, USA.\n\n\n                              oil supplies\n  Second, the loss of ANS crude oil supplies from the west coast of the \nUnited States must not create a situation where gasoline prices at the \npump go up in our western States, or where our western refineries that \nnow depend on this crude oil supply must close their doors because they \nare unable to replace it at a reasonable cost.\n  This bill specifies that the President shall determine on an annual \nbasis whether independent refiners in the Western United States are \nable to secure adequate supplies of crude. If not, he is to make \nrecommendations to Congress. Further, the bill requires that the GAO \nconduct a broader assessment of the impacts of the export of ANS crude \nafter 5 years, including gasoline prices at the pump, and make any \nrecommendations necessary.\n\n\n                          ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\n  Third, I have been concerned that passage of this legislation could \nincrease pressure for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nand off the west coast of the United States. The administration has \nassured me that it will oppose such drilling, and that this is an issue \nthat is totally separate from whether or not ANS crude should be \nexported.\n\n\n                                BENEFITS\n\n  Now, Mr. President, let me turn to the dramatic benefits the export \nof ANS crude offers. The current law provides that all ANS crude be \nshipped to American refineries. This creates an artificial surplus in \ncrude oil supplies on the west coast, which depresses the price that \nrefineries are willing to pay for alternative sources of supply, such \nas the heavy crude oil pumped in Kern County, CA.\n  Independent oil producers in Kern County have laid off thousands of \nworkers over the past decade, and shut down many wells. Eliminating the \nfederally mandated oil glut on the west coast will raise the price paid \nfor Kern County crude and make its production viable once again. The \nDepartment of Energy estimates that this will generate from 5,000 to \n15,000 new jobs very quickly, with as many as 10,000 to 25,000 by \ndecade end, most of which will be in Kern County.\n  As you know, Mr. President, California still has not joined the rest \nof the United States in a full recovery from the recession of 1990. \nUnemployment has remained particularly high in California's Central \nValley, caused in part by dramatic fluctuations in annual rainfall, but \nalso by the steady decline in employment and production in the Kern \nCounty fields.\n  So, in conclusion, Mr. President, I am pleased to state my support \nfor this legislation, which will provide net positive benefits to our \nmerchant marine, our independent oil producers, and the companies \npumping ANS crude, while providing protection through periodic \nevaluation of its impacts for our shipyards and our independent \nrefiners.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that the bill be read for the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further amendments to be \nproposed, the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the \nbill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third time and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that \namendment 1105 previously adopted by the Senate be modified to conform \nto the language which I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to bring to my colleague's \nattention a copy of a letter I recently received from the Department of \nDefense regarding the Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n  The letter from Under Secretary of the Army Joe Reeder responds to a \nletter I sent recently to Defense Secretary Perry about the Civilian \nMarksmanship Program. It confirms my longstanding belief that the time \nhas come for the Congress to terminate this program once and for all. \nThe letter says ``* * * the Army gets no direct benefit from the \nprogram'' and that there is ``* * * no discernible link'' between the \nprogram and our Nation's military readiness. It goes on to say, ``Last \nyear and again last week, DOD repeatedly has conveyed to Congress that, \nwhile it will continue to administer the program as directed by \nCongress, it will also continue to support legislation ending the \nprogram.''\n  This letter, Mr. President, is not a plea to the Congress to save a \nprogram that enhances our military readiness and national security. To \nthe contrary. It is an invitation to terminate the program. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the \nCongressional Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, recent press reports indicate that \nmembers of extremist militia groups in this country, which may pose a \nthreat to public safety, may be gaining access to military bases and \nreceiving weapons, ammunition, and training at Army facilities under \nthe auspices of the Civilian Marksmanship Program. In one article, I \nlearned that the leader of the Michigan-based militia group told ABC's \n``Prime Time Live'' that he had access to U.S. military bases in \nMichigan for the purpose of training through this program. In another \narticle, I learned that members of the Competitive Sportsman club were \nasked to leave Camp Grayling base when they showed up wearing Southern \nMichigan Militia patches. The American people have a right to know that \ntheir tax dollars are not being used to train people who may pose a \nthreat to law abiding citizens and to peace and order in this country. \nThe Defense Department should either investigate these allegations or \ncall on another branch of the U.S. Government to do so.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, the Civilian Marksmanship Program \nshould be terminated. My colleagues know that I have long believed the \nCivilian Marksmanship Program is a low-priority program and is an \negregious example of waste in Government. The program promotes rifle \ntraining for civilians through a system of affiliated clubs and other \norganizations, and sponsors shooting competitions. As part of these \nactivities, the program donates, loans, and sells weapons, ammunition, \nand other shooting supplies. The Department of Defense has provided me \nwith a State-by-State breakdown listing of 1,146 member clubs that \nparticipate in this program, which I will make available to any of my \ncolleagues who wish to read it.\n  The program was first established in 1903, at a time when civilian \nmarksmanship training was believed to be important for military \npreparedness. Yet the Pentagon says it supports legislation to \nterminate it and that there is ``no discernible link'' between military \nreadiness and the Civilian Marksmanship Program. As Army officials told \nthe GAO, no Army requirements exist for civilians trained in \nmarksmanship, and no system is in place to track program-trained \npersonnel. In a March 15, 1994, hearing in the Senate Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Army Secretary West stated that national \nsecurity objectives will be met with or without the Civilian \nMarksmanship Program.\n  In essence, the Civilian Marksmanship Program has provided a taxpayer \nsubsidy for recreational shooting. In light of the budget deficit we \nface and the military needs we ought to address, this simply is not a \njustifiable use of scarce resources. After all, defense dollars are not \nused to subsidize other sports. They ought not be used to subsidize a \nshooting program which has no relationship to military needs and \nrequirements.\n  Additionally, the program puts the U.S. Government in the role of \nselling weapons and ammunition to civilians. There is no shortage of \nguns and ammunition available in this country through the private \nsector. I do not believe the U.S. Government needs to be involved in \nputting more guns on the street in this country.\n  Mr. President, Senators Feinstein, Levin, Simon, and I recently \nintroduced a bill, S. 757, to terminate the Civilian Marksmanship \nProgram. I urge my colleagues to read the letter from Under Secretary \nReeder and approve that bill without delay.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Under Secretary of the Army,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Secretary of Defense, the \n     Honorable William J. Perry, has asked me on behalf of the \n     Army, which serves as the executive agent for the Civilian \n     Marksmanship Program (CMP), to respond to your letter \n     regarding your concerns about the CMP.\n       The CMP was established by Congress in 1903 to develop \n     marksmanship skills throughout our nation from which the \n     armed forces could draw when needed for rapid mobilization. \n     To this end, the CMP supported creation of rifle clubs \n     throughout the country. There are 1,146 member clubs (the \n     current listing at Tab A is an update from all previous \n     reports on clubs).\n       Over time the mission of the CMP changed. Now, the current \n     focus of the CMP is weapons safety, familiarization and the \n     sport of marksmanship. The CMP is apolitical, and provides no \n     instruction in military skills.\n       In FY 1994, the CMP spent $2.483 million of appropriated \n     funds; $2.544 million are budgeted for FY 1995. The Army has \n     requested no appropriated funding for the CMP in FY 1996, \n     because the Army gets no direct benefit from the program. The \n     FY 1996/1997 Biennial Budget Estimates submitted to Congress \n     documents the request for no funds in FY 96. Last year and \n     again last week, DOD repeatedly has conveyed to Congress \n     that, while it will continue to administer the program as \n     directed by Congress, it will also continue to support \n     legislation ending this program. I have enclosed a copy of \n     the recent OSD, General Counsel, response (Tab B) to The \n     Honorable Floyd Spence, Chairman, House National Security \n     Committee, and Ranking Minority Member Ron Dellums \n     reiterating, ``. . . no discernible link'' between military \n     readiness and the CMP.\n       DOD shares your concern that the CMP not inadvertently \n     become involved with groups or individuals who may intend to \n     harm federal or non-federal employees. To my knowledge the \n     CMP has never endorsed the involvement of militia groups or \n     extremists in any context. Before club status is granted, \n     three adults responsible for the formation of the club must \n     submit a DD Form 398-2 (Personnel Security Questionnaire) and \n     pass a background investigation performed by the National \n     Agency Check and Investigative Center. If Congress continues \n     to direct that this program be implemented, we will continue \n     to follow these procedures.\n       Section 4309, Title 10, United States Code, provides that \n     all ranges built in whole or in part with Federal funds may \n     be used by persons capable of bearing arms. Under this \n     legislation, the CMP and other organizations may request the \n     use of military ranges and are generally granted such use \n     provided they comply with range and installation rules. They \n     must not interfere with scheduled military training and their \n     intended use must not pose a safety hazard. If we have any \n     indication of misuse, we will take appropriate corrective \n     action.\n       Thank you for your interest in this program. I hope this \n     information addresses your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Joe R.

Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues as a \ncosponsor of the Minor Crop Protection Assistance Act. This legislation \nwill provide much needed relief to the food and horticultural \nindustries so important to the economy of my State and the Nation.\n  This purpose of this legislation is simple: It is all about \neconomics. This legislation seeks to provide some relief to producers \nof minor crops who face the imminent threat of losing access to vital, \nand safe crop protection tools due to market forces. Currently, \nregistration of pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and \nRodenticide Act [FIFRA] with EPA is an intensive process, involving as \nmany as 120 data requirements. Chemical manufacturers are forced to \nmake the decision to cancel, or not reregister, crop protection tools \nfor use on minor crops because the resulting \n[[Page S6744]] sales revenues will not support the high costs of \nreregistration. The result is that many safe minor crop protection \nchemicals have been dropped from production, despite the essential role \nthey play for our minor crop growers.\n  The production of the minor commodities, as they are called, is in \nfact of major importance to Washington State. In Washington, 90 percent \nof our agricultural industry is in minor crops. Most notable are hops, \napples, small fruits, vegetables, and hay. Washington alone produces 77 \npercent of all commercially consumed hops in the United States. Hops \ngrowers have five pesticides available to them, and four of these are \nin danger of being lost due to the high cost of reregistration. If only \none pesticide is available, pests will quickly develop their resistance \nand this compound will become obsolete as a tool for crop protection. \nAnother example comes from the hay producers in Washington. The hay we \ngrow makes up one-third of the world's hay market. We export 75 percent \nof our product. One particular pesticide which is essential to the \ngrowth cycle is in danger of not being reregistered. If it goes, with \nit will go our global market share.\n  This purpose of this bill is not an issue of public health or public \nsafety, this is an issue of economics. It is designed to preserve safe \nminor use pesticides and to encourage the development of \nenvironmentally sound pest management tools. We need to provide the \neconomic incentive for pesticide manufacturers to pursue the costly \nreregistration of products with limited market potential.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture recognize this situation. They have worked with a coalition \nof minor crop producers and my colleagues, Senator Lugar and Senator \nInouye, on this legislation. Accordingly, this bill streamlines the \nregistration and reregistration process, and provides new incentives to \nthe pesticide industry to pursue minor crop registrations. Most \nimportantly, this bill reinforces EPA's authority to deny \nreregistration of minor use pesticides out of concern for public \nsafety. In the Administrator's judgment, if a pesticide puts the public \nat too great a risk, the incentives for development, registration, or \nreregistration can be revoked.\n  A safe food supply is very important to me. Minor crops, which in \nlarge part are fruits and vegetables, are staples in the diets of \ninfants and children, and they also receive large applications of \npesticides. In its 1993 report, ``Pesticides in the Diets of Infants \nand Children,'' the National Academy of Sciences found that current \npesticide standards may be inadequate to protect infants and children \nfrom pesticide exposure and recommends policies to increase protection.\n  While this legislation addresses a market issue, it leaves us with \nthe responsibility of addressing the complex issue of food safety and \nthe adequacy of the current pesticide regulatory system. In no way are \nwe relieved of dealing with pesticide issues in a comprehensive manner.\n  I am very interested in promoting the development of newer, safer \npesticides, and encouraging farmers to decrease their use of dangerous \npesticides. Our efforts in this bill should go hand in hand with \nincentive-based approaches that encourage integrated pest management, \nand even organic production practices. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to address the shortcomings of our current pesticide \nregulatory system, and to encourage innovative approaches for the \nfuture.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6743-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MASSIMO SANTEUSANIO\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, I have today received a copy of a resolution \npassed by the Rhode Island House of Representatives, outlining the \ndevastating consequences that H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act, \nwould have on the State of Rhode Island if it becomes law.\n  This resolution, introduced by Rhode Island State Representatives \nBenoit, Sherlock, Williams, Kellner, and Bumpus, articulates far better \nthan I can the great damage that this legislation would do to the \nneediest of Rhode Island families.\n  As the welfare debate begins in earnest in the Senate, I hope that my \ncolleagues will bear in mind the strong opposition of many in my State \nto this proposal, and will heed in particular the part of the Rhode \nIsland House of Representatives' resolution which urges us to ``Put \nchildren first by working for humane welfare reform that provides for \nall citizens in need during difficult economic times, that supports \neffective return-to-work programs, and that recognizes that the care \ngiven to our Nation's children is a shared Federal-State \nresponsibility. * * *''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution passed by the Rhode \nIsland House of Representatives on May 10, 1995, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                            House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, under the provisions of the Personal \n     Responsibility Act (H.R. 4), Aid to Families with Dependent \n     Children would be replaced by the Temporary Family Assistance \n     Block Grant, and the entitlement program which guarantees \n     benefits to all children who qualify would be eliminated. \n     Under the proposed block grant financing formula, Rhode \n     Island would receive $54 million less in federal funds over \n     the next five years, and an estimated 25,000 children would \n     be denied benefits; and\n       Whereas, while the Personal Responsibility Act purports to \n     return control to the states, the block grant legislation, in \n     reality, contains many federal prohibitions limiting states' \n     freedom that would deny eligibility to several categories of \n     children and families; and\n       Whereas, the Personal Responsibility Act would virtually \n     eliminate cash assistance to 21% of the disabled children \n     currently in the SSI program, and $27 million less in federal \n     funds would be available to Rhode Island over the next five \n     years; and\n       Whereas, all child nutrition programs would be replaced by \n     two block grants; federal funding would be reduced by 10%; \n     federal nutrition standards would be repealed; eligibility \n     for food stamps would be sharply curtailed by federal \n     restrictions with the result that Rhode Island would receive \n     a combined total of $127 million less in federal funding over \n     the next five years; and\n       Whereas, funding for several major child protection \n     programs would be sharply reduced and replaced by a block \n     grant, and Rhode Island would receive $15 million less in \n     federal funding over the next five years, sharply reducing \n     funds for adoption assistance, foster care, and the \n     computerization of the state's abuse and neglect tracking \n     system; and\n       Whereas, essential child care programs that enable low-\n     income families to work would lose their entitlement status; \n     Rhode Island would receive $8 million less in federal funding \n     over the next five years and $2.4 million less by the year \n     2000, thereby resulting in 1,570 fewer children receiving \n     assistance; and\n       Whereas, most legal immigrants would be ineligible for most \n     programs, leading to a loss in federal aid to Rhode Island of \n     $72 million over the next five years; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That this House of Representatives of the State \n     of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations hereby \n     respectfully requests that the Rhode Island Congressional \n     delegation:\n       1.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words of \ncongratulation to the people who work for \n[[Page S6745]] Norwest Bank of Colorado and Atlantis Community, Inc.\n  Atlantis Community is the largest home health care agency in \nColorado, with an outstanding record of service to and advocacy for \ndisabled individuals. With Norwest Bank, Atlantis developed a unique \nprogram to help lower income disabled people achieve an American dream: \nthe dream of owning a home.\n  Atlantis and Norwest pioneered the Disability Community Homeownership \nProgram to help provide home mortgage financing to disabled people. \nThis program features 15- to 30-year first mortgage loans with no down \npayment, no closing costs, below market interest rates, and other \nadvantages to qualified home buyers. In 1993, Norwest set aside $2.5 \nmillion for loans to the disabled community. Norwest now has over $6 \nmillion in home loans to 100 people with disabilities, who could not \navail themselves of existing lending programs.\n  Atlantis teamed with Norwest to help build awareness of this program \namong the disabled community. In addition, Atlantis offers financial \ncounseling and money management services specifically tailored to meet \nthe needs of disabled people. The interest in these services was so \nhigh, Atlantis and Norwest decided to expand it to a consumer loan \nprogram for buying and modifying vehicles, improving disabled access to \nhomes, and other purposes.\n  In recognition of these community-oriented efforts, Atlantis and \nNorwest received nominations for the Social Compact Outstanding \nCommunity Investment Award. Social Compact is a coalition of hundreds \nof leaders from the financial services and community development \nindustries, coming together to strengthen American communities through \nneighborhood partnerships.\n  I congratulate Atlantis and Norwest for their nominations for this \naward, and I applaud their initiative for turning community concerns \ninto concrete results.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6744-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, in late January I came to the floor to \nspeak of our relations with Mexico in the context of the new North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement. My remarks appeared in the Record under \nthe heading ``Free Trade With an Unfree Society.'' I returned to a \ntheme which I had stated on a number of occasions since NAFTA was first \nproposed during the administration of President Bush. I had been an \nenthusiastic supporter of the free-trade agreement with Canada, but was \ntroubled by the thought of a similar arrangement with Mexico, and for \nthe most elemental reason. I argued that the political and legal \narrangements of the United States and Canada being essentially \nsymmetrical, the vast involvement in one another's affairs, the partial \nceding of sovereignty implicit in such an agreement would \nprovide quite manageable. There would be no political loss \nand considerable economic gain. Optimality, as an economist might say. \nBy contrast, I feared that our political and legal institutions were \nanything but symmetrical with those of Mexico. Mexico, I said, was a \nLeninist state.\n  I had hoped for some response to this statement from the executive \nbranch, but there was little. Indeed, apart from a gracious note from \nour distinguished Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, there was none. \nIn any event, we were then, in January, caught up in an intense effort \nto save Mexico from defaulting on its foreign debt. This was the first \nof what I fear will be a sequence of such crises, and it seemed \ngratuitous to press the argument in that atmosphere. But now the first \ncrisis has eased, thanks in large measure to what Alexander Hamilton, \nour first Secretary of the Treasury, termed ``energy in the \nexecutive,'' now embodied in his successor, Secretary Rubin. And so I \nwould take this quiet morning to return to the subject.\n  I would begin by calling attention to an essay by William Pfaff, \nwhich appeared in the International Herald Tribune on March 16. Mr. \nPfaff, who writes from Paris, is a foreign policy analyst of unexampled \nrange, depth, and experience. He would be such if he lived in Utica, \nbut living abroad gives him a singular perspective on American affairs. \nHis essay begins with this simple, chilling analogy.\n\n       The commitment the United States now has made to Mexico \n     bears a distinct resemblance to the commitment it made to \n     Vietnam during the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when the \n     troubles in that country were only beginning.\n       That was war and this is peace. Nonetheless now, as then, \n     with as little reflection and a simplistic ideology, \n     Washington has taken on responsibility for the fortunes of \n     another nation that it scarcely knows and fails to \n     understand.\n       In Mexico this American assumption of responsibility is \n     primarily economic, but Mexico's economic plight is \n     inseparable from the political crisis afflicting the eleven-\n     decade-long dictatorship in Mexico of the PRI, or \n     Institutional Revolutionary Party, historically the vehicle \n     of Mexican nationalism--and of resistance to American \n     exploitation of Mexican oil resources.\n       Washington has demanded, and last Friday was given, \n     Mexico's promise of a program of economic austerity with \n     distressing implications for millions of Mexicans, who only \n     weeks ago were being told that their country's membership in \n     NAFTA assured rising prosperity for them and their country. \n     One aspect of the new arrangement is that a major part of \n     Mexico's future oil revenues is pledged against the new \n     American and international loan guarantees.\n       Even without the debt crisis a national upheaval is under \n     way in Mexico which not even the Mexicans can be sure they \n     can solve. Washington's commitment to a solution is an \n     engagement with the uncontrollable and unforeseeable.\n\n  In my January statement I was unapologetic about discussing \ngovernment in the abstract. I allowed as how Speaker Gingrich, by \nencouraging us to read or re-read The Federalist, was directing us to \njust such abstractions, which very much engaged the Founders of the \nNation. They ransacked history for different ideal types of government \nfor lessons to be learned and contrasts to be made with the new \nAmerican Republic which they had set about constructing. Here, then, is \na definition of Leninism from the ``Harper Dictionary of Modern \nThought.'' The capitalized words are employed in the original for \npurposes of cross reference:\n\n       Leninism. The term refers to the version of MARXIST thought \n     which accepts the validity of the major theoretical \n     contributions made by Lenin to revolutionary Marxism. These \n     contributions fall into two main groups. Central to the first \n     was the conception of the revolutionary party as the vanguard \n     of the PROLETARIAT. The workers, if left to their own \n     devices, would concentrate on purely economic issues and not \n     attain full political CLASS consciousness, and therefore the \n     revolutionary seizure of power needed the leadership of \n     committed Marxist ACTIVISTS to provide the appropriate \n     theoretical and tactical guidelines. The role of the party \n     was thus to be a ``vanguard'' in the revolutionary struggle \n     which would culminate in the overthrow of the CAPITALIST \n     STATE and the establishment of a DICTATORSHIP OF THE \n     PROLETARIAT under the HEGEMONY of the party.\n       The second major theoretical contribution made by Lenin was \n     to draw the political consequences from an analysis of \n     CAPITALISM as both international and imperialist. The \n     phenomenon of IMPERIALISM divided the world between advanced \n     industrial nations and the colonies they were exploiting. \n     This situation was inherently unstable and led to war between \n     capitalist nations thus creating favorable conditions for \n     REVOLUTION. For Lenin, the ``weakest link'' in the capitalist \n     chain was to be found in UNDERDEVELOPED regions of the world \n     economy such as Russia where the indigenous BOURGEOISIE was \n     comparatively weak, but where there had been enough \n     INDUSTRIALIZATION to create a class-conscious proletariat. \n     The idea of world-wide SOCIALIST revolution beginning in \n     relatively backward countries led to the inclusion of the \n     peasantry as important \n     [[Page S6746]] revolutionary actors affording essential \n     support to the proletariat in establishing a socialist order. \n     Such socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would \n     exacerbate the contradictions inherent in advanced capitalist \n     economies and thus lead to the advent of socialism on a world \n     scale.\n       As compared with the ideas of Marx and Engels, Leninism \n     gives more emphasis to the leading role of the party, to \n     backward or semi-colonial countries as the initial site of \n     revolution, and to the peasantry as potential revolutionary \n     agents. With the success of the BOLSHEVIK revolution in 1917, \n     Leninism became the dominant version of Marxism and the \n     official IDEOLOGY of the Soviet Union. Lenin's analysis of \n     imperialism and his idea of the ``weakest link'' also made \n     his version of Marxism appealing to emerging ELITES in the \n     THIRD WORLD. In the West, however, while Leninist principles \n     are maintained by the small Trotskyist parties, many \n     adherents of eurocommunism have begun to ask how far Leninist \n     ideas reflected specifically Russian circumstances and should \n     therefore be modified to fit the conditions of advanced \n     capitalist societies.\n\n  Clearly, Leninst doctrine and Soviet example had considerable appeal \nto the revolutionary leaders and intellectuals who came to power in \nMexico in the 1920's. It happens this was a time of artistic energy, \nperhaps especially in mural paintings of Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente \nOrozco, and David Alfonso Siquieros. To this day one can see on the \nwalls of the Government buildings of Mexico City vast scenes of \nrevolutionary tumult. Amid a sea of yellow sombreros and silver \nmachetes there is sure to be found an incongruously bearded Lenin \nturned out in a starched collar and black necktie. That, and of course, \nswarms of red flags.\n  If the Soviet experiment attracted sympathizers, even adherents, in \nthe United States in those years, I would hazard that public opinion \nwould have shown even greater sympathy for the goings-on in Mexico. A \nwonderful encounter came at the time of the construction of Rockefeller \nCenter in New York City in the early years of the Great Depression. \nDiego Rivera was commissioned to paint a fresco for the lobby of the \ncentral RCA building, as it then was. Word got out that it would \ninclude not only red flags, but Lenin himself. Nelson A. Rockefeller, \nwho was managing the enterprise, demurred. Much hullabaloo followed, \nleading in turn to the classic poem by E.B. White of the New Yorker, \n``I Paint What I See,'' describing an imagined encounter between the \nyouthful scion of great wealth and the revolutionary artist. Here are \npassages.\n\n     ``Whose is that head that I see on my wall?''\n     Said John D.'s grandson Nelson.\n     ``Is it anyone's head whom we know, at all?\n     ``A Rensselaer, or a Saltonstall?\n     ``Is it Franklin D.? Is it Mordaunt Hall?\n     ``Or is it the head of a Russian?''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     ``For twenty-one thousand conservative bucks\n     ``You painted a radical. I say shucks,\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     ``For this, as you know, is a public hall\n     ``And the people want doves, or a tree in fall,\n     ``And though your art I dislike to hamper,\n     ``I owe a little to God and Gramper,\n     ``And after all,\n     ``It's my wall. . .''\n\n     ``We'll see if it is,'' said Rivera.\n\n  As I noted in January, it was no accident that when Leon Trotsky fled \nthe Soviet Union, having lost out to Stalin in the struggle to succeed \nLenin, he did not settle in Paris, where failed revolutionaries were \nsupposed to go. He went to Mexico City, where he set up in considerable \nstyle, surrounded often as not by American acolytes.\n  Two things are to be said about the coming to power of the \nInstitutional Revolutionary Party in 1929. First--the great English \nhistorian Sir John Plumb has made this point--it was a blessing for the \nMexican people who for decades had lived through indescribably bloody \nand agonizing turmoil. Of a sudden, stability was achieved. Sir John \nmakes the point that revolutions are easy; it is the onset of stability \nthat is rare in human experience. The second point is that nothing like \nthe Leninist terror followed the coming to power of the PRI. Diplomatic \nrelations with the Papacy--severed since 1867 when Benito Juarez \nimplemented strict controls of church power--became particularly \nhostile in 1926 during the rule of Plutarco Elias Calles, who would \nlater organize the PRI. His strict enforcement of the anticlerical \nprovisions of the Constitution sparked the Cristero rebellion which \nlasted 3 years. The Mexican Government and the church reached a modus \nvivendi in\n 1929 and after that Catholicism, the religion of the people, was not \ngenerally speaking suppressed. But do not fail to take note of Graham \nGreene's ``The Power and The Glory.''\n\n  Even so, one party control, and the corruption that so quickly \nfollows, settled on the Republic of Mexico. The forthcoming 1994-95 \nedition of ``Freedom in the World,'' the authoritative annual survey \npublished by Freedom House, states:\n\n       Since its founding in 1929, the PRI has dominated the state \n     through a top-down corporatist structure that is \n     authoritarian in nature and held together through co-\n     operation, patronage, corruption and, when all else fails, \n     repression. The formal business of government takes place \n     secretly and with little legal foundation.\n\n  I correct Leninist practice, the party controlled not only the State, \nbut all the private institutions that might seem to be arrayed against \nthe State, most importantly the trade unions. The Department of State \nreports in the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1994:\n\n       The largest trade union central is the Confederation of \n     Mexican Workers (CTM), organizationally part of the ruling \n     PRI. CTM's major rival centrals and nearly all the 34 smaller \n     confederations, federations, and unions in the Labor Congress \n     (CT) are also allied with the ruling PRI.\n\n  Of late, however, the Leninist state in Mexico appears to have \nentered a time of troubles, possibly of disintegration. As William \nPfaff, writes, ``a national upheaval is underway.'' Let us turn to Tim \nGolden's account of the May Day celebrations in Mexico City this year.\n\n         Defiant Workers in Mexico Protest Government Policies.\n\n\n               may day demonstration in capital's center\n\n       Defying the pro-Government union leaders who have dominated \n     Mexican labor since the 1930's, independent unions and \n     leftist political groups turned the celebration of Labor Day \n     today into an outpouring of anger at the economic policies of \n     President Ernesto Zedillo.\n       The limited political strength of the independent labor \n     movement was evident in the colonial central square of this \n     capital, where the biggest of more than a dozen protests \n     around the country drew only about one-fifth of the 350,000 \n     demonstrators that organizers had predicted. But for the \n     first time in decades, May Day's main political act was \n     something other than a loyal tribute to the Government and \n     its long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary party.\n       Leaders of the pro-Government unions had canceled their \n     traditional parade through the square weeks ago, apparently \n     out of fear that they would be unable to control the critics \n     in their ranks.\n\n  Trade union subservience to the PRI has been a settled fact for half \na century. As I noted in January, this hardly escaped the notice of the \nAmerican labor movement. Perhaps more recently the party seems to have \nbegun parceling out hugely profitable state enterprises or resources to \nfavored business leaders, who have evidently become fabulously wealthy. \nA dacha outside Moscow is one thing; $25 million a plate fundraising \ndinners in the Presidential palace are surely another.\n  Such enormities, such contrasts can never be stable, and in Mexico \nthe system is obviously under strain, as Pfaff observes.\n  On March 23, 1994, Luis Donaldo Colosio, the Presidential candidate \nof the PRI, was assassinated in Tijuana. One Mario Aburto Martinez was \narrested at the scene, convicted, and sentenced to 45 years in prison. \nThe\n administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who had chosen Colosio as \nhis successor, maintained that the assassination was the work of this \nlone gunman. However, on February 25, 1995, the new Mexican Attorney \nGeneral Antonio Lozano Gracia announced the arrest of a second \nsuspected gunman, Othon Cortes Vazquez, a PRI security guard.\n\n  A second political assassination occurred on September 28, 1994, when \nJose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the Secretary-General of the PRI was \nkilled in Mexico City. On February 28, 1995, Attorney General Lozano \nGracia announced the arrest of Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of \nformer President Salinas, in connection with Ruiz Massieu's \nassassination. The investigation into the Ruiz Massieu assassination \nhad previously been carried out by the victim's brother, Mario, who was \nsoon after arrested in the Newark, NJ airport with $46,000 in \nundeclared cash. The Mexican Attorney General has since located $10 \nmillion in United States bank accounts linked to Mario \n Ruiz [[Page S6747]] Massieu which he apparently obtained while in \ncharge of Mexico's counternarcotics program.\n  Add a further twist to the tale. Former President Salinas whom the \nUnited States supported as our candidate to be the first president of \nthe World Trade Organization until this story was revealed, is now \nliving in the United States in virtual exile.\n  And now another political murder would seem to have occurred. On May \n10 the former Jalisco State Attorney General, Leobardo Larios, who \npreviously had been responsible for investigating the 1993 killing of \nCardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, was assassinated in Guadalajara. At \nthe time of Cardinal Posadas Ocampo's assassination, the first official \nexplanation of the killing was that the Cardinal had been accidentally \nkilled in the cross-fire between two rival drug cartels. However when \nthe autopsy later revealed that the Cardinal had been shot 14 times at \nclose range, Leobardo Larios postulated that the Cardinal had been \nmistaken for the leader of a local drug ring, despite the fact that the \nCardinal was wearing his clerical garb.\n  Revelations such as these are familiar. Power in Mexico has resided \nwithin the PRI and on occasion arguments within the party settled by \nmurder. These features of Leninist totalitarianism appeared early in \nthe Soviet state. In ``Political Succession in the USSR'' (1965), Myron \nRush explains,\n\n       [W]hile Lenin still ruled, he exercised his power through \n     both the Party and the government. In the Party, formally, he \n     had no special position but was simply a member of the \n     Politburo along with six others; he headed the government, \n     however, as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. \n     He governed through the state apparatus directly, through the \n     Party apparatus indirectly. * * * The Party, as the \n     embodiment of the Revolutionary will, decided overall policy.\n\nAfter Lenin's death, no one person was in a position to consolidate \npower.\n  The ensuing power struggle was waged for control of the party, not \nfor control\n of the Government. At the time of Lenin's death there were six other \nmembers of the Politburo, the chief deliberative body in the party for \nthe formation of policy, including Stalin and Trotsky. By 1929 Joseph \nStalin had managed to expel the other five surviving members of the \nPolitburo and secure unchallenged leadership of the party, and by \nextension of the state. Stalin did not take a political title until May \n7, 1941, when he became the formal head of the Government as chairman \nof the Council of People's Commissars. Mexico continues to maintain the \nLeninist model of having the President fulfill the official role of \nhead of state, while controlling the party without formal title, though \nthe party and the Government appear to be moving apart somewhat. Much \nof what happened of late in Mexico echoes an earlier time of change and \nviolence. But there is much that promises a new era altogether.\n\n  On May 23, 1991, as we in the Senate debated granting fast-track \nauthority to enable the administration to negotiate the North American \nFree-Trade Agreement, I took to the floor to explain my opposition. I \nbegan, ``Mr. President, for some months now, I have made the point to \nthe administration that Mexico does not have an independent \njudiciary.'' This was, and I fear still is, a matter of seeming small \ninterest to our Department of State. But observe. It has become a \nmatter of considerable interest to the rulers of Mexico. On May 12, \n1994, the first ever Presidential debate took place between Ernesto \nZedioll Ponce de Leon, the PRI candidate who succeeded the assassinated \nColosio, and his opponents from the National Action Party [PAN] and the \nParty of the Democratic Revolution [PDR]. During the debate Diego \nFernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party charged that Zedillo \ndoes not get a passing grade in democracy. If elected, Mr. Fernandez de \nCevallos promised to form a plural government. In turn, Zedillo used \nthe debate to announce his intentions to establish a truly independent \njudiciary. The CIA Foreign Broadcast Information Service records him as \nsaying, ``I am proposing the total reformation of our judicial system. \nThis must be a deep-rooted reform, starting virtually from ground zero, \nbecause we need a justice system that will function for the Mexican \npeople.''\n  Once elected, President Zedillo in one stroke cleared the bench of \nall 21 sitting supreme court justices. These judges had been appointed \nfor life. Like most things in Mexico, while the constitution provides \nfor an independent judiciary, reality is something quite different. \nAppointments to the court are made by the President and approved by the \nSenate; in which 95 of the 128 Senators belong to the PRI. Again, \nFreedom House is instructive:\n\n       The judiciary is subordinate to the president, underscoring \n     the lack of a rule of law. Supreme Court judges are appointed \n     by the executive and rubber-stamped by the Senate. The court \n     is\n      prohibited from enforcing political and labor rights, and \n     from reviewing the constitutionality of laws. Overall, the \n     judiciary system is weak, politicized and riddled with \n     corruption.\n\n  And yet, and yet, very possibly President Zedillo means to change \nthis. And to change much else. The North American Free-Trade Agreement \nsurely indicated a desire by Mexican elites to begin to put the \ninstitutions of the Leninist state behind them; indeed, to throw in \nwith the liberal democratic states that appear to have prevailed in \nthat epic struggle of the 20th century. Pfaff writes:\n\n       The new president, Ernesto Zedillo, a product of the PRI \n     system, is attempting to reform the party and the way it has \n     perpetuated itself in power. For the first time crimes \n     committed within the party leadership are being exposed to \n     public view, investigated and given the promise of \n     prosecution.\n\n  It may be the United States can help. More to the point, we have no \nchoice but to try to help. We have made a huge commitment to this \nrelationship. There is no point arguing whether we should have done so. \nWe did. And in no time at all we began to realize this. The Mexican \ncurrency crisis appears to have been the direct result of overspending \non imported consumer goods, which the ruling party determined would \nhelp with yet another Presidential election, this time when there was \nserious opposition. Perhaps not least because in a North American free-\ntrade zone it is taken as normal for elections to involve more than one \nparty! My argument is to a somewhat different point. I have been here \non the Senate floor talking about the nature of the Mexican state for \nhalf a decade. Apart, as noted earlier, from a generous note from the \nSecretary of the Treasury, I have never had the least indication from \nthe executive branch that anyone had the least idea what I was talking \nabout. In my remarks in January, I noted that the American labor \nmovement had no such difficulty. From the time of Samuel Gompers, who \nin 1924 had to be brought across the Rio Grande so that he might die on\n American soil, American labor has followed events in Mexico with clear \nunderstanding of the threat a Leninist state poses to a free labor \nmovement. Can the Nation ever adequately express our debt to the \nleaders of the A.F. of L. and later the AFL-CIO, for their \ninternational activism through all those years of the cold war? But the \nDepartment of State? To my knowledge, there has been little or no \ninterest at all in any of this.\n\n  The President has just returned from Moscow, where the great \ntransition from totalitarianism is underway, to what purpose and what \nend we do not know. But surely, we know that it matters to us. Surely, \nthe Department of State has focused attention on the matter; has \nproposed policies, responses. The same intelligent, patient, persistent \nattention needs to be paid to the transition in Mexico. There is, \nperhaps, not that much America can do, especially given our long \nhistory of aggression against Mexico, and the consequent suspicion of \nour motives. But surely we can let it be known that we have some \ninkling what they are going through. There are small ``d'' democrats in \nMexico who need to know this. If there is anything we have learned from \nthis hideous century is that it makes all the difference when those who \nresist totalitarian regimes know that there are those abroad who know \nof their resistance. I do not wish to suggest that Mexico is in any way \nto be compared with, shall we say, East Germany. But still, it is not \nDenmark and those who would see it change need to know that we are with \nthem. At the same time, we need to be very careful about the \ncommitments we take on. It is perhaps a heartless thing to say of so \nrare a thinker as William Pfaff, but I \n[[Page S6748]] hope this time, for once, he does not prove to be \nprescient. But this can only happen if we attend to what he foresees.\n  The financial crisis has eased. We are free to think anew and act \nanew. There was at least one such moment in our involvement with \nVietnam. We missed it.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6745-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          SOUTH DAKOTA FLOODS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, once again, Mother Nature's fury is \nchallenging the spirit and perseverance of South Dakotans. For the past \nseveral weeks, persistent rains have brought flooding conditions to \nmuch of the State for the third straight year. As a result, 38 counties \nalready have been declared disaster areas. More counties may be added \nin the days ahead. Just by way of comparison, in July 1993, 33 counties \nwere disaster areas due to the heavy rainfall and flooding that made \nfront page headlines nationwide.\n  Flooding has made vital roads and bridges impassable, placing the \nassurance of basic services at risk. Rivers and streams overflowing \ntheir banks have wreaked havoc in urban and rural areas across South \nDakota--basements, fields, and roads are inundated with water. Damage \nto public and private property threatens the well-being of farmers, \nsmall business men and women, families, and individuals.\n  On Monday, Gov. Bill Janklow requested that the President declare the \nState a disaster area and provide Federal emergency assistance in \nexcess of $16 million. The devastation appears already to have \nsurpassed that caused by the so-called Great Flood of 1993. Some areas \nof the State already are experiencing their wettest springs in history \nwith 3 weeks remaining in the season.\n  An end does not appear to be in sight. National Weather Service \nreports indicate heavy precipitation will continue through the end of \nthis month and maybe into this summer. If this is the case, South \nDakota once again may resemble the Great Lake of the Midwest.\n  South Dakotans clearly are experiencing hard times. The Governor's \noffice has informed me that the State is using all the resources it can \nto assist those in need. Federal help is critical. As South Dakota's \nsenior Senator, I intend to do all I can to ensure that the President \nand our Federal agencies respond to South Dakota's disaster needs \nswiftly and diligently. The people of South Dakota deserve and should \nexpect no less from their Government.\n  I already have written to the President, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency [FEMA], and the Small Business Administration [SBA], \nand the Federal Highway Administration, alerting them of South Dakota's \nurgent situation and urging quick approval of the Governor's aid \nrequest.\n  I also invited the Administrator of the Federal Highway \nAdministration, Rodney Slater, to personally assess the damage of our \nflood-damaged roads and bridges and to give immediate consideration to \na request from the State for assistance. Having endured $1.2 million of \ndamage to roads and bridges last year, additional damage to roads and \nbridges makes FHWA assistance even more critical this year.\n  Administrator Slater for some time has planned to survey damaged \nroads and bridges in South Dakota. Unfortunately, he has not scheduled \na visit. Now is as good a time as any for him to see just how serious \nthe situation is.\n  South Dakotans have no time to waste. The Federal Government should \nact, and act fast. South Dakota deserves the same response other areas \nof the Nation receive in times of need. I intend to see that this \naction is taken.\n  What kind of action can be taken at the Federal level? Plenty. In \nfact, a number of initiatives can be taken without a Presidential \ndisaster declaration--initiatives that are critical to South Dakota \nfarmers and ranchers. First and foremost, the Department of Agriculture \nand the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation must provide far greater \nflexibility in the administration of the Crop Insurance Program to \nSouth Dakota farmers.\n  The Crop Insurance Program, which has replaced disaster payments as \nthe central means for emergency relief, is predicated on the planting \nof crops. However, as we all know, the clear problem caused by the \nrecent rain and floods for crop farmers is that they are unable to \nplant. Consider the percentage of crops planted, as of May 8, 1995, as \ncompared to the 5-year average: corn--1 percent, 5-year average--19 \npercent; spring wheat--17 percent, 5-year average--89 percent; oats--12 \npercent, 5-year average--85 percent; barley--6 percent, 5-year \naverage--84 percent.\n  I already have written to Agriculture Secretary Glickman, urging \nadministrative flexibility for the Crop Insurance Program. Specifically \nthe Secretary needs to take the following steps:\n  First, provide prevent planting coverage on crops that producers paid \npremiums on. If a producer was unable to plant the insured crop by the \nfinal planting date, crop insurance should pay the prevented planted \nindemnity and permit the producers to plant any subsequent crop \npossible and insure that crop.\n  Second, provide crop insurance coverage for producers who aerial seed \nthis year's crop. With the degree of wet conditions occurring in South \nDakota, aerial seeding needs to be considered a usual practice.\n  Third, withhold penalties against producers by permitting prevented \nplanting coverage even if a producer enters the 0/92 program.\n  Fourth, release Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] acres for haying \nand grazing.\n  Fifth, extend immediately the May 15 deadline for calving on CRP \nacres. I am pleased that Secretary Glickman has responded to this \nrequest, and has extended the deadline.\n  Sixth, permit the following crops to be planted this year without the \nloss of farm program benefits: millet, soybeans, buckwheat, sunflowers.\n  FEMA, SBA, and the FHWA also should be equally responsive, fair, and \nflexible to the needs of South Dakotans should the Governor request \nFederal assistance.\n  The need for equitable treatment in response to disasters is very \nimportant to me. In recent years, I have been very critical of what I \nbelieve to be the apparent discriminatory administration of Federal \nemergency assistance. It seems that disaster aid is always quick in \ncoming to States and localities with major media markets and big \nelectoral votes. However, whether you are from Humboldt, CA, or \nHumboldt, SD, a disaster is a disaster--a lost home, business, or \nincome due to Mother Nature is hard for all Americans, regardless of \nwhere they live. Thus, treatment of these disasters should be fair.\n  Once again, the wrath of Mother Nature is challenging the people of \nour great State. Times are tough, but I know South Dakotans will \npersevere. The pioneer spirit and sense of community within all South \nDakotans will rise to the occasion. In the last few days, my wife \nHarriet and I have talked to a number of our friends in South Dakota. \nWe have heard the difficulties they have faced. Our hearts and our \nprayers are with them--the farmers, ranchers, business men and women, \nand the families impacted by the flooding. I intend to do all I can to \nensure that the Federal Government stands side-by-side with all South \nDakotans during this difficult time. The President can begin this \neffort by approving Governor Janklow's request and send assistance \nwhere needed. I urge him to do so without delay. Again, the people of \nSouth Dakota should expect and deserve no less.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6748-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6748-S6749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE OF ED ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it was with profound sadness that I \nlearned of Ed's death. On March 14, 1995, not only did the world lose \none of our most dynamic and forceful advocates for the rights and \nempowerment of people with disabilities; on that day, I lost a friend \nand confidant.\n  Ed Roberts was a kid who lived for baseball when he contracted polio \nat age 14. He became severely disabled almost overnight, needing large \nequipment and assistance simply to breathe. Ed overheard the doctor \ntell his mother that it would be better if he died because he was going \nto be a vegetable. He decided right then that if he was going to be a \nvegetable, he would be an artichoke: prickly on the outside with a \ntender heart.\n  A lot of people told Ed there were a lot of things he could not do.\n  They told him he could not graduate from high school because he could \nnot pass PE or driver's education, so he \n[[Page S6749]] had to argue with and convince his principal to change \nthese requirements because they were not fair.\n  They told Ed he could not attend the University of California at \nBerkeley because they had never had a student in a wheelchair, one who \nused a respirator, or one who slept in an iron lung. Ed fought all that \ntoo, and convinced the university to admit him. ``Helpless Cripple Goes \nto College'' was one of the headlines marking Ed's entrance to college.\n  They made him live in the infirmary. But Ed was not helpless. By the \ntime Ed left UC Berkeley, he and fellow student activists who called \nthemselves the Rolling Quads had organized funding to begin \ntransforming the campus into a model of physical accessibility for \nstudents with disabilities.\n  As Ed said, ``We realized that we could change some things, and the \nfirst thing we can do is change our own attitudes toward ourselves, be \nproud of who we were and what we were and go out and change it for \nothers and for ourselves * * * that liberated me when I realized that I \ncan help others. It made me a lot freer to help myself.''\n  Ed went on to graduate school in political science and taught at UC \nBerkeley for several years. One of Ed's deans once told him, ``Oh, \nyou'll finish your Ph.D and they you'll live in a nursing home.'' But \nEd knew otherwise. He told that dean, ``No, that's not the plan. We're \nhere to change that whole idea.'' And at his memorial service, a \nrepresentative from the university described him as ``bringing the \nhonor of being the right kind of troublemaker here at Cal.'' Today, \nover 800 students with many\n kinds of disabilities attend UC-Berkeley where there are scholarships \nin his name for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students with \ndisabilities.\n\n  After his university years, Ed went on to establish the first Center \nfor Independent Living in the country. Where was it was located? Where \nelse? Berkeley. Today there are over 300 independent living centers all \nacross the country. Independent living is a philosophy which defines \nindependence as full inclusion of people with disabilities in all \naspects of community life. Ed lived this philosophy, and he helped \nothers live it as well. His colleague Doug Martin, ADA and 504 \ncompliance officer for UCLA, recently described Ed during the CIL years \nwhen he said, ``He believed in us before we believed in ourselves.''\n  Ed's philosophy of independent living, and his ability to get the \nmoney and the people behind it changed our lives. It changed the lives \nof millions of people in this country and abroad--people with \ndisabilities, their families, their friends and many others who began \nto see the universality of his approach. As Ed put it, ``I'm paralyzed \nfrom the neck down, but I'm completely in control of my own life. I can \nmake decisions about what I want.''\n  Early on, they told Ed he was unable to be rehabilitated. However, \nthis rehab failure went on to become director of the California State \nDepartment of Vocational Rehabilitation. You see, Ed loved to turn \nbarriers upside down, rendering each one a challenge in his own slalom \ncourse toward empowerment and independence. And by the end of his \ntenure in Sacramento, Ed knew he wanted to be a full-time rabble-\nrouser. Ed told his friend Stephen Hofman, ``I don't want to work. It \nprevents you from raising hell, and I like to raise a lot of hell * * * \nAfter all, if raising hell doesn't work, the only solution is to raise \neven more hell, and then, they give up!''\n  As Joe Shapiro wrote in U.S. News & World Report the week after Ed \ndied, ``He knew that it was the paternalism of others, more than his \nown disability that held him back.''\n  In 1984, Ed was awarded a MacArthur Genius Fellowship, which he used \nto live on as he started The World Institute on Disability, a \ndisability policy think tank located in Oakland, CA. Ed testified \nbefore committees in Congress numerous times, and many of us grew to \nknow him well. But Ed was not content to be a solo rabble-rouser. He \nwanted to join forces, debate the issues, hammer out policy and see it \nimplemented in his lifetime. WID was the crucible Ed fashioned with his \ncolleagues for stoking fires and building community.\n  Ed's vision was exemplified in the way he lived his own life, but he \nalso very much believed in empowering others. As one of his colleagues \nat WID said, ``Part of his star quality was that he always talked about \n`we'. He always would come up and say\n `we've got to do that,' `we need people,' `we need to work on this \ntogether,' `we can make this happen.''' Ed blew people's minds when he \ntook to the streets of Moscow in his motorized chair in 1993. There, he \nhas become a symbol of freedom, a household word to millions of people \nwith disabilities.\n\n  But Ed was more than a civil rights hero. He was a man with heart, a \nman whose love and sense of humor were tools just as powerful as his \nkeen mind and his passion for justice. Ed always took the time to find \nout how you were doing.\n  He took the time to encourage young students with disabilities to \nstudy public policy.\n  He took time to talk with personal assistants about the powerlessness \nof being underpaid.\n  He took the time to visit other respirator users in the hospital when \nthey were despairing over living independent lives.\n  He took the time to stop on the street and talk with homeless people, \npeople with disabilities that the ``system'' has forsaken.\n  He took the time to laugh, to have an adventure, and always to eat a \ngood meal!\n  Ed did just about everything a person could dream of doing. He got \nmarried. He fathered a son--his absolute pride and joy. Ed swam with \nthe dolphins, practiced karate, was almost eaten by a shark, threw \ntremendous dinner parties, and travelled all over the world. As WID \nvice president and one of Ed's former proteges, Debby Kaplan said \nrecently, ``He had a determined exuberance for life.''\n  We are all fortunate to live in this world which Ed so deeply \ntouched, so richly celebrated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6748-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1045.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants to entities in rural areas that design and implement innovative \napproaches to improve the availability and quality of health care in \nsuch rural areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the rural health improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, during the last several years, \nAmericans have heard a lot about the need to reform our health care \nsystem. Health care costs are soaring out of control--far outpacing the \nrate of inflation--and nearly 38 million Americans are without health \ncare insurance. Solutions for reform are complex and will go through \nmuch debate and consensus building before implemented on a national \nlevel.\n  While local and regional health care systems have rushed to \nconsolidate and integrate their services and resources over the last \ndecade, rural entities, due to their shortage of physicians, the \nvulnerability of their hospitals, their geographical and technical \nisolation, and the demographics of their patient populations, have been \nlargely unable to adjust in a similar way. As public concern over the \nnational health care crisis grows and legislative bodies and \npolicymaking agencies scramble to devise and implement far-reaching \nhealth care reform, the special health care needs of rural America must \nnot be neglected.\n  Today I am reintroducing the Rural Health Improvement Act because I \nfeel, given the current direction of the health care reform debate, \nthat it provides an essential transition into comprehensive health care \nreform. Now, more than ever, health providers in rural communities are \njoining with their urban counterparts to create networks to assure that \nhealth care is accessible in rural areas. There are a number of \nobstacles, however, that create a disincentive for providers to \nparticipate in these efforts. I believe that the legislation that I am \nintroducing today will remove these obstacles and help rural \ncommunities position themselves for comprehensive health care reform.\n  Mr. President, the Rural Health Improvement Act will help our rural \ncommunities in the following ways. First, this legislation provides \ngrants to allow rural and urban providers to develop rural health \nextension networks to facilitate the delivery of health care in rural \ncommunities. It allows existing networks such as area health education \ncenters to compete for these grants in order to prevent needless \nduplication and to assure that successful programs will have the \nability to expand their capabilities. The goal of the rural health \nextension networks grant is to facilitate resource sharing within the \nnetwork by providing education and training for health care providers \nin rural areas, creating linkages between rural and urban providers \nthrough the use of telecommunications and other consultative projects, \nand assisting rural providers in\n developing cooperative approaches to health care delivery.\n\n  Second, my bill provides grants for the creation of rural managed \ncare cooperatives which will enhance the economic viability of health \ncare providers in rural areas. The idea of health cooperatives in rural \nareas is not new. In 1929, the first health maintenance organization in \nthe United States was developed in rural Elk City, OK, by the Farmers' \nCooperative. Since 1929, there have been several attempts to create \nrural health cooperatives, however, they have suffered because they \nlacked sufficient startup support. My bill provides this startup \nsupport.\n  These cooperatives will be made up of health providers of all types \nincluding, but not limited to, hospitals, physicians, rural health \nclinics, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and public health \ndepartments. By establishing an effective case management and \nreimbursement system designed to support the financial needs of rural \nhospitals and health care systems, cooperatives will provide an \neffective framework for negotiating contracts with payers and assuring \na defined level of quality. The cooperatives will also help rural \npractitioners with a portion of their payments on malpractice premiums.\n  Due to the concerns about possible antitrust problems that might \narise in the formation of the rural health extension networks and the \nrural managed care cooperatives, the bill includes language which would \nprotect providers who participate in these entities from antitrust law. \nThis exemption from antitrust law should facilitate the development of \nnetwork and cooperatives in rural areas.\n  Third, the bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \naward competitive grants to develop and implement mental health \noutreach programs in rural areas. The bill emphasizes the needs of the \nelderly and children in rural areas. Grant recipients are encouraged to \nform relationships with rural managed care cooperatives to enhance the \ndelivery of these services.\n  Fourth, my bill provides stipend grants under the Area Health \nEducation Centers [AHEC] Program to health care providers and trainees \nin rural communities as an incentive to provide health care services in \nthose areas. While the stipends envisioned in this legislation will not \ncompletely relieve the financial burden young providers face, \nespecially physicians, it is my hope that they will provide enough of \nan incentive to attract and retain health care providers in rural \nareas.\n  It has been 20 years since the AHEC Program was enacted and we now \nhave a network of 48 AHEC Programs in 38 States. In my own State of \nOregon, we have an excellent statewide AHEC program with five centers \nnow operating to meet the challenges of both rural and urban areas. \nState studies have shown that AHEC's have an excellent record in \naddressing the primary health care profession needs of underserved \nareas. In fact, since AHEC's inception more than 1.5 million students, \nresidents, and preceptors have been trained in medicine, allied health, \ndentistry, nursing, and pharmacy.\n  Finally, this year I have included a nonrefundable tax credit for \nqualified providers in rural and underserved areas. This tax credit is \nsimilar to the tax credit proposed in health care reform legislation \nlast session. Under this provision qualified providers will be eligible \nfor a tax credit if they serve in rural or underserved areas for 5 \nyears. A similar tax credit program in Oregon has enjoyed great \nsuccess. In a recent survey by the Oregon Office of Rural Health, rural \nproviders indicated that the Oregon Tax Credit Program is the most \nimportant program offered that keeps them practicing in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, our rural communities are facing a crisis in health \ncare delivery. Nationwide, 141 rural community hospitals closed between \n1989 and 1993. In Oregon, five rural hospitals have closed since 1986 \nand several other rural facilities are threatened with imminent \nclosure. These hospitals simply cannot compete with their urban \ncounterparts. I believe my legislation will give rural health care \nproviders the tools to build rural health care delivery systems which \nmeet the health needs of their communities. This is the first step in \ndeveloping an infrastructure of providers who will support and sustain \ncomprehensive health care reform and provide health care access for all \nAmericans.\n  [[Page S6751]] I'd like to take a moment to thank the National Rural \nHealth Care Association, the Oregon Office of Rural Health, the Oregon \nAssociation of Hospitals, the Oregon Medical Association, the Oregon \nNurses Association, and the Oregon AHEC Program Office for their \nsupport in developing this innovative legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a careful look at this bill and consider \nit as a transition into comprehensive health care reform that can help \nour rural communities now.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 808. A bill to extend the deadline for the conversion of the \nvessel M/V Twin Drill, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                       m/v twin drill legislation\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \nextend the deadline for the completion of the conversion of the vessel \nM/V Twin Drill. This vessel is what is known as a SWATH or small \nwaterplane area twin hull vessel of advanced design that provides for \nan unusually smooth operating platform. This vessel currently \nundergoing initial conversion in Louisiana to ready her for a complete \nconversion to a U.S.-flag day cruise service.\n  Under terms of section 601(d) of Public Law 103-206 the M/V Twin \nDrill was granted full coastwise privileges provided that the cost of \nmajor conversion work on the vessel in a U.S. shipyard was more than \nthree times the purchase value of the vessel. Furthermore, the owners \nwere required to commit to build a new vessel entirely within a U.S. \nshipyard. These requirements were to have been completed by certain \ndates. A number of delays resulted from the discovery of additional \nwork that was necessary because of unknown conditions on the vessel \nslowed the project to the point where it will now be impossible to \ncomplete the conversion by the statutory deadline.\n  Given the significant investment to date, and the progress already \nmade, it is only reasonable that we provide some additional time for \nthis shipyard work to be completed. This will cost the Government \nnothing, but it will mean immediate jobs at the shipyard and long-term \nemployment opportunities onboard the Twin Drill. Failure to act would \nalso mean foregone job opportunities in the construction and operation \nof the new vessel as well. A similar provision was passed by the House \nof Representatives last fall as part of the Coast Guard authorization \nlegislation which we were not able to act on before the end of the last \nsession. It is time we finish the job and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Bradley):\n  S. 809. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to limit the \neligibility for treatment under the generalized system of preferences \nin the case of countries that support international acts of terrorism, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the trade act of 1974 amendment act of 1995\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that would \nmake our Nation's Generalized System of Preferences Development Program \nconform with out foreign aid program when it comes to eliminating \nbenefits for countries that sponsor terrorism. I am pleased that \nSenators Helms and Bradley are original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  Under this bill, a country would automatically lose its GSP benefits \nonce the Secretary of State makes a determination under the Export \nAdministration Act of 1979 that ``the government of that country has \nrepeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.'' \nUnder the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, once the Secretary makes this \ndetermination and a country is added to the State Department's so-\ncalled ``terrorism list,'' it is no longer eligible to receive foreign \nassistance from the United States. Likewise, state sponsors of \nterrorism should be precluded from importing products into this country \nduty free under the GSP Program.\n  But they are not.\n  Syria is a case in point. Syria was designated by the State \nDepartment as a state-sponsor of terrorism on December 29, 1979, which \nmade it ineligible to receive foreign assistance. Nonetheless, Syria \ncontinued to import products into the U.S. duty free under the GSP \nProgram until August 16, 1992. At that time, Syria's eligibility was \nsuspended due to concerns about workers' rights--not a concern about \nterrorism.\n  Technically, the GSP law prohibits the President from designating a \ncountry GSP eligible ``if such country aids or abets, by granting \nsanctuary from prosecution to any individual or group which has \ncommitted an act of international terrorism.'' But the law did nothing \nto prohibit Syria, a country our Government already recognized as a \nstate-sponsor of terrorism, from benefiting from the United States \nGovernment's GSP Development Program. That is why I am proposing a \nchange in the law.\n  Mr. President, once the Secretary of State determines that a country \nsponsors terrorism it ought to automatically lose its GSP benefits, \njust as it loses its foreign assistance. There is no sensible rationale \nfor barring foreign assistance for state sponsors of terrorism while \nproviding GSP benefits to those same state sponsors of terrorism. Like \nforeign aid, GSP is a benefit, not a right. It is development program \nwith goals that are similar to those of the foreign aid program. Both \nprograms ought to be governed by the same terrorism standard.\n  When it comes to fighting terrorism, our Government needs to speak \nwith one voice. We need to make it crystal clear that the benefits of \nAmerican friendship are not provided to countries that, by their \npresence on the terrorist list, have been found to have a consistent \npattern of state support for terrorism.\n  Mr. President, by making the GSP Program conform with the foreign aid \nprogram when it comes to providing benefits to countries that support \nterrorism, this bill would add an important element of consistency to \nour antiterrorism foreign policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 809\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON DESIGNATION AS BENEFICIARY \n                   DEVELOPING COUNTRY.\n\n       Section 502(b)(6) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19) U.S.C. \n     2462(b)(6)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(6) if--\n       ``(A) such country aids or abets, by granting sanctuary \n     from prosecution to any individual or group which committed \n     an act of international terrorism, or\n       ``(B) the Secretary of State makes a determination with \n     respect to such country under section 6(j)(1)(A) of the \n     Export Administration Act of 1979; and''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 810. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to remove from \nthe Coastal Barrier Resources System a tract of land in South Carolina \nthat was added to the System without notice to the county in which the \ntract is located, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n       the coastal barrier resources system fairness act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal \nBarrier Resources System Fairness Act of 1995. The bill is aimed at \ncorrecting a mistake in the Coastal Barrier Resource System. Without \nthis correction, a portion of Colleton County, SC, will remain in the \nCoastal Barrier Resources System even though the county never had an \nopportunity to voice their objection to their inclusion.\n  In 1980 Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to study and \npropose a Coastal Barrier Resources System. The aim was to create a \nsystem made up of relatively undeveloped low-lying coastal lands which, \nbecause of their susceptibility to flooding, would not be eligible for \nFederal flood insurance. Practically speaking, to be included in the \nCBRS means you can't sell or develop your property.\n  Soon after the passage of the 1980 act, the Department of the \nInterior created a study group charged with promulgating an inventory \nof coastal \n[[Page S6752]] properties--properties to be included in the CBRS. By \nthe end of 1988, the study group had completed its work and the \nDepartment of the Interior submitted the CBRS proposal to Congress.\n  This proposed inventory was the culmination of 8 years work and \nincluded suggestions made during two public comment periods. The first \npublic comments were made following the release of an initial draft \ninventory in 1985. Additional comments were made following the release \nof a second draft in the spring of 1987. The Department of the Interior \nreceived numerous comments on these draft inventories and incorporated \nmany in their final report to Congress. This final report was the basis \nfor the Coastal Barrier Resources System adopted in 1990.\n  I recite this history because without an understanding of it, Mr. \nPresident, one can't understand the intent of my legislation.\n  While the Department of the Interior was drafting this proposed \nsystem, a strip of coastal South Carolina was being annexed by Colleton \nCounty from Charleston County. Unfortunately, this annexation occurred \nin 1987 in the midst of the 1987 CBRA comment period. Unfortunately, \nthe notice of this second draft inventory was not received by Colleton \nCounty. The county never received any notice. It appears, the draft \ninventory was provided to Charleston County, not Colleton County. In \nfact, the maps currently on file at the Department of the Interior, \nstill, incorrectly show this tract in Charleston County--not Colleton \nCounty. Thus, the citizens of Colleton County, never having had an \nopportunity to comment on these proposed changes, now find this tract \nincluded in the CBRS. And for all practical purposes off limits for \ndevelopment.\n  This bill corrects that mistake. It rights that wrong. It does not \ndrastically redraft the Coastal Barrier Resources System nor withdraw \nany lands included in the 1985 draft. The bill simply returns a small \nportion of Edisto Island, SC, to its 1985 status.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

This title may be referred to as the ``Outer \n     Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act''.\n       Sec. 302. Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \n     Act.--Section 8(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, \n     (43 U.S.C. 1337 (a)(3)), is amended by striking paragraph (3) \n     in its entirety and inserting the following:\n       ``(3)(A) The Secretary may, in order to--\n       ``(i) promote development or increased production on \n     producing or non-producing leases; or\n       ``(ii) encourage production of marginal resources on \n     producing or non-producing leases;\n\n     through primary, secondary, or tertiary recovery means, \n     reduce or eliminate any royalty or net profit share set forth \n     in the lease(s).

In making such determination, the \n     Secretary shall consider the increased technological and \n     financial risk of deep water development and all costs \n     associated with exploring, developing, and producing from the \n     lease. The lessee shall provide information required for a \n     complete application to the Secretary prior to such \n     determination. The Secretary shall clearly define the \n     information required for a complete application under this \n     section.

If the Secretary \n     determines that such new production would not be economic in \n     the absence of the relief from the requirement to pay \n     royalties provided for by clause (i), the Secretary must \n     determine the volume of production from the lease or unit on \n     which no royalties would be due in order to make such new \n     production economically viable; except that for new \n     production as defined in clause (iv) (aa), in no case will \n     that volume be less than 17.5 million barrels of oil \n     equivalent in water depths of 200 to 400 meters, 52.5\n      million barrels of oil equivalent in 400-800 meters of \n     water, and 87.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in water \n     depths greater than 800 meters. Redetermination of the \n     applicability of clause (i) shall be undertaken by the \n     Secretary when requested by the lessee prior to the \n     commencement of the new production and upon significant \n     change in the factors upon which the original \n     determination was made. The Secretary shall make such \n     redetermination within 120 days of submission of a \n     complete application. The Secretary may extend the time \n     period for making any determination or redetermination \n     under this clause for 30 days, or longer if agreed to by \n     the applicant, if circumstances so warrant. The lessee \n     shall be notified in writing of any determination or \n     redetermination and the reasons for and assumptions used \n     for such determination.

Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues and all Americans a poem, ``Korea--Both Sides of the Line,'' \nwritten by Mr. Ernst E.

I believe Mr. \nBanfield's poem poignantly depicts our Nation's commitment to this \nconflict, and ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The poem follows:\n\n                     Korea--Both Sides of the Line\n\n     It's over now or so some may say.\n       Will silence prevail while some turn to prayer?\n     Some will cheer, others a disbelief will share.\n       Is it true no bugles will sound this day?\n\n     We had our differences, Army . . .

GEN. RONALD E. BROOKS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \naccomplishments of Maj. Gen. Ronald E. Brooks. General Brooks' \npatriotism and service to our country have been impressive. America \nshould be proud of his dedication and hard work around the world. I \nwould like to elaborate a moment on General Brooks' tremendous career, \nwhich he will complete this fall.\n  General Brooks grew up in Tennessee and began his military service in \nthe Reserve Officers Training Corps at East Tennessee State University. \nIn 1961, he earned the bachelor of science degree in business \nadministration from that institution and was commissioned in the U.S. \nArmy. He later earned the master of business administration degree from \nButler University. General Brooks has also studied at the Army War \nCollege and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.\n  General Brooks has a military record of distinction. Beginning as a \nplatoon leader in the 2d Infantry Division, General Brooks rose \nsteadily in a number of administrative positions. In addition to \nservice throughout the United States, he has served as commander of the \ntransfer and reception station in Puerto Rico, and as an adjutant \ngeneral in Vietnam and in Europe. The culmination of his distinguished \nwork came in 1990, when he assumed command of the U.S. Army Soldier \nSupport Center at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased today to pay tribute to a great American. \nGeneral Brooks stands as a symbol of American military achievement, and \nit is my privilege to salute his life and work.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6762-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6762-S6763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             CHILDREN ARE THE VICTIMS OF NATIONAL POLICIES\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Abigail Trafford of the Washington \nPost wrote a commentary recently that I ask be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks. She writes that we as a Nation care immensely \nwhen tragedies involving individual children come to our attention, but \nwe fail to care enough for children who are hurt by our national \npolicies.\n  A recent example of this is our national sense of outrage and \ncompassion regarding the children killed in the \n[[Page S6763]] Oklahoma City bombing. We were all rightfully outraged \nthat innocent children were killed in this senseless act of violence. \nBut we cannot and should not accept the fact that millions of innocent \nchildren do not have adequate health care, which results in the \npremature death and disability of many, many children. Perhaps if we \nwere able to put a face on every single child who suffers from lack of \naccess to health care, we would have a national policy that ensures all \nchildren would have their health care needs met.\n  There are important reasons why we need to act soon. A report \nreleased a few months ago by the Employee Benefit Research Institute \nshows that between 1992 and 1993, the number of uninsured people \nincreased 17.8 percent to 40.9 million. The most alarming finding, \nhowever, is that children account for the largest proportion of the \nincrease in the number of the uninsured. In 1993, 11.1 million children \ndid not have health care coverage.\n  In addition, if the enormous cuts in the Medicaid Program that have \nbeen proposed by some of my colleagues are enacted, there will be a \ntremendous increase in the number of uninsured children. That is \nbecause Medicaid currently provides health care coverage to \napproximately 13.5 million children whose families could not otherwise \nafford to take their children to a doctor.\n  To address this problem, I will introduce legislation next month to \nensure that all children, beginning with children under 7, and pregnant \nwomen have affordable coverage for comprehensive, high-quality health \ncare. My proposed maximizes State flexibility while ensuring full \naccountability for results, and relies on the private sector to deliver \nthe highest quality care at the lowest price.\n  If you agree that we need to protect our children, I welcome your \ninterest and urge you to help me develop a proposal that all of us can \nsupport. Dr. Birt Harvey of the Stanford University Medical School \nstates in Ms. Trafford's article, ``We care about children as \nindividuals. We don't care about them as a nation.'' I hope we can work \ntogether to change that.\n  The article follows:\n                     [Washington Post, May 9, 1995]\n\n            We Love the Child, But What About the Children?\n\n                         (By Abigail Trafford)\n\n       It was the baby in the firefighter's arms--little Baylee \n     Almon covered with dust and blood--who became the symbol of \n     the nation's agony in the Oklahoma City bombing. Long after \n     rubble from the bombing is cleared, we remember Baylee and \n     the others in the doomed day-care center.\n       Suffer the children.\n       We are a nation that loves children. Obsesses about \n     children. The child in pain, the child in triumph--we hang on \n     every detail. We open our hearts--and our pocketbooks--to \n     help a high-profile child in need. Children are our \n     conscience.\n       Or are they?\n       You would certainly think so from the way we respond to \n     children in the news. We have a track record for turning the \n     child in the public spotlight into a metaphor of what kind of \n     people we are and who we care about most.\n       We held our breath when Jessica, the 18-month-old toddler \n     of Midland, Tex., was buried for 2\\1/2\\ days in an abandoned \n     well in 1987. And cheered when she was hauled out by a crane \n     into the glare of television lights and cameras.\n       We agonized over David, the boy in the bubble. Born with a \n     rare immune disease, he died in 1984 after spending most of \n     his 12 years of life inside a sterile plastic cage that kept \n     him away from common germs--and away from human touch.\n       And last year, we grieved for Michael, 3, and Alexander, 14 \n     months, the two boys of Susan Smith, the young South Carolina \n     mother who confessed to sending her sons to a water grave.\n       Suffer the children.\n       Every child who makes the news taps into the public's huge \n     reservoir of concern for children in trouble, for children \n     who are victims. But this outpouring of anguish and \n     generosity usually stops with the high-profile case.\n       The fact is that as a nation we neglect our children, \n     particularly the ones who are sick and poor. That was the \n     conclusion of a 1991 bipartisan national commission on \n     children. ``. . . at every age, among all races and income \n     groups, and in communities nationwide, many children are in \n     jeopardy,'' stated the commission in its executive summary. \n     ``If we measure success not just by how well most children \n     do, but by how poorly some fare, America falls far short.''\n       Advocates for children like to point out that the United \n     States is the only industrialized country that doesn't have a \n     national policy to support children. While a patchwork of \n     government and private programs help certain groups of \n     children, there is no comprehensive commitment to the young \n     the way there is to the elderly. As Sara Rosenbaum, co-\n     director of the George\n      Washington University Center for Health Policy Research, \n     explains: ``Children are the most vulnerable segment of \n     society. They don't have the clout that other population \n     groups have. If children are falling apart, it has \n     tremendous consequences for the nation.''\n       To be sure, the prime responsibility for the health and \n     safety of children rests with the family. But some families \n     cannot provide the basic supports. The needs, according to \n     the bipartisan report, involve many aspects of children's \n     lives including housing, education and protection from abuse.\n       One of the biggest needs is health insurance. An increasing \n     number of children do not have health coverage from private \n     or public sources. There is no national health plan for \n     children that automatically covers them as the Medicare \n     program does for the elderly.\n       ``We care about children as individuals. We don't care \n     about them as a nation,'' says Birt Harvey, professor \n     emeritus at the Stanford University Medical School and past \n     president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       ``It's a crisis of conscience and it's a crisis of \n     consciousness,'' adds Susan S. Aronson, clinical professor of \n     pediatrics at the Medical College of Pennsylvania and \n     Hahnemann University. ``We've lost our perspective as a \n     society that we are responsible for children.''\n       Statistics tell the dismal story. Since 1991, the number of \n     uninsured children has risen from 9.5 million to 11.1 million \n     in 1993, according to an analysis by the Employee Benefit \n     Research Institute. The percentage of uninsured children has \n     also increased and of the additional 1.1 million Americans \n     who have recently lost health coverage, more than 920,000 are \n     children. This increase occurred despite expanded coverage of \n     children under Medicaid.\n       What's more, private coverage of children has declined. The \n     largest jump in uninsured children took place in families \n     where the father was working for a small firm with fewer than \n     10 employees, researchers found.\n       Three basic options to cover all children and pregnant \n     women have been circulating in the backwaters of the nation's \n     capital for some years: provide subsidies for the uninsured \n     to purchase health coverage, create a Medicare type program \n     for children, and open up Medicaid to more families. While \n     there is a general consensus that all children ought to have \n     access to basic medical services, there is not a lot of \n     agreement on how to get there. And right now there's very \n     little apparent interest in Congress or the Clinton \n     administration to do much of anything. As Harvey observes: \n     ``It doesn't seem like a high priority--it doesn't seem like \n     a priority at all.''\n       Suffer the children.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/16/senate-section/article/S6762-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6763-S6764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF DEPUTY CHIEF JOHN F.

Moriarty on his retirement from 50 years of service to \nthe Stamford Police Department in Stamford, CT, where he was honored on \nApril 29, 1995. Deputy Chief Moriarty was born and raised in Stamford, \nCT. Jack's career began as a special constable with the former town \npolice department on June 15, 1944, and he served in this capacity \nuntil his appointment as a regular police officer 5 years later on \nNovember 17, 1949.\n  Jack Moriarty served during the consolidation of the city of Stamford \nand the town of Stamford Police Departments into what has now become \nthe Stamford Police Department. During his long and honorable tenure, \nhe served with 8 police chiefs, 13 mayors and 1 first selectman. His \ndedication, intelligence, and foresight to duty, all contributed to \nJack's many promotions throughout the years, including sergeant, \nlieutenant, captain, and ultimately deputy chief in November 1981. His \nfinal assignment was as commanding officer, administration and support \nservices, where he served with distinction until his retirement on \nDecember 30, 1994.\n  Jack continues to reside in Stamford, and is a life long member of \nSaint Mary's Roman Catholic Church where he is one of the two lay \ntrustees and a member and past president of the church's Holy Name \nSociety. He also has a membership to an assorted selection of groups \nincluding the Knights of Columbus, Saint Augustine Council No. 41, the \nboard of directors of Saint Camillus Health Center, Stamford Police \nAssociation, Inc., and the Police Association of Connecticut. He and \nhis beloved wife Jean, have four children and seven grandchildren, all \nwith Irish first names. Jack's work and commitment to helping those in \nneed has been an inspiration to those who know him. I salute Deputy \nChief John Moriarty on his retirement for his never-ending energy and \nsteadfast devotion to the Stamford Police Department.\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this week is National Police Week, \n7 days we set aside to honor the men and women who put themselves in \nharm's way--every day--so that our neighborhoods and communities can be \nsafer places to live.\n  National Police Week was proclaimed by President John F. Kennedy in \n1963. On the first day of this important week, designated as Peace \nOfficer Memorial Day, we pay tribute to the brave officers killed in \nthe line of duty. At a special ceremony yesterday in our Nation's \nCapital, the names of those men and women who gave their lives in 1994 \nwere engraved into a memorial and candles were lit in their honor. Our \nhearts go out to the families and loved ones of those who made the \nultimate sacrifice to protect and preserve our way of life.\n  This year, in addition to offering our deep gratitude, we should give \nour police officers a helping hand. While we have won some important \nvictories in the war on crime--through the passage last year of the \ncrime bill and legislation to keep guns off the streets--we still have \na long way to go.\n  We know that our streets will not be safe as long as our police \nofficers are outgunned and outnumbered. Last year, 13 California police \nofficers were killed in the line of duty. Seven California officers \nhave died in the line of duty in the first 4\\1/2\\ months of 1995. They \ngave their lives to protect ours. Knowing they put themselves at such \ngreat risk every day, we cannot in good conscience send a single \nofficer out on the street without doing everything possible to give \nthem the tools they need to protect us.\n  I urge everyone take a stand for the safety of our Nation's peace \nofficers. Call upon your legislators to continue to enact tough crime \nmeasures, and to oppose any weakening of the crime bill or the assault \nweapons ban. Do it to honor the brave men and women who help keep our \nstreets safe, and do it for your community and those you love.\n  I ask that a list of the brave California peace officer killed in the \nline of duty in 1994 be printed at this point in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n                              In Memorium\n\n       Officer Clarence W.
