Mr. President, I have requested and gained an hour of \nmorning business under a special order today to discuss the beginning \nof what I believe will be one of the most historic debates that the \nCongress of the United States will engage itself in and most certainly \nthat the 104th Congress will become involved in. That debate will begin \nin the House today and will begin in the Senate early next week.\n  What I am talking about is an issue that many of us for a good number \nof years have believed is the most important issue to bring our \nGovernment back on track and to focus it on the priorities that the \nAmerican people want us to focus on and that, of course, is the issue \nof our fiscal matters and our spending under a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  In November of this year, as for a good many years, the American \npeople have spoken very loudly about their desire to see this Congress, \nand all past Congresses, move in a fiscally responsible way. Our \nfailure to do so over the last good many decades has produced our \nNation's largest Federal debt of now 4.6-plus trillions of dollars. It \nhas produced an annualized deficit of nearly $200 billion and an \ninterest on debt--now the second-largest payment in our Federal \nbudget--of nearly $300 billion a year.\n  I think the American people spoke with fright and alarm this year, \nthat this Congress and its political leaders seem to be unsensitive to \nthe continued mounting of a Federal debt and the potential impact that \ndebt will have on future generations.\n  Before the President pro tempore opened the Senate this morning, I \nasked him if he would address us on this issue briefly before he \nresumed his duties as chairman of a very important committee in the \nSenate. Certainly, for all of his political life, Senator Thurmond has \nled this issue, has offered the American people and the Congress of the \nUnited States the foresight to focus on the issue of balancing the \nFederal budget, and he was the first, some 30-plus years ago, to \nintroduce the concept of a constitutional amendment for a federally \nbalanced budget.\n  At this time, I yield to Senator Thurmond such time as he might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                      A Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I am very pleased to say a few words \non behalf of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I have \nbeen in the Senate 40 years now and for 36 of those years I have \nfavored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I worked with \nSenator Harry Byrd, Sr., Senator Styles Bridges, Harry Byrd, Jr., and \nmany others in the past, in an effort to get this amendment adopted.\n   [[Page S1478]] As chairman of the Judiciary Committee a few years \nago when President Reagan was the President, I was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and was the author of a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. We got that amendment through the committee and we \ngot it through the Senate. We sent it to the House and the House killed \nit. The Speaker of the House and the majority leader led the movement \nto kill that amendment.\n  Evidently, they did not want to stop spending. And the spending has \ngone on year after year after year. We have not balanced this budget \nbut one time in 32 years. We have not balanced this budget but eight \ntimes in 64 years. That is a disgrace to this Nation. We should not \nspend more than we take in in any year. And if we do spend more, it \nshould be made up immediately.\n  Under the South Carolina law and constitution, we have to balance the \nbudget every year, and we do it. If we can do it in South Carolina, we \ncan do it in the United States. It is nothing but reasonableness and \nfairness and exercising foresight that will balance the budget.\n  I am very anxious to see us pass this amendment. I think it would be \nthe greatest step we could take.\n  There are two threats to this Nation that we must realize. One is \nthat we must keep strong armed services. We have threats now throughout \nthe world. We have hot spots in North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and other \nplaces. We must keep a strong defense if we are going to remain free.\n  President Clinton has taken steps to reduce our strength in defense. \nI am hoping we can rebuild that strength. We need to make the 1996 \nbudget for defense equal to the 1995 budget. We must take steps to \nrebuild defense so that this Nation can remain free and strong and \npreserve all that this country has stood for.\n  The other threat is the fiscal threat, and that is a serious threat. \nWhen we have not balanced this budget but one time in 32 years, that \nmeans it is a threat. How are we ever going to balance it if we do not \ntake steps?\n I remember a statute was passed years ago to balance the budget. \nBefore the end of the session, we had passed appropriations to overcome \nthat statute. The statute did not amount to anything. It will not \namount to anything now.\n\n  The only way, in my judgment, to stop spending more than we take in \nand to balance this budget is to pass a constitutional amendment to \nmandate, to make, the Congress do it. The Congress has not shown the \nattitude to do it. They have not shown the will to do it.\n  How are we going to handle it? I do not know of any other way under \nthe Sun to do it except to pass this constitutional amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to go forth and show the courage and take the steps \nnecessary to balance this budget. The best way I know to do it is to \npass this constitutional amendment.\n  First, I want to commend the able Senator from Idaho for the great \ninterest and leadership he has shown on this important question. He is \na very fine representative. He represents his State and Nation well. On \nthis particular question he has shown unusual leadership and is to be \ncommended.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me thank the Senator from South \nCarolina and once again recognize his early and continued leadership on \nthis most critical issue. I thank him for making those opening comments \nthis morning on this special order as we begin to debate the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  As I mentioned in my opening comments, Madam President, the House \nbegins debate on House Joint Resolution 1. Under the rule reported from \nthe Rules Committee, six substitute amendments are in order from the \nfollowing Members: Mr. Barton, Mr. Owens, Mr. Wise, Mr. Conyers, Mr. \nGephardt, and Schaefer-Stenholm. In other words, the House is looking \nat a variety of approaches to offer an amendment through the resolution \nprocess to our American citizens.\n  Of course, we must recognize that any one of those resolutions, as is \ntrue of the resolution here in the Senate, has to gain the necessary \ntwo-thirds vote for final passage. There will be about 3 hours of \ngeneral debate and 1 hour of debate on each one of the substitutes.\n  The reason I bring this up, Madam President, is because early next \nweek we will begin debate on a very similar resolution to the Schaefer-\nStenholm resolution. Already there is talk that that debate could go on \nfor 2 weeks, 3 weeks. There could be 200 or 300 amendments, all dealing \nwith different aspects of Federal spending that some Members of the \nSenate think ought to be exempt from the rule or the constitutional \nrequirement of a balanced budget.\n  Whatever time we take in the House and in the Senate, I believe the \nmost significance to that time will be reflective on the importance of \nthis debate and the attention the American people are giving it. There \nwill be a good many arguments about whether we should or should not \nbalance the Federal budget, whether we should exempt certain portions \nof the budget, whether we should clearly establish priorities of \nspending within the Constitution, or whether we ought to be sensible, \nas I think the Senate resolution is, to establish the ground rules of a \nconstitutional requirement for a balanced budget and then to recognize, \nas I think all Americans recognize, that over the length and breadth \nand strength of a Constitution now having directed the Senate for over \n208 years, that it is the Congress itself what must establish the \nspending priorities from one generation to another.\n  It is clearly important that we establish the rule of a balanced \nbudget and the dynamics of how we get to a balanced budget through a \nprocedure. Certainly, it is the responsibility of the House and the \nSenate, of the Congress of the United States, to establish the spending \npriorities. That certainly is what the Senator from South Carolina was \nreferring to this morning when he placed high on the list of priorities \nfor the strength and stability of our Nation in a world of nations our \nnational defense and a concern that that ought to be, as our Founding \nFathers said, one of the primary responsibilities of a Federal central \ngovernment: providing for our national defense and our human freedoms. \nThat is a priority that the Senator from South Carolina would \nestablish. It would be a priority similar to the one that I would want. \nIt would list high on a number of items that I might place as \npriorities for spending.\n  What is reality today is that there is no fiscal discipline within \nthe bodies of the Congress of the United States, so there need not be \nthe listing of priorities, there need not be the responsibility of \nturning to the American citizen and saying, ``Here is the money we have \nto spend; here is where we are going to spend it'' because we believe \nthat is the best priority outline that we can offer to the American \npeople at this time.\n  Second, under our Constitution, we have clear obligations, and that \nis, of course, to provide for the common defense and, in the words of \nour Constitution or the preamble, to promote our Nation's welfare.\n  I am pleased to be joined this morning with the Senator from Wyoming, \nand I ask at this time if he would like to participate in our special \norder. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                  A BALANCED BUDGET IS NOT A NEW IDEA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I am pleased to \nhave the opportunity to join in to talk about a balanced budget \namendment.\n  There has been a great deal of talk about it. There continues to be a \ngreat deal of talk about it. There is a great deal of interest in this \nmatter, as there should be. I think most of all, as evidenced by the \nleadership of the Senator from Idaho, there is a great deal of \ndedication to getting this job done.\n  Voters supported the idea in November. It is not a new idea. Somehow \nsome of the discussion seems to center on what will we do with such a \nthing. The fact is that it is not a new idea. It is not a new idea for \nthe Congress. It is not a new idea for the Nation. Indeed, it is used \nby 48 States now, and used successfully in my State of Wyoming. We have \na constitutional balanced budget amendment. The legislature and the \ngovernment live by that constitutional amendment without a great deal \nof problem, as a matter of fact.\n  So, it seems to me that it is terribly important. It is important \nbecause it \n[[Page S1479]] will result in a balanced budget amendment and a \nbalanced budget that we all agree should happen.\n  It is also a symbol of responsibility, both morally and fiscally. So \nit is something that we really ought to do. There are, of course, a \ncouple of questions that are always asked. The first question and the \nbasic question we ought to ask ourselves and voters ask themselves and \ncitizens ought to ask themselves is: Should we, in fact, balance the \nbudget? Should we in the Congress spend more than we take in? Should we \nlive on the same basis as our families must? As our businesses must? As \nlocal governments must? And that is, that we have to have a balance \nbetween revenue and expenditures, a reasonable thing. That first \nquestion is: Should we do that? The answer is, I think, almost \nunanimous, not only among Members of the Congress, but among voters and \namong citizens: Yes, indeed, we should do that.\n  So, a citizen in Greybull, WY, says: What is the discussion about? I \ndo not quite understand this. Of course we ought to balance the budget.\n  The fact is we have not balanced the budget and we need to do \nsomething about it.\n  He says: Gosh, everyone says they are for a balanced budget. Do you \nknow of anyone who says, no, we should not balance the budget? Of \ncourse not. Everyone wants to balance the budget. And yet we find more \nand more people who are saying, ``What is the hurry? Let us delay this. \nI am not sure about this. Let us talk about it,'' as if we had not \ntalked about it before.\n  They oppose the amendment saying we do not need an amendment; we have \nthe tools. The Director of OMB was on TV the other day in sort of a \ndebate about it and saying, ``Gosh, we do not need an amendment; we can \nbalance the budget. We have the tools.'' The fact is, the evidence is, \nthat that is not true. We have not balanced the budget. We have \nbalanced the budget once, I think, in 26 years or something and just a \nfew times out of the last 50 years.\n  So the fact is that there does need to be some discipline. The idea \nthat we want to balance the budget does not just make it happen. I \nunderstand why it does not happen. There is always a reluctance to \nraise revenues and there is always a willingness on the part of \npoliticians to want to do things for their constituents.\n And I understand that. The result, of course, is that we spend much \nmore than we take in. The result is that we have nearly a $5 trillion \ndeficit that you and I and our children and our grandchildren must live \nwith.\n\n  So then some say, ``Well, what about the details? We want to know \nprecisely how you are going to do this.'' Obviously, that is almost an \nimpossibility. It is going to be done over a period of time and, I must \ntell you, I am not concerned about the fact that it is 5 years or 7 \nyears or, personally, if it is 10 years. If we are in a course toward \nbalancing the budget, moving without deviation to that, if it takes \nlonger, let it take longer.\n  But who knows what the economy will be in 5 years? Who knows? So the \nidea that you can lay out in detail how you are going to do it does not \nseem to be reasonable. It seems to me, rather, to be a way of saying, \n``Yes, I am for a balanced budget, but unless you can give the details, \nthen I am not for it.'' It is simply a way of saying I am for it and \nnot for it, which is not a new technique in this place, by the way. It \nis done quite often.\n  The other interesting thing about that is the same person will say, \n``We can balance the budget without the amendment, but I want to know \nthe details if you are going to have an amendment; tell me the details \nof how you are going to do it without an amendment.'' The cuts are \ngoing to have to be about the same.\n  Then I heard someone this morning on TV say, ``We want to know about \nSocial Security.'' We have clearly said Social Security is not to be a \npart of the reduction. We have clearly said that Social Security is an \nobligation that we have to Social Security recipients.\n  We hear a great deal about cuts, as if there would be draconian cuts \nto do this. The fact of the matter is that what we are really talking \nabout is a reduction in the growth. That is what it takes, the \ndiscipline to have a reduction in the growth.\n  I noticed there are others on the floor who want to talk about this. \nI feel very strongly about the balanced budget amendment. As I \nindicated, as a member of the Wyoming Legislature, I was involved with \nthis process. I think it works. I think it should work for us on the \nnational level. I think we have a great opportunity to do that now.\n  I think this is one of the procedural changes that we really need to \nhave if you want to have a change in Government. Procedural changes \nare, in the long run, more important than are the specific changes that \nwe will make in this year or any other year because they change the way \nthat the Congress deals with problems.\n  Procedural changes, like the one that we have already passed on \nmaking the Congress accountable, to live under the same rules that we \nexpect everyone else to live under, changes like line-item veto are \nvery important, it seems to me.\n  It is almost impossible for Members of this body or the House to \nreach into bills and make changes on the floor. But the President is \nthe only person who has the kind of political structure on which to \nstand to make those sorts of cuts in pork. The line-item veto is very \nimportant.\n  I happen to believe that unfunded mandates is one that we have to \npass. Procedurally, that will change the future of how this Congress \nbehaves. I personally believe we ought to have term limits. These are \nthe procedural changes that will impact the decisions we make.\n  I am persuaded--I think most people in this country are persuaded--it \nis morally and fiscally correct to balance the budget. I am persuaded \nthe evidence shows we have not and cannot do it without the discipline \nof an amendment. I am persuaded that the States and the people, through \ntheir legislatures, ought to have a chance to deal with it on a \nconstitutional basis.\n  I urge that we move forward and give the people of America an \nopportunity to deal with this issue through their legislatures.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  (Mr. JEFFORDS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nparticipating with us this morning in the discussion of the debate \nthat, as I mentioned earlier, is beginning today in the House and will \ncommence next week in the Senate, one of the most important debates, I \nthink, any of us who are privileged to serve in this Chamber will \nengage in in the course of the next good many years.\n  Let me now yield such time as he would desire to the Senator from \nGeorgia for comments on the balanced budget amendment.\n\n\n                    A Great Issue Before the Nation\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for the \nopportunity to share thoughts on this great issue before the Nation \ncalled a balanced budget amendment.\n  I really do not think we would be in this debate this year except for \none thing: I believe this would have passed the U.S. Senate last year. \nWe had a very strong debate and very narrowly failed to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment a full year ago.\n  Why did we not pass it? In my judgment, it failed because the \nPresident of the United States chose to oppose it. When it was clear \nthat the President would not throw his weight behind this idea, I \nsensed the energy in letter after letter coming in from one special \ninterest group after another that had become dependent upon the Federal \nGovernment and its largess, stacks upon stacks upon stacks, in an \neffort to frighten the American people about the consequences of a \ndiscipline machinery to deal with the financial health of our Nation.\n  Fair tactics--will somebody be affected? Will there be less there for \nthem if we manage the financial health of the Nation?\n  In my judgment, we would have passed it had the President assisted.\n  This is important as we begin this debate, Mr. President, because \nshortly thereafter--shortly thereafter--the Nation had a chance to \nreflect on that debate and this Presidency, and the contest that has \nbeen waging in our Nation's Capital about governance, how are we going \nto govern ourselves? As we have, or are we going to change our ways in \nthe Nation's Capital?\n   [[Page S1480]] The election of November 8 probably is only \nparalleled maybe four other times in American history. Four other times \nin the entire history of this Nation has the whole of the Nation come \nso forcefully to an election. I think much of it was shaped by that \nbalanced budget debate which was defeated with the weight of the \nPresidency against it.\n  Then we have a public opportunity to comment and the public says, \n``We want the way things are done in Washington changed and we are \ngoing to change the people who represent us there.'' And they did, in \noverwhelming numbers.\n  At the center of the debate, over and over, was the balanced budget \namendment. The people who were sent here are supporters of the balanced \nbudget amendment. Many of the people who opposed it were not returned. \nToday, between 7 and 8 out of 10 Americans across the land support the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  In the last few weeks, we have heard talk about ``reinventing the \nPresident.'' From my point of view--I am sure my advice is not adhered \nto down at the Pennsylvania Avenue White House--you really cannot \nreinvent people who have been in public life a quarter of a century. I \ndo not think it is a useful term. But in any event, ``reinventing the \nPresident.''\n  Last night, we were to have our first view of the new look. I think \nit has all paled and will all be forgotten and will all be set aside \nexcept for two paragraphs of the speech; a 1\\1/2\\-hour speech and about \na 3-minute piece will be the substance that will be remembered.\n  That is when the President about midway through the speech said, ``I \ndo not support the balanced budget amendment,'' having supported a \nbalanced budget. But that is the routine we have been playing for the \nlast 30, 35 years. We all support a balanced budget, but we never get \nto one.\n  To me, the President defined and made vivid his decision about the \nnext 2 years of his administration when he decided: ``I do not support \nthe balanced budget amendment.'' That means that the message of \nNovember 8 has not been embraced by this President. Anything that was \nso core to the election, so overwhelmingly supported, to be rejected in \nthe face of all this, to be set aside, that he will stand in the way of \nthat yet again as he did last year, defines his view of this capital \ncity. What it says is I think things are just fine the way they are. I \ndo not think we need to change the rules. We do not need to change the \nrules to balance the budget. The reason so many Americans support it is \nthey do not believe that anymore. And why should they? We never do.\n  Mr. President, the American people realize that we must change the \nprocess and the procedures by which we deal with governance in this \ncountry. They believe the Federal Government has become too big; that \nit exacts too much of the fruit of their labor. They work from January \nto June, some of them August, before they get to keep the first dime \nfor their own dreams. They feel the Federal Government has become too \nintrusionary, too much in their face.\n  The balanced budget amendment is symbol and substance--symbol and \nsubstance. It symbolizes that we are going to change; that we are going \nto reorder the way we manage our financial health; that we are going to \ncome to grips finally with the setting of priorities; that we are going \nto force ourselves to pick that which we can do and that which we \ncannot do.\n  When the President decided he would not support it, he was saying, \nloud and clear, we are going to keep on doing things just the way we \nhave been, and I am not going to listen to the message of November 8.\n  Then he went a step further; he began using the same techniques that \nhave been used historically to frighten America, to frighten her about \na discipline and a new set of rules, to start picking out different \ngroups of people and saying, now, wait a minute. If we start setting \npriorities, this may affect you.\n  It had been that technique over the years that has blocked, time and \ntime again, our coming to grips with our priorities. You know what I \nwould say to those groups? I would say that if this Nation does not \nfind a way to discipline its financial management, it will be unable to \ncare for anyone.\n  Have you ever known a family, have you ever known a business, have \nyou ever known a community, a State or a nation that was able to \neffectively provide for its needs and its priorities if it was \nfinancially weakened or unhealthy or it had been undisciplined in the \nprocess by which it governed itself, that it had mounted debt it could \nno longer control?\n  We only need to look south of the border, not far from here, to know \nwhat happens when you do not have sound financial management. Who is \nimpacted by that? By every report, the disadvantaged, the poor. Those \nwho are on the margin are the ones who are going to suffer from that \ncrisis in Mexico.\n  The balanced budget amendment is a fundamental core process that \nforces our Nation to set priorities and assures us that we will always \nmaintain financial integrity, and that integrity is fundamental to our \nability to take care of our responsibilities for ourselves and our \nresponsibilities as the leader of the free world and civil order in \nthat world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Georgia for \nthose well-placed comments and pointing out some of the stark reality \nof the debate and the support and the opposition for this most \nimportant issue.\n  I was in the Chamber of the House last night for the State of the \nUnion speech, and I was very disappointed when our President used the \nold argument: well, if you are going to balance the budget, show us \nwhere you are going to cut.\n  That is like saying to a man or a woman who is terribly overweight \nand they are just getting ready to start a diet, tell me every bite of \nfood you are going to take over the next 4 or 5 years to lose all of \nyour weight--every bite, every kind of food.\n  You and I know that is not possible. What we do know, when someone \nannounces they are on a diet and has consulted a doctor and is \nbeginning to work, they have started a process, and they have begun to \nwork toward a goal and they have put themselves on a regimentation.\n  Mr. President, that is a phony argument, and you used it last night, \nand you know it is. Over the next 5 or 6 or 7 years, as the Senator \nfrom Wyoming spoke, as we balance the Federal budget, priorities may \nshift, they may change a little, and we may choose to spend less in one \narea and more in another because we have seen that is where the \nAmerican citizenry needs their tax dollars spent.\n  So as the Senator from Georgia said, what we speak about today and \nwhat begins in the House today and on this floor next week is the \ndebate about putting into the Constitution a process requiring a \nprocedure through a process that gets us to a balanced budget and \nbegins to build the enforcement of what we hope would become a standard \ndiscipline in this Congress, and that would be to balance the budget on \nan annual basis.\n  Mr. President, we are now joined by our colleague from Michigan who \njust in the past few months has campaigned on this issue and others. \nThe people of Michigan decided to send him here to work in their behalf \non issues like the balanced budget, and I would now yield to that \nSenator such time as he might consume.\n                       balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, as Congress prepares to take up a \nbalanced budget amendment, I would like to offer to my Senate \ncolleagues the perspective of a new freshman Senator who ran on an \naggressive platform to reform Congress and limit the size of \nGovernment.\n  In my view, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nembodies the spirit of the electorate that voted for a Republican \nCongress for the first time in 40 years last November. We in the Senate \nshould not let them down.\n  The Founding Fathers recognized that persistent Government deficits \nand the growth of Government has consequences for the long-term \nstability of our democracy and implications for our individual \nfreedoms.\n  The reason why the Founding Fathers did not include a balanced budget \nrequirement in the Constitution is because they felt it would be \nsuperfluous. \n[[Page S1481]] Paying off the national debt and balancing the budget \nwas considered a high priority of the early administrations.\n  Consider the following comments by some of our Nation's early \nleaders:\n  Thomas Jefferson: ``The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be \nfeared by a republican government.''\n  John Quincy Adams: ``Stewards of the public money should never suffer \nwithout urgent necessity to be transcended the maxim of keeping the \nexpenditures of the year within the limits of its receipts.''\n  James Monroe: ``After the elimination of the public debt, the \nGovernment would be left at liberty to apply such portions of the \nrevenue as may not be necessary for current expenses to such other \nobjects as may be most conducive to the public security and welfare.''\n  From 1879 until about 1933 the Federal Government operated under an \nimplicit balanced budget requirement. Spending remained low--and rarely \nexceeded revenues. To the greatest extent possible, the existing debt \nwas reduced.\n  As a consequence, Federal spending as a share of GNP never rose above \n10 percent. In the mid-1930's, the rise of Keynesian economics gave \npoliticians the economic rationale to increase Government spending to \nsolve the Nation's economic problems. As a consequence, the balanced \nbudget discipline was abandoned--and Federal spending exploded.\n  Today, Federal spending as a share of our national income stands at \n22-23 percent--near historic levels. In effect, deficit spending has \nbecome the norm.\n  Because there are no limits to the availability of deficit spending, \nMembers of Congress find it extraordinarily difficult to resist such \nspending. On the one hand, every dollar of deficit spending creates \nsome measure of political advantage by pleasing parts of a Member's \nconstituency; on the other hand, there is no need for Members to incur \nequivalent political disadvantage by having to raise anyone's taxes.\n  All the balanced budget amendment does is eliminate from our system \nthis built-in bias toward spending caused by the unlimited access to \ndeficit spending.\n  Critics of the amendment charge that it is a hollow gimmick, a \nsubstitute for making real choices about how to balance the budget. \nPerhaps the best way to respond to this charge is to examine how \nbalanced budget constraints have worked on the State level. Every State \nexcept Vermont has some sort of statutory or constitutional requirement \nto balance its budget.\n  According to economist Bruce Bartlett, in 1933 total Federal spending \nwas $3.9 billion and total State and local spending was $7 billion; 60 \nyears later, however, the situation was almost reversed. By 1993, \nFederal spending had risen to $1.5 trillion, while total State and \nlocal spending had risen to $865 billion.\n  The fact that State governments were required to make real choices \nand balance their budgets, while the Federal Government did not, was \nthe major reason why Federal spending has dramatically outraced State \nand local spending.\n  Without a balanced budget amendment, this Nation could be looking at \nFederal deficits in the trillions of dollars within 15 years. I was \nsent here by people who will not accept such a fate.\n  The proposed amendment does not read into the Constitution any \nparticular level of spending or taxation, or mandate particular \neconomic policy outcomes. It only restores the historical relationship \nbetween levels of public spending and available public resources. \nNational solvency is not--nor should it be--a partisan political \nprinciple. It should be a fundamental principle of our Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                       Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Michigan for \nsaying that a balanced budget amendment should be a fundamental \nprinciple. It was historically. While it was not embodied in our \nConstitution, it was a fundamental principle of our Founding Fathers. \nAnd it was a fundamental principle of many Congresses for well over a \ncentury.\n  This Congress, this Government recognized there might be times of \ndeficit. But during the good times, after you had overspent--whether it \nwas for war or for other extraordinary purposes--you paid off your \ndebt. In fact you ran a surplus.\n  That was an important part of the way our Nation kept its fiscal \nhouse in order. Of course we have lost that principle and now, for many \ndecades, we have run deficits that mounted the debt I referred to \nearlier. Over the course of the next good many weeks there will be a \nvariety of arguments about why we cannot balance the Federal budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nBusiness Daily that appeared this morning entitled ``A Balanced Budget \nMyth Bared: Economic Cycles Unlikely To Worsen Under Plan.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Investors Business Daily, Jan. 25, 1995]\n\n A Balanced Budget Myth Bared; Economy Cycles Unlikely To Worsen Under \n                                  Plan\n\n                           (By John Merline)\n\n       A balanced budget amendment will either restore fiscal \n     sanity to a town drunk on deficit spending or lead the \n     country toward economic ruin.\n       Those, at least, are the stark terms typically used by \n     supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment \n     outlawing deficit spending.\n       And, while passage of a balanced budget amendment is almost \n     a sure thing this year, debates over its merits remain \n     fierce--with critics from all sides of the political spectrum \n     lobbing grenades at it.\n       Democrats don't like the rigidity it imposes while \n     conservatives fear it may bias Congress towards tax \n     increases.\n       One of the principal criticisms of the amendment is that it \n     would short-circuit the federal government's ability to fight \n     recessions, either with ``automatic stabilizers'' or with \n     stimulus spending like temporary tax cuts or spending hikes. \n     Yet there is little evidence to support this view.\n       ``When purchasing power falls in the private sector, the \n     budget restores some of that loss, thereby cushioning the \n     slide,'' said White House budget director Alice Rivlin in \n     testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this \n     month.\n       ``Unemployment compensation, food stamps and other programs \n     fill the gap in family budgets--and in overall economy \n     activity--until conditions improve,'' she said, defending the \n     budgetary ``automatic stabilizers.''\n       In addition, because of the progressive income tax code, \n     tax liability falls faster than incomes drop in a recession, \n     slowing the decline in after-tax incomes.\n       The result, however, is typically an increase in the \n     deficit.\n       Mandatory balanced budgets would, she argued, force \n     lawmakers either to raise taxes or cut spending in a \n     recession to counteract increased deficits.\n       ``Fiscal policy would exaggerate rather than mitigate \n     swings in the economy,'' she said, ``Recessions would tend to \n     be deeper and longer.''\n       Other economists agree with Rivlin.\n       Edward Regan, a fellow at the Jerome Levy Economics \n     Institute in New York, argued that the amendment would \n     ``restrict government efforts to encourage private sector \n     activity during economic slowdowns.''\n       The assumption, of course, is that these automatic \n     stabilizers actually work as advertised, an assumption not \n     all economists share.\n       ``If anything, I think the government has made economic \n     cycles worse,'' said James Bennett, an economist at George \n     Mason University.\n       Bennett, along with 253 other economists, signed a letter \n     supporting a balanced budget amendment introduced last year \n     by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.\n       Ohio University economist Richard Vedder agrees. ``If you \n     look at the unemployment record, to use that one statistic, \n     it was more favorable in the years before we began automatic \n     stabilizers than in the years since,'' he said.\n       Much of the countercyclical programs were implemented in \n     the wake of the Great Depression.\n       Unemployment data show that in the first three decades of \n     this century the average jobless rate was roughly 4.5%.\n\n\n                           prolonging slumps\n\n       In the four decades since World War II, the rate averaged \n     5.7%. And, from 1970 to 1990, it averaged 6.7%.\n       In addition, some of the stabilizers may actually keep \n     people out of the work force for longer periods of time, \n     possibly prolonging economic slumps.\n       A 1990 Congressional Budget Office study found that two-\n     thirds of workers found jobs within three months after their \n     unemployment benefits ran out--suggesting that many could \n     have found work sooner had they not been paid for staying \n     home.\n       Other data suggest that, at most, federal fiscal policy has \n     had only a small stabilizing effect on the economy, despite \n     the sharp increase in the economic role played by government.\n       A study by economist Christina Romer of the University of \n     California at Berkeley \n     [[Page S1482]] found that economic cycles between 1869 and \n     1918 were only modestly more severe than those following \n     World War II.\n       Romer corrected what she said were serious flaws in data \n     used to suggest that the pre-war economy saw far larger \n     swings in economic cycles.\n       The finding runs contrary to conventional wisdom--which \n     posits that government fiscal programs enacted after the \n     Great Depression have greatly reduced the magnitude of boom \n     and bust cycles.\n       ``I think there are plenty of arguments against the \n     balanced budget amendment,'' said Christina Romer is an \n     interview. ``I would not put much emphasis on taking away the \n     government's ability of having countercyclical fiscal \n     policy.''\n\n\n                           private insurance\n\n       Other economists argue that, even if economic stabilizers \n     made a difference at one time, vast changes in the economy \n     have diluated the importance of government efforts.\n       ``All this policy was formulated before the days of easy \n     access to credit cards, two-earner families, and so on,'' \n     said Bennett.\n       Finally, some economists note that the stabilizers Rivlin \n     points to don't have to be a function of government.\n       Private unemployment, farm or other insurance could provide \n     needed cash during economic downturns, they say, replacing \n     the government programs as the provider of these funds.\n       While the effectiveness of automatic stabilizers is doubted \n     by some, straightout antirecessionary stimulus spending has \n     few outright backers--for one simple reason.\n       Every major stimulus package since 1949 was passed after \n     the recession was already over.\n       These packages typically consisted of temporary tax cuts or \n     spending hikes designed to boost economic demand and \n     artificially stimulate growth.\n       The problem has been that, by the time Congress recognizes \n     the economy is in a slump and approves a package, it's too \n     late.\n\n\n                         too little, too late?\n\n       Clinton's failed stimulus package, for example, was \n     proposed nearly two years after the 1990-91 recession ended, \n     and half of the money wouldn't have been spent until 1994 and \n     1995.\n       A study of the 50-year history of stimulus-packages by \n     Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the Arlington, Va.-based \n     Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, concluded that ``without \n     exception, stimulus programs have failed to moderate the \n     recessions at which they were aimed, and have often sowed the \n     seeds of the next recession.''\n       ``These programs have not been simply worthless, but \n     harmful,'' Bartlett wrote. ``It would have been better to do \n     nothing.''\n       Further, even assuming the economic stabilizers or stimulus \n     spending work as intended, a balanced budget amendment would \n     have little bearing on the government's ability to pursue \n     these policies during recessions.\n       First, the amendment allows Congress to pass an unbalanced \n     budget, as long as it can muster 60% of the votes.\n       And, lawmakers could avoid that by simply running a budget \n     surplus during growth years.\n       ``The best technique is to aim for a modest budget surplus, \n     of about 2% of GDP, over the course of the business cycle,'' \n     Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International \n     Economics, told the Judiciary Committee.\n       ``This would permit the traditional `automatic \n     stabilizers,' and perhaps even some temporary tax cuts and \n     spending increases, to provide a significant stimulus to the \n     economy,'' he said. Interestingly, Rivlin herself made \n     similar arguments in her book, ``Reviving the American \n     Dream,'' which was published shortly before she joined the \n     Clinton administration.\n       In that book, Rivlin said that the federal government \n     should run annual budget surpluses--increasing national \n     savings and, in turn, economic growth.\n       At the same time, Rivlin said the federal government could \n     strengthen federal ``social insurance'' programs designed to \n     mitigate economic swings.\n       To accomplish this, she proposed shifting whole blocks of \n     federal programs down to the states, including education, \n     welfare, job training and so on.\n       Whether the amendment should contain a tax or spending \n     limitation provision is another subject of debate.\n       ``Absent a three-fifths majority provision, there will be \n     significant tax increases if a balanced budget amendment is \n     approved,'' said Allen Shick, a budget expert at the \n     Brookings Institution in Washington, at a recent Brookings-\n     sponsored budget briefing.\n       That is precisely what worries conservatives who insist \n     that the supermajority language is included in the amendment.\n\n\n                        A Supermajority On Taxes\n\n       ``The supermajority requirement is premised on the fact \n     that there is an intrinsic bias in favor of tax increases,'' \n     said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who co-sponsored the tax \n     limitation amendment.\n       While benefits go to specific groups who can effectively \n     lobby Congress, taxes as spread more widely, he said.\n       A balanced budget amendment without a supermajority might, \n     Barton and others argue, exacerbate this bias--requiring a \n     supermajority to borrow money but only a simply majority to \n     raise taxes.\n       He points out that in states with tax limitation laws, \n     taxpayers saw taxes decline 2% as a share of personal income \n     between 1980 and 1987. States without such protection saw \n     taxes climb a comparable 2% over those years.\n       Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., argues that a spending limit, \n     rather than a tax limit, should be included in the amendment.\n       ``It's very important both how you balance the budget and \n     at what level you balance it,'' he told Investor's Business \n     Daily.\n       ``If all you have is a requirement to balance the budget, \n     Congress can fix the level of balance at too large a \n     percentage of gross national product,'' he said.\n\n\n                        spending limit amendment\n\n       Kyl proposes a constitutional limit on federal spending at \n     19% of gross national product--roughly equal to the average \n     level of federal revenues over the past several decades.\n       Not everyone things these limits need to be in the \n     amendment.\n       ``The balanced budget rule should stand alone on its own \n     merits,'' said James Buchanan, Nobel Prize winning economist \n     at George Mason University, at the Judiciary committee \n     hearing. ``To include a tax or spending limit proposal . . . \n     would, I think, make the proposal vulnerable to the charge \n     that a particular economic attitude is to be \n     constitutionalized.''\n       Buchanan argues that such limitations should be passed as \n     separate laws.\n       Others argue that even without a supermajority tax \n     requirement, voters will not stomach more tax hikes. They \n     point to the recent election outcomes as proof of the \n     punishment leveled against tax-raising lawmakers.\n       ``That's the true tax limitation,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, \n     R-Idaho.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the writer of this article suggests that \none of the standard arguments we are hearing, and we have now heard \nbefore both the committees--the Judiciary Committees in the House and \nthe Senate--that have taken testimony on a balanced budget amendment, \nhave come from people like Alice Rivlin who, in testimony for the White \nHouse as the Budget Director, suggests that we cannot possibly strive \nto balance the budget because, she suggests, that when purchasing power \nfalls in the private sector--in other words referencing a recession--\nthat the Federal budget must be there to stimulate, to cushion the \nslide, to cushion the downfall. She and others have used that as a \nstandard argument, that under the ``straitjacket of a balanced budget \namendment, the Federal Government will not have that kind of \nflexibility. As a result, recessions will become deeper, verging on to \ndepressions. Certainly our citizens will suffer as a result of it.''\n  That is what she and other economists believe. They would argue that \nis largely the substantial majority of belief embodied in the community \nof economists in our Nation today.\n  I would like to argue differently. James Bennett, who is an economist \nat George Mason University, along with 235 other economists, have \nsigned a letter supporting a balanced budget amendment of the very kind \nthat the Judiciary Committee here in the Senate has brought forth that \nwe will begin debate on next week.\n  Ohio University economist Richard Vedder agrees that the automatic \nstabilizers, if you will, that Alice Rivlin talks about, really are not \nnecessary if you treat the economy of this country and if you treat the \nbudget of our Government in an interesting way, and that is to keep it \nbalanced and in the good years run a little surplus like they used to \ndo, a good many years ago, and use that surplus in the more difficult \ntimes or recessionary times, to provide the cushion, and that in fact \nyou will have fewer recessions, fewer radical swings in the economy, \nbecause you have created a much more stable private sector with a much \nstronger private sector financing base than to constantly be pulling \nfrom the private sector ever larger sums into the Federal package.\n  Every major stimulus package, this article says--which I think is \nfascinating--every major stimulus package that the Federal Government \nhas passed to soften a recession since 1949 was passed after the \nrecession was over.\n  If you remember, last year our President brought a stimulus package \nto the floor of this Senate, and to the Congress of the United States, \narguing that this was going to be a cushion in the recession. Yet we \nwere out of the recession. We had been out of the recession a year and \na half. Last night this President touted that in his 2 years of \nPresidency so far we have had the \n[[Page S1483]] strongest economy, we have created the largest number of \njobs, that our economy is stronger now than at any other time in the \nNation. How could, just a year ago, this President have been offering a \nstimulus package to pull us out of a recession because we were still in \none? Mr. President, you cannot have it both ways. Because what you were \nsuggesting last night was true, or what you were suggesting last year \nwas true, but both cannot be true.\n  This article points out that historically, every time we have used a \nstimulus package since 1949 it has been at least 1 year after a \nrecession was over with, and in the case of last year, nearly 2 years \nafter the recession was over with.\n  What that references then is that it was not necessary, that, in \nfact, it created a deficit and it created debt, and it may well have \nbrought on the next recession by pulling an excessive amount of money \nout of the private sector at just the time it was lifting off, growing, \nand creating jobs.\n  Mr. President, at this time let me yield to my colleague from Montana \nto use such time as he may desire.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized using \nthe time of the Senator from Idaho which expires at the hour of 10:30.\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank my friend and \nneighbor from Idaho, not only for this time but also for his leadership \non this particular issue. It is not just this year that he has been \ninvolved in this. I think he has been involved in the balanced budget \ndebate ever since he served in the House of Representatives, and he \nstill works very closely with our friends in that body.\n  I just need a couple of minutes to remind the American people about, \nbasically, representative government and the debate on priorities. If \nwe ever worked in local government where the law says you will balance \na budget and you will retain reserves on each line, no matter what the \ncounty government or what part of county government you look at, there \nwas always a reserve. You were by law given a cap on how much reserves \nyou could keep, but you also maintained those reserves.\n  So, basically, that is what we are talking about when we talk about a \nbalanced budget amendment. It is the old self-governed philosophy as we \npick our priorities and what is important to the survival of a free \nsociety.\n  We worked in Montana under an initiative called 105. We could not \nlevy any more mills to raise taxes. In a time of declining property \nvalues when your entire budget almost was set on property values, the \nmills that you collected and put in your coffers and delivered the \nservices that people then wanted, it was a wrenching experience to go \nthrough and say, ``We just cannot find enough money for our museums, \nfor our libraries, for our schools, for roads and bridges.'' Then we \nhad to go back and sort of survey exactly the mission of government. \nWhat is government for? We had to reidentify. What is our mission here? \nWhat is our primary consideration? What are our second considerations \nif we have the money?\n  I would suggest that those primary considerations would be, first, \npublic safety. That is our fire, our police, our emergency. I say that \nis the first consideration of government, public safety. Then I would \ngo to probably transportation because we have to get farm-to-market \nroads; to provide, in other words, transportation, that highway of \ncommerce that leads to all other elements of government. Then I would \nhave to say it has to be education. They do not have to be in that \norder. But that is the primary purpose of government.\n  Then, when you move off of that--you are talking about dollars--if we \nhave some, it is nice to add some amenities. Then we have to start \nlooking at utilities, water, public health.\n  But I think we have to reevaluate why we have government. That is \nwhat this debate will be about; where we set our priorities. After all, \nis not that the debate of a free people? We will have to redefine the \nmission of government as we go into this debate called a balanced \nbudget amendment. It forces us to take a look at those priorities, to \nset them and fund the ones we can. Yes. If the public wants more, then \nwe should say it will cost such and such dollars. Are you willing to \npay those dollars for that particular program?\n  I have said all along we can get to where we want to go in this \ndebate if we have some reform. We need regulatory reform and spending \nand budget reform. The balanced budget amendment makes us go to those \nreforms and makes us take a look at them. In fact, as our good friend \nfrom Pennsylvania said yesterday in a small debate on a balanced \nbudget, it starts the clock. It puts us on the field. It makes us look \nat our priorities.\n  So I thank my friend from Idaho. I just wanted to make those comments \nthis morning. But we must not take our eye off of the ball. It forces \nus to set priorities. I think that is what the American people say. I \nthink that is why they sent us here, to say, look at your priorities.\n  We heard the discussion about public radio and the NEA, the National \nEndowment for the Arts. I am saying, if my particular area of great \ninterest is the ability to feed and clothe this great Nation, where are \nour priorities? Where are our priorities to maintain a free society and \nto bring together those elements that create a standard of living that \nis unmatched by any other society to this date in our history, and to \ntake care of this little piece of mud that happens to be whirling \nthrough the universe? What this does is set priorities. I support it \nwholeheartedly.\n  I thank my friend from Idaho.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in my concluding minutes, let me thank my \ncolleague from Montana for his strong support and for the always strong \ndose of good common sense he brings to the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nwhich sometimes does not prevail here when we debate fiscal matters, \nwhen we work in setting the priorities that he so clearly spelled out \nare the responsibilities of legislators like ourselves in meeting the \nmandates of a constitution and of the kind of government we have.\n  I think we all recognize that our Government cannot be all things to \nall people, and yet for well over three decades we have had a Congress \nthat largely believed we could continue to spend and get involved in \nalmost every aspect of American life, stimulating, offering, providing, \nadding to and always directing and controlling ultimately when we put \nthe Federal tax dollar there. That has amounted, as I mentioned in my \nopening comments, to a $4.7 trillion debt that is now more than $18,500 \nof debt for every man, woman, and child in the United States.\n  In just a few moments we will resume debate of S. 1. That again is \nsymbolic of a Congress and a government that has lost its vision of \nwhat our Government and country ought to be like. Our State Governors \nsaid, if you are going to pass a balanced budget, then pass S. 1 first \nso that you will not have the ability of a central Federal Government \nto push through to us mandates and then require that we raise the \ntaxes. In other words, S. 1 really forces the priority process that my \ncolleague from Montana so clearly talked about, which is part of the \ndebate that is very much important in the whole of what we plan to do \nin the reorganization and redirection of our Government that was \ndemanded of us by the electorate on November 8.\n  But, once again, let me remind my colleagues that as we begin this \ndebate, there will be loud cries of: Show us your nickel and show us \nyour dime, show us where you are going to spend, show us every bite of \nfood you are going to take as you scale down your diet and you plan to \nlose weight.\n  Let me remind my colleagues we are talking about, with this Senate \nresolution, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That is a \nprocess. That then requires a procedure to be adopted by the Congress \nof the United States to establish the priorities and spending and to \nbring us to a federally balanced budget.\n  So let the debate begin. Let us recognize over the next several weeks \nthat this is only the beginning, that if this Congress sends forth a \nconstitutional amendment, it must go to every State capital in this \nNation and every legislator. And I hope every citizen becomes involved \nin what could be one of the most unique national debates in the history \nof our country as the citizens determine whether they want to ratify \n[[Page S1484]] by 38 States the balanced budget amendment and begin to \nrequire the Congress of the United States to live within the parameters \nof a process that we will soon begin to debate and hope to establish.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1477-6", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1484-S1485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, last night was a time for rhetoric. And no \ndoubt about it, President Clinton knows how to give a good long speech.\n  And now that the President has delivered his speech, the Republican \nCongress will continue to deliver on the promises we made to the \nAmerican people.\n  For we know that the success of this Congress--as well as the future \nof our country--does not depend on our words. They depend on our \nactions.\n  And now it is time to act. It is time to carry out the mandate the \nAmerican people gave us on November 8. And that means limited \nGovernment, less spending, fewer regulations, lower taxes, and more \nfreedom and opportunity for all Americans.\n  As Governor Whitman said last night in the Republican response, if \nPresident Clinton is ready to help us achieve those goals, then we \nwelcome him aboard. But we won't wait long to see if he means what he \nsays. The train is pulling out of the station. Republicans are getting \non with the business of changing America.\n  If President Clinton is truly committed to change, I hope he has a \ntalk with with congressional Democrats--many of whom are devoting \nthemselves to derailing Republican efforts to give government back to \nthe people.\n  And while I do not begrudge anyone standing firm against legislation \nthey oppose, some of my Democrat friends are doing their best to block \nlegislation they support.\n  The American people are in a demanding mood--and rightfully so. They \nare watching us very closely. And they will know who is responding to \nthe message they sent, and who is restoring to 100 percent pure \npartisan politics.\n  The President spoke again last night about Americans he terms as \n``middle class'' and those he terms as the ``under class.''\n  We have a basic fundamental disagreement in philosophy here. \nRepublicans do not believe we should create factions of Americans \ncompeting against one another for the favors of Government. Instead, we \nbelieve we should lead by taking actions that instill hope and restore \nfreedom and opportunity for all Americans.\n  So, this Congress will carefully consider the President's so-called \nmiddle-class bill of rights,--but our actions will flow from the real \nBill of Rights--the one that contains the 10th amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  The President did not mention that amendment last night, so let me \nread it for the record. It is very short.\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.\n\n  End of quote. That is all there is. That is the 10th amendment.\n  Let me close by saying how exciting it was for some of us, \nparticularly me, to look up last night and see a Republican Speaker \nsitting behind the President. We have waited--some almost a lifetime, \n40 years--to see this happen. In fact I think it was a sight I was \nbeginning to loose hope of ever seeing.\n  But now it is a fact. And the President well knows that this Congress \nis much, much different from those in the recent past. He talked about \nyesterdays. This is not yesterday's Congress. This is a new Congress. \nThis is not a big taxing, big spending Congress. This is not a Congress \nthat has a government-mandated solution to every problem.\n  Rather, this is a Congress that has a very specific mandate from the \nAmerican people. President Clinton said last night that despite his \nliberal policies of the past 2 years, he accepts and understands that \nmandate.\n  Republicans and all Americans who support our efforts to return \nGovernment back to the people hope that is a reality, and not just \nrhetoric.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems to me the President has spoken. He has \nevery right to. He spoke as most Presidents do, laid out the best that \nhas happened in the administration. That is true whether you are a \nRepublican or Democrat President. The President talked about lobbying. \nHe did not mention how many lobbyists contributed to his legal defense \nfund. So if we are going to stop and give it all back, maybe we will \nhear that announcement today that all that money is going to go back, \nthe $1 million raised from lobbyists around the country for his legal \ndefense fund.\n  We are prepared to work with the President. I must say I did not hear \nany cheers go up on the other side of the aisle when Mexico was \nmentioned. I do not know where the Democrats are on Mexico. The \nPresident said it is not foreign aid, it is not a loan. Maybe there is \nsomething we are not aware of.\n  But I would say as far as that issue is concerned, we told the \nPresident in good faith at this meeting at the White House, which \nSecretary Rubin has talked about a number of times, that we understood \nthere was a problem and we wanted to help. But we are not going to help \non just this side of the aisle. Unless there is some help on the other \nside of the aisle, forget it; it is not going to happen.\n  I do not see much support. I did not see any applause last night when \nthe President talked about our special relationship with Mexico and our \nboundaries and the history of the two countries. But I would say to the \nPresident that we are still prepared to work out some arrangement--\nmaybe a different arrangement than has been proposed so far. But it \nmust be bipartisan. It cannot be Republicans in the House and the \nSenate providing the votes while the Democrats vote the other way.\n  If that is the case it will never be brought up in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I passed through the Chamber and \nheard the distinguished majority leader, I remembered the words of John \nMitchell, the former Republican Attorney General. He said, ``Watch what \nwe do, not what we say.''\n  As I heard the distinguished Republican leader, he asked that we not \nresort to class warfare. Yet almost in the same breath, he waxed \neloquently about the ``Contract With America'' and sank into the very \ngame he indicted. Yes, President Clinton has put forward a proposal to \ncut middle-class taxes. But let us not forget that an important part of \nthe Republican ``Contract With America'' is none other than a middle-\nclass tax cut. It is ironic, if nothing more, that Republicans would \nattack the President for something they themselves have done.\n  Having said that, I feel strongly that the formulation of public \npolicy should not be based on class, or age, or race, or anything of \nthat sort. We are Senators for all the people, in our State and \nthroughout the entire country. Unfortunately, we too often fall into \nthe trap of conducting politics by poll numbers and forgetting that \nfact.\n  We need to get out of that habit and start doing what is best for the \nAmerican people. Otherwise we end up admonishing each other about \nlobbyists on the one hand, and then accepting contributions from them \non the other, as might the distinguished majority leader when he \nestablishes his committee for the Presidency. In the end, we haven't \ndone anything, and the electorate simply grows angrier and angrier.\n  We should not resort to demeaning the Government. That is what I \nheard in the majority leader's speech today and in the President's last \nnight. Sometimes I feel like Republicans and Democrats are in a \nfootrace to see who can demean the Government the most, to which I take \nstrong exception. After all, we are never going to work together and be \neffective, if we are always finding fault and pointing fingers.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly turn to another subject, namely, the \ncrisis in Mexico. I shall have more to say on this issue at a later \ntime, but let me make a few brief points. It is my opinion that the \nrisk subsidies which the administration is seeking on the $40 billion \nin loan guarantees would require the Mexican Government to pledge some \nof its oil revenues. While that may be a good business decision to \nsecure the loan guarantee, my fear is that we will be taking the \nwherewithal from the Mexican people to recover as a country. In \nessence, in a year or two, the United States of America will not be \nseen as a friend, but as an enemy. In \n[[Page S1485]] that sense, I think it is a bad, bad policy.\n  Furthermore, the President should not be obligated to get Democrats \ntogether.\n  It is a Republican program to bail out the billionaires. Former \nPresident Salinas was given tremendous credit for privatizing. But if \nyou look at Forbes magazine last year, you will see that of the 24 to \n25 billionaires, 22 were created under the Salinas administration. What \nwe saw was the good old boys system where the newly privatized \ncompanies were farmed out to political allies.\n  If the Mexican Government really needs money, they should tell that \ncrowd to give some of the money back. The people need it badly down \nthere. But what we don't want is to get into a situation where we bail \nout Wall Street and the billionaires in Mexico but breed resentment \nfrom the Mexican people.\n  Supporters of the loan guarantees have taken pains to stress that it \ndoes not cost the United States anything. While that may be true on \npaper, I immediately recall the $7 billion we guaranteed to Egypt, the \n$14 billion to India, and the $2 billion to Poland. I do not mean to \nquestion the need for that assistance, but I merely raise that point to \nillustrate that when this crowd in Washington says it won't cost \nanything, it is the taxpayers who ends up holding the bag when loan \nforgiveness occurs.\n  Mr. President, I did not intend to talk at length. I only wanted to \ncomment on the tone of today's political discourse which paints \nGovernment as the enemy. It isn't new. I heard the same singsong when I \nwas a member of the Federalism Commission under President Reagan. ``Get \nrid of the Government.'' Indeed, 15 years ago, President Reagan came to \ntown pledging to slash Federal programs and send Government back to the \nStates. Five years later, what we slashed was the funding by \neliminating revenue sharing. That is what has caused the dilemma that \nbrings this bill before the Senate today.\n  It is time for elected officials to quit blaming the Government in \nWashington and acting as if we were not part of the Government. \nInstead, we need to get down on the floor of the Congress and do the \njob, which the distinguished Senators from Ohio and Idaho are \nattempting to do. I thank them for their courtesy in yielding.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1484-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I recognize that the Senator from \nMinnesota would like to offer an amendment that I think is actually \nrelated to the discussion just held on the floor of the Senate, as soon \nas the floor managers are here.\n  The Senator from Idaho, a friend of mine, has, along with his \ncolleagues, been discussing an issue for the past hour that is very \nimportant for this country, the issue of a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. He knows and understands that there is not \nnecessarily a partisan difference on that subject in the Senate. Many \nof us, myself included, have voted in the past for a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget and are prepared to do so again.\n  I think most people believe that it would be desirable to move this \ncountry toward a point when we are spending only the resources we have. \nThere may need to be some exceptions to that. If you run into a \ndepression, you might want to have a stimulative kind of fiscal policy. \nBut generally speaking, we ought to balance what we spend with what we \nraise. We are nearing $5 trillion in debt. I have a couple of children \nwho will inherit that debt, as will all of America's children. We have \na responsibility, it seems to me, to address this question and address \nit in the right way.\n  I do want to talk a little about the nuance of the discussion. Some \nhave been suggesting that Federal spending is out of control because \nthere are folks who swagger over to the Chambers of the House and the \nSenate and propose wildly irresponsible spending schemes and programs \nfor which they have no idea where the resources will come. The Senator \nfrom Idaho and others know, of course, that this is not the case. And I \nam not saying that the Senator suggested that. I am saying that people \nwho understand the system know that what is causing these substantial \nrun-ups in the deficit are----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Retirement programs and health care programs, Medicare \nand Medicaid. Each year more people become eligible for Medicare \nbecause they have reached the age of 65. Each year, Medicare becomes \nmore expensive and so does Medicaid. So each year these programs grow \nin cost without anyone having done anything to increase their costs. I \nam happy to yield at this point.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Very briefly. I thank my colleague for engaging in this \nissue this morning. I will say that clearly the balanced budget \namendment is a bipartisan issue. I have always appreciated the support \nof my colleague in this issue. It must be bipartisan. This is a \nnational debate that involves all partisan interests. I thank my \ncolleague for coming to the floor this morning and making that very \nimportant point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I want to make this \npoint again and again. It is not a basket full of new and irresponsible \nFederal programs, being offered by Members of either side of the \npolitical aisle, that are causing this problem. The cause is \nentitlement programs, whose costs increase very substantially year \nafter year and therefore claim an increasing amount of money out of the \nFederal budget and run-up the Federal deficit.\n  The question for those who want to address this, whether in the \nConstitution or through a statute, is: Exactly how do you do it? What \ndo you choose to cut? What do you keep and what do you get rid of? We \ncould change the Constitution 2 minutes from now, if procedures would \nallow it, and it would not make a one-penny change in the Federal \ndeficit. Two minutes from now, we could change the Constitution to read \nthat, from this moment forward, there would not be a one-cent increase \nin the Federal deficit, and yet this would not reduce the deficit by \none penny. Why? Because changing the Constitution does not solve the \nproblem. Changing the Federal budget is what solves the problem.\n  I have seen the sunny side of this little thing called the budget \nfracas. It came to us from Art Laffer and a bunch of folks in the early \neighties. These folks believe that you can double defense spending and \ncut the revenue base and there would be nirvana around the corner, and \nthe budget would be balanced. We have heard that. That was about $3.5 \ntrillion ago. Of course, it was preposterous when it was proposed and \nwhen it was implemented. They saddled this country with an enormous \ndebt. Supply side economics they called it. Some have said that is \nwhere the other side gets all the supplies. But it is a little more \ncomplicated than that. Now we have some who are saying again let us \nincrease defense spending, cut taxes again, and let us change the U.S. \nConstitution to require a balanced budget.\n  Well, I happen to support a constitutional provision requiring a \nbalanced budget. I did not come to Congress thinking I would support \nthis, but that was about $3.5 trillion ago. I would support virtually \nanything requiring that there be a sober and serious solution to this \nproblem because, frankly, I think this fiscal policy very much limits \nour country's opportunities in the future.\n  Two years ago, we had a vote here in Congress on a budget bill. It \nwas a terrible vote. People talk about politicians not caring and not \nbeing connected, not having any courage. The vote was ``shall we \nincrease some taxes?'' That was unpopular. And the vote was ``Shall we \ncut some spending?'' That was unpopular. ``Shall we do that in a \nsignificant combination to reduce the Federal deficit?'' Enough people \nin this Chamber--by one--voted yes to pass the deficit reduction bill. \nThere was a one-vote margin here and a one-vote margin in the other \nbody. I regret to say that not one Member of the Republican side voted \nwith us on that bill. It was not an easy vote. It was an awful vote. If \none were just going to be a politician, one would say, ``Count me out, \nI am not going to cast a tough vote. This increases taxes and cuts \nspending. Count me out. I am not involved in this.'' But enough people \nvoted yes to say we are willing to do \n[[Page S1487]] this. It might not be popular or the political thing, \nbut we are willing to do it for the benefit of this country.\n  When we pass--and I think we will--a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, the question becomes even more intense. How do you, \nwith a specific series of changes in taxes and in spending, reach a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002? I voted for, and intend to vote for \nagain, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But I would \nsay this: When we have people who propose a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget and at the same time say increase defense spending \nand cut the revenue base, I say they need to spell it out. We \nunderstand that this is the point on the map you want to get to. I want \nto find out the route, especially if you are going to stop near the \nbridge of ``increased defense spending'' and go down the hollow called \n``a cut in taxes.'' How do you reach that destination in the year 2002? \nI think the American people want to know that, as well.\n  Are you going to cut Social Security? Not with my support. Why? \nSocial Security is paid for by every single person in this country who \nworks and by everyone who employs the people who work. This money is \ntaken from paychecks and put into a very specific account, a trust \nfund. We have said that we are going to take this amount from your \npaycheck and put it into a trust fund so that it will be safe for the \nfuture. This problem is a solemn one, a compact among those who work \nand those who retire and the system that funds it.\n  Are we going to raid the trust funds to balance this budget? Not with \nmy vote. Not one cent of this deficit is caused by Social Security. \nThis year, a $70 billion surplus will occur in the Social Security \ntrust fund. We will have collected, in other words, $70 billion more in \nthe Social Security System than we will have paid out. Can anybody \nreasonably claim that Social Security has caused this problem? So when \nthe constitutional amendment to balance the budget comes up, we will \nhave an amendment that says you will not balance the budget by raiding \nthe Social Security trust funds. This program has not caused one cent \nof the deficit, and we will not allow a raid of the trust funds to \naccomplish the goal of this amendment.\n  Second, we say we have a right to know what route you will take to \nreach a balanced budget. There is a special right to know, and it seems \nto me an obligation on the part of those saying we want to increase one \nof the largest areas of public spending and cut the revenue base to \ntell us how they plan to get there. Show us a 7-year budget and tell us \nthe result. Then we and the American people and the States and local \ngovernments know what the plan is.\n Share with us the plan. That is the issue.\n\n  I have mentioned Social Security. Does one get to a balanced budget \nby cutting Social Security? Not with my support. It does not cause this \nproblem.\n  Does one get there by cutting defense? No. A large number in this \nChamber now say they want to increase defense spending. That is one of \nthe largest areas of spending in the Federal Government.\n  Well, if not defense, then what? Interest on the debt? No, we pay \ninterest on the debt. There is no way of avoiding it. And the folks on \nthe Federal Reserve Board, meeting in secret, have increased the \ninterest rate six times and are set to do so again. There is not much \nwe can do about that. Interest on the debt is another of the largest \nareas of public spending.\n  How about Medicaid and Medicare? There is considerable support for \nMedicaid and Medicare.\n  And for health care, are the requirements for these programs any less \nthis year than last year? Hardly. Health care costs are going up, not \ndown. So are we going to cut health care spending? If so, how? How do \nyou do that when health care costs are rising, more people are becoming \neligible for Federal health programs, more people are growing older, \nAmerica is graying?\n  Or, I guess, if that is the plan, then tell us who is not going to \nget the health care that was promised? If that is part of the plan, let \nus hear it.\n  Medicaid. Forty million people live in poverty in this country. Which \npoor people are going to be denied access to health care?\n  Interestingly enough, health care costs are increasing. Yet we do not \naddress the causes for the increases in health care costs. If we do not \ndo this, in my judgment we do not have a chance to deal with this \nbudget deficit problem.\n  What about veterans issues. Do you propose that we cut veterans' \ncompensation, veterans' hospitals? I do not think so. I do not think \nsomebody is going to say that those soldiers who put their lives on the \nline for this country will now have to discover that the promises this \ncountry made to them will not be kept. I do not think that is going to \nbe the case.\n  So I guess the question is not with respect to intent; the intent \naround here is wonderful. And I am going to join those who intend to do \nthis, and I will vote for a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, but with two caveats.\n  One, I am not gong to let anybody under any circumstance raid the \nSocial Security trust fund to do it because the Social Security trust \nfund is a solemn compact between generations and has not caused one \npenny of this deficit. If that is the fight we have to have, that is \nthe fight we are going to have.\n  Two, it seems to me--and I think the Senator from Minnesota has an \namendment on this issue coming up next on this floor--that there is an \nobligation--especially given the circumstances these days of saying we \nwant to increase spending on one hand and cut the revenue base on the \nother, while saying we want a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget--to tell us how that is achieved. The American people and State \nand local governments should be able to make judgments: Does this make \nsense? What will this do to us? What does it mean to our revenue base \nout in the States? What programs will we have to assume? What programs \nwill people do without?\n  Having said all that, a lot of strange things go on. All of us know \nthat. This is reform time, and when you deal with reform, there are a \nlot of nutty ideas bouncing all over the walls. There are also some \ntimeless truths in this country. One of the timeless truths for me as a \npublic servant is that we want to help people who need help in this \ncountry, to provide opportunity and hope. In this country, a lot of \npeople who do well and who will do better next year have opportunities, \nwonderful opportunities. But we have a lot of people who, through no \nfault of their own, find themselves in circumstances where we need to \nreach out a hand and help them up.\n  There ought not to be a board of values in this country as we discuss \nwhat we do about all these issues. We ought to understand that one \nreason for our country's success has been the largess in helping all of \nour people achieve the opportunities they can achieve with their God-\ngiven talents.\n  I mentioned some of the ideas floating around here. You know, several \npeople say, ``Well, we do not want to ever talk about taxes when we \ntalk about fiscal policy, so let us talk about charging admission fees \nto the U.S. Capitol.'' That was a nutty idea from last week. \nConservative think tanks up here say, ``Let's charge the people of \nAmerica,'' who own the U.S. Capitol, ``an admission price to see the \nU.S. Capitol.''\n  I might be old fashioned, I suppose, coming from a town of 400 \npeople, to think you ought not to charge citizens an admission fee to \nenter a building they own.\n  We need to separate the nutty ideas from the decent ideas. And there \nare some good reform ideas, some good ideas, but there are a lot of \nstrange ones bouncing around here as well.\n  It seems to me that, as we try to separate the good ideas from the \nbad, we ought to try to figure out where we are and follow it down the \nline. Let us try to understand what it is that is necessary for our \nfuture, what we need to invest in order to achieve the kind of growth \nand opportunity we want.\n  But it seems to me that we should not, as we begin talking about the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, leave an impression \nthat the Federal budget deficit has been caused by a bunch of folks \ntrooping in that door and concocting a new program last March. That is \nnot what has caused this. That is not what has caused this at all.\n   [[Page S1488]] We have massive entitlement programs whose costs are \nlinked to the Consumer Price Index and whose costs go up every year. We \nhave a revenue base linked to changes in the Consumer Price Index so \nthat revenues are kept down by that same indexation. So you have one \nindexing approach that moves costs up and another indexing approach \nthat keeps revenues down. And the result is a mismatch that anybody \ntaking arithmetic can understand very quickly.\n  The Senator from Idaho and others are absolutely correct that we \nshare a goal. That goal is that this country ought to put its budget in \norder and it ought to do it soon.\n  I suppose one area of disagreement occurs when some say let us \nincrease spending in one of the biggest budget items and then cut our \nrevenue, but they do not believe they have an obligation to tell people \nhow they will then get to a balanced budget 7 years from now. We \ndisagree on that. There is, in my judgment, an obligation to tell the \nAmerican people how they are going to achieve that.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words \nabout this subject. I know some have spoken about it for an hour or so. \nWe will have hour after hour after hour of debates, probably weeks of \ndebate on this subject. It is very important. The American people want \nus to control our fiscal policy in a reasonable and responsible way. I \nintend to join in that effort. But I intend also to see that we do it \nin the right way.\n  Some say, ``Well, you know, let us keep building Star Wars and let us \ncut out some critically needed investments'' like education and \ntraining that I think are vital for achieving the full human potential \nin this country. I say, ``I'm sorry. I don't share your goals. I do not \nshare your priorities.''\n  So those are the kinds of debates I think we will be having in the \ncoming weeks. This will allow the American people to not only \nunderstand that we share a common goal of where we want to go, but also \nto recognize that we have some disagreements about how to get there. \nAnd that is politics. Someone once said, ``When everyone in the room is \nthinking the same thing, no one is thinking very much.''\n  There is going to be a lot of diversity of thought about how we reach \nthe destination of a better fiscal policy so that we unsaddle the \nAmerican children of the heavy burden of deficits they now have to \nassume.\n  I know that, as I said before, the Senator from Minnesota is now \nwaiting and has an amendment that I think will follow this discussion \nin an appropriate way. So, with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1486-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1488-S1495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 185\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Minnesota very much.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today we are considering S. 1, the \nunfunded mandates bill, a bill designed, as my good friend from Idaho, \nthe main sponsor of this bill, has said repeatedly, to ensure that \ninformation is available to Members of Congress before they vote to \nimpose a mandate on a State or local government.\n  As I understand the basic premise of this piece of legislation, which \nI will say to my colleague from Idaho I am very much in agreement with, \nit is really twofold.\n No. 1, we ought to be very clear about the kinds of mandates we are \nimposing on State and local governments and we ought to be accountable \nfor our votes; No. 2, I think this piece of legislation is about the \nright to know. It is about the right to know both for Senators and \nRepresentatives and State and local government officials about a \nproposal's economic impact before we pass it.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that is good government reform. I have said \nthat to my colleague from Idaho several times. I think it is good \ninstinct. I think this instinct by the Senator from Idaho is on the \nmark, but I think it might be missing for some of our colleagues. In \nparticular, I want to talk a little bit about this balanced budget \namendment, and in particular I want to give some context by talking \nabout some of the comments of the House Republican Leader Armey.\n  Mr. President, let me first of all be clear about the amendment that \nI have already sent to the desk that we are now considering. This is a \nsense of the Congress that the Congress should continue its progress at \nreducing the annual Federal deficit, and if the Congress proposes to \nthe States a balanced budget amendment, it should accompany it with \nfinancial information on its impact on the budget of each of the \nStates, so that States know what exactly the impact of this piece of \nlegislation will be on them.\n  Let me begin at the beginning. This unfunded mandates bill operates \non the premise that information should be available to Senators and \nRepresentatives and to State and local government officials about the \nfinancial impact of legislation we are proposing and attempting to \npass.\n  Mr. President, I think that that is a very important standard for any \npiece of legislation. Mr. President, it is also true, operating on that \npremise, and that is what this amendment speaks to, that if we pass a \nbalanced budget amendment we ought to be clear with States, and I want \nto talk about this really because it comes from Minnesota.\n  In that sense, I have a mandate from Minnesota today regarding what \nthe impact of a balanced budget amendment would be on Minnesota or any \nother State. If we are not clear about where these cuts are going to \ntake place and what the impact is going to be on our States, then what \nhas been called the Contract With America becomes not a contract but a \ncon. I mean, if there is a mood piece in the country, it is that we \nshould be honest, straightforward and direct with people, and not try \nto finesse people; tell them what we are doing and tell them what the \nimpact of what we are doing will be on their lives.\n  Now, in the House, House Republican Leader Armey has said about the \nbalanced budget amendment, ``I am profoundly convinced that putting out \nthe details would make passage virtually impossible. The details will \nnot come out before passage. It's not possible.'' The Washington Post, \nJanuary 7, 1995. Another quote: ``Because the fact of the matter is \nonce Members of Congress know exactly, chapter and verse, the pain that \nthe Government must live with in order to get a balanced budget, their \nknees will buckle,'' January 9, 1995, the Washington Post.\n  Mr. President, people in Minnesota and people in Vermont and people \naround the country did not send us here to sign on to any piece of \nlegislation without being clear with them as to what the impact of that \nlegislation will be on their lives. Let me repeat that one more time, \nbecause that is the \n[[Page S1489]] premise of this amendment: People in Minnesota, people \nin Vermont, people in Ohio, did not send us here to pass legislation \nwithout understanding the implications of the legislation we pass on \ntheir lives. What will the impact be of a balanced budget amendment on \nVermont, on Minnesota?\n  Mr. President, people in Minnesota want to know what passage of this \nbalanced budget amendment will mean to them in personal terms. In fact, \nthere is a considerable amount of apprehension in my State, and I think \nin every State. I have met with not just statewide officials, but \nlocal--county and city--officials from small towns in Minnesota, and \npeople are worried that if we pass a balanced budget amendment but do \nnot spell out where we will make the cuts or what the impact will be, \nthen later on they will find that they may have to assume the costs.\n  For example, what would happen--and by the way, I will have figures \nthat may spell out that this very well may happen--if we have cuts, the \nSenator from North Dakota spelled out the context, the $1.3 trillion \ncut. We are in a bidding war to raise the Pentagon budget; in another \nbidding war to cut taxes, taking some large programs off the table. We \nknow where the cuts will be. So where will the additional funding be \nfor our young people to go on to afford higher education? Who will \nassume the cost of nutrition programs for children? What about veterans \nprograms? What about Medicaid-Medicare? And if a person lives in a \nState like Minnesota--I know the people in my State--we will not walk \naway from citizens who need some support so that they can become \nindependent. Thus, we will end up having to pick up this cost.\n  The Governor from Vermont, Governor Dean, has made this same point. \nThis could become one big shell game, transferring the costs back to \nState and local units of government, I fear, relying on the property \ntax.\n  Well, Mr. President, given this context, on January 12, about a week \nafter I went home and met with legislative leadership and local \nofficials, the Minnesota State Senate--and I would like for my \ncolleagues to be very clear about this, because I think their State \nsenate may well do the same thing--passed a resolution urging the U.S. \nCongress to provide these details before sending the balanced budget \namendment to the States for ratification.\n  This resolution reads, from Minnesota:\n\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota That \n     it urges the Congress of the United States to continue its \n     progress at reducing the annual Federal deficit and, when the \n     Congress proposes to the States a balanced budget amendment, \n     to accompany it with financial information on its impact on \n     the budget of the State of Minnesota for budget planning \n     purposes.\n\n  This resolution was passed unanimously in the State senate by \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. This really does not have anything to \ndo, as a matter of fact, with the position we take on a balanced budget \namendment. The resolution then went--this was January 12--it then went \nto the House of Delegates and on January 17, the Minnesota House of \nDelegates also passed this resolution, I think, with only three \ndissenting votes. Then it went to the Governor and last Friday, January \n20, Minnesota's Republican Governor signed the resolution.\n  Mr. President, from the State of Minnesota, I ask unanimous consent \nthat this resolution be included as a part of the Record. And as the \nSenator from Minnesota, I am proud to send this resolution from the \nMinnesota State Legislature, signed by the Governor of Minnesota, to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                            Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the 50 States, including the State of Minnesota, \n     have long been required by their state constitutions to \n     balance their state operating budgets; and\n       Whereas, the States have long done so by making difficult \n     choices each budget session to insure that their expenditures \n     do not exceed their revenues; and\n       Whereas, without a federal balanced budget, the deficit may \n     continue to grow within the next ten years from $150 billion \n     gross domestic product (GDP) per year to $400 billion GDP per \n     year, continuing the serious negative impact on interest \n     rates, available credit for consumers, and taxpayer \n     obligations; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States, in the last two \n     years, has begun to reduce the annual federal deficit by \n     making substantial reductions in federal spending; and\n       Whereas, achieving a balanced budget by the year 2002 will \n     require continued reductions in the annual deficit, averaging \n     almost 15 percent per year over the next seven years; and\n       Whereas, it now appears that the Congress is willing to \n     impose on itself the same discipline that the States have \n     long had to follow, by passing a balanced-budget amendment to \n     the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, the Congress, in working to balance the federal \n     budget, may impose on the States unfunded mandates that shift \n     to the States responsibility for carrying out programs that \n     the Congress can no longer afford; and\n       Whereas, the States will better be able to revise their own \n     budgets if the Congress gives them fair warning of the \n     revisions Congress will be making in the federal budget; and\n       Whereas, if the federal budget is to be brought into \n     balance by the year 2002, major reductions in the annual \n     deficit must continue without a break; and\n       Whereas, these major reductions will be more acceptable to \n     the people if they are shown to be part of a realistic, long-\n     term plan to balance the budget: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota, \n     That it urges the Congress of the United States to continue \n     its progress at reducing the annual federal deficit and, when \n     the Congress proposes to the States a balanced-budget \n     amendment, to accompany it with financial information on its \n     impact on the budget of the State of minority for budget \n     planning purposes. Be it\n       Further resolved, That the Secretary of State of Minnesota \n     shall transmit copies of this memorial to the Speaker and \n     Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     presiding officers of both houses of the legislature of each \n     of the other States in the Union, and to Minneosta's Senators \n     and Representatives in Congress.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, based on the Minnesota resolution, I \ntherefore have offered this amendment to the unfunded mandates bill, a \nsense-of-the-Congress resolution that if the balanced budget amendment \nis sent to the States, it should be accompanied by financial \ninformation on the impact it will have on each State's budget. This is \na very simple and straightforward amendment.\n  Mr. President, I cannot emphasize this enough. In my State of \nMinnesota, the thing that is being asked of Members, whether we are \nDemocrats or Republicans, is: Please be clear and straightforward with \nthe State and please spell out for the State the kind of cuts we will \nhave to make within this balanced budget amendment mandate, and please \nspell out what the impact will be on our States.\n  We want to know which people are going to be affected by this. We \nwant to know how much of this we are going to have to pick up through \nour own State budgets. Are we going to have to raise taxes? What kind \nof communities are going to be hurt? Let us know what the impact will \nbe on our States. That is, if you will, the mandate that I take from \nthe State of Minnesota to the floor of the Senate today.\n  Mr. President, obviously this balanced budget amendment--and I think \nthis was the meaning of Mr. Armey's quotes, is going to necessitate \nsome deep cuts. In the words of House Judiciary Committee Chairman \nHyde, once Social Security is taken off the table the ``effect on other \nFederal programs will be Draconian.''\n  I did not say this, the Chair of the Judiciary Committee in the \nHouse, Representative Hyde, said this: The ``effect on other Federal \nprograms will be Draconian.''\n  I think that statement is an understatement. The arithmetic of this \nequation is harsh, as we know full well. That is why I believe too many \nof my colleagues are unwilling to be straightforward with the people we \nrepresent. We are going to raise the military budget, we are going to \nhave more tax cuts, we clearly are not going to be cutting into Social \nSecurity. And we know what programs are left, we know the importance of \nthose programs and we know the kind of cuts that are going to take \nplace.\n  We are talking about aid to States for State and local law \nenforcement agencies. We are talking about highway maintenance and \nconstruction. We are talking about education. We are talking about \ncollege and small business loans. And we are talking about hungry \nchildren and the elderly.\n  Mr. President, let me just lay out some Treasury Department \nestimates \n[[Page S1490]] for my State of Minnesota, and other Senators, I think, \nhave this data as it pertains to their States.\n  The Treasury Department estimates that Minnesota will have to \nincrease State taxes by 9.4 percent across the board to make up for the \nloss in grants. This is even before factoring in what would be the \neffect of additional offsets in cuts if we do a lot of tax cuts or we \ndramatically increase the Pentagon budget.\n  The loss of this grant assistance to the State of Minnesota would \nmean that in the year 2002, the Treasury Department estimates, we would \nhave a loss of $679 million in Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that half of Medicaid \nexpenditures go into taking care of older people in nursing homes; $679 \nmillion less in Medicaid; $102 million less for highway trust fund \ngrants; $83 million less in AFDC, and, by the way, Mr. President, \nbecause sometimes I think some of my colleagues do not understand it, \naid to families with dependent children goes, by definition, mostly to \nchildren. We are talking about parents, often a single parent--almost \nalways a woman--and children.\n  And $314 million cuts in funding for education, job training, the \nenvironment, housing and other areas.\n  The Department of Commerce estimates that Minnesota over 7 years, \nleading up to 2002 as potential impact: Education would lose $1.5 \nbillion; environmental protection could lose $74.6 million; disease \ncontrol and prevention would lose $9.8 million; Fish and Wildlife \nService would lose $16.7 million, law enforcement would lose over $143 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, children's defense fund estimates that the cuts in \nMinnesota in 2002 would result in the following, just in Minnesota:\n  Almost 30,000 babies, preschoolers and pregnant women would lose WIC \nnutrition supplements;\n  Over 51,000 children would lose food stamps; over 154,000 children \nwould lose free or subsidized lunches; over 93,000 children would lose \nMedicaid health coverage.\n  Over 59,000 children would lose State child support agency help in \nestablishing paternity or collecting child support; almost 38,000 \nchildren would lose welfare benefits; over 2,400 blind and disabled \nchildren would lose SSI, that is supplemental security income; 3,900 \nchildren would lose Federal child care subsidies; over 2,500 children \nwould lose Head Start early childhood services; and 28,000 children \nwould lose child and adult food care programs.\n  Mr. President, this is the point: I will not even preach about what \nall these statistics mean in personal terms. I will not even argue with \nmy colleagues, if they are so inclined, over these figures. We do not \nknow the exact figures, and that is what Minnesota has said in this \nresolution, passed unanimously by the House, passed almost unanimously \nby the Senate, signed by the Governor. I bring it here to the floor of \nthe Senate, and this amendment that I have offered, which is this \nresolution from Minnesota, says if we pass the balanced budget \namendment, then at least we ought to include with that balanced budget \namendment a financial analysis of its impact on our States. This is a \nreasonable amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time waiting for other \ncolleagues who may want to respond.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I first want to comment on the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota. It seems to be an amendment \nwith the primary purpose of stopping cutting and spending in this \ncountry. The balanced budget amendment and the unfunded mandates are \nclosely tied.\n  We have not even passed the balanced budget amendment and yet we are \nsaying what great damage it is going to do to the States. We are, in \neffect, planning the funeral during the birth. We need to wait and see.\n  For 30 years, that I am well aware of, we have passed law after law \nafter law--this Congress has--that has had an irrevocable and \npermanently damaging effect upon the fiscal condition of the States, \ncounties, and cities of this Nation. New taxes, new rules,and new \nmandates and not one time have we ever made a study, or I have even \nheard it suggested, that we let the States, the citizens of the \ncounties know what we are going to do to them. For 30-plus years, we \nsimply did it, and then it hit and they had to figure out a way to \ncover it.\n  There has not been a local budget that has really been accurate in \nthis country in 30 years, because every year, particularly the counties \nhave had to go back and increase taxes to take care of the mandates \nthat we have placed on them.\n  Now, all of a sudden from the other side of the aisle, it becomes \nabsolutely necessary that we do a definitive fiscal analysis of what \neffect this might have upon cities and counties and States.\n  Certainly we need to be sensitive and cognizant of what effect it \nmight have on the cities and counties, but first let us get on with \nstopping spending instead of thinking of ways to keep on spending. We \nare going in debt at something like $800 million a day. We already have \na $5 trillion debt, so let us get to what we ought to be doing and that \nis stopping spending.\n  The thing we have to do first is to cut the spending. If we will take \nthe mandates off of the local governments, then they can handle their \nproblems. They will know what to cut and what not to cut because they \nknow. But the first thing we have to do is get rid of the mandates.\n  Now, I came to the Senate after 45 years in the private sector as a \nbusinessman and farmer. I watched and literally for the last 35 years \nnot one time has the Congress convened and adjourned that they did not \npass rules, regulations and laws making it more difficult to operate a \nbusiness. The intent of these laws, we heard, was that they were going \nto help business, but not one single one of them ever did or has. They \nhurt people in the private sector.\n  I can think of no better example of this same rule going to the \npublic sector than the mandates we have been dictating to State and \nlocal governments without providing any money to pay for them. The \nunfunded mandates have been a fiscal disaster for local governments. We \nsimply tell them what the problem is and for them to find the money to \ncover the solution. It amounts to something that the Constitution says \nwe cannot do, and that is for one branch of Government to levy a tax \nupon another. And we are doing it blatantly when we tell the counties \nof this Nation that they simply have to come up with this money and \ntheir only source of it is ad valorum taxes or local sales tax. We \nshould not be telling them how and where and when to levy a tax.\n  In typical fashion, Federal Government bureaucrats and Congress think \nthey have all wisdom of what should be done at the local level. The \nFederal Government and its bureaucrats think that the local government \nhas come to Delphi, and they have the wisdom and will tell us what to \ndo. All they have to do at the county level is pay the bills.\n  That is wrong, Mr. President.\n  A recent editorial described it pretty accurately:\n\n       In recent years, as deficits have cramped Washington's \n     style, legislators have taken to issuing commands to State \n     and local governments. Those lower governments are forced to \n     pick up the tab, while Federal legislators take credit for \n     enlightened policy. (That means more spending.)\n\n  This severing of decisionmaking from the paying of the bill is what \nhas gotten us the trouble we are in today, and it has invited \nundisciplined spending. It has encouraged the spending of money we do \nnot have. It has encouraged entitlement programs that, if the Federal \nGovernment had to pay the total bill, would not be out there.\n  It burdens State and local governments, and it takes away the \ndiscretion of county commissioners, city councilmen and State \nlegislators to decide where the money should be spent that they bring \nin in taxes, that they tax the people for. The decision has already \nbeen made in Washington.\n  In some of these counties it is absolutely ludicrous. I will take the \ncounty I live in, and if you will look at a lot of counties around the \nState you will see they are not a lot different. But I am going to take \none federally mandated program in the county in which I have spent my \nlife. This is Sampson \n[[Page S1491]] County, a rural county in eastern North Carolina. The \ntotal ad valorem taxes collected in that county are, more or less, $10 \nmillion. This is the total county tax collection. Would you believe \nthat the Medicaid Program for that county is $30 million a year, of \nwhich the county has to put up 5 percent? We have not had a budget in \nthe last 10 years that we have not had to go back and adjust to pick up \nthe increases in the cost of Medicaid.\n  Now, if you will look at the counties, in particular the more rural \nand agrarian counties, you will find this same pattern, that the total \ncounty ad valorum tax collection is often only half or even, as in our \ncase, a third of what is the Medicaid program in the county and what is \nour percentage of these unfunded mandates.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. This bill will fix the problem by requiring the \nCongressional Budget Office to estimate the costs to the lower \ngovernments before we pass prospective legislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield? Would the question be on the \nSenator's time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No. But that is not why I asked the question.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield on \nhis time? The Chair might advise the Senator he has less than 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. When I finish, I will yield for the Senator's \nquestion.\n  Currently, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 12 percent \nof all bills that Congress has passed since 1983, nearly 800, contain \nunfunded mandates with a cost per bill of the 800 of over $200 million.\n  It is long past time that those in the Congress--us, we--should take \nresponsibility for these actions and stop issuing the mandates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would indicate that the Senator has \nused his 10 minutes. The Senator was yielded 10 minutes and that time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would be happy to yield the Senator an additional 2 \nminutes so he can conclude his remarks and in that time if he wished to \nrespond to the Senator from Minnesota. Two minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is further recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed 5 minutes \nadditional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Idaho yield 5 minutes?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I will not need 5.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The Senator will yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Three minutes. Good enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Simply, we are writing these laws and sending them to \nthe States COD. It is time we send them with the bills paid when we \npass the law. The States are tired, the cities are tired, and the \ncounties are broke paying for mandates that we send from here.\n  Mr. President, I do want to thank the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nKempthorne] for the leadership he has taken in it. When he came to the \nSenate, it was one of the first things he talked about. He has followed \nit. He has followed it closely. I know that he served for many years as \nmayor of Boise, ID. He has firsthand knowledge of how it works, \nwhatever goes on. And he has done an excellent job of presenting the \nbill to the floor and to the Senate, and for that I wish to thank him. \nI think it is fitting that he be the leader in ending an abuse that has \ngone on far too long.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I will be glad to answer the \nquestion of the Senator from Minnesota, if he will speak loud enough so \nI can hear him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think the Senator has probably run \nout of his time so I will not ask him to yield. I will just comment \nvery briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 17\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining on his time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator from Minnesota allow me, then, to \nproceed with the next speaker so in your summary----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, since the Senator from North Carolina \nno longer has any time to yield, I might just quickly respond. I will \ntake 2 minutes. Then I will be pleased to reserve the rest of my time.\n  Mr. President, just very briefly, I appreciate what the Senator from \nNorth Carolina said. But I do want colleagues to know, who are about to \nvote on this, that this amendment does not say no to S. 1, to unfunded \nmandates. This amendment does not say no to a balanced budget \namendment. This amendment, as a matter of fact, based upon the \nMinnesota resolution, memorializes Congress for continuing its work on \nFederal deficit reduction. The only thing this amendment says--and I do \nnot think the Senator really responded to this amendment--was that if \nwe pass a balanced budget amendment, we ought to accompany this with \nfinancial information on its impact on the budget of each of the \nStates.\n  This came from Minnesota. It was passed unanimously by the Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. It was passed almost unanimously in \nthe House. It was signed by the Republican Governor.\n  It focuses on deficit reduction, but it says: Look, Federal \nGovernment, in the spirit of unfunded mandates, tell us what the impact \nis going to be on our States of a balanced budget amendment. That is \nall this amendment says. So I think the Senator from North Carolina had \nsome interesting comments, but I do not think they spoke directly to \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 17 minutes and 17 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it is rare that I differ with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota. He is one of those who has really brought compassion to \nthis body and I have great respect for him. One of the best things that \nhas happened in the U.S. Senate since I have been here is the election \nof Paul Wellstone to the U.S. Senate.\n  I differ with him on this for two basic reasons.\n  No 1, the argument that is made against the balanced budget amendment \nby those who oppose it is that we can do this, we can balance the \nbudget, without a balanced budget amendment. Therefore, the pain \ninflicted would, in theory, be the same, whether we have the balanced \nbudget amendment or whether we do not, with one exception. And that \nexception is this: Every econometric study shows if we pass the \nbalanced budget amendment, we are going to have lower interest rates. \nIf you have lower interest rates, you will have an easier time \nbalancing the budget with a constitutional amendment. If you have lower \ninterest rates, you are going to stimulate investment and employment; \nyou are going to stimulate revenue for the Federal Government, for \nState and local governments. That is No. 1. So I think you cannot make \nan argument both that this is going to hurt and we can balance the \nbudget without the constitutional amendment.\n  Second, we have to ask as we look at States and local governments, \nwhat will happen if we do not have a balanced budget amendment? You \nlook at that GAO report of 1992--and it would be modified some, thanks \nto the vote of the Senator and mine in passing that budget in August \n1993--but they say, in that report that if we follow the basic path we \nare on now that by the year 2020 their projection is, because of \ninterest growth and entitlement growth, that social services would be \ncut by one-third and defense cut by two-thirds.\n  Frankly--my colleague from Minnesota has been around here long \nenough. I do not think that is the way the pie would be cut. I think it \nis much more likely that it would be closer to 50-50, on both sides. \nBut that assumes--the GAO report assumes, optimistically--that we do \nnot monetize the debt, that we do not just start the printing presses \nrolling.\n   [[Page S1492]] The history of countries--and we may hope we will be \nan exception to this history--but the history of nations is, when you \nget around 9 percent of deficit versus GDP, except for a wartime \nsituation, you start monetizing the debt. We are going to go beyond \nthat.\n  I ask the Members of this body just to take a look at what happened \nin New York City. This was before my colleague from Minnesota was here \nas a Member of this body. New York City faced bankruptcy. New York City \nwas rescued by the U.S. Government. But New York City had to cut its \nprograms for poor people up to 47 percent.\n  There is no United States of America, no big umbrella, to rescue this \ncountry. We are one-fifth of the world's economy. If we go down the \ntube economically, there is nobody out there to rescue us. The \nInternational Monetary Fund cannot begin to deal with our problem. The \nInternational Monetary Fund, in the case of Mexico, is offering to help \nto the tune of about $2 or $3 billion in guarantees. They cannot go \nfurther than that.\n  So, though I have great respect for my colleague from Minnesota, I do \nbelieve this amendment should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield a minute to myself to respond.\n  May I ask how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 10 minutes and \n48 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, it is certainly rare the Senator from \nIllinois and I are in disagreement on an issue. I am hoping to persuade \nhim to change his mind before the final vote because I want the Senator \nto know that, No. 1, when he talks about econometric models he is \nabsolutely right; there are a variety of different variables, including \nfactoring in the effect of lower interest rates, that would be \nincluded.\n  This is not an amendment against the balanced budget amendment. I \nmean, many State senators and representatives who signed this \nresolution, or voted for this resolution, are for it, I say to my \ncolleague from Illinois. The only thing they are saying is, if or \nwhen--your choice--you pass a balanced budget amendment, please \naccompany it with a financial analysis so we can have some sense of \nwhat the impact will be on the States.\n  I say to my good colleague, that is where your econometric model \nwould be figured in. We should do that. It is a matter of State and \nlocal government officials having the right to know--which is very much \nwithin the framework, I might say, of the unfunded mandates \nlegislation.\n  And finally, I have to say this to my colleague, and this is our \nhonest and profound disagreement: My colleague from Illinois is willing \nto make the difficult choices, which means he is not going to be \ninvolved in a bidding war to raise the Pentagon budget. He is not going \nto be involved in a bidding war for yet more tax cuts. He is not going \nto take everything off the table. And he is not just going to do \ndeficit reduction according to the path of least resistance, focused on \nthose citizens with the least amount of political clout.\n  But there is every reason in the world to believe that is precisely \nwhat we are going to do here and that is what people are worried about \nback in the States. That is what people in the States are worried \nabout, and they want us to be clear with them. That is all this \namendment says.\n  If we pass it, let us accompany it with a financial analysis of its \nimpact on the States. That is from Minnesota, passed unanimously by the \nState Senate, passed almost unanimously by the House, and passed and \nsigned into law by a Republican Governor. I do not think this is \nunreasonable.\n  So Senators should understand this is all they are voting on.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague will yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I may yield on the other side's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON. May I have 1 minute?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Just for 1 minute. I thank my colleague, and if this \npasses, if the balanced budget amendment passes--and I believe it \nwill--then I think we have to at that point let State and local \ngovernments know, let everyone know what kind of a glidepath we are on. \nI do not think we need to do that prior to passage. I think that \ncompounds the problems of passage--very candidly.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take my own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  MR. WELLSTONE. This amendment reads, after we pass it, we should do \nthis. That is the way this amendment reads.\n  Mr. SIMON. If that is correct, then I withdraw my opposition.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Then we should do the analysis.\n  Mr. SIMON. Then I withdraw my opposition. In that case, I have no \nobjection to the amendment. Once again, I am on the same side as my \ncolleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge and thank the \nSenator from Illinois, who certainly has been one of the leaders on the \nbalanced budget amendment, and also two Senators that will now be \nspeaking, the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] and the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Craig], again leaders on this balanced budget amendment.\n  So I yield 5 minutes now to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I cannot see a reason in the world why on \nlegislation regarding unfunded mandates we should have an amendment \nlike this or why we should spend 2 minutes on it.\n  We all know the balanced budget amendment is going to come up within \ndays on the House floor and within a week on the Senate floor, that is \nif we ever get through this unfunded mandates bill. If we do not get \nthrough this legislation pretty quick, we will not get through the \nMexican loan guarantee legislation with all its problems, which are \nvery, very serious.\n  As I say, I am not sure why we are here debating this issue now. We \nare supposed to be passing a bill to provide relief to the States from \nunfunded mandates. Everyone knows we are going to have ample time to \ndebate the balanced budget amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nand we should not hold up this bill to debate an amendment like this.\n  The provision that the Senator would like us to have--I know he is \nsincere; I have watched the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for \nhis whole Senate career, and I know he is sincere--but this amendment \nputs the cart before the horse. It puts the cart before the horse in \ntwo ways: First, in time since this debate should happen on the \nbalanced budget amendment itself, not here; and second, this amendment \ncannot be complied with as it is written. The balanced budget amendment \nrequires the Congress of the United States to work to balance the \nbudget. It does not write a particular mix of cuts or taxes into the \nConstitution. It is for the Congress to work toward resolution of those \nparticular issues and to set the priorities within the budget from year \nto year.\n  If we could get back to the business at hand and pass the unfunded \nmandates bill, it will give the States a measure of protection against \nWashington's mandates, and if the statutory route is insufficient, then \nthe States may want us to pursue a constitutional amendment on unfunded \nmandates. But let us pass the unfunded mandates bill first. Let us get \non to debate the passage of the balanced budget amendment and get the \nNation's fiscal house in order by balancing the budget without first \nburdening or binding the States. We need to get on with it, but we need \nto do it in a reasonable order.\n  The problem--just to spend a minute or two on this amendment--and I \nnote that the Senator is very sincere. What he would like in this \nsense-of-the-Congress amendment is that when Congress proposes to the \nStates a balanced budget amendment--assuming a balanced budget \namendment is passed through both Houses of Congress by the requisite \ntwo-thirds vote--then Congress must accompany it with financial \ninformation on the impact on the budget on each of the States.\n   [[Page S1493]] I would point out that we have trouble even getting \nCBO and other budget baseline scoring mechanisms to give us sound and \ntimely information on what we are doing, let alone having them analyze \nwhat each and every State in the Union has to do. Under this amendment, \nwe would be spending all our time trying to understand a continually \nshifting set of State problems and how our budget might impact on them. \nI think we need to worry about how the Federal budget can be reduced \nbetween the time of the passage of the balanced budget amendment and \nthe year 2002, if that is the effective date of the amendment. I do not \nwant to get into a situation where we must also worry about the choices \nof each of the States, and we complicate passing the balanced budget \namendment while attempting to get information like this that could cost \nus hundreds of millions of dollars to get.\n  Again, this amendment is just another unnecessary provision. The \nminute we pass the balanced budget amendment, this Congress will have \nto start working on coming up with a mechanism to get to a balanced \nbudget. I might add not just the Congress; the President is going to \nhave to work on coming up with the mechanism beyond the balanced budget \namendment to bring us into fiscal balance by the year 2002. I have to \ntell you, nobody in Congress and the Congress as a whole will be able \nto do that without the leadership of the President of the United \nStates. That has been the problem up to now. We have not had \nPresidential leadership to tell us what we have to do to balance the \nbudget, short of increasing taxes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could just finish. The fact of the matter is this \namendment would cloud the whole issue. It would require us to do \ncontinual budgetary analysis of State budgets--there are 50 of them; we \ncannot even handle the Federal budget--and thousands of Federal \nprograms tailored to each State and how it impacts each State. We would \nhave to put in place, before ratification, not only the budget for each \nyear until 2002, which of course we cannot do because we cannot bind \nfuture Congresses, but we must analyze what we guess each of the 50 \nStates would do in each of those years in response to our assumptions \nabout what future Congresses would do. And since we cannot either bind \nfuture Congresses, nor should be attempt to tell the States how they \nshould respond, we would have a continually shifting process, with \ncontinually changing information. We just do not have the capacity to \ncomply with this amendment. And I do not know how we would ever get 535 \nMembers of Congress to agree on all these forecasts of future \nCongressional actions and the responses of and effects on each of the \n50 States.\n  Furthermore, this amendment assumes that the States, which are very \ncapable, would be unable to do their own analysis and make its own \ndecisions about its budget priorities and come to its own decision \nabout ratification. I think the States should participate in the \nprocess of setting the national budget priorities, especially as it \nwill affect their own freedom to set priorities for themselves.\n  Mr. President, this is the wrong way to proceed. We need to get the \nmechanism in place that will require Congress to balance the budget \nbefore we can balance the budget. And before that we cannot tell what a \nbalanced budget would look like. We cannot tell the States what they \nshould or may do in response to either the balanced budget amendment or \na balanced Federal budget. This unfunded mandates bill that we are \nsupposed to be debating has the purpose of curbing such Washingtonian \nimperialism. And finally, we cannot project what future Congresses will \ndo. In fact we often cannot project very far into the future the \neffects of our present budgetary decisions. We cannot bind future \nCongresses to a particular budget. Nor should we. It is the right and \nduty of each Congress to set its own national priorities in the budget \nwhile complying with a balanced budget rule.\n  I hope this amendment is voted down. It is unnecessary and unwise, \nand adds an unnecessary cost to our society.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What I just heard the Senator say--and, by the way, it \nis part of the response to the discussion I had with the Senator from \nIllinois. What this amendment says, a sense of the Congress, coming \nright from Minnesota is that if we pass a balanced budget amendment, \nthen before we send it to the States we ought to have for the States a \nfinancial analysis of the impact. What I am hearing the Senator say is \nit is too hard for us to do that.\n  So do you not think, I would say to my colleague from Utah, or my \ncolleague from Idaho, or Ohio, or Georgia, our States have the right to \nknow? Do you not think our States have the right, as Minnesota as a \nState, to say to us, ``Look. After you pass this, if you pass it, \nbefore you send it to us, will you please give us an analysis of its \nimpact on our States?'' And now I hear the Senator from Utah saying it \nis too hard. We are talking about all sorts of amendments and all sorts \nof legislation in the unfunded mandates bill making sure that an \nanalysis is done. We did not say it is too hard for that. We are \ntalking about the right to know for our colleagues and for people back \nat the State and local communities. Now, when it comes to a huge \ndecision we are going to make, we are saying it is too hard, that we \ncannot, after we pass this, let our States know what the impact of this \nlegislation will be on that.\n  I find that to be an interesting argument. But I certainly hope my \ncolleagues will not be swayed by it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield on the time of the Senator \nfrom Utah, if I could.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Idaho yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Utah for purposes of \nresponding.\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, look. I guess there is nothing that is too hard if we \nhave enough money and enough time and enough bodies and enough people \nand enough economists to do it. The question is, is it prudent, is it \nwarranted, is it worth the cost? The fact of the matter is we cannot \nget CBO scoring the way we need to have it on time in order to do the \nthings that we need to do in this body. Do we need to add to it a \ncontinually shifting set of State budgetary priorities, for each of 50 \nStates, and have us be on top of every one of those priorities, and \nspend all the money to do that? No. What we have to do is get our own \nfiscal house in order. The States will adapt to it, each in its own way \nguided by the wisdom and needs of its own citizens. But I would add \nthat we have to have Presidential and congressional leadership for us \nall to do so.\n  Finally, Mr. President, everybody knows that this type of amendment \nis for one purpose; that is, to undermine the balanced budget \namendment. That is the sole and specific reason for it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield to the Senator from Ohio, \nbut if I could just respond.\n  First of all, I do not want Senators to be able to vote on the basis \nof a dodge. This amendment in no way, shape, or form is opposed to the \nbalanced budget amendment. Senators have different views on that. I can \nassure my colleague from Utah, my good friend, that the Minnesota House \nof Representatives and the Minnesota State Senate passed it by \noverwhelming votes and it was signed by a Republican Governor there. \nThere is strong support by many of these colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, for a balanced budget amendment. The only thing they \nhave said is, from our perspective in Minnesota, I think from the \nperspective in Utah and other States, how are we going to know whether \nor not to ratify this unless we know what the impact is going to be? If \nwe are going to pass something that is so far reaching, it is our right \nto know. Can you not provide \n[[Page S1494]] specific information? Can you not provide specific \nanalysis? That is all this amendment says.\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  I just say that I hope the same logic is used by the Senator from \nUtah when Senator Grassley's amendment comes up because the \ninterpretation of his amendment would mean we go back 21 years and \nrequire a study of all mandates--all mandates, period. It does not have \na $50 million threshold to it, as I understand it.\n  It would be such an enormous study that we requested CBO to give us \nfigures on how much it would cost them to do such a study, and they \ncannot give us an estimate right now. In other words, we are putting an \nunfunded mandate on CBO. He is concerned about CBO and I am, too, but I \nthink the logic of what the Senator is trying to do should also be \ncarried over to the consideration of Grassley, which would be an \nenormous study, beyond anything I would see proposed here.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have not referenced CBO. I have said it is up to us \nin our Budget Committee to come up with an analysis.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield a few moments to the Senator from Utah to respond.\n  Mr. HATCH. Last year, at the height of one of the most important \ndebates last year, the battle over health care, we could not get the \neconomic analysis of just health care in sufficient time for our \nanalysis, and that involved just the President's and one or two other \nhealth care programs. There were all kinds of other programs to be \nconsidered, but there was no time to get the full economic analysis. \nThe fact of the matter is that what the Senator from Minnesota is \nasking for would cost an arm and a leg and would not get us closer to a \nbalanced budget anyway--indeed it would place us further away because \nof the increased costs in performing the analysis.\n  I will look at Senator Grassley's amendment, because I think we have \nto look at what these costs are. But, really, this type of an amendment \ndoes not have an efficacious effect. It is going to cost us. We do not \nhave the facilities or the resources to do it. We have to determine \nhere what we can do to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. It is \ngoing to take time to do it and it is going to be costly in and of \nitself, without worrying about 50 States, and we should let future \nCongresses and each of the States make up its own mind about how it \nwishes to comply with a Federal rule of fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho. I \nbelieve my good friend from Minnesota did not vote for the balanced \nbudget amendment. I have to conclude that the essence of this amendment \nis to reinforce a message we heard last night from the President when \nhe defined, in my judgment, his decision about the new Democrat and old \nDemocrat, when he decided to oppose the balanced budget. He wanted \nthings to stay the same in Washington.\n  He underscored his dispute with the balanced budget amendment by \nbeginning to raise the specter of fear across the land, and began \npointing to specific groups. This is but an extension of that context, \nto try to suggest to the States that there is something for them to \nfear about this Nation finally taking charge and putting in motion a \ndiscipline to govern its financial affairs.\n  That is what this amendment is designed to do--to suggest that there \nis something to be feared. I might say, following on the remarks of my \ngood colleague from Utah, it goes beyond a question of the consumption \nof analysis as to how this would impact States. The point is that there \nis no way to determine what the judgments of future Congresses might--\nnot even including all the august Members that are here--do in order to \narrive at a balanced budget. This presupposes that you could suggest \nwhat is going to happen in the future, and you cannot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me conclude the time on our side by \nlooking at what past Congresses have done when they proposed amendments \nto the Constitution.\n  What the Senator is suggesting in his amendment is that the first \nCongress would have been able to anticipate that in the first amendment \nwe would have said that yelling ``fire'' in a crowded theater is \nagainst that amendment. But that is not what the first Congress said \nabout the first amendment, because they did not know at the time. They \ndid not understand, or they could not anticipate, what a court would \nsuggest.\n  What this is saying is that in the second amendment we would have \nsaid it was intended to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles. That \nis not what our Founding Fathers said at the time. They did not know.\n  Or we could have said the fourth amendment required reading aspects \nof the Miranda rights into the decision. Or maybe we would have said, \nin a post-Civil War Congress, that we knew 100 years subsequent how we \nwould anticipate all of the civil rights that would have come under the \nConstitution. No, I do not think that was intended, and I do not \nbelieve that any Congress can anticipate what a constitutional \namendment will do beyond the clarity of the language of the \nConstitution itself, and that is that we will have a balanced budget \namendment in a period of time.\n  Now it would then be the responsibility of Congresses following the \nenactment of an amendment as they begin to shift the priorities of \nGovernment, as they begin to downsize the rate of growth in Government, \nto turn to States and say: These kinds of impacts could occur. I think \nthat would be the responsibility.\n  I hope the Senate will vote down this amendment in a tabling motion, \nbecause I do not believe it is possible for us to project 7 years out \ninto the future what future Congresses might do and what impact it \nwould have upon the States.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues \nthat it is my joy to serve with, I think a lot of these arguments just \nmiss the central point. I want all of my colleagues to be clear on what \nthey are voting on.\n  This is not a sense-of-the-Congress amendment that says we should not \npass a balanced budget amendment. They are not voting on that. This is \nnot a sense-of-the-Congress amendment or sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nthat says we should be voting against unfunded mandates at all. In \nfact, the unfunded mandates legislation says that senators and \nrepresentatives in our State and local governments are entitled to \ninformation, entitled to a right to know before we pass legislation and \ndo not tell them anything about the impact or come up with the money.\n  This amendment is a mandate from Minnesota, strong bipartisan support \nin a resolution that emphasized deficit reduction. Then it ended up \nsaying:\n\n       . . . be it Resolved by the legislature of the State of \n     Minnesota, that it urges the Congress of the United States to \n     continue its progress in reducing the annual Federal deficit, \n     and when the Congress proposes the balanced budget amendment, \n     to accompany it with financial information on the impact on \n     the budget of the State of Minnesota.\n\n  My amendment says if we pass a balanced budget amendment before we \nsend it to the States, which by definition would be after we pass it, \nwe should do an analysis of its financial impact on our States. How can \nour States then make decisions about whether or not to ratify it unless \nwe are willing to provide them with the information?\n  Mr. President, I am just amazed by some of the arguments that have \nbeen made on the floor of the Senate because they do not speak to the \ncentral issue.\n  I say to my colleagues that this vote on this amendment is all about \naccountability. This is all about being direct with people. It is all \nabout responding to our States. It is all about the concern that people \nhave, about where will $1.2 trillion or $1.3 trillion in cuts take us \nbetween now and 2002. What will be its effect on citizens in Minnesota, \nIdaho, Georgia, Utah, all across the country? Minnesota State \nlegislators, Republicans and Democrats alike, and the Republican \nGovernor, are bipartisan and have sent a resolution here. I translated \nthat into an amendment. It is an eminently reasonable request that I \nthink will come \n[[Page S1495]] from all of our State legislatures and Governors, which \nis: If you pass the balanced budget amendment, then before you send it \nto the States, please do an economic analysis of it so we will know the \nimpact on our States and on our people. Are we going to have to raise \ntaxes at the State level? Is that what we are afraid to tell our \ncolleagues at the State level? Are our local governments going to have \nto rely more on the property tax? Is this going to become the biggest \nunfunded mandate of all, where we just transfer costs back to State and \nlocal governments? Is that why we are unwilling to pass this amendment, \na sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that we at least, before we send this \nto the States, have an accompanying financial analysis?\n  I hope that this amendment will attract strong bipartisan support. It \nis all about the rights of people back in our States to know what we \nare doing. It is all about accountability. It is all about good \ngovernment. It is all about being direct and straightforward with \npeople, and this amendment should pass by a huge vote in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the second-degree amendment numbered 186 of the \nSenator from Minnesota to the first-degree amendment No. 185.\n  Does the Senator from Idaho wish to table the first-degree amendment \nor the second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I wish to table amendment No. 185.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is to table amendment No. 185.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion of the Senator \nfrom Idaho [Mr. Craig] to table the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me state for the benefit of my \ncolleagues, we do have a meeting at 2 o'clock today. Hopefully, \neverybody will come--Senators only, no staff--to talk about a number of \nthings that affect us, not as Senators, as Republicans or Democrats, \nbut as people who live around here.\n  I think during that period, we will not recess because I think there \nwill be an amendment offered. But I want to point out, we still have 39 \namendments. This is the 11th day and we still have 39 amendments to \nthis bill. We are going to finish the bill this week, if it takes all \nday today until midnight, all day tomorrow until midnight, all day \nFriday, and all day Saturday. We are going to finish the bill this \nweek.\n  So I hope that Members are prepared to offer amendments and give us \ntime agreements, or not offer amendments. I cannot believe that every \none of the 39 amendments, whether they are on this side of the aisle or \nthat side of the aisle, needs to be offered. So we will finish this \nbill this week sometime. We may file cloture if we do not get some \naction on some of the amendments. It is 12:15. We disposed of one \nlittle amendment. We have 39 left.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, in response to the majority leader's \ncomments, we are working very hard trying to get just as many lined up \nwith time agreements as short as possible so we can move it along. I \nknow the majority leader's desire to end this this week. We are \ncertainly cooperating in that endeavor to that end. We are trying very \nhard to line things up just as fast as we can, to get them tailored \nwith the shortest time agreement as possible. I think we are making \nsome progress, and we will continue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the introduction of S. 274 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 1:30 p.m. the Senate turn to the consideration of \namendment No. 202 by Senator Boxer and there be time for debate prior \nto a motion to table divided in the following fashion: 90 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Boxer, 30 minutes under the control of Senator \nKempthorne. I further ask unanimous consent no amendments be in order \nto amendment No. 202, and that following the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, the majority manager or his designee be recognized to \nmove to table amendment No. 202 and that upon the disposition of \namendment No. 202 the Senate turn to the consideration of amendment No. \n187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will not direct my address to the \nPresident's \n[[Page S1496]] speech last night. But I have been planning for some \ntime to make a few remarks regarding the President's performance, with \nemphasis on the things that I think are important to the future of this \ncountry.\n  We get so bound up here in our considerations on the Senate floor, in \nour committee work, and in our speeches back home that I think we \nsometimes do not really sort out the wheat from the chaff and try at \nleast in our mind's eye to go 10, 15, or 20 years in the future, and \nlook back to see what was really important to the people that was \npassed by any administration. What has effect 15 years down the road \nfor every family, every child, the elderly, the young --everyone in our \nwhole society? What then should be relegated to trivial footnotes of \nhistory? It seems as though quite often we concentrate on things that \nin history's 20-20 hindsight will be but trivia, while in the future we \nwill live with the important things that were passed in any \nadministration. I think we need to consider the Clinton administration \nin that light.\n  The October 24 issue of Time magazine had a little graph that showed \nthat this President, President Clinton, had passed and signed into law \nmore of his stated agenda than any other President since Lyndon Johnson \nand before that back to Dwight Eisenhower. In other words, it was the \nmost successful first 2 years--not quite 2 years, but the first 20 \nmonths--of accomplishing an announced agenda since President Dwight \nEisenhower.\n  That is a proud record quite apart from all the trivia and all the \nups and downs of charges against the President that I think will wind \nup as small print footnotes later, trivia, in history.\n  What we are talking about here is doing rather than talking. It seems \nto me people tend to ignore the record of what was done, what has been \naccomplished in this first 2 years. Too many on the other side keep \ntalking about doing some of these things that are already under way, \nthat are already being accomplished by this administration.\n  I can go through some examples of this. The economy has never been \nbetter. We have the lowest unemployment in 4 years, and the budget \ndeficit has come down 3 years in a row. That is not something for the \nfuture. This is being done now with the economic policies of this \nadministration. We remember the reconciliation vote in August of the \nfirst year of this President's tenure in office. There was not a single \nRepublican vote, not one, that we could get here in the Senate to pass \nthat reconciliation. In fact, the Vice President had to break the tie \non that vote. There were dire predictions by some on the other side \nthat there was going to be massive unemployment. In fact, all the other \nthings that were brought up at that time that have not occurred. The \neconomy remains in good shape. I repeat this is the first time we will \nhave reduced the budget deficit since the administration of Harry \nTruman-- 3 years of reducing the budget deficit.\n  How about the size of Government? When this administration came in, \nwe had a lot of publicity and talk about reinventing Government. But it \nwas not all talk; a lot of things were also put into effect. Some 300 \ndifferent programs have been cut in the last 2 years. We talk about \nreducing the size of Government, getting the Government down-sized. The \nobjective stated last year was that within 3 years we would be able to \nreduce the size of the Federal work force by some 272,000 people. At \nthat time, a lot of people clucked a little bit, put their tongue in \ntheir cheek and said, ``We will believe it when we see it.'' Well, we \nare seeing it.\n  Right now, the current figure of reaching that goal of reducing the \nFederal work force by 272,000 is being accomplished. 98,000 people have \nalready been cut from the Federal work force. Along with those cuts--\nand I worked with the administration on this as chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--has come something else. Formerly, the \nFederal work force was all skewed to bosses and there was not enough \nemployees in many departments and agencies. In other words, the boss-\nto-employee ratio was not what it is in private business, academia, or \nanywhere. In businesses across the country, the ratio of managers to \nemployees is 1 to 12 or 1 to 15. The Federal Government has drifted \nover the years to a point where it is top heavy. We have about a 1-to-7 \nmanager-to-employee ratio.\n  At the same time we are down-sizing by 272,000, how do we manage to \nadjust the manager-to-employee ratio? We put in buyout legislation \nalong with early retirements. This encourages the GS--the civil service \nratings--GS-13's, 14's, and 15's, who are basically the managers, to \nget out. So we are simultaneously down-sizing and correcting this \nimbalance that is very wasteful and adjusting it back to a better ratio \nthat will compare favorably with what is done in private industry and \nprivate business. We do not hear that mentioned very often. When we get \ncut down to the 272,000 level, we will have the lowest Federal \nemployment since John F. Kennedy was President.\n  What other things have been done during the first 2 years of this \nadministration? With the administration's support, the Congress put \nthrough a family leave bill. Everybody talks about making a more \nfamily-friendly administration here in Washington, a more family-\nfriendly Nation. What could be more family friendly, I ask you, than \nallowing employees to have time off when there is a bereavement in the \nfamily, when somebody is sick, or when there is a birth in the family? \nThese are times when a person's attention should flow to the family and \nbe concentrated on the family.\n  Once again, there were all sorts of dire predictions of what would \nhappen if we passed this legislation. So there was one exemption put in \nthat said if you have key employees, and taking those key employees out \nfor family leave would hurt the business, they were exempted. But the \nregular rung of employees in a company that can be filled in for on a \ntemporary basis, they would have the right to help take care of their \nfamilies if there is sickness, or a mother or father needs help, or if \na child is ill, or whatever.\n  This administration is expanding Head Start. We now have an extra \n200,000 young people in this country that have access to the benefits \nof the Head Start Program. Last evening the President talked about his \nNational Service Program. This program is a helping hand. It is a \nprogram where people are doing constructive things for their community \nand reaping some benefit for it. I have talked to some of those people \nand they are proud of what they are doing under these Government \nprograms.\n  I submit that, once again, going into the future some 15 or 20 years, \nwe will look back and many of those people will be in productive work \nbecause of the opportunity they were given at this time. I would be \nvery surprised, if we took that view in the future and actually \ndetermined the past cost, if this program had not been something of \nbenefit for the Government. Those people will be so much more \nproductive. They will be paying taxes and will be productive citizens. \nEven more important will be the fact that their lives have been \nenriched, and they will be participating citizens in the future of this \ncountry. What can be more important than that?\n  In another area, the college loan program has been expanded. The \npotential is there for some 20 million people to have the advantage of \na college education over the next few years.\n  For communities, there is a community development bank that has been \nprovided. These are not things where we are just talking about it as \nthough we had to do something in the future; these are things actually \nbeing done. They are being accomplished now. They are accomplishments \nof the first 2 years of this administration. These are not pie-in-the-\nsky things. These are things where the new administration made these \nproposals, worked with Congress, and we got them through.\n  I think the news media concentrate on the trivia of history to the \nexclusion of some of the good things that have gotten through for which \nthe President should get due credit as accomplishments achieved during \nthe administration's first couple of years. Yet, too often we find the \nother side talking as though nothing has been done in these areas.\n  We want to cut the size of Government. It is being done, my friends. \nIt is being done now--and ahead of schedule. There has been a 98,000 \nreduction in the Federal work force already, but 272,000 was the goal, \nand that is coming.\n   [[Page S1497]] Have we gotten everything done? Not by a long shot. \nWe are just seeing the beginning of GATT. I have not mentioned that. \nInternational trade is now being addressed. This is controversial. We \nhave a lot of people in my State of Ohio, and some were for GATT and \nsome were against GATT. I submit that we have moved into such an \neconomic situation in the world that had we not finally terminated \nnegotiations and gotten an agreement on GATT, we would have placed \nourselves at a great disadvantage down the road.\n  To give an example of what I am talking about, if we went back to a \nNew England village 100 years ago or so, it probably made very little \ndifference whether anyone came through that village from one year to \nthe next. The buggy-maker was on one corner, the cobbler or the \nshoemaker was over on another corner, most people had a garden out \nbehind the house, and there were vegetables grown out in the valley. It \nwas basically a self-sufficient community that took care of itself. \nPeople took care of people; the community took care of its local \ncommunity. Now, what happened? Then we developed out of that village, \nand the cobbler, in effect, became all of New England and parts of the \nSouth. The buggy-maker became Detroit, and the Imperial Valley in \nCalifornia became the supplier for the whole Nation, as our means of \nshipping were expanded. Then we developed even further, and what \nhappened? The buggy-maker that was in Detroit became 30 percent \nJapanese, and the cobbler became Korea and Italy, and our food was sent \nall over the world, with hundreds of millions of tons being shipped \neverywhere.\n  In other words, we became, whether we like it or not, a worldwide \ncommunity. And the question is, are we going to move into GATT and \nparticipate and be the competitive Americans that we have always been, \nor are we going to ask for protection in a world that is moving toward \ninternational relationships?\n  I think it is to the President's credit that he moved us into GATT. \nGATT was not something that was supported by just this President alone, \nbut he brought it to its final culmination, and we got it through. GATT \nhad been going on over the last two Republican administrations. It has \nbeen negotiated over a lengthy period of time. But it was brought to \nfruition, and now we have this agreement that I think will be a \npattern, not perfect, that we can follow into the future.\n  Now, have we accomplished everything that needs to be accomplished? \nCertainly not. There was a lot that did not get done in the first 2 \nyears. Certainly health care is one that always comes up about what a \ngreat failure it was. Well, I think, in looking back on what happened \nhere, the concentration on health care last year was not all a \ndisaster, for this reason:\n  For the first time we had a concentrated debate, concentrated \nattention on health care reform. Because of the efforts of the \nPresident and the First Lady, there was attention focused on health \ncare all through last year. Maybe it excluded some other things.\n  But was it a total loss? No; I do not think it was. Because what \nhappened was the health care community, the health care providers, \nthose in the health care industry, took a new look at themselves. They \ntook a new look at themselves and said, maybe we can do better, and \nfelt that they should do better or something was going to happen to \nthem.\n  So we find HMO's being formed and we find hospitals cooperating for \nthe first time with other hospitals, not just in competition but \nworking together to see whether they cannot share equipment and cut \ncosts down. We find doctors' groups moving to HMO's. We find all sorts \nof things going on in the medical industry, the health provider \nindustry, that are good, largely as a result of the concentration on \nhealth care during the past year.\n  I do not want to be a Pollyanna about this and say that we solved our \nhealth care problems. Far from it. We have yet to address many \nproblems, and they are still out there waiting to be addressed, because \nwe have many millions of Americans that do not have health care \ninsurance yet. But I would say that the costs are beginning to level \noff a little bit from what some of the predictions indicated because of \nthe attention that was put on the industry last year and because of the \naction they have taken to try to reduce health care costs. So that is \none that we have yet to deal with.\n  There are environmental concerns that we have not yet addressed. Last \nnight, the President spoke of several other issues that have not been \naddressed such as lobbying reform, political reform and campaign \nfinance reform.\n  There are two other issues that we are in the process of addressing. \nOne of the two other objectives set early on in the administration was \ncongressional compliance with the laws that apply to everyone. We voted \nthat out of here. It went to the White House and the signing was just \nthe day before yesterday. I participated in that signing. This \nlegislation is something that I have pushed on the Senate floor since \n1978 and it has taken all this time to get it through. Senator Grassley \nand Senator Lieberman took the lead in drafting this legislation \nthrough our Committee on Governmental Affairs last year and we almost \nhad it through last fall.\n  Those who would somehow seem to eliminate all past considerations as \nthough this legislation was something brand new that was passed just \nbecause there was a change of political leadership in the Congress have \nnot looked back to see the long history of what has happened in getting \nto the point where we are now. Had there not been some of the delays \noccasioned in the last 10 weeks of the past session, where nothing was \nbeing let through, we probably would have had congressional coverage \nlegislation last fall.\n  I would say the same with unfunded mandates, the bill that is on the \nfloor right now. Unfunded mandates is another one that my colleague \nSenator Kempthorne from Idaho has taken a lead on. I have worked with \nhim on this. We had a bill through committee last fall, S. 993, but, \nonce again, because of the delays, we could not get it on the floor. We \neven finally tried to do it by unanimous consent. We could not do that \nlast fall in the last few days of the session, so that did not get \npassed. So we are addressing that now.\n  This legislation also has a long history over the last couple of \nyears of being addressed under the leadership of the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho. And he has done a great job. It has been an honor \nfor me to work with him on this legislation. We remain as committed as \never to getting it passed. We are involved now in some of the \ndifficulties in getting it through.\n  There were delays in committee. We were not permitted to bring up \namendments in committee, so we are trying to address those amendments \nhere on the floor right now to correct some discrepancies in the bill \nand to make the bill better and workable. So we will work through this.\n  But I wanted to take this opportunity, since there were some comments \nmade about the President's speech last night, to make these few remarks \nhere today on the floor about the accomplishments of the first 2 years \nof this administration. I personally think the President can be very \nproud of these first 2 years.\n  As I started off saying, Time magazine in the October 24 issue showed \na bar chart of accomplishments of the announced agenda of Presidents \ngoing clear back to Dwight Eisenhower, since World War II. This \nPresident has the best record of getting through what he said he would \ndo since Lyndon Johnson, who came in on the heels of the Kennedy \nassassination, had a great wave of support at that time, and going \nbeyond that back to Dwight Eisenhower, who was trying to reform things \nafter World War II and had the support of the people in that effort.\n  So I think this is a Presidency in which we can be proud of its \naccomplishments. Did the administration accomplish everything they \nwanted? No, certainly not. There was a mammoth effort on health care \nlast year that did not result in everything they wanted, and we still \nhave to deal with that.\n  But I wanted to set the record straight on what I think will be in \nthe mind's eye, looking back 20 years from now or 15 years from now, as \nto what is affecting my family, your family, our children, our mothers \nand fathers, and so on. What, in this first 2 years, will be the \nimportant things that are affecting lives across this country? And \n[[Page S1498]] if we look at it from that vantage point in the years to \ncome, it seems to me that we will be living with a lot of very, very \nimportant things. We will have had a stable economy during this time; \nwe will have had a new relationship in trade that we can expand; the \ncrime bill--I did not mention that; that is one that affects us \neverywhere we live--family leave, Head Start, national service. These \nare programs that are good. They are programs that I have been glad to \nbe a part of helping put through here in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are ready to move on some other items \nhere. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I had asked that we go into morning business. I ask \nthat we return to regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, I listened to a goodly number of our \ncolleagues earlier today as they came to the floor to speak about the \nconstitutional amendment on the balanced budget. I was glad to see the \nPresident last night give some time to that subject matter.\n I was glad that he stated that the proponents of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget have a responsibility to let the \nAmerican people know up front the details as to just how the proponents \npropose to achieve that balanced budget over the next 7 years.\n\n  I listened to my friends with a great deal of interest this morning \non the floor, and I just have a few comments to make in regard to this \nsubject. Many colleagues who support such a constitutional amendment \nare sincere in their belief that such an amendment is the answer to our \nbudget deficits and is necessary to impose discipline on ourselves. I \ndo not quarrel with their sincerity. They have a right to their \nviewpoints just as I have a right to mine.\n  I heard it said earlier today that Members of the House and Senate \nshould show courage by voting for a constitutional amendment. Mr. \nPresident, courage is not needed to vote for a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. Courage is needed to oppose the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. We read public polls that 80 percent \nof the American people support a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget. Courage is not needed to vote for something that the polls \nsay 80 percent of the people want. Courage is needed to take the time \nto try to convince the American people that they are being misled. So \nthose of us who vote against a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget are swimming upstream, and going against the grain.\n  I believe it was Talleyrand who said, ``There is more wisdom in \npublic opinion than is to be found in Napoleon, Voltaire, or all the \nministers of state present and to come.''\n  I subscribe to that view. There is more wisdom in the people, but the \npeople have to be informed in order to reach considered and wise \njudgments. The people have to be correctly informed if they are to form \nwise opinions. They also have a responsibility to do what they can to \ninform themselves.\n  It does not take courage, Mr. President, to vote for this \nconstitutional amendment on the balanced budget. It just takes a \npolitician's view of what is best for him or her politically at the \nmoment. I urge Senators to show courage in taking the time to debate \nthis matter fully and voting against a constitutional amendment on the \nbalanced budget, at least until the proponents show Senators what is \ninvolved here--what is in this poke, along with the pig.\n  I hear it repeated over and over again that we need a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, so that we will be forced to \ndiscipline ourselves. Mr. President, no constitutional amendment can \ngive us the political spine to make the hard choices necessary to \nbalance the budget. Constitutional amendments cannot impose spine or \ncourage or principle where those things may be lacking to begin with.\n  We do not need a constitutional amendment. If the proponents of a \nconstitutional amendment have two-thirds of the votes in the House and \nSenate, and I would say they are very close to that, I would say they \nwould need 67 votes in the Senate and 290 votes in the House. If they \nhave 67 votes in the Senate and 290 votes in the House for a \nconstitutional amendment, they can pass any bill, now. It only takes a \nmajority to pass a bill. If all Senators are here, it only takes 51 \nSenators to pass a bill, and only a majority of the House to pass a \nbill. So if the votes are in both Houses to adopt a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, the votes are here to produce simple \nmajorities to pass bills and resolutions that will get the job done \nnow. We do not have to wait 7 years.\n  In the final analysis, the discipline that is needed now will still \nbe needed 7 years from now if this amendment goes into effect. That \nconstitutional amendment will not cut one program nor will it raise \ntaxes by one copper penny. In my judgment it will have to be a \ncombination of both in order to deal with the extremely serious problem \nof balancing the budget.\n  The responsibility of balancing the budget 7 years from now will rest \nwhere it rests now: With the President of the United States and with \nthe Members of the House and the Senate. If we lack the discipline now \nwe are not likely to have much more spine, if any, 7 years from now. It \nwill come right back here. Of course, many of those who vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance theMr. Chairman, budget today \nprobably will not be around, some of us, in the House and Senate, 7 \nyears from now.\n  Mr. President, an immense hoax--that is what this is, in my judgment, \na colossal hoax. It is supported by a lot of well-intentioned, well-\nmeaning people. But in the final analysis, that is what it will prove \nto have been--a hoax. It is about to be perpetrated on the public at \nlarge.\n  It is this Senator's hope that the people will get quickly about the \nbusiness of informing themselves of the ramifications of the so-called \nbalanced budget amendment before it is too late. In my opinion, the \nAmerican people could do themselves no better favor than to become very \nintimately involved as fast as they can with the details. And they \nshould insist on their representatives in these two bodies to give them \nthe details, and the probable impact of this proposal.\n  For almost every benefit being claimed by the proponents of this ill-\nconceived idea, the exact opposite of the bogus claim is, in fact, the \ntruth. For example, the proponents claim that the balanced budget \namendment will remove the burdening of debt from our children and leave \nthem with a brighter future. This balanced budget amendment will do \nnothing of itself. The amendment would do nothing of the kind that is \nbeing stated. Even if we were somehow able instantly to be able to \nbring the current budget into balance, our children, our grandchildren, \nand their children would still be in debt and they would still be \npaying interest on that debt. Bringing the budget into balance so that \nthere is no deficit this year or next year, or the \n[[Page S1499]] next year, is child's play compared with wiping out this \nNation's $4.6 trillion national debt.\n  What we pay interest on is our debt. The people should be made aware \nthat the deficit is not the debt. The debt is an accumulation of the \ndeficits built up over a period of years. A constitutional amendment \ndoes absolutely nothing about retiring the national debt.\n  The American people are being told that by passing a constitutional \namendment, we will somehow be relieving generations to come of the \nobligations to pay for the debt of past generations. Well, until the \nday that the national debt is completely retired, there will still be \ninterest that has to be paid, and then there will be the principal, \nwhich future generations will have to eliminate.\n  That is not to say that getting our deficits down is not important. \nIt is. And we went down that track in 1990 when, under President Bush, \nwe met at the so-called budget summit and a Republican President, \nPresident Bush, and the Democratic Congress, made up of both Houses, \nnot just one, enacted legislation to reduce the deficit over a period \nof 5 years.\n  The same thing happened again in 1993. President Clinton and a \nDemocratic Congress passed a reconciliation measure which laid out a 5-\nyear glidepath to bring down the deficits, and the deficits are coming \ndown.\n  That was a tough bill to vote for. Not one of our Republican friends \non the Senate side--not one--not one of those who are proposing today \nthat we have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, not one \nvoted for that bill in 1993, and I believe I am correct in saying that \nnot a single Republican in the House voted for that package. I could be \nwrong in that. But not one vote came for that bill from the other side \nof the aisle. There was an opportunity for courage. Why was it not \ndemonstrated then by the proponents on the other side of the aisle?\n  There was some pain in that package--some increased taxes, some cuts \nin programs. We are operating right today with a freeze on \ndiscretionary spending. We are operating below a freeze in our \ndiscretionary spending, because we passed that package and because, \nsubsequently, we have passed measures that are in keeping with the \npromise that we made when we passed that budget reduction measure. That \nis the course we ought to continue on: Bring the budget deficits down \nbut do not tamper with that fundamental organic document, the \nfundamental law of our country which trumps any other law of the land.\n  So let us not buy the claim that the balanced budget amendment will \nsomehow take your grandchildren off the hook. These deficits and that \ndebt can never be wished away, nor can they willy-nilly, over a period \nof any number of years, be erased through a simple provision that is \ninscribed into the fundamental law of the land: The Constitution.\n  That balanced budget amendment will not take our grandchildren off \nthe hook. It cannot and will not.\n  As for leaving future generations with a brighter future, this \nbalanced budget amendment is more likely to snuff out any possibility \nfor a brighter future for many of America's children than to brighten \nsuch future.\n  Getting the details about how the proponents would actually get to a \nbalance by the year 2002 is like extracting blood from a turnip. The \nPresident said we ought to have that. But if the broad outlines of such \na plan to get to balance are to be believed, America's future may be \ndim, indeed.\n  According to reports, some proponents of the balanced budget \namendment want to exempt Social Security and exempt defense spending \nfrom any cuts. Regardless of whether one agrees with those exemptions \nor not, let us just look at the arithmetic.\n  If one adds to that list the interest on the national debt, which \ncannot be cut and which must be paid, then more than half of the \nFederal Government's budget will have been excluded from any effort to \nbalance the budget by constitutional amendment, if those items, defense \nand Social Security and interest on the debt, are taken off the table.\n  When we take those items off the menu, slide them off the table and \ntotally insulate them from any review or analysis as to whether or \nwhere they should be cut, what have we done to the remainder of the \nFederal budget? The prime candidate then left to feel the budget ax \nbecomes the domestic discretionary budget.\n  Discretionary spending is made up of both domestic and defense \nspending. If we eliminate defense from the equation, then the prime \ncandidate to feel the budget ax becomes the domestic discretionary \nbudget. That portion of the budget is the portion left to fund \neducation, veterans' medical care, pensions, protect our people's \nhealth and safety, fund research and development projects, build roads \nand bridges, fund crime-fighting efforts, foster U.S. economic \ncompetitiveness in global markets, and generally invest in our people, \ntheir talents, and their future.\n  Obviously, if we take most of the Federal budget off limits for cuts, \nthen the portion that is still eligible for cuts is going to be pretty \nbadly devastated. One-point-three trillion dollars is not change for \nthe streetcar or the bus.\n  What then happens to the quality of life in America that we are going \nto bequeath to our children? That ought to be a prime consideration in \nour debate here on the floor, and it ought to be a prime consideration \non the minds of the people.\n  Are we really doing our children and our grandchildren a favor by \nembracing this amendment to balance the budget? We are all for a \nbalanced budget. Those Senators who spoke in support of a balanced \nbudget amendment this morning said we are all in favor of balancing the \nbudget, and we are. If we devastate the part of the budget that keeps \nour kids educated, protects our health, advances our research, helps to \nkeep our Nation competitive in the world, keeps our infrastructure in \ngood repair--in other words, minds the basic needs of the Nation--what \nare we actually doing?\n  Mr. President, is there an order that at 1:30 we go back----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Chair will state to the Senator from \nWest Virginia, under a previous order, we will be considering an \namendment at the hour of 1:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed out of order for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, so what we are actually doing is walking \naway from these responsibilities at the Federal level and relegating \nthem to the States and counties and municipal governments. Some would \nsay, ``Yahoo, get the Federal Government off our backs.'' That is the \nstandard talk show answer. But let us give that a little more thought.\n  With the passage of this balanced budget amendment, we will actually \nbe shifting traditional Federal responsibilities, many of them, to the \nStates and to the State houses. We will be creating a patchwork quilt \nof a nation with some States able to meet the increased \nresponsibilities dumped on them by the Federal Government's withdrawal \nof funds due to steep budget cuts and other States not being able to do \nso.\n  We will have some States with enormous unemployment, some States with \nextremely dilapidated and deplorable transportation systems, some \nStates booming, maybe, and others busting.\n Do we want that result?\n\n  I hear the Governors boasting of having cut taxes. I heard some of \nthat last night. They are cutting taxes at the State level. And they \nhave further tax cuts planned. Just wait until this constitutional \namendment goes into effect. Those Governors will not cut taxes anymore. \nThey will have to increase taxes because much of the burden is going to \nbe dumped on them from the Federal Government. We will have trickle-\ndown mandates. The Federal Government will offload the problems on the \nState governments. State governments will offload those problems on the \ncounty governments and municipal governments, and in the final analysis \nthe same people who pay the taxes now are going to continue to pay the \ntaxes.\n  Do we want to have parts of America looking like a Third World \ncountry? I have not heard those concerns addressed by anyone. The \nAmerican people are not being told about the very dark and dismal side \nof this balanced \n[[Page S1500]] budget amendment. Why is not anyone talking about these \nprobable results of enacting such a proposal? In the opinion of at \nleast one leader of the other body, the answer is, because if we talk \nabout these things, the proposal will not pass. The knees of Members \nwill buckle.\n  Now, think of that. Are we going to hide these things from the people \nin order to pass this ill-conceived idea?\n  There are other aspects of this proposal that are being hidden from \nthe American people as well. All the while we are slashing away at the \nfunds we have used to invest in our own people, some of the proponents \nof this amendment are busily signing on to some of the biggest tax cuts \nin our history. The U.S. Treasury Department indicates that Congress \nwill have to come up with another $300 billion in cuts over the next 7 \nyears to pay for the tax cuts reported to be embraced by the so-called \nContract With America.\n  Now that, my friends, is not small change, either. Well, some would \nsay, what is wrong with that? I want a tax cut.\n  Now we have the leaders of both parties advocating tax cuts.\n  Well, with a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, we need \nto reduce our deficit. We do not want any cuts in defense. We say no \ncuts in Social Security. We want to balance our budget, but we also \nwant to cut taxes.\n  I said to Mr. Reagan, when he was President, you cannot do all these \nthings and balance the budget. You cannot cut taxes in the situation we \nare in; you cannot have a massive buildup in defense spending; you \ncannot do all those things at the same time you cut taxes and still \nbalance the budget. And we saw an accumulation of $3.5 trillion added \nto the nearly $1 trillion national debt which was in existence when \nPresident Reagan was elected--an almost $1 trillion national debt--and \nnow we have a $4.5 trillion debt.\n  Look again at those tax cuts in the context of the budget cuts. It \ndoes not make sense. All that additional chopping at the budget to pay \nfor tax cuts puts even more pressure on the States to fill in the gaps \nleft by the cuts in the Federal budget.\n  There is some very clever sleight of hand going on here, Mr. and Mrs. \nTaxpayer. You may get the Federal tax cuts, but your State taxes are \ngoing to go through the roof as a result of this constitutional \namendment on the balanced budget. And that ought to infuriate every \nthinking American taxpayer and inflame every Governor of the Nation. \nBut many of the Governors are saying: No, give us a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. We are cutting taxes in the States. \nWhy do we not have a balanced budget amendment? Get the Federal \nGovernment off our back.\n  Once that constitutional amendment takes effect, the Governors of the \nStates will not be cutting taxes. The load is going to shift to them. \nThey are going to be increasing taxes. Federal taxes will be cut and \npaid for with cuts in Federal programs, but that means the States will \nbe left holding the bag, and the States' taxes will likely climb \nthrough the ceiling. The poor, unwitting believer in the balanced \nbudget will be given the double whammy of increased taxes and reduced \nservices.\n  When one takes more than half the Federal budget off the table--makes \nit off limits for cuts under the balanced budget amendment--then fully \none-third of the remaining Federal programs are composed of grants to \nState and local governments and those are obviously going to be \nbrutalized under this balanced budget amendment regardless of our \npassing this unfunded mandates bill that is presently before the \nSenate.\n  I hope the Governors will listen. I hope the Governors are eager to \nraise taxes to pay for essential needs, because the Federal Government \nis going to have to take a powder under this balanced budget amendment.\n  Nobody is leveling with the American people about these matters. I \nsay to the American people, if there is ever a time to utilize your \nwell-honed distrust for politicians, utilize it now. Demand to know \nwhat balancing the budget really means and how the proponents plan to \nbalance it. Do not let the politicians get away with this rabbit in a \nhat, with this sleight of hand.\n  What is going on here is simply politicians falling all over each \nother to embrace something that is momentarily popular. Sloganeering \nhas taken the place of serious legislating and only you, the American \npeople, can turn that around. I urge the American people to look \nbeneath the slogans before it is too late. Demand to understand what \nwill really happen to your taxes, to your quality of life, to your \nlocal economy, to your children and grandchildren if we \nconstitutionalize this slogan. Demand to know the details. Understand \nthat when Federal taxes are slashed in this instance, State taxes are \nlikely to soar, likely to go up. Understand that when necessary Federal \nprograms are slashed, services decline.\n  I am not saying that there should not be some programs slashed--that \nis what we did in 1993; it is what we ought to do--or services decline. \nEach State then has to try to pick up the slack.\n  Understand that reducing the deficit is not the same as reducing the \ndebt, and do not be disappointed to learn that even after we devastate \nthe only pot of money we have from which to invest in ourselves, in our \nNation, and in our children by way of infrastructure and investment in \nthe Nation's infrastructure, those children and their children will \nstill be paying interest annually on the national debt.\n  Also understand that the unfunded mandates legislation does nothing \nto protect States from Federal mandates already in place.\n  Understand that the balanced budget amendment straitjackets the \nNation when it comes to dealing with the economy. In a recession when \neconomic activity falls and revenues fall, unless the Congress can get \na three-fifths vote to agree to run a deficit, then the Government will \nbe forced to aggravate the problem by cutting public expenditures, \nwhich is the easiest way I know to turn a recession into a depression.\n  Fiscal policy needs to be flexible because we cannot accurately \npredict economic fluctuations. Engraving fiscal policy and political \nideology on the marvelously flexible United States Constitution is like \nputting an ugly tattoo on the forehead of a beautiful child. It is \ninappropriate, will mar the child forever, and it serves no purpose \nwhatever except to destroy something inherently fine and to deface it.\n  I implore the American people to make the powers-that-be tell the \nAmerican public how--exactly how--they intend to get the budget into \nbalance by 2002. What are the proponents hiding? What about this \nsleight of hand on the subject of tax reduction? What else is there \nthat we do not want the American people to know?\n  I also hope to remind the American people that television and radio \ntalk shows are entertainment, not hard news and not hard facts. Do not \nlet the colorful talk show hosts obscure real issues by exploiting \npublic anger. If you are really angry about public policy, demand to \nknow the details of the so-called cures for the ills of public policy \nfrom the proponents. Do not buy three-line formulas as a blueprint for \nsome so-called American revolution, some Contract With America.\n  Here in my hand is my ``Contract With America,'' the Constitution of \nthe United States of America. If revolutions are contemplated, let us \nremember Lenin's words:\n  ``We shall destroy everything, and on its ruins we shall build our \ntemple.'' Does that sound like some of the talk that is making the \nrounds lately?\n  It might be well to remember Lenin's words in these days of talk \nabout revolution.\n  If revolutions are contemplated, let the public clearly understand \nwhat the final results may be before we so wound the Constitution and \nthe Republic that they may never recover.\n  We are only just now recovering from the fiscal hangover left the \nNation by the Reagan revolution. As I recall balanced budgets, tax \ncuts, budget cuts, and sacrosanct defense budgets were all prime \nfeatures of that last revolution and we are still paying the tab for \nthat one. Let us not overdose on a frenzy of dimly understood \nprocedural reform to the point where we take the insane step of writing \nfiscal policy into the U.S. Constitution.\n  We are on the road to balancing the budget, and it is an important \nand laudable goal to do so and we cannot let up. We have passed \nimportant and significant deficit reduction measures \n[[Page S1501]] in 1990 and in 1993, the latter without a single vote, \nas I say, from the Republican majority in either House. What does that \ntell the people about the reality of expecting to get votes on measures \nthat will be required to reduce the budget, measures that inflict pain?\n  What does that tell the people?\n  An informed and active citizenry is essential for the workings of a \nrepresentative democracy. It is up to the people to exercise their \nright to know by demanding explanations to the many unanswered \nquestions about this proposal, and it is my hope that they will be \nrelentless and ruthless in their pursuit of knowledge in this \nparticular case.\n  Mr. President, I call attention to a poll. Mr. President, the poll \nshows that 86 percent of the people think that the balanced budget \namendment's backers should be required to specify what cuts they would \nmake before the amendment is adopted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the poll released by the Los Angeles \nTimes on Monday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Los Angeles Times Poll, Jan. 23, 1995]\n\nSelected Results From the Times National Poll, Responses Are Among All \n                                 Adults\n\n       A full results summary with question wording and full \n     question text will be available through the Los Angeles Times \n     Poll at a later date.\n       Note: Not all numbers add to 100% because in some cases the \n     ``Don't know'' answer category is not displayed.\n\n\n                 ambivalence about republican proposals\n\n       Do you think the Republican ``Contract with America'' is a \n     realistic or unrealistic set of proposals?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           1/95    10/94\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRealistic set of proposals..............................      31      30\nUnrealistic set of proposals............................      54      55\nSome are realistic, some are unrealistic................       4       3\nDon't know..............................................      11      13\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       As you may know, Congress is considering a proposal for a \n     constitutional amendment to require that the federal budget \n     be balanced by the year 2002.

Do you favor or oppose \n     maintaining a ban on the future manufacture, sale and \n     possession of rapid-fire assault weapons?\n\n                                                                Percent\nFavor................................................................67\nOppose...............................................................16\n                       how the poll was conducted\n\n       The Times Poll interviewed 1,353 adults nationwide by \n     telephone, Jan. 19 through 22. Telephone numbers were chosen \n     from a list of all exchanges in the nation. Random-digit \n     dialing techniques were used so that listed and non-listed \n     numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in \n     English and Spanish. The sample was weighted slightly to \n     conform with census figures for sex, race, age and education. \n     The margin of sampling error for the total sample is plus or \n     minus 3 percentage points. Selected questions were asked of a \n     half sample of approximately 675; these carry a sampling \n     error margin of 4 points. For certain other sub-groups the \n     error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be \n     affected by other factors such as question wording and the \n     order in which questions are presented.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nresume consideration of amendment No. 173, and that the amendment that \nwas scheduled to be debated at 1:30 be set aside for 5 minutes so we \ncan \n[[Page S1503]] proceed to the consideration of amendment No. 173.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just want to make it clear we will not \nlose 5 minutes from our side because we have many Senators who wish to \ndebate my amendment. I have no objection if the unanimous consent \nrequest includes the fact that we will not lose 5 minutes from the 90 \nminutes that we have been promised on our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will observe to the Senator from \nCalifornia that under the previous rule that has been adopted the time \nwould not be deducted from her time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 173\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 173 corrects a problem in \nthis bill. The bill does not provide that individual Members can seek \nan estimate from the CBO that is so critical to the survival of their \namendments and bills. This is a different bill from last year. This \nbill creates a new point of order which was not in last year's bill. It \nbasically keeps the points of order that were in last year's bill, but \nit adds a new, critical point of order that makes a bill out of order \nif the estimate of the CBO is not in the bill, if there is not an \nauthorization estimated for what it will cost local governments. But \nthe new point of order has severe ramifications relative to the \nappropriations process.\n  Because there are such severe ramifications in this year's point of \norder, it is critical that individual Members have the power to seek an \nestimate from the Congressional Budget Office because if that estimate \nis not there--if certain other things are not there--there is going to \nbe a point of order against our amendments and our bills. And even \nthough it is a point of order and a procedural matter, that stands for \nsomething. Points of order mean things, they are not just little \nprocedural hurdles. They can make the difference whether or not an \namendment is considered or not considered, and whether or not a bill is \nconsidered or not considered.\n  On page 14 and on page 18 there are references to committees of \nauthorization obtaining the estimates from the CBO in two different \nprovisions. And there is also a provision on page 29 for the chairman \nor the ranking member of the minority of a committee of the Senate or \nthe House, to the extent practicable, to obtain a study of a Federal \nmandate. There is no provision in here for an individual Member to \nobtain that estimate from the CBO, which is so critical for that \nMember's amendment or bill to survive a point of order.\n  So the amendment which I have asked unanimous consent now be \nconsidered, amendment No. 173, would correct that problem with the \nbill. I hope this will be adopted by the Senate.\n  At this point, with the understanding of the managers, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order to seek a rollcall on this \namendment at this time, and that the rollcall occur prior to a \nrollcall, if ordered, on the Boxer amendment, which will come \nimmediately after this amendment.\n  I am not sure if the manager heard my unanimous consent--whether \neither manager heard that. I am seeking unanimous consent that it be in \norder to seek a rollcall on this amendment at this time, but that the \nrollcall be delayed until immediately preceding the rollcall on the \nBoxer amendment if one is ordered.\n  I will modify the unanimous-consent request so that it read \nimmediately after the vote on the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent-\nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to very strongly support the \namendment proposed by my colleague from Michigan. I do not think any \nSenator here wants to give up his or her rights to request the same \ninformation that anybody else has--whether a committee chairman or not. \nI think this is a key amendment here. I do not see this as any small \namendment.\n  To say that only chairmen of committees or only ranking minority \nmembers are the only ones who could ask CBO for a budget estimate gives \nup a right for a Senator to represent his or her State. And I do not \nthink that is right. I think this was more of an oversight in the bill. \nIt was not intended that Senators' rights be trampled on, but that \nwould be the effect of this. So I see this as a very, very important \namendment.\n  Every Senator representing his or her State has a full right to ask \nfor whatever information may be required to get an amendment through or \nto propose legislation. In this case, that means that Senator has to go \nto the Congressional Budget Office and get an estimate. Otherwise, when \nthey try to bring something up in committee and it is brought up and \nsomeone says what is the estimate on this, that Senator would not be \nable to have an estimate. So they would be precluded, in effect--they \nwould be precluded from putting in amendments that other Senators could \nput in, if the other Senators were committee chairmen or ranking \nminority Members.\n  I do not think there was any intention to take away the rights of \nindividual Senators. But lest there be any doubt about it I think we \nshould pass this amendment. I hope it will be unanimous, if we pass it. \nTo me it makes such common sense. So I rise in strong support of this \nand hope it could be accepted. If it cannot be accepted on the other \nside I hope the leadership on the other side could support this. We \nwill have an overwhelming vote of support for this particular amendment \nbecause this really does correct something that needs to be corrected, \nsomething we should have done in committee but we did not have that \nopportunity. So here we are on the floor doing it, and I think this is \na very important amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the amendment of the \nSenator from Michigan. I am supportive of that amendment. I will \nencourage my colleagues on this side of the aisle to support that \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-degree \namendment be in order to the Levin amendment prior to its disposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I want to thank the \nmanagers of the bill for their support of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 202\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of amendment No. 202 offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia. Pursuant to that order, there will be 2 hours of debate; 90 \nminutes of debate will be controlled by the Senator from California, \nand 30 minutes of debate will be controlled by the Senator from Idaho.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator from California yield for a \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 217, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment which has already been entered and is qualified, amendment \nNo. 217. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 217), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, beginning with line 22, strike out all through \n     line 2 on page 6 and insert in lieu thereof:\n       ``(I) a condition of Federal assistance;\n       ``(II) a duty arising from participation in a voluntary \n     Federal program, except as provided in subparagraph (B)); or\n       [[Page S1504]] ``(III) for purposes of section 408 \n     (c)(1)(B) and (d) only, a duty required under section 6 of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206); or\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 202\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to again thank \nthe managers of the bill for agreeing to a time limit which I believe \nwill be sufficient so that Senators who wish to be heard on my \namendment can come to the floor and be heard.\n  My amendment will ensure that this unfunded mandates bill will not \nthreaten the health of children, of pregnant women and of the frail \nelderly. If we stand for anything in this Chamber, I hope it would be \nto stand up and be proud to defend the health of our most vulnerable \npopulations.\n  I want the U.S. Senators to know that I support the thrust of this \nbill. I thought last year's bill did exactly what it should do. It was \nan important move forward. I myself, coming out of local government, \nhad experiences which I had detailed on this floor which basically said \nto me that local and State officials certainly have brains, certainly \nknow what their priorities are and certainly should not be treated in a \nway that is unfair to them or to their budgets.\n  Having said that, I think it is important that we not go too far in \nthis bill, that we have a bill that makes sense, that essentially says \nwe will not put unfunded mandates on the States but, in fact, we will \nlet them know the cost and, to the greatest extent possible, we will \nprovide the dollars.\n  Having said that, I think it is important to note that many of the \nthings we do around here are for the good of the people. I will bring \nthat out as I put forward my arguments.\n  I feel I must at this point speak to something the majority leader \nsaid, the distinguished majority leader, the Republican leader. He said \ntoday that Democrats were trying to block a bill they support. I \npersonally feel that is a very unfair statement. I am on one of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction, Mr. President. I am on the Budget \nCommittee. And my committee chairman, Senator Domenici, for whom I have \nthe highest regard, and the ranking member, Senator Exon, for whom I \nhave the highest regard, asked me if I would withhold most of my \namendments until I came to the floor. I agreed to do that, with the \nexception of a sunset provision which we debated very swiftly in \ncommittee, and on a party-line vote the Republicans voted not to sunset \nthis legislation. But I agreed to hold off.\n  What I came up with were four amendments that I thought were \nimportant. I had a call from my good friend, the majority whip. He \nsaid, ``Senator, can't you try to cut down your four amendments to two \namendments?'' I said, Look. I think all four of my amendments are \nimportant. They protect the children, the elderly, they deal with \nbenefits, and they deal with illegal immigration. But, I said, let me \nsee if I can do it. I am happy to say that I was able to cut back on \none of the amendments because Senator Wellstone had a similar \namendment, although really the amendment that he had, in my opinion, \ndoes not go as far as I wanted to in terms of weighing the benefits of \nsome of our laws. But I agreed in the spirit of bipartisanship to cut \nback.\n  Today, I have agreed to time limits on two of my amendments, and the \nthird one I think we can dispose of very, very quickly.\n  So I want to make the point to the majority leader, if he happens to \nbe listening, or to those who are perhaps monitoring the floor so that \nhe can know what is being said, that truly I know of no Democrat who is \ntrying to stall this bill. We want it to be a good bill. We want to be \nable to vote for this bill.\n  I also think it is important to note that my Republican friends have \nvoted lockstep against every single amendment the Democrats have \noffered. I have gone back through the record book to the last Congress \nand I could not come up with more than one or two occasions when that \nhas happened.\n  So we have our Republican friends voting lockstep against amendments \nthat could make this bill a better bill, in my opinion. The Senator \nfrom Idaho authored the bill in the last Congress. I supported that \nbill. But I very briefly want to tell you what this bill does because I \nhave gone through this once before on the floor. I will not take a lot \nof time going over this chart. But I think, if you just look at this \nchart, you can see the kind of hurdles that we are putting our \nlegislation through should this bill pass as it is without amendment.\n  In the initial bill, we asked for a Congressional Budget Office \nstatement on cost, and a point of order would lie against any bill that \ndid not detail that cost. That made sense. We are adults here in this \nChamber, and we should know what we are doing. And when we have the \nfacts to know what the numbers are we ought to determine if the \nbenefits are worth the cost. That makes sense.\n  If that bill had been before us, this chart would have ended, Mr. \nPresident, essentially right here. All of this would not have been \nadded. All of this green deals with the legislative process and the \npower of the Parliamentarian here in the Senate. No matter how fine and \nwonderful the Parliamentarians are--and, by the way, I think they are \nfine and wonderful--the people of California who I represent, 31 \nmillion of them, did not send me here to abdicate my responsibility to \nunelected Parliamentarians and to unelected bureaucrats at the CBO, \nfaceless, nameless people who, if they are politicized--and that has \nhappened in the past--one way or the other may come up with a number \nthat is questionable. And there is not much we can do about it. In any \nevent, we set up a huge hurdle. That does not even get into this chart, \nwhich is what our Federal agencies must do regarding this issue of \nunfunded mandates.\n  So the reason I have these charts here is to make my argument, Mr. \nPresident, that there are certain priorities that we will not want to \nsend through this incredible maze. By the way, this chart looks like it \nis describing a one-shot process. It is not. This process may be \nrepeated 10 times for one bill. Let me explain what I mean.\n  The bill starts here. It goes through all of this rigamarole through \nCBO, it goes through the committee, it passes to the Parliamentarian, \nall kinds of points of order may be heard, may be waived, and then it \ngoes to a vote. But guess what? If anyone offers an amendment, you \nstart all over again. Thank God for Carl Levin pointing out that not \none U.S. Senator had a right to find out what his or her amendment \nwould cost, to come to the floor with a CBO estimate and try to compete \nto get an amendment. Only the authorizing committees have that right \nunder the bill.\n  So this is a nightmare. I have to smile because I remember when my \nRepublican friends had charts like this on some of the Democratic \nproposals.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have to smile. This makes that look like a birthday \nparty, because if I was really being totally straightforward, I would \nhave 10 of these charts, because every time you have an amendment, you \nhave to start all over again. By the way, every time you have a \nconference report, you have to start all over again. And by the way, \nevery time the House takes up a bill, they have to start all over \nagain. So this does not even really reflect the bureaucratic maze we \nare putting legislation through. That is why the exceptions clause in \nthis bill is so very important. That is why I am so pleased that the \nbill, as it now stands, makes certain exceptions for national security, \nfor emergencies, for international agreements. But since we have set up \nthis maze, it seems to me that we better be darn sure that we are not \nstopping legislation that protects the health and the safety of our \nmost vulnerable populations, and that is what my amendment is about.\n  I am very proud to tell colleagues that we have today received a \nletter from Carol Browner, who heads the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency. I would like to read it into the Record.\n\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I applaud your efforts to ensure that \n     sensitive subpopulations such as the elderly, infants, and \n     pregnant women are protected in statutory and regulatory \n     decisionmaking.\n       A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that some \n     subpopulations may be disproportionately affected by some \n     contaminants. For example, it is well documented that high \n     levels of lead exposure contribute \n     [[Page S1505]] to learning disabilities in children. The \n     National Academy of Sciences has published two reports \n     confirming the need to consider differing effects in \n     subpopulations when performing risk assessment and in \n     regulatory decisionmaking.\n       Your amendment to S. 1 will ensure that Congress is free to \n     act to protect the health of our children, pregnant women and \n     the elderly and it has my full support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carol M. Browner.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Carol Browner comes out of State government. She is very \nsensitive to the need not to put burdensome regulations on our States. \nIn fact, she is very well supported by people in State government. But \nshe agrees that my amendment is necessary. Why? Because she knows that \nif in fact S. 1 passes as it is, without amendment, and we do not fix \nit up, bills that deal with the health and safety of the frail elderly, \nchildren under 5, and pregnant women, will go through this maze. I \nthink we owe it to our children and their children, and the children \nafter them, to stand up and be proud and vote for this amendment.\n  I want to tell you that we are in a time when we keep trying to \nsimplify issues. Somebody said, ``Oh, the President's speech was \nlong.'' It was long last night, but do you know what? There are a lot \nof issues that need discussion, intelligent discussion. The American \npeople are a lot smarter than 30-second sound bites and they deserve to \nhear more. Do you know what is happening in this country? They are \nhearing it. They are hearing it. Yes, there is a contract--a Republican \ncontract--that somebody said they are going to get through in 100 days. \nWell, I am going to tell you that where I agree with that contract, I \nwill walk hand-in-hand with my Republican friends. But if it hurts the \nchildren, if it hurts the frail elderly, if it hurts pregnant women, if \nit hurts the economy, if it hurts job creation, if it hurts deficit \nreduction, I am going to be on this floor and this is one of those \ntimes I personally, as one individual Member of the Senate in my 90 \nminutes that I have, and I will be joined by others, we are going to \nstand here and say ``no'', because this legislation sets up \nunbelievable hurdles to legislation.\n  This chart is just a hint of it because every amendment goes through \nit again and every conference report goes through it again. And it \nhappens in two legislative bodies. I think the least we can do is \nexempt from that, in addition to the other things that are exempted in \nthis bill, the most vulnerable people in our society.\n  Mr. President, there was a recent poll in the Wall Street Journal \nthat I would like to share, a national poll that asked: ``Which do you \nthink should have more responsibility for achieving the following goal, \nFederal or State government?'' Protecting the environment. Fifty \npercent of the people say it ought to be our responsibility; 38 percent \nsay the State. Protecting civil rights? Sixty-seven percent say Federal \nGovernment; 26 percent say the State. Strengthening the economy? Sixty-\nfour percent say the Federal Government; 24 percent say the State. When \nI ran for this office, I was very honest with the people in my State \nand I said, ``I am going to fight for you, and I am going to fight for \nwhat you believe is right and what is best for you and your children.'' \nThey trust me to do that. There are many other Senators who did the \nsame. So I am very proud to offer this amendment.\n  I would like to retain the remainder of my time. I know there is \nopposition on the other side of the aisle. I would like now to yield \nthe floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the bill manager, I yield \nmyself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is good legislation--trying to have a \nprocess to get some control on the incredible burden of Federal \nunfunded mandates. It has broad support at the local level --the \nmayors, county commissioners, Governors, and the private sector. All \nacross America people are saying this needs to be done and asking, \n``Will you not at least have a process to look at the burden that is \nbeing created by Federal unfunded mandates, the burdens you are passing \nto individuals and to county and city governments, the taxes you are \nputting on people?'' This is good legislation. It has had broad \nsupport, building over a period of months--in fact, years.\n  I understand there are 62 or more cosponsors of this legislation. \nRepublicans and Democrats have joined together in drafting this \nlegislation. We had the bill last year. The bill that got to the final \nhours of the session last year has been improved on. Changes have been \nmade that make it better. It has been brought to the floor with this \nbroad base of support across the country and in this Chamber.\n  Even the President, last night in his remarks, singled this out and \nsaid we may have some disagreements and maybe some improvements can be \nmade, but this is something that we can have and he supports it. Great. \nWe are going to find things we can work together on, such as \ncongressional accountability, line-item veto, unfunded mandates. We are \nmaking progress. The American people are going to be the beneficiaries. \nWe are working together. And then what happened?\n  A funny thing happened on the way to passage, on the way to the \nPresident's desk. Every amendment conceived by the minds of men has \nbeen pulled up and has been offered or is pending to be offered to this \nlegislation.\n  This is the ninth day on this noncontroversial, bipartisan bill. This \nis delay. This is not just finding ways to improve it. It has a \npurpose. Now, I am not real sure what the purpose is. I presume it is \nto try to delay the taking up of the constitutional amendment on the \nbalanced budget. That is the only thing I can figure. Maybe it is just \nto try to score points along the way.\n  When the President says, ``Let's work together,'' he gets applause on \nboth sides. But he needs to convey to his agents in the Congress that \nwe need a little help. We cannot make progress if we are going to have \nthese amendments that are unrelated, nongermane, that are not going to \nbe accepted. Let us get to the end of this process and pass this \nlegislation.\n  The ninth day already, and it looks to me like it is going to be all \nday today and into the night and all day tomorrow and into the night, \nperhaps Friday, Saturday. But I think we need to get used to it. The \nleader said we are going to vote this week. The only way we are going \nto get to a vote is if we begin to dispose of these amendments.\n  Now, what kind of amendments are we talking about here over the past \n9 days? We have had amendments on both sides of the aisle, I admit \nthat, that have dealt with history standards, abortion clinic violence, \none on Social Security, I understand one on pornography, now this one \non elderly and children.\n  And, again, as has been said on this floor, I am not diminishing the \nimportance of any of those, but on most of them I ask, why here? Why \nnow? They do not relate to this bill.\n  This is just making points, Mr. President. And I think it is damaging \nthe image of this institution, and it is certainly, at a very minimum, \ndelaying this bill.\n  Now, there are those who say, ``Wait a minute. I'm not talking about \ndamaging this bill. Even if it is unrelated or nongermane, or maybe if \nit is germane, I just want to try to improve it. Could we exempt this \nlittle thing? Could we add this or that to the little list of \nexemptions?''\n  Well, after a while, if you exempt this, you exempt that, what are \nyou going to have left? If it is going to in any way affect anybody or \nany group of individuals, then we want to exempt them.\n  And this bill has exemptions, carefully selected exemptions drafted \nby the committee, by the Members most intimately involved and \nknowledgeable in this legislation, that have already been worked out \nand put in the bill.\n  In fact, there are at least six categories of exemptions in the bill. \nIn addition to the ones that came to the floor originally in this bill, \na couple have been added--age, color. But we have the exemption if it \ninvolves enforcing the constitutional rights of individuals; we have an \nexemption if it establishes or enforces any statutory rights that \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, \nnational origin, or handicap or disability status--and now we have \nadded age and \n[[Page S1506]] color. We have an exemption of any provision in the \nFederal laws that requires compliance with accounting and auditing \nprocedures with respect to grants or other money or property provided \nby the U.S. Government; that provides for emergency assistance or \nrelief at the request of any State, local or tribal government or any \nofficial of a State, local or tribal government; that is necessary for \nthe national security or the ratification of or implementation of \ninternational treaty obligations; or the President designates as \nemergency legislation and the Congress so designates in statute.\n  This has been worked out. It has been carefully crafted in the \ncommittee. The exemptions that really need to be in the bill are in \nhere. We cannot keep adding to it and adding to it and adding to it. We \ncan all come up with some category that maybe we would like to say, \n``Oh, exempt that.'' I can certainly think of some I would like to have \nin my State of Mississippi.\n  But I think the committee has done a good job. I think the managers \nof the bill have done a good job. They have been willing to accept a \ncouple of additions, a couple of changes.\n  I think we have to stop that process where we keep adding to it. And \nremember this: This is a process. It has been said over and over again, \nbut I repeat it again. This is not saying that it must be this way or \nthat way. It sets up a process for Congress to be able to think about \nwhat we are doing with these mandates, to know what the impact is, so \nthat we can raise a point of order. What is the cost analysis? Who \nwould be affected? And it allows us to have a process or forces us to \nconsider what the impact is and deal with it. And if it unfairly deals \nwith the frail elderly, there will be a way to deal with that.\n  You know, when the American people realize that we pass all these \nbills and all these mandates and that we do not know what the costs \nare, we do not know what the impact is on individuals and cities and \ncounties and States, they are horrified. They cannot believe it.\n  But at least now we will have a process to analyze what the impact \nwould be, what the cost would be. We can make a decision that this is \nin the national interest and we are going to go forward with it. And \nthat decision could include providing the money or not providing the \nmoney if that decision is made by the Congress. But it forces us to \ndeal with this issue.\n  So you do not need to add every possible, conceivable exemption that \nyou can possibly dream up because they are not being cut out. We would \nstill have a process to review it and think about it.\n  It will help all of the people, including people of all races and \ncolors and age and children, if we pass this legislation. This \nlegislation will begin, hopefully, to get a grip on stopping some of \nthe burdens we have dumped off on individuals, on cities, that leads to \ntax increases, causes the loss of jobs.\n  What about the people that want a job that cannot get one because of \nFederal unfunded mandates? We are going to at least force ourselves to \nthink about those things.\n  There are a lot of groups and individuals that have written us in \nfavor of this legislation as it was drafted in the committee--business \ngroups, industrial groups, groups of private individuals, governmental \nassociations, the National Federation of Independent Businesses. I have \na long list of supporters.\n  Mr. President, if my time has expired, I yield myself 2 more minutes \nto wrap this up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi yields himself 2 \nmore minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. There are groups that are on record as supporting this.\n  But, also, to again clarify the depth of the support and that there \nis a lot of Democrat and Republican support for this, I have letters in \nmy hand here. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have these \nletters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, January 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to urge your support for \n     the Mandate Relief Legislation (S. 1) currently being debated \n     on the floor of the Senate and I encourage you to work with \n     your Democratic colleagues to oppose any weakening \n     amendments. I am pleased that the new Congress is acting \n     quickly, with bipartisan support, to move this legislation.\n       My support for effective mandates legislation goes back \n     several years. Along with countless other mayors, governors \n     and county officials, I have long tried to make clear to the \n     Congress and the Administration the adverse impacts unfunded \n     mandates have on our ability to conduct the people's business \n     and be accountable to our taxpayers. Chicago's 1992 study, \n     Putting Federalism to Work for America, one of the first \n     comprehensive studies of this issue, conservatively estimated \n     that mandates cost the City of Chicago over $160 million per \n     year--a figure that has only increased since then.\n       The legislation being considered in Congress will begin to \n     address this problem by setting up a strong process to \n     discourage the enactment of new mandates, and to require that \n     new mandates be funded if they are to be enforced. I \n     recognize that it does not cover existing mandates, an issue \n     which I believe Congress also needs to address.\n       Fundamentally, this issue is all about giving local \n     governments the flexibility to make the best use of local and \n     federal dollars. The importance given the mandates issue \n     gives me hope that the new Congress--Democrats and \n     Republicans alike--will be paying close attention to the real \n     issues that face our communities and our citizens. Please \n     work to expeditiously enact a strong, effective version of S. \n     1.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard M. Daley,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the elected officials \n     of the nation's cities and towns, I thank you for sponsoring \n     the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act and for working against \n     amendments that threaten the effectiveness and bipartisan \n     spirit of this legislation. Local governments and the \n     taxpayers we serve have borne the federal government's fiscal \n     burden for a long time. We will not have such an important \n     relief opportunity again if this measure is thwarted in the \n     final hour by special interests or partisan politics.\n       We urge you to oppose amendments that would provide blanket \n     exemptions of certain types of mandates from the points-of-\n     order contained in S. 1. We believe that exemptions for labor \n     mandates and/or environmental mandates (sometimes termed as \n     legislation relating to ``protecting public health and \n     safety'') would undercut the fundamental purposes of S. 1, as \n     well as reduce the capacity and flexibility of the nation's \n     cities to focus our resources to protect public safety. \n     Historically the most onerous unfunded mandates to local \n     governments have fallen into the two categories of \n     environment and labor.\n       We also strongly oppose amendments that would exempt \n     mandates related to services which both the public and \n     private sectors provide. The argument that S. 1, as it is \n     currently written, gives the public sector a ``competitive \n     advantage'' over competing private sector entities is an \n     unfounded fear, as the private sector entities and the U.S. \n     Chamber of commerce, who support S. 1, would likely confirm. \n     Furthermore, we would note that the ``Motor-Voter'' bill is \n     one of the very few bills we are aware of which imposes \n     mandates upon the public but not the private sector. \n     Therefore, we are apprehensive that any so-called \n     ``competitive advantage'' amendment would largely eviscerate \n     your NLC-supported legislation.\n       Our strongest objection to such ``competitive \n     disadvantage'' amendments is that they contradict the purpose \n     of S. 1--to provide relief to state and local governments \n     from unfunded mandates. The legislation and its sponsors \n     recognize that the public sector is distinctly different from \n     the private sector, both in the services each provide and how \n     they are affected by unfunded mandates. Local governments \n     have the responsibility to provide services such as clean \n     water, drinking water, public safety and garbage disposal. In \n     contrast, providing these same services are an option for the \n     private sector--which can provide such services, for a \n     profit, to those who can afford to pay. Local governments \n     act, not as a matter of choice or motivated by profits, but \n     as a duty to all citizens. In the case of private entities, \n     the motivation is to gain a profit.\n       It is one issue to set certain standards so that any \n     private corporation can understand the rules before it \n     chooses to ply a trade. It is a different issue when the \n     federal government requires a local government to provide a \n     service in a one-size-fits-all manner to every citizen. This \n     distinct difference between the two sectors means that the \n     federal government must be sensitive to mandates it imposes \n     on state and local governments.\n       Thank you for your continued efforts to maintain the \n     integrity and bipartisan spirit of S. 1.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Carolyn Long Banks,\n\n                                 President, Councilwoman-at-Large,\n                                                      Atlanta, GA.\n\n                                               [[Page S1507]]\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of The United States \n     Conference of Mayors, I want to thank you for your continued \n     leadership in our fight against unfunded federal mandates and \n     to express strong support for the new bill, S. 1.\n       S. 1 is serious and tough mandate reform which will do more \n     than simply stop the flood of trickle-down taxes and \n     irresponsible, ill-defined federal mandates which have come \n     from Washington over the past two decades. S. 1 will begin to \n     restore the partnership which the founders of this nation \n     intended to exist between the federal government, and state \n     and local governments.\n       S. 1 which was developed in bipartisan cooperation with the \n     state and local organizations, including the Conference of \n     Mayors, is even stronger than what was before the Senate last \n     year in that it requires Congress to either fund a mandate at \n     the time of passage or provide that the mandate cannot be \n     enforced by the federal government if not fully funded. \n     However, the bill is still based upon the carefully crafted \n     package which was agreed to in S. 993 and which garnered 67 \n     Senate cosponsors in the 103rd Congress. The ill would not in \n     any way repeal, weaken or affect any existing statute, be it \n     an existing unfunded mandate or not. This legislation only \n     seeks to address new unfunded mandate legislation. In \n     addition, S. 1 would not infringe upon or limit the ability \n     of the Congress or the federal judicial system to enforce any \n     new or existing constitutional protection or civil rights \n     statute.\n       The mayors are extremely pleased that our legislation, \n     which was blocked from final passage in the 103rd Congress, \n     has been designated as S. 1 by incoming Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole. We also understand and appreciate the significance of \n     the Governmental Affairs and Budget Committees holding a \n     joint hearing on our bill on the second day of the 104th \n     Congress at which our organization will be represented.\n       I remember the early days in our campaign when many \n     questioned our resolve. How could a freshman Republican \n     Senator from the State of Idaho move the Washington \n     establishment to reform its beloved practice of imposing \n     federal mandates without funding? We responded to these \n     doubters by focusing the national grass-roots resentment of \n     unfunded mandates into a well orchestrated political machine, \n     and by joining with our state and local partners in taking \n     our message to Washington.\n       The United States Conference of Mayors will continue in its \n     efforts to enact S. 1 until we are successful. We will not \n     let up on the political and public pressure. And we will \n     actively oppose efforts to weaken our bill.\n       The time to pass our bill is now. Those who would seek to \n     delay action will be held accountable, and those who stand \n     with state and local government will know that they have our \n     support and appreciation.\n       Thank you again for all of your hard work and commitment, \n     and rest assured that we will continue to stand with you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                                  Victor Ashe,\n\n                                               Mayor of Knoxville,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures enthusiastically supports S. 1, the Unfunded \n     Mandate Reform Act of 1995. We join you in urging your \n     colleagues to cosponsor this bill and approve this \n     legislation in Committee and on the floor of the Senate. The \n     National Conference of State Legislatures commends your \n     efforts, along with those of Senator Bill Roth, incoming \n     Chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, and \n     Senator John Glenn, the outgoing Chairman of the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee, in forging the bipartisan \n     mandate relief bill that is to be presented to the Senate \n     next week as S. 1. We deeply appreciate your leadership in \n     developing legislation that takes significant steps toward \n     correcting the problem of unfunded federal mandates and for \n     your openness to listen to our concerns during the \n     negotiation process.\n       Your bill is a fitting first step in restoring the balance \n     to our federal system by recognizing that the partnership \n     with state and local governments has been significantly \n     weakened by the growing federal practice of imposing unfunded \n     mandates. No government has the luxury of unlimited \n     resources, and the taxpayers of this country, our shared \n     constituents, recognize that having the federal government \n     pass its obligations down to the state and local governments \n     does nothing to reduce their overall tax burden.\n       This bill is about information and accountability. The cost \n     estimate, points of order, rules changes and other provisions \n     contained in this legislation are absolutely necessary to get \n     us back on track and have the federal government take \n     responsibility for its actions. To make responsible \n     decisions, members of Congress need to be fully aware of the \n     financial burdens that federal legislation often places on \n     state and local governments, and to understand the \n     implications of those burdens.\n       As has been said often over the past year, the level of \n     cooperation among state and local governments and members of \n     the United States Senate during the negotiation process is \n     unprecedented. Again, we appreciate your efforts, and those \n     of the other Senators who helped forge this compromise, and \n     wholeheartedly support passage of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate \n     Reform Act of 1995.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Jane L. Campbell,\n\n                                  President, NCSL, Assistant House\n     Minority Leader, Ohio.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: I am writing on behalf of the \n     elected officials of the nation's cities and towns to commend \n     you for sponsoring the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. \n     Of all the measures introduced to date, this legislation is \n     undoubtedly the strongest, best crafted, and most \n     comprehensive approach to provide relief for state and local \n     governments from the burden of unfunded federal mandates.\n       The National League of Cities commits its strongest support \n     for the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. We will fight any \n     attempts to weaken the bill with the full force of the \n     150,000 local elected officials we represent. Local \n     governments and the taxpayers we serve have borne the federal \n     government's fiscal burden for too long. We will not have \n     such an important relief measure thwarted in the final hour \n     by special interests.\n       We commend you for continuing to foster the bipartisan \n     support which your original mandate relief bill so \n     successfully garnered in the last Congress. We will work hard \n     to gain bipartisan support for mandates relief in the 104th \n     Congress, because, as you are well aware, this bill will \n     benefit all states, all counties, all municipalities, and all \n     taxpayers, regardless of their political allegiance.\n       Again, please accept our sincere gratitude for your \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Carolyn Long Banks,\n\n                                       President, Councilwoman-at-\n     Large, Atlanta, GA.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           National School Boards Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, December 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: The National School Boards \n     Association (NSBA), on behalf of the more than 95,000 locally \n     elected school board members nationwide, would like to offer \n     its strong support for the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995'' (S. 1). This legislation would establish a general \n     rule that Congress shall not impose federal mandates without \n     adequate funding. This legislation would stop the flow of \n     requirements on school districts which must spend billions of \n     local tax dollars every year to comply with unfunded federal \n     mandates. We commend you and your unending leadership on this \n     critical issue.\n       Today, school children throughout the country are facing \n     the prospect of reduced classroom instruction because the \n     federal government requires, but does not fund, services or \n     programs that local school boards are directed to implement. \n     School boards are not opposed to the goals of many of these \n     mandates, but we believe that Congress should be responsible \n     for funding the programs it imposes on school districts. Our \n     nation's public school children must not be made to pay the \n     price for unfunded federal mandates.\n       S. 1 would prohibit a law from being implemented without \n     necessary federal government funding. S. 1 would allow school \n     districts to execute the future programs which are required \n     by the federal government without placing an unfair financial \n     burden on the schools.\n       Again, we applaud your leadership in negotiating and \n     sponsoring this bill which would allow schools to provide a \n     quality education to their students. We offer any assistance \n     you need as you quickly move this bill to the Senate floor.\n       If you have questions regarding this issue, please contact \n     Laurie A. Westley, Chief Legislative Counsel at (703) 838-\n     6703.\n           Yours very truly,\n     Boyd W. Boehlje,\n       President.\n     Thomas A. Shannon,\n       Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 29, 1994.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Counties, I am writing to express our strong \n     support for S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. We \n     sincerely appreciate the leadership you have provided in \n     crafting this new, strong bipartisan bill to relieve state \n     and local governments from the growing burdens of unfunded \n     federal mandates. Our NACo staff has \n     [[Page S1508]] reviewed the latest draft and they are \n     convinced it is much stronger than S. 993, the bill approved \n     in committee last summer.\n       While this legislation retained many of the basic \n     principles from the previous bill, there were many \n     improvements. Most significant among them is the provision \n     that requires any new mandate to be funded by new entitlement \n     spending or new taxes or new appropriations. If not, the \n     mandate will not take effect unless the majority of members \n     in both houses vote to impose the cost on state and local \n     governments. Although the new bill will not prevent Congress \n     from imposing the cost of new mandates on state and local \n     taxpayers by holding members accountable we believe it will \n     discourage and curtail the number of mandates imposed on \n     them.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this important \n     legislation. County officials across our great nation stand \n     ready to assist you in anyway we can to ensure the swift \n     passage to S. 1. If you have any questions, please contact \n     Larry Naake or Larry Jones of the NACo staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Randall Franke,\n\n                                  Commissioner, Marion County, OR,\n                                                   NACo President.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I have a letter from Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago; \nanother one from the National League of Cities. They support the \nlegislation. But there are some key words in here. They support the \nlegislation without weakening amendments. And that is what this is. It \nis a weakening amendment.\n  I will just read the first sentence in the letter from Mayor Daley.\n\n       I am writing to urge your support for the Mandate Relief \n     Legislation (S. 1) currently being debated on the floor of \n     the Senate and I encourage you to work with your Democratic \n     colleagues to oppose any weakening amendments.\n\n  That letter was to the minority leader, Tom Daschle.\n  In a letter to the manager of the bill, the Senator from Idaho, \nSenator Kempthorne, from Carolyn Long Banks, president, and \ncouncilwoman-at-large, Atlanta, GA, on behalf of the National League of \nCities, the first sentence of the second paragraph:\n\n       We urge you to oppose amendments that would provide blanket \n     exemptions of certain types of mandates from the points-of-\n     order contained in S. 1.\n\n  Right on point with this amendment--``oppose amendments that would \nprovide blanket exemptions of certain types of mandates.''\n  And this is from a city officeholder in Atlanta on behalf of the \nNational League of Cities, not your basic, you know, Republican \norganization. Mr. President, I really think that we should defeat this \namendment, all other similar amendments. Let Senators bring this thing \nto closure. Let Senators pass this bill tomorrow night and celebrate, \nhaving done the right thing for all Americans with this unfunded \nmandates legislation.\n  I reserve the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 74 minutes and \n30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will speak for about 1 minute \nin response to the Senator from Mississippi, and I plan to yield 10 to \n20 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, whatever time he might wish \nto consume.\n  Mr. President, I want to say to my friend from Mississippi, and he is \nmy friend, that I am rather distressed at his comments. But I am not \nsurprised. It is the intent of the Republicans to make it look as if \nthe amendments we are offering are so-called frivolous amendments. They \nare not important amendments. They are only meant to slow things up.\n  I understand he has a Contract With America that he likes. Hey, I \nlike some of the things in the contract. I will help him when I agree \nwith him. But I will not be railroaded so that he can make his 100-day \ndeadline, when the people of California sent me here to protect the \nchildren, protect the frail elderly, to make sure that I stand up and \nfight for my State to get reimbursement for illegal immigration, the \nbiggest unfunded mandate of them all that is not even addressed in this \nbill.\n  I liked the bill as it came out last year. As a matter of fact, it \ndid exactly what the Senator from Mississippi, the distinguished whip, \nsays this bill does. Today he said, ``We want a process to look at the \nburden we are putting on the other levels of government.'' I agree. \nThat is exactly what the bill did last year. It stopped right there. \nCBO came in with the estimate. If we did not have an estimate there was \na point of order against the bill. This whole green area here was added \nthis year. It is a bureaucratic nightmare.\n  I believe we should think very carefully before we pass a law that \nwill impact local and State government. I served on local government. I \ncome out of local government. I had some mandates that were ludicrous \nthat came down from the Reagan administration. Ludicrous. But I do not \nwant to go too far because we can take a good bill with a good concept, \nwhich is what this bill is, and we can destroy it if the real agenda is \nto stop this U.S. Senate from acting in behalf of the people.\n  I am very clear in my mind that the people sent Senators here to do \nsomething. They did not send us here to walk away from our \nresponsibility. Now, every day I hear of letters from mayors of cities, \nsmall cities and big cities, and members of boards of supervisors, and \nthat is great. But I do not represent mayors and Governors and city \ncouncils and boards of supervisors. I like them a lot. I have a \nresponsibility to the people that elected me. There were, as I \nremember, 6 million of them. And the others who voted for my opponent, \nthey want me to work, too.\n  I find it interesting, because the majority leader last week said, \n``What is wrong with the Democrats? You do not want to work. We are \nready to work.'' First he says we do not want to work in January; then \nhe criticizes us for having 100 amendments. It is work to put together \nan amendment that we believe in and fight for it as I am doing and \nothers are doing. It is not fun and games, especially since the \nRepublicans are voting lockstep against us on every single amendment.\n  I urge the American people to look at that. On the Congressional \nAccountability Act, they even voted in lockstep--lockstep--to allow \nlobbyists to continue to take them out to dinner and pay for their \nweekends. They voted in lockstep against the Lautenberg amendment that \nsaid if there is an across-the-board cut, we should take a cut in pay. \nThey voted against that. They are voting in lockstep. There is a \ncontract, and I am not here to help them get a contract through which, \nin part, I think will hurt Americans.\n  I think this bill is a good one, but we have to make it better. I am \nvery glad to see that the managers of the bill support Senator Levin's \namendment, which will allow an individual Senator to get an idea of \nwhat his or her amendment will cost so that they can participate in \nwhat is now becoming a nightmarish scenario of how to get a bill into \nlaw.\n  When I was a kid I read how a bill becomes a law. It was complicated \nenough then. Wait until the kids have to learn about this. They will \nwonder what are we up to. So, I could say to the mayors who are \nlistening and the city councils, I do not intend to vote on anything \nthat will lay an unfair burden on you. But I say to the mayor of \nMilwaukee, and I don't know if anyone has heard from him, but when \ncryptosporidium killed 100 people in his city and caused 400,000 \nserious illnesses because a parasite got into the water, he would have \nbeen glad if we had passed a law here that told them they had to get \nrid of cryptosporidium which killed his constituents.\n  So, I will yield time to the Senator. I will reserve my time to \ncontinue to debate this very important amendment. I am proud that the \nEPA, the person in charge of the environment in this great Nation has \nsent a letter to every Senator, asking for this amendment. I am very \nproud that the Senator from Connecticut is here now. He will talk not \nonly about this amendment on protecting the frail elderly, children \nunder 5, and pregnant women from this bureaucratic maze, but also on my \namendment on child pornography that he supports. I yield to him at this \ntime, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me thank my colleague from \nCalifornia. I may not need all 10 minutes, and I will reserve the \nbalance of time if I do not use it.\n  Let me first of all commend the Senator from California for offering \nthe amendment that is before the Senate, and, as I understand it, a \nsecond amendment which she will offer later this afternoon involving \nvulnerable constituencies.\n   [[Page S1509]] The first amendment, the one which is before the \nSenate now, would provide protection for the health of children under \n5, pregnant women, or the frail elderly. They would not be subjected to \nthe procedural hurdles imposed by S. 1. The second amendment, which the \ndistinguished Senator from California will be offering, would exempt \nlaws that protect our children from pornography, sexual assault, and \nexploitive labor practices. And I think both are very sound and \nresponsible amendments.\n  Let me just echo the comments of my colleague from California. First \nof all, I am a supporter of this bill, the unfunded mandates bill. I \nwas a supporter of the bill that we could have passed last September, \nhad it not been stopped through the gridlock and filibusters that took \nplace here.\n  I do not know if there is much debate, there may be some who are \nopposed to the idea of amending the present situation which allows \nunfunded mandates to foist incredible burdens on our State and local \ngovernments. As the Presiding Officer knows, and others, a year ago I \noffered an amendment on this floor with the support, I might point out, \nof my distinguished colleague from Mississippi, on the Budget Committee \nand again on the floor.\n  We tried to do something about the cause of special education, which \ntoday the Federal Government contributes about 7 percent of the cost of \neducating a child with special needs, despite we made a commitment some \n20 years ago that we would make up to 30 or 40 percent of the cost. I \ntried a year ago to get this body to support an amendment that would \nhave raised our commitment to the costs of special education to 30 \npercent. That failed at the time. But that was again an unfunded \nmandate, in a sense, by saying special needs children must be educated. \nWe said that should be the case, and yet we are not willing to back up \nthat mandate with the kind of resources to support the States deferring \nthose costs. That is one example.\n  Here we are talking about a generic law dealing with a lot of issues. \nI do not take a back seat to anybody in my support for the concept of \ntrying to be more of a partner in meeting the desirable goals of our \nNation. That, I do not think, is in debate. The question is, are there \ncertain areas that we ought to exempt from those procedures?\n  Now, when we are sitting here debating a situation where there are \nabsolutely no exemptions. We were taking the position, or there was a \nposition of the majority here, that there should be no exemptions. \nDiscrimination laws, national security issues, we are going to subject \nevery mandate to the same standard and test. Then I think the argument \nthat we should not be accepting or supporting the Boxer amendment would \nhave value because we are applying the same standard to every single \nconstituency and every single issue that comes before this body where a \nmandate is involved.\n  Mr. President, that is not the case. We have already decided to \nexempt some areas. And I agree with them, by the way. I am not \ndisagreeing with the exemptions that have been made. We said, for \ninstance, on the basis of sex or race or national origin, that you \ncannot require a procedural process dealing with the funding or the \nmandates in those areas.\n  We have already taken categories of people based on their gender, \ntheir national origin, and their race, and we have said, ``If there is \na mandate here to the States that involves those issues, then you are \nexempt from the procedures.'' I think that is wise. I think that is \nright.\n  We have also done that in the area of national security and \ninternational agreements, again I think for good cause. We said, \n``Look, this is a very sound idea. Unfunded mandates, we ought to be \nfunding them, helping our States or not requiring them. But there are \nareas in which we think that these procedures should not apply for \ncertain constituencies. Certain people, certain circumstances ought to \nbe exempt from that process.''\n  What the Senator from California has said is we agree. We also think \nthere are some other people here, in addition to the ones mentioned, \nthat we think also fall into that category, and circumstances that fall \ninto that category. Not every State has laws which prohibit the mailing \nor communication of pornography. I know which States they are. I will \nnot bother listing them here today, but there are States that have no \nlaws in this area whatsoever.\n  So if we do not fund these things, it is conceivable through the \ncomputer practices today--and all of us have read the stories about \nInternet, and so forth, how you can cross State lines very quickly. The \ndays of just only affecting your neighborhood in these areas is long \nsince behind us. In fact, there are some horrid stories involving the \nuse of computers, on-line computers, Internet, and what happens to \nyoung children who get caught up in this.\n  What the Senator from California is saying, when it comes to \npornography and to child abuse and neglect, is that we ought to also \ncarve out an exception, as we have carved it out for the others. Now \nthat we are no longer being pure on the issue, we are carving out \nexemptions, this is one we think also ought to be carved out.\n  In addition to the question of children under 5 and frail elderly, I \ndo not think any of us want to be in the position of having some huge \nprocedural hurdles put in front of us despite our commitment to dealing \nwith the unfunded mandates issue. This idea that we have to be so pure \nwhen it comes to the process, the process becomes more important, far \nmore important than the constituencies we are trying to serve.\n  I think we have to get some balance here. Try to have an intelligent, \nthoughtful process, but let us not lose sight of what happens. The \nprocess becomes, in a sense, the Holy Grail, rather than the people who \nare supposed to be served by the process. I think we lose sight of \nthat. It is possible to have a sense of equilibrium here, where you \nmove forward in the process, you try to make it work better, far more \nefficiently, far more effectively. But when you turn to certain \nconstituencies, as we have done in this bill--we have said on the basis \nof race, gender, or national origin, you are different; we are not \ngoing to apply the process to you because we honestly believe we should \nnot be turning the clock back in certain of these areas.\n  What the Senator from California is saying, when it comes to the \nfrail elderly and children under 5, and pregnant women, that we ought \nto, as well, say ``Look, this is not a matter, folks, that we can argue \nabout how much we want to do,'' and so forth, but in these areas, it \nwould be a major setback to become so distracted, so embracing of the \nprocess, that we are willing to walk away from constituencies in these \nparticular cases.\n  I would certainly not stand up here and support constituency group \nafter constituency group after constituency group that seek to avoid \nthe process. This has been carefully crafted by the Senator from \nCalifornia--carefully crafted. She talks about a series of \nconstituencies and circumstances in which some of those vulnerable \ncitizens in our society could be affected.\n  Protecting children from pornography, that is a very important issue. \nThis body has debated and discussed this issue over the years, and we \nhave taken strong positions on the issue. I do not know of anyone here \nwho wants to be on the side of coming out and saying, ``I'm sorry, but \nthe process of unfunded mandates is more important than what happens to \na child through the use of pornography through the mails and \ncomputers.''\n  We have to make a choice here: Is the process more important than the \nissue? I suspect if the American public had an opportunity to vote on \nthat issue, they would say, ``Do not make the mistake of becoming so \nwedded to your process around here that you have neglected or failed to \ndeal properly and forcefully with the issue of child pornography.''\n  The same could be said with sexual assault and exploitative labor \npractices included in this piece of legislation. Children under 5, \npregnant women, frail elderly--those are the constituents. If we cannot \nfind a way to have an intelligent bill on unfunded mandates--and I am \nconfident we will--as well as intelligently carving out certain areas \nof constituencies that need our national protection, then I think we \nhave lost sight of what our role is here to be a body that does try to \nbe far more efficient and effective, make Government smaller, make it \nwork \n[[Page S1510]] better. All of us, I think, are wedded and determined to \ndo that and also, as I said a moment ago, to maintain that sense of \nequilibrium, which is critically important, in my view.\n  Mr. President, I will just mention here, because someone may say, \n``How bad is this problem in certain areas,'' let me just point out--I \nknow the Presiding Officer knows these numbers, as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, on which I have the pleasure of \nserving with him--but reports of child abuse and neglect have risen 40 \npercent between 1985 and 1991. Too many cases of child neglect and \nabuse are reported annually now. One in three victims of physical abuse \nis a baby less than 1 year of age, and almost 90 percent of the \nchildren who died of abuse and neglect in 1990 were under the age of 5.\n  Unfortunately, these numbers seem to be getting worse. I do not know \nif anybody has simple answers to it, but I think as we try to deal with \nthese questions, we ought to try to get to the heart of it as quickly \nas we can and not set up, as I say, an arbitrary set of hurdles here in \nour desire to intelligently do something about a process that needs \nreforming.\n  So, again, I emphasize, Mr. President, the fact that we have already \ncarved out constituencies because we feel and have felt that they were \nimportant and essential and should not be subject to the whim of a \nsimple majority here, a 51-49 vote that could roll back our support in \nthese areas.\n  I suggest in the areas the Senator from California has outlined, we \nshould do likewise. This will not do great violence to the underlying \nbill on unfunded mandates. Quite the contrary. I think it says that \nthis is a body that has dealt with an issue that needed dealing with \nand dealt with it effectively, and had a sense of balance and \nequilibrium about the constituencies out there that deserve to be \nsingled out because of their vulnerabilities. I think we ought to be \nable to do both.\n  If we do, I think we strengthen the legislation and build a stronger \nbase of support, because we have shown a heightened degree of \nsensitivity about these people, these children, particularly, because \nmost of the categories we are talking about are the youngest children, \nthe ones who have little or no protection at all but look to us and \nlook to others to make sure that at least there are laws on the books \nwhich allow those who are responsible for enforcing them to have some \ntools in their hands and not watch some endless debate down here that \ngets caught up in filibusters as to whether or not we are willing to \ncome up with the money in these areas and watch the issue die.\n  I urge the adoption of these amendments. I hope we will get away from \nthis notion that any suggestion--any suggestion--to try to improve this \nbill is rejected because of some drag-race mentality. We are not \ninvolved in the business of a goldfish-swallowing contest around here, \nto see how many we can put down our throats in what period of time. \nThis is the Senate of the United States in the business of trying to \nlegislate. I think these are good ideas.\n  Under normal circumstances, were we not sitting around here trying to \nmeet some date that has been set out in front of us, I think these \namendments would be debated, modified a bit, and I think they would be \naccepted. In the normal course of amending a bill, these amendments \nwould be accepted.\n  But because there might be a conference with the House working out \nsome of the differences, it might delay the calendar on adopting this \nlegislation, no one can support it on the other side. I think that is a \nhuge mistake. I do not think we are being well served by that \nmentality.\n  As I say, this is not a drag race to see who can beat the clock. We \nare dealing with a very important bill, a good bill--I will say, a good \nbill, a good bill--that will change the process in this country and \nprovide assistance to States and localities. It is a good bill. I think \nit can be made a better bill, and that is our business through the \namendment process.\n  Let us get rid of this calendar/clock idea. Let us get our business \ndone quickly, but let us also engage in the kind of discourse that the \nSenate requires when good ideas are raised; Members can support or \nobject. But to go through a process, no matter how good your idea is, \nno matter how many people may agree with you, we say, ``Sorry, we \ncannot accept it because, you see, it is far more important we have a \nclean bill without a conference to get it done than it is what we write \nand what we ask the American people to support.''\n  So, again, I commend the Senator from California. These are good \namendments. I think I can predict what is going to happen. They are \ngoing to be defeated mindlessly because it does not fit the drag race \nto get the bill done.\n  My view and hope would be that some might begin to at least say look, \nI think these are pretty good ideas. I think the House might accept \nthem.\n  Let us not get bogged down in rejecting every idea that comes along \nhere merely because it is going to upset the 100-day calendar, whatever \nelse it is we are dealing with.\n  That is not what the American people are interested in. They could \ncare less about the politics of what kind of timeframe you are going to \nbuild on. They want us to do a good job here--not a fast job, a slow \njob but a good job. I think we have a wonderful opportunity to do a \ngood job. It can be a better job with the adoption of these amendments.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut yields back his \nremaining time.\n  The Chair advises the Senator from California the time under her \ncontrol is 53 minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Is there a desire on the other side to take some time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I inquire of the time remaining on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Mississippi \nthere are 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Since there are 50 minutes on the other side and only 17 on \nthis side, I will reserve the remainder of our time at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Connecticut leaves \nthe floor, I want to thank him for taking time to speak. It is very \ndifficult for Senators to come and talk on another Senator's amendment. \nThat is why I am so pleased I have a number who will be doing that.\n  I could not be more pleased than to have the Senator who has really \nstood for protecting the children of this country to be here on these \namendments. I think it is clear that he has been the leader in this \nregard. I think he makes the points very clearly. We are setting up \nhurdles in this bill, many more hurdles than in last year's bill. Some \nof us may still decide it is a bill worth voting for, but we do have a \nchance to make it easier.\n  I say to my friend, under last year's bill, the hurdles stopped about \nat this point, because at that time we just said CBO had to let us know \nhow much our amendments or bills would cost State and local \ngovernments. And then we would make intelligent decisions because \nhopefully we have the ability to do that.\n  What has happened in this year's bill, S. 1, which some say goes too \nfar, is that we added all this part here which deals with giving power \nto the Parliamentarian to decide whether or not the amendment or bill \nas it comes to us is fully funded, and there are points of order and \nall kinds of confusion.\n  I might say to my friend, after we even get a bill down here to the \nfloor, every amendment has to start all over again with this procedure. \nThat is why the exceptions clause is so critical to us. It is not as \nimportant as it was under last year's bill, but because of these \nhurdles, we have to be careful that we do not tie our hands behind our \nback, blindfold ourselves, and put earplugs in so we can really do \nnothing.\n  I am very fearful, if we do not get these amendments through, then \nthe children of our country, who do not put on pinstriped suits or come \nup here and treat Senators to dinners and breakfasts, will not be \nheard.\n   [[Page S1511]] So I thank the Senator for adding his important voice \nto this amendment. I repeat that Carol Browner of the EPA supports us \non this, of which I am very, very proud.\n  At this time, I would like to yield 7 minutes to my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, to me, the operative language in the amendment says \nthat any bill which ``provides for protection of the health of children \nunder 5, pregnant women, or frail elderly would not be subject to S. \n1's point of order and other requirements.''\n  I had a meeting back in Minnesota before the beginning of this \nsession. It was really a very powerful meeting. It was with a large \nnumber of people from the disabilities community in Minnesota--Justin \nDark came out--and people were really both terrified and I think \nindignant about what this unfunded mandates bill would mean to them.\n  I think it was very, very important it be made clear that there would \nbe an exemption as it applied to the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  I really view this amendment in the same framework, and I would say \nto my colleague from California and the Senator from Washington, with \nwhom I have worked closely as well, that actually, as I have had \ndiscussions with people in my office about this piece of legislation, \nsome have been surprised at really what is, by and large, with my \nstrong support, the premise of this bill, but my view is that we should \nbe accountable.\n  I think that when we vote legislation and we are requiring State or \nlocal governments to follow through and implement certain policy and \nthere is an expense, and we might decide that we cover the expense or \nwe might decide that it is appropriate for State or county or city \ngovernment to also be providing some of the funding, we should go on \nrecord.\n  In many ways, that is what we do now. Someone can challenge a \nparticular through an amendment and call for 51 votes right now. I like \nthe idea of our being accountable, and in that sense I think the \npremise of this piece of legislation is extremely important. I have \nsaid that to Senator Kempthorne. But I also worry about what Senator \nBoxer has so ably pointed out on the chart.\n  What I worry about is that we get into a kind of morass where there \nis the complexity and the multiple veto points which end up leading to \na process where we literally cannot move forward with important \nlegislation where there are needs that cry out to us. I would say that \nthose needs cry out from children and from frail elderly and from women \nexpecting children.\n  I know one of the most poignant gatherings I have been involved with \nhere in Washington was when a group of citizens, to make a connection \nto the environment, came from around the country. They were mainly poor \nand they came to talk about environmental justice. Their point was that \nall too often the environmental degradation has a disparate impact on \ntheir communities. And they are right.\n  So when it comes to situations where women really cannot eat fish out \nof lakes or rivers close to where they live, nor can their small \nchildren, or when you go into a classroom--this happened to me in \nMinneapolis--and meet with students--I think there is no alternative to \nmeeting with elementary school kids; it is wonderful how eager they \nare. It is sort of like the world all of a sudden of magic is before \nyou. But to leave this meeting and then have a teacher say to you \nafterwards: You know, Senator, these kids are wonderful, but I really \nworry about the lead they have in their bloodstream--environmental \ndegradation, whether it be in the paint or whether it be in the soil--\nthere are needs that cry out in this country.\n  I cannot think of an amendment that does more to really strengthen \nthis piece of legislation because by passing this amendment I think \nwhat we say in one stroke of public policy is we are committed to being \naccountable; we are committed to making sure that we do not impose \nlegislation on State and local governments without making an effort to \neither provide the funding or be clear that they should provide the \nfunding, but we go on record, we are explicit about what we do, but at \nthe same time in the framework of the Americans With Disabilities Act, \nwe understand that there are some compelling needs in this country, \nthere are important populations that, unfortunately, are not so \nimportant here, not as important as they should be, that really do need \nsupport and protection.\n  We do not want to see some legislative process we have designed that \nhas become so convoluted, so complex, so full of opportunities for \npeople to block to prevent us from moving forward where we really need \nto take action.\n  I think that is what this amendment does. I think it strengthens the \nbill, and I am very pleased to support it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I thank the Senator from California \nfor her leadership.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator for coming over \nand joining in this debate. Again, it is an honor for me to have so \nmany of my colleagues make the time. He has consistently worked since \nthis bill began to try to strengthen the ability of this Senate to \nrespond to the needs of populations that simply cannot get on a plane, \ncome over here, take us to dinner, and plead their case eloquently.\n And many times these populations are in fact little kids, pregnant \nwomen, and the frail elderly.\n\n  What we are saying in this amendment is very clear. This bill has \nturned into somewhat of a bureaucratic nightmare. Maybe it is worth it \nall, to make the Governors happy. But we better stand up and look out \nfor regular people. Is that not why we are here?\n  At this time I am going to yield to the Senator from Washington who I \nthink, more than anyone in this place, stands up in the most direct way \nto protect those people, average Americans. I yield 7 minutes to my \nfriend from Washington, Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer, for bringing this very important piece of legislation, \nthis amendment, in front of us today, because I think it points out who \nsome of the critical citizens we are representing in this debate are \nand what attention we need to bring to them. Certainly I, like all of \nmy colleagues, have received letters from mayors and city councilmen \nand women who are saying you have to pass this unfunded mandates bill.\n  As a former State Senator I certainly was the recipient of mandates \nfrom the Federal Government, and I said, ``Who are they to pass this \nalong to me?'' However, I think in the process we have forgotten the \npeople whom we are here to represent. My constituents in the State of \nWashington sent me back here to represent their interests at the \nFederal level. Certainly some of the most important people I represent \nare the people who are spoken to in this amendment: Children, pregnant \nwomen, and the elderly. I look at this bill very critically. How will \nthat affect those, the most frail in our society, people who do not \nhave much of a voice here in the U.S. Senate?\n  There certainly are no children here, no pregnant women, and very few \nelderly. I think it is important we speak out for them and I thank the \nSenator from California for bringing this to our attention.\n  As we look at this bill in front of us, I look at the charts of the \nSenator from California that say what we will have to go through in \norder to pass a bill or amendment in the future, once the unfunded \nmandates bill comes before us. I have to say, as a mother I have a \ngreat concern about what this may do in case of a national crisis in \nthe future. I want to point out an example of an issue I think might be \nseverely impacted by this legislation as it is now in front of us \nwithout Senator Boxer's amendment.\n  Last year in my State there was an outbreak of E. coli. E. coli is a \nbacteria that is in meat, and if the meat is not cooked properly it can \ncause severe illness and in some cases death. In my State of \nWashington, some children had hamburgers from a restaurant where the \nmeat was not cooked sufficiently. Several children died, many were ill, \nseveral of them still ill, and \n[[Page S1512]] the outbreak of that has very much affected me as a \nmother thinking about buying meat and purchasing things.\n  We responded very quickly, putting out new regulations about how long \nmeat should be cooked. Certainly public awareness has become greater on \nthe issue. But I say to all my colleagues, and to people listening, \nthat E. coli is an emerging bacteria. It was not here several decades \nago. It is now something we are seeing more and more of, and there may \nbe a time in this country where it is not just isolated to my region. \nWhere we see more of it, we will need to respond quickly and directly \nwith national legislation to ensure that we deal with this crisis.\n  I look back at the charts of my colleague from California that show \nus the legislative process we have to go through and I ask what would \nhappen if we had to bring an amendment forward to deal with an issue \nlike E. coli. What strikes me very much is it will no longer be our \ndecision about whether or not this is a critical issue to the country \nand one we will be able to fight for. It will end up at CBO, and CBO \nwill decide whether or not, if they have the manpower or the womanpower \nto decide how much this is going to cost, how long it will take them to \nput together the impacts, if they can, of the passage of the \nlegislation. We will have some nonelected bureaucrat sitting in a back \nroom, looking at a stack of paper on his or her desk deciding whether \nor not they have the time to decide the impacts of my E. coli amendment \nthat is before the U.S. Senate.\n  I have a serious concern with that. I was elected by the people in my \nState to come back here and to bring to the attention of this \nGovernment important issues that we have to address. To know that I \nwould be stymied by somebody who is not elected, who is a CBO \nbureaucrat in the maze of the Senator from California back there--that \nI could not react quickly really concerns me. It especially concerns me \nwhen the issue affects children or pregnant women or the elderly.\n  I think the amendment of the Senator from California is very \nimportant for several reasons. It points out very specifically how this \ncan have a dramatic impact on some of our populations, some of our \namendments--the process. Kids are small. Their tolerance level is very \nlow. They cannot take a lot. We cannot wait for a bureaucrat to decide \nwhether or not this is an important issue. Maybe they are not a mom and \nthey do not have the kind of feeling I have about it. We need to be \nable, as elected officials--the people we have--to be able to move \nlegislation quickly.\n  I commend again the Senator from California for bringing this very \nimportant amendment before us that will simply say when the issue \naffects children, pregnant women and elderly, that we can move it \nthrough this body quickly and effectively. I believe, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut said, this strengthens the bill. This touches the \nconcern I have, and says we can act as who we were elected be, to be \nlegislators, to make legislation. We can do it responsibly. And it is \nan important amendment for this body to consider and to move forward.\n  I again thank my colleague, the Senator from California, for bringing \nthis amendment before us and I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. We do not have much time remaining on our side but I will \njust try to give a little balance to the debate. I would like to take 4 \nminutes of our time to make a couple points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after the last three statements we have \nheard I want to emphasize this point. This bill hurts no one. This is a \npositive bill. The results of this bill will be to help people, all \npeople, including--and I believe especially--the elderly who now have \nto bear the burden of so many of the Federal regulations through \nadditional taxes and in many cases property taxes. This is a way to \nbegin to help the American people by getting the onerous mandates of \nthe Federal Government and all the problems it creates and all the \ntaxes off the backs of people.\n  We should not be trying to anticipate, in this legislation, S. 1, any \nand all of the types of circumstances that would justify a waiver in \nfuture legislation. This legislation fully anticipates that such \ncircumstances will exist, probably, and allows the full Senate to judge \nthose cases on a case-by-case basis.\n  Several amendments have been offered. I guess others will be offered \nthat would remove additional categories from coverage by the bill. I \nhave a lot of questions about this.\n  How do you define frail elderly as distinguished from sick elderly or \njust elderly? My mother, heaven help her, is 82 years old. She has a \nbum knee. She does not get around too well. The bill already has an \nexemption for age. Would that not take care of this problem?\n  There is this other little exemption in the bill that I read earlier. \nIf there is a real problem the President of the United States can \ndesignate this is an emergency and can take care of the problem also.\n  There is no end to the list of groups or categories of individuals or \ncircumstances we might conjure up that might come forward. The bill \nwill take care of that. There are at least three problems with adding \nall these exemptions.\n  First, it is a slippery slope and there is no limit to the interests \nthat arguably ought to be protected through an exclusion.\n  Second, creating entire categories of blanket exclusions invites real \nproblems of interpretation. Would a mandate that deals with infants and \npregnant women, but also includes many nonexcluded circumstances or \ncategories, be exempt from the requirements of S. 1? That is a question \nwe really would have to think about.\n  Third, the more categories that are excluded, the more loopholes in \nthe bill that will invite creative construction of mandates, in order \nto avoid the intent of the law.\n  The real answer to these pleas for additional exclusions lies in the \nwaiver provision. Remember, S. 1 does not decide which mandates will be \nfunded by the Federal Government and which ones not. Instead it \nestablishes a process. Is it a magical process? Are we wedded to that? \nCan we make changes? Yes, we can. But this is not a mandate. This is a \nprocess by which we can virtually look at all Federal mandates. They \nwill be judged on their individual merits as to whether or not the \nFederal Government ought to fund them or not.\n  S. 1 fully anticipates the concerns of Senators like the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Senator Boxer, by allowing the \nSenate to make a case-by-case judgment on which mandates are so \ncompelling that they ought to be imposed even without Federal funding.\n  A big advantage of such case-by-case determinations is that it allows \nCongress to prevent creative uses of exemptions from turning into \nunintended loopholes. It also allows us to still require that the cost \nof a mandate be scored by CBO, under the provisions of S. 1, while then \nhaving the option of waiving the requirement that the Federal \nGovernment fully fund it. Remember, exclusions from this act are exempt \nfrom both requirements.\n That is the way they should be considered.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). All time which has been yielded \nhas expired.\n  The Chair reminds the Senator from Mississippi that he has 13 minutes \n43 seconds left under his time, and the Senator from California has 38 \nminutes 2 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi. I want to \nrespond to some of his points.\n  The Senator says, ``What do you mean by frail elderly? It is \nconfusing to me.'' Let me tell you why we decided to go with frail \nelderly. We wanted to make this a narrow exception. We did not want to \nmake this an exception that will hurt this bill. We said children under \n5, because those are the ages recognized by the World Health \nOrganization as the years when children are particularly vulnerable to \nenvironmental pollution. We did not want to say ``elderly.'' That would \nmean everyone over 65 or 62 or 70, because I \n[[Page S1513]] have many friends of that age group who are in better \nshape than some of us who are younger. We are trying to make an \nexception for the most vulnerable in our society.\n  It is really extraordinary to me that my good colleague would send \nout one of the members of the leadership to fight this amendment. I am \nvery flattered that the majority whip himself is here with all of his \nexperience in debate. But I think it speaks to the fact that this is an \nimportant amendment.\n  I hope that my Republican friends will not march lockstep to some \n100-day plan to pass a contract and say we have to vote against every \namendment because if this bill is different than the House bill we will \nhave to go to conference, and, God forbid, it will slow it down and \ntake time.\n  I hope the American people are listening to this debate. I hope they \nget involved in it because we are going to vote on this issue pretty \nsoon. I think anyone who has followed this debate, who has seen how \nbureaucratic this law is, will well understand why we need to exempt \nsome of our priorities from the maze it creates. If children are not \nour priority, where are we as a nation? Every Senator from every party, \nRepublican, Democrat, independent, I do not know of one who has not \nmade a great speech and gotten great applause for our wanting to \nprotect our children or our future. Well, let us show that we mean what \nwe say.\n  We are setting up a new procedure that is very confusing. I daresay I \nlistened to this debate. The two managers could not agree on some of \nthe provisions. There is no explanation of one of the key points in the \nbill, the term ``direct savings.'' There is no definition. The Senator \nfrom Mississippi says, well, the Senator from California does not \ndefine what frail elderly means. In this bill there is no definition of \ndirect savings. If we pass an environmental law and kids do not get \npoisoned from lead and they can concentrate in school and they can get \ninto high school and college and earn a living, was it worth it that we \nsaid to the States get the lead out of the water? You bet.\n  I ask you, my friends, my Republican friends who voted in lockstep \nagainst every one of these amendments, to ask the people in Milwaukee \nif they would have wished we would have acted to take the \ncryptosporidium out of the water, or my friend from Washington, my good \nfriend, who said she had to deal with the effects of E. coli in the \nmeat supply.\n  This bill sets up a bureaucracy. Make no mistake about it, it is \nhere. No one disputes it because this is it. This picture, I say to my \nfriends, does not even show the whole nightmare that it is because this \nis just what the Senate does to get the bill. Every amendment goes \nright around and through all of these steps again at every single \nconference report that may come to us. It goes right through it again. \nYou can hear the arguments on this amendment. They have accused us of \nslowing things up. I have news for them. They are on a 100-day course. \nMy people did not send me here to march in tune to a contract that some \npolitician wrote. They sent me here to fight for the people of \nCalifornia, to stand up for what I believe in, and especially for those \nwithout a voice because kids do not come here in pin-striped suits and \ntreat us to dinner. They expect, and they should expect, of their \nelders that we will look out for them.\n  I have made this amendment very narrow. I have made this amendment so \nnarrow that the exception is the frail elderly, children under 5, and \npregnant women, because I do not believe it is right, I do not believe \nthe American people want us to tie that kind of legislation into knots \nand later on be offering an amendment that says if it is a law that \ndeals with child pornography, child sexual abuse, child labor law \ninfraction, that we do not subject those kinds of laws to this \nbureaucratic nightmare.\n  If that is what this contract is all about, fine. I have to say that \nmy friend from Mississippi, and he is my friend, says this bill hurts \nno one, that this helps all people. Let me tell you something. I will \nbe unequivocal about this. I used to be in local government. I did not \nlike it when the Reagan administration told me what to do, and they did \nit time after time. So I want to support a bill that takes the mandates \noff our backs. I supported the original bill. This one goes too far. It \nsets up a maze. I am here to tell you. What good is it for the people \nof California to send me here and I cannot even offer an amendment to \nsave the children--to save the children from chemicals that go into the \nwater, from bacteria that goes into the food, from dirty air?\n  Do you know that the children in Los Angeles today have a 15 percent \nlower lung capacity than children born in clean air areas? The San \nFrancisco Chronicle, which in the past has supported many Republicans, \nsays as follows about this bill:\n  Clearly none of the major environmental protections passed over the \npast 25 years could have withstood this bill.\n  So let us be careful. Let us vote for the Boxer amendment, supported \nby the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and in a new poll \nthe vast majority of people believe we should have an Environmental \nProtection Agency. And Carol Browner has sent to every Senator a letter \ntoday saying vote for this amendment. This is smart. She says:\n\n       Your amendment, Senator Boxer, will ensure that Congress is \n     free to act to protect the health of our children, pregnant \n     women, and the elderly, and it has my full support.\n\n  This bill sets up a process. This is not about helping anybody. It is \nabout a process. It is not about helping anybody. I hope that we will \nadd an exception. That is an exception for the frail elderly, the \nchildren, and the pregnant women.\n I ask my friend from New Jersey if he is prepared at this time to make \na few remarks on this amendment, or would he rather the Senator from \nTexas take her time now? I have the right to the floor, and I am glad \nto yield if he wishes.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California. I hope the \nSenator from Texas will excuse my taking advantage of the time offered \nnow. I will not be long.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator like 10 minutes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That would be the most that I would need.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to make sure that as we pursue \nthe objective of S. 1, one that I think almost all share here, which is \nto get rid of assigning States tasks that cost them lots of money \nwithout having a good and sufficient reason, that we take important \nnational matters into consideration. One issue that I have mentioned in \nprevious statements is interstate pollution. I am concerned about my \nability to persuade the citizens of New York to take on an extra tax so \nthat beaches in my State could remain free of pollution. Yet that is \nexactly what may happen, because under S. 1, States would not have to \ncomply with Federal mandates unless we pay them to--or unless I am able \nto persuade a majority of my colleagues to help my State.\n  As I examined this bill, I came to the conclusion that, while in \nconcept and principle it is an excellent idea, there are certain \nnational interests that are so important that they ought not to be \nsubject to the S. 1 point of order. I commend the Senator from \nCalifornia, whose always thoughtful review of legislation enables her \nto have a certain uniqueness about finding that one spot or a place in \na bill that really calls out for unique or special attention.\n  In this case she is absolutely right. These exemptions, such as the \none that is being proposed by the Senator from California, include \nFederal mandates relating to national security, discrimination, and \ninternational agreements.\n  So today, I am trying to help secure support for the amendment of the \nSenator from California, to add the protections of children, pregnant \nwomen, and the frail elderly to the list of vital national interests.\n  Mr. President, I cannot believe that any of my colleagues would act \nin a way to endanger the welfare of already vulnerable Americans. Yet, \nthis bill, as it now stands, would do just that.\n  Mr. President, if we leave Federal environmental laws to the States, \nwe risk a situation where some States will enact much stricter \nlegislation than others and in that situation, by way of example, our \nNation's children could be placed at terrible risk. Scientific studies \nhave shown that children, pregnant \n[[Page S1514]] women, and the elderly are all particularly vulnerable \nto environmental threats. The overall incidence of childhood cancer, \nwhich induced, frankly, the review of the Superfund statutes that are \non our books, has increased 10.8 percent over the last decade. Noting \nthat, the incidence of childhood cancer has increased 10.8 percent over \nthe last decade. Cancer now is the No. 1 disease killer of children \nfrom late infancy through early adulthood.\n  Unlike legislators and regulators, the disease of cancer does not \nknow State lines. If just one State were to loosen its environmental \nlaws, the fallout could lead to even higher rates of childhood cancer, \nboth in that State and throughout the region.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President cautioned that we \nmust maintain our sense of responsibility and compassion as we move to \ntrim the Federal Government.\n  As it now stands, S. 1 would allow States to decide whether or not, \non their own, to protect citizens from serious environmental threats. I \nam concerned that passing this bill in its current form might be \nneither compassionate nor responsible.\n  The Federal Government has a moral responsibility to protect American \ncitizens--especially our most sensitive populations--from grave dangers \nto their health and well-being. We have a moral responsibility to \ntackle national problems with national solutions. And we have a moral \nresponsibility to make sure that our national environment is habitable \nand safe.\n  Later this afternoon, I plan to offer another amendment that \naddresses concerns not dissimilar to those raised by the Senator from \nCalifornia. My amendment would exempt from the requirements of this \nbill, legislation seeking to limit exposure to group A carcinogens. In \nother words, very simply, if a mandate was issued that one State had to \nrid itself of the emission of carcinogens to protect another State's \ninterest as well as its own, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask \nthat polluting State to pay for it, particularly if the effects, like \nthe wind blowing or currents flowing, would be in another State.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly sensitized now to the well-being of \nchildren, as I expect a phone call any minute from my youngest \ndaughter, who is ready to deliver my second grandchild. It is an \nexciting time, as all know. Also, it is a daunting one. I want to make \nsure that my children and your grandchildren, Mr. President--you are \nyoung and do not have them yet, but you will get them, God willing--and \nall the children in this land grow up in a safe healthy environment.\n  I want to make sure that they can breathe in the air without also \nbreathing in toxins of death, that they can drink the water without \nimbibing lead, and that they can grow up as healthy, productive adults, \nfree from scars of serious birth defects and childhood diseases. That \nis why I am here and joining the Senator from California to support \nthis amendment.\n  It is thoughtful, purposeful, and it belongs in this piece of \nlegislation as an exemption. Otherwise, Mr. President, we are going to \nbe putting the children of America and the elderly at dangerous risk. \nThere is nothing more beautiful, in my mind, than my pregnant daughter. \nWe ought to be concerned about pregnant daughters across the face of \nthis Nation. We all instinctively want to protect and admire that cycle \nof life.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope this is an amendment that is going to carry \nby weight of its value and by the persuasive presentation from the \nSenator from California.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Texas \nis prepared. I will only take 1 minute of my time. How much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take, at maximum, 2 minutes to say to my friend \nhow much I appreciate his coming over here. He has been a stalwart in \nterms of protecting the environment of the State of New Jersey and the \nhealth and safety of all Americans. He just faced the voters in a very \ntough race, where he stood on that record of environmental strength. \nAnd I think the fact that he is out here today supporting this very \nimportant amendment--which, I tell my friend from New Jersey, Carol \nBrowner, the head of EPA, supports and has sent us a letter which is on \neveryone's desk--and the fact that he took the time out of his busy \nschedule says to me he meant what he said to the people of New Jersey \nand he is very magnanimous to the Senator from California for helping \nher.\n  I want to share a personal note with my friend. I, too, have a \ndaughter who is going to give me, if all goes well, my first grandchild \nin June. And it is quite an experience to those people who have not had \nit yet. Your feelings for life and children and future come right to \nthe forefront. What we do here now is going to affect those \ngrandchildren of yours and mine, because if we set up such hurdles that \nmakes it impossible for the Senator from New Jersey to fulfill the \npledge he made to his people in his election and impossible for the \npeople to look to me and say, ``Please, Barbara, you said you want to \nact to help the young people and elderly in our environment.'' Children \nwho live in Los Angeles have on average 15 percent lower lung capacity \nthan children living in clean air areas. That is wrong.\n  This bill is a good idea that may well go too far. We are trying to \nfix this and make it better. I am stunned at my colleagues, that they \ndid not say to me, this is reasonable, let us work it out, let us \nchange two or three words, and let us make your idea part of this bill.\n  No. No. I have never seen anything like it; vote after vote along \npartisan lines against amendments that are going to make this bill \nbetter. The majority leader said, ``They like this bill. Why are they \noffering these amendments?''\n  Because we want to make it better. We did not come here to roll over \nand play dead because there was an election and somebody has a 100-day \ncontract. You know, my contract with my people goes far past 100 days. \nIt goes to the next generation.\n  I really believe that the Senator from New Jersey spoke eloquently to \nthat point. I am so proud to have his support, and also have the \nsupport of the Senator from Connecticut and the Senators from \nWashington and Minnesota. I thank them all.\n  I retain the remainder of my time to close debate at a later point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the concern of \nthe Senator from California about pregnant women and children and the \nelderly, and the Senator from New Jersey talking about carcinogens.\n  A vote today against this amendment or against the Senator from New \nJersey's amendment does not mean that we are for carcinogens in the \nwater. It does not mean that we do not want to take care of the young \nchildren and the elderly. We all want to make sure that our young \nchildren and our elderly people who need help have it.\n  In fact, that is the purpose of the bill. The purpose of the bill is \nto bring the issue down not to whether we take care of people or not \nbut how do we take care of them? What is the best way to make sure that \nour children have a future, that our elderly are able to be taken care \nof, that we do not have carcinogens in the water?\n  The question is who makes the decision and who pays for it?\n  What we are saying today is that the Government that is closest to \nthe people should be making those decisions and they should pay for it \nafter they make the decisions.\n  The whole concept of our Government is that we do not have taxation \nwithout representation; that if we are going to have a program whoever \ndecides that we are going to have that program should pay for it. That \nis the issue today. It is not whether or not we are going to take care \nof the people in this country who need help.\n  I am a former State treasurer. I have been a State officeholder. My \ncolleague from Idaho has been the mayor of his city in Idaho, Boise. So \nI think we have to look at the issue of who can best do this job.\n   [[Page S1515]] We know the impact of these mandates. We know the \ntough choices unfunded mandates force States and cities and counties to \nmake. And the issue is, are they going to raise taxes or are they going \nto cut services, services to the elderly and children? That is the \nquestion.\n  Passage of this bill sends a clear message to our State and local \ngovernment leaders that have cried to us time after time after time. We \nwant to work with them to reduce the pressures on the taxpayers of \nAmerica. It will also send a message to them that we intend to return \nto the proper role of Federal Government.\n  In my own State, almost one-third of the increase in the State budget \nover the last 3 years has been the result of unfunded Federal \nmandates--one-third. It is a stealth tax. The taxpayers of Texas and \nCalifornia and Ohio and Idaho are paying taxes but we do not get the \nblame for those taxes because it is a stealth tax. It comes from \nunfunded Federal mandates through the States and local governments. We \njust cannot afford it anymore. The taxpayers of this country cannot \nafford it anymore.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about an amendment and I said these unfunded \nmandates mean that we may have to increase and have increased the light \nbill or the water bill or the sewer bill for the very elderly people \nthat the Senator is trying to protect. I think you have to look at the \noverall picture to determine what the effects are going to be on the \npeople that we are going to try to protect.\n  Gov. George Bush of Texas, who just got sworn in last week, in his \ninaugural address said, ``Texans can govern Texas. Thank you very much, \nFederal Government. We can do it ourselves.''\n  Well, I am sure Tennesseans can govern Tennessee. I am sure \nCalifornians can govern California. They are quite competent to do it. \nIn fact, they are better able to make the decisions, because they would \nnot put a mandate on the local governments to test the water supply for \nproposed carcinogens that that water supply has never had and will \nnever have because they know what the potential carcinogens are in \nBoise, ID, or Amarillo, TX, or Memphis, TN. They know better than the \nFederal Government and they do not need to send their money to \nWashington to have them launder it through their bureaucracy and send \n80 cents on the dollar back. They have figured that out.\n  So the issue is not are we going to protect the elderly and the \nchildren and the working people and the jobs in this country. The issue \nis how is the best way to do it. And the best way to do it is to pass \nthis bill without amendments that are going to gut it as this amendment \nwill, pass this bill to say to the State and local governments: We are \nnot going to tell you what is best for your locality because we know \nyou can make that decision. We know that you are the best source to \ndetermine what the quality of air is and what the priority programs to \nclean up the air is for your area. And it is different in Los Angeles \nthan it is in El Paso. It is different in Houston than it is in \nMemphis.\n  That is why we want to pass this bill, so that the local governments \ncan more efficiently protect the people that we are here to protect, \nbecause they can do it best at the government level that is closest to \nthe people and they can determine what the priorities are and they will \ndo it in a much better way than the Federal Government, the bureaucrats \nthat may or may not have ever visited Los Angeles or Memphis. They can \ndo it better.\n  So that is why I am supporting this bill. And that is why I am very \nconcerned about an amendment that would essentially start to take out \nsegments of the potential mandates because when you do that you are \nsaying, ``We will be able to continue telling you how you will do your \nbusiness, State government and local governments.''\n  And I think the people of America understand that. And I think they \nunderstand that this is a bill that will fulfill a commitment that we \nhave made to downsize the Federal Government, to go back to our roots, \nwhich is State and local governments have all of the responsibilities \nin the Constitution except those specifically reserved to the Federal \nGovernment.\n Not the opposite. It is not the Federal Government saying we are going \nto do everything and we will let the States and local governments do a \nfew things that we decide they might be competent to do. The Federal \nGovernment did not create the States in this country. The States \ncreated the Federal Government. That is the way our Founding Fathers \ndecided to do it because they knew, they knew, that States and local \ngovernments were best able to deal with our problems. They knew that we \nshould have a very limited Federal Government. That is what we are \ntrying to return to with this bill.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I inquire as to what the timeframe is \non both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 17 minutes and 10 seconds, and 5 minutes \nand 13 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be glad to ask the manager if he wishes to retain \nhis time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, to the Senator from California, I \nbelieve I will use the remaining 5 minutes to make closing comments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Chair, it is my plan to close the debate \nsince it is my amendment, so at this time I would like to take 10 \nminutes of time. I would like the President to inform me when I have \nreached that 10-minute timeframe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am really glad that the Senator from \nTexas came over here to talk about her philosophy of government \nbecause, really, it goes to my amendment in many ways.\n  The Senator comes over here and talks about her philosophy of \ngovernment. I am talking about people, people who are going to be \nimpacted by a bill that is based on an excellent idea. The Senator from \nTexas talked about how she was in State government. I was in local \ngovernment. I come out of the grassroots. In my first campaign, I \nknocked on every door in my county. I lost that one. But I won the \nsecond one, 4 years later. And I have won every one since.\n  The reason I think I won these elections, sometimes unexpectedly, is \nbecause I said to the people of my State, ``I will go and fight for \nyou. I will walk hand in hand with the Republicans when I agree with \nthem, but when they go too far, I will fight for you.'' So the Senator \nfrom Texas talks about her philosophy of government. I want to talk \nabout the people. I like the idea of looking at costs when we write \nlaws.\n  I loved S. 993, which the Senator from Idaho wrote in the last \nCongress. It had very strong bipartisan support. It forces Members to \nlook at the costs. On this chart, it ended over here. It was very \ndoable and workable. And now it has been changed. We have hurdles set \nup, not only for the bills but for every single amendment. Maybe there \nare some here who think that everything we do here is bad. I do not \nthink that everything we do here is bad. Some of the things maybe, but \nthere is a lot we do that is good.\n  I found it interesting that the Senator from Texas says, ``Texans can \ntake care of Texas.'' That was not the case when they had a flood, as I \nremember it. And I was happy to help her constituents. I say to my \ncolleagues, be careful in your rhetoric. There may be times when you \nwill have floods in the Midwest, tornadoes, storms. There was a \nhorrible one in Tennessee, I remember, after my friend who is in the \nchair was elected. It was a terrible problem.\n  I believe that all levels of government should work together. We are \nnot enemies of each other; we are not enemies of each other. We are all \nin it for the same purpose. Sometimes, it will make sense for the local \ngovernment to be in complete control of everything that goes on. \nSometimes it should be a partnership.\n  My friend from Texas talked about the founders. If the founders took \na look at these charts, they would roll over in their graves. They were \nvery clear thinkers; they were very clear thinkers. Why we want to set \nup these hurdles on every single U.S. Senator is something I find hard \nto understand.\n  That is why I am offering my amendments. I would not have offered the \namendments to the former bill because \n[[Page S1516]] that bill made sense. This bill goes too far. If there \nis an outbreak of E-coli in the meat supply, as Senator Murray said, \nshe wants to act. If there is cryptosporidium in the water supply, it \nkills people. Who does it kill? The frail elderly, the children, and it \nharms the pregnant women and the children they are carrying. All we are \nsaying is: Make another exception. You have made other exceptions in \nthis bill. If we mean that our children are important, make an \nexception for those children.\n  Let me read for my friends here from a very important paper, ``Health \nEffects of Ambient Air Pollution.'' As I understand it, my friend from \nTexas has a bill that would postpone implementation of the Clean Air \nAct. What does that mean to one part of my State? It would, in fact, \nreverse the progress we are making and we would see a continuation of \nthe costs of dirty air approach $9 billion, just in Los Angeles. If we \nclean up the air, we will save $9 billion. Does that go into this \nformula? No, it does not. We do not believe that savings is in this.\n  I also have to say to my friend, she says Texans can govern Texas and \nCalifornians can govern California. Of course, we can. There is a role \nfor State government, and there is a role for local government and a \nrole for Federal Government. But I have news for her. We had a Civil \nWar. We decided we were one Nation under God. We are not enemies of one \nanother. I love to work with Governors and State-elected officials and \nlocal officials, of which I was one. We are not enemies.\n  The American people, in a recent poll in the Wall Street Journal, a \ncouple of days old, said it is up to this Government to act to protect \nthe health of the people, the environment; only 9 percent of the people \nthink there is no use for the Environmental Protection Agency. Let me \nrepeat that: Only 9 percent of the people think there is no use for the \nEPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Environmental \nProtection Agency supports my amendment. It is unusual for them to send \na letter. They sent it on this amendment, because Carol Browner, who \ncomes from the State of Florida, who understands the role of State \ngovernment, who supports deregulating, says this is an important \namendment.\n  Listen to what the American Lung Association says:\n\n       The young, the old and the chronically ill are usually \n     assumed to be at high risk for many forms of air pollution. \n     Much experience leads us to expect that immature, growing \n     bodies will be highly vulnerable to all sorts of \n     environmental stresses in comparison to healthy adult bodies. \n     A more specific concern is that children breathe more air for \n     a given volume of lung tissue than do adults; likewise, much \n     experience leads us to expect that bodies debilitated by \n     disease (that is the frail elderly) or by the inevitable loss \n     of function with advanced age will be highly vulnerable.\n\n  My friend from Mississippi says, ``What do you mean by the frail \nelderly?'' I tell you, read the American Lung Association. ``* * * \nbodies debilitated by disease or by the inevitable loss of function \nwith advanced age will be highly vulnerable.''\n  They cannot put on a pinstriped suit and come in here and take me to \nlunch and tell me why it is so important to protect them. They just \nwant to be grandmas and grandpas and great grandmas and great grandpas, \nand live in peace and drink the water, breathe the air, and kiss their \ngreat grandchildren, and pass on the family values that are so \nimportant to everyone in this Senate. I have yet to hear a Member who \ndid not talk about family values. We better value the family of \nhumanity here in America because if we cannot act with speed, \ndeliberate speed, when there is an outbreak of some poison in the \nwater, some chemical in the water, we are putting those people at risk.\n  Maybe you will change your mind if it happens to be your mother or \nyour father or your pregnant daughter. I hope we are never in that \nsituation where I have Members coming to the U.S. Senate floor saying: \nSenator Boxer, you were right; we should have done this. We cannot act. \nWe are tied up in knots. I cannot even offer an amendment.\n  Why are we here? We are not here to please Governors. We are not here \nto just deal with the process.\n  That is why I like last year's bill. It was sensible, it was sound. \nIt treated us like grownups. Let us get a cost estimate. If we do not \nhave it, there is a point of order against the bill and we have to \nstand up and be counted if we, in fact, pass a law that costs some \nmoney.\n  By the way, I am very willing to put the money behind anything I \nbelieve in. I think that is the right way to be. I think we should move \nin that direction, but to tie us up in knots?\n  By the way, I also have to make a point here. In the committee, I say \nto my friends, I offered a sunset amendment. I said, ``Look, this may \nbe a great bill, but let's analyze it in a few years.'' They said, \n``Oh, no, no, no, we do not want to do that.''\n  I said, ``OK, I'll offer an amendment for 3 years,'' and then I \nsunsetted it at 5 years, then I sunsetted it out in 2002. No, \nRepublican party-line straight vote, no sunset.\n  So when I hear my friend say, ``If this doesn't work, we'll change \nit,'' I think it is a little disingenuous because we offered a sunset \nprovision out as far as 7 years and could not get a Republican vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, will you please notify me when I have \nspoken for 4 minutes?\n  I just came from a press conference. That is why I had to leave for a \nfew minutes. At that press conference, we had mayors from around the \ncountry. We had Victor Ashe, from Knoxville, TN. We had Greg Lashutka, \nwho is Senator Glenn's mayor, from Columbus, OH; Rich Daley, the mayor \nof Chicago--all of them in strong support.\n  The press conference was to announce strong support for S. 1 and the \nfact they appreciated S. 1 has as its core S. 993. But that we have \ntaken a good step forward. That is what S. 1 is.\n  At any point during this process, if you truly have an emergency \nsituation, you can seek a waiver. These points of order are not self-\nexecuting either, Mr. President. Someone will have to raise that point \nof order, and if you truly have some true national emergency, I really \ndo not perceive someone is going to try to stop the process of dealing \nwith it.\n  I do not want the Senator to feel that those who may oppose the \nlanguage of her amendment are against in any way the elderly and \nchildren. I appreciate the sensitivity by which she has addressed the \nissue of the elderly and the children.\n  I have said many times that S. 1 is a carefully balanced bill. It is \na bill that has bipartisan support because we have addressed these \nissues. A number of Senators have expressed concern that exemptions \nneed to be added to the limited few that are in S. 1. But I do not \nshare that view and for a number of reasons.\n  First, remember this is a bill that is prospective in nature. It only \napplies to new mandates contained in legislation considered in Congress \nafter next year. So it is impossible that this bill would harm the \ncurrent environment, public health, and safety.\n  S. 1 is a process bill. It reforms the process by which Congress \nconsiders legislation imposing mandates. It is a process bill for \nmaking better decisions in the future about issues that affect State \nand local governments and the private sector. So nothing in this bill \naffects in any way the current health, job safety, or the environment \nof any citizen.\n  Let me emphasize a provision in this bill that directs committees to \nreport on the costs and benefits on health and safety and protection of \nthe natural environment. We will have more information to make better \ndecisions. S. 1 is not a ban on mandates. As the sponsor of this bill, \nI may well vote to waive this point of order sometime in the future.\n  With respect to the issue of the elderly and children, let me mention \nwhat I think is quite straightforward. State and local officials, more \nthan Congress, work on these issues hands on. These are the real world \nday-to-day facts of life that State and local officials care about. \nThey want clean water, clean \n[[Page S1517]] air, safe working conditions just as we do. They want to \ncare for their neighbors, their elderly and those who need help.\n  Unfunded mandates, unfortunately, keep State and local officials from \ntaking meaningful action to improve public health and safety. Examples \nof that are boundless and have often been cited on the Senate floor.\n  The reason why unfunded mandates are counterproductive is simple: \nStates and cities have to use discretionary dollars that would have \nbeen spent on other programs to pay for mandates. States and cities \nhave fixed costs that they must pay. They have to pay for sewers and \nroads and police and fire.\n  I noted with keen interest the comments made by the other \ndistinguished Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, when we began \ndebate on this bill. And she said, and I quote:\n\n       Let us take Los Angeles County. To meet Federal mandates \n     and still balance its budget, the County of Los Angeles has \n     to curtail significantly other programs. For example, this \n     year--\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n       For example, this year, Los Angeles County employees would \n     have to forgo cost-of-living and other wage adjustments, and \n     aid to indigents will be substantially reduced. Several \n     libraries are being closed * *  *. Recipients of welfare and \n     public health services will face longer waits due to minimal \n     county staff.\n\n  Let me read a quote from the National School Board Association, \nPresident Boyd Boehlge:\n\n       The very children Congress is trying to protect are the \n     ones who are hurt most often by proliferation of unfunded \n     mandates.\n\n  To accept further some unfunded mandates to the process or exemptions \nin S. 1 seems it could lead to the imposition of more unfunded mandates \nin the future. It is a process so that we can have these discussions. \nThis is where those discussions should take place, recognizing that we \ndo have State and local officials who realize their responsibility and \nare looking for a partnership instead of just dictates from their \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five seconds. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have to close?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 6 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to close debate at \nthis point. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwho participated in this debate. I think this was a very important \ndebate, and I think the vote is very important as well.\n  I want to say to my friend from Idaho that, again, he talks about how \nthe mayors want this. My mayors like the impact of this as well, but \nwhen I met with them and I explained the amendment that I had offered, \nthey did not object to what I am trying to do. They understand that we \nhave to be reasonable people.\n  My friend says, ``Oh, its real easy, you come to the floor and you \njust get everything waived and everything works fine.'' I say to my \nfriend from Idaho, the author of this bill, that if it is so easy, why \ndoes he have any exemptions whatsoever? I think it is a very important \npoint that he address in his own mind. If this is such a \nstraightforward bill, if any Senator can get on this floor and say, \n``Look, this is so important, I want a waiver,'' why does he have any \nexemptions in this bill? And he does have exemptions in this bill. It \ncurrently shields constitutional rights, discrimination, national \nsecurity, and implementation of international agreements such as NAFTA.\n  Now let me say something. It shields international agreements, such \nas NAFTA.\n  What about children? Are our American children as important as an \ninternational agreement such as NAFTA? Are our pregnant women as \nimportant as an international agreement such as NAFTA? I think so. If \nthere were no exemptions in this bill, I think that the manager of the \nbill would be intellectually correct when he says it is easy; any \nSenator can get a waiver. Then why did he put exceptions in the bill? \nAnd why does he oppose our adding a very narrow group of people who \ncannot come here and lobby, of people who do not have a powerful voice \nbut are the most vulnerable of populations?\n  Now, I read to you before that the lung association feels very \nstrongly that children are very vulnerable to chemicals, to pesticides, \nand to other things in the environment that harm them more than they \nharm adults.\n  Right now, when our agencies set limits on chemicals and pesticides, \nthey use a healthy 170-pound man as their model. But now we know that \nchildren are more vulnerable than a 170-pound man, that the frail \nelderly are more vulnerable than a 170-pound man, and certainly a child \nwho is 5 years old or less is vulnerable and they are getting cancers \nin greater numbers. And we are setting up hurdles here that my friend \nfrom Idaho says is just a process. It is just a process.\n  Well, we know what process means around here. We had enough \nfilibusters from the other side last year. We know what happens to \nbills when there is a process. The bills die. So therefore when we have \na process bill that sets up all this bureaucracy, we have to say to \nourselves, well, wait a minute, there are some people in our society \nthat really should not be impacted by this process, by endless \nchitchat, by unelected officials in the CBO and the parliamentarians.\n  I say to them, I think you are great, but the people of California \ndid not elect you to decide whether my amendment would get to the floor \nwithout a point of order. They want me to be able to offer my \namendment. If I can persuade the people here, fine. If I lose the \nfight, at least I waged it. They do not want me stopped by process. If \nI am stopped by substance, that is fine. That is why we want to add to \nthe exceptions this very narrow group.\n  Now, listen to what is stated in this book. I told you before, I lost \none of my constituents to cancer, a little girl, Colette Chuda, and her \nparents are working very hard so that other little babies, our \nchildren, our grandchildren, do not have the same fate, and they funded \nan environmental study. I wish to quote from it in part.\n\n       An estimated 8,000 children under the age of 15 are \n     diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year. Brain \n     cancer and leukemia are the most common childhood cancers.\n\n  My friends, I want to tell you right now as we speak I have two \nfriends in the House of Representatives, one who has a little tiny baby \nwith brain cancer and the other who has a youngster about 19, or in his \n20's, with leukemia; perfectly beautiful children.\n\n        Incidence rates have increased for the majority of these \n     malignancies with the greatest reported increases occurring \n     for acute lymphatic leukemia and brain cancer.\n\n  These are the biggest increases. You can talk about mayors; you can \ntalk about Governors; you can talk about a contract. I admire you. I am \ntalking about kids. I do not want to get them caught up in this maze. \nYou did not have it last year, but you have it this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope you will join with me and vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate the arguments made by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I move to table her amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Also, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nwhen the Senate turns to amendment No. 187, it be considered and \ndebated along with No. 188; that there be 30 minutes total equally \ndivided in the usual form for debate on both amendments; that no \namendments be in order to either amendment; and that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time the majority manager or his \ndesignee be recognized to move to table amendment No. 187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n   [[Page S1518]] Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Also, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that following the disposition of amendment No. 188, the Senate \nresume consideration of the Graham amendment No. 183; that there be 10 \nminutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual form, and that no \nsecond degree amendments be in order to amendment No. 183, and that \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of time the Senate proceed to \nvote on the Graham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. No objection.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot, I just wanted to clarify, there will be agreed-upon substitute \nlanguage offered for No. 183, and I wanted to clarify that the managers \nunderstand that and that will not be inconsistent with the prohibition \non second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Florida, I \nam not sure I have seen the modified language.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Senator's staff has seen the modification.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. All right. Mr. President, then I would vitiate my \nunanimous-consent request with regard to the Graham amendment until I \nam sure I have seen the language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n               vote on motion to table amendment no. 202\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do support \nvitiating the yeas and nays and then we would proceed to the \nconsideration of the amendment, is the Senator correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order.\n  Without objection, the yeas and nays are vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 183, as modified\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk on my \namendment No. 183.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 183), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) if funded in whole or in part, a statement of \n     whether and how the committee has created a mechanism to \n     allocate the funding in a manner that is reasonably \n     consistent with the expected direct costs among and between \n     the respective levels of state, local, and tribal government.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as modified, the amendment has been \nreviewed by both managers, and I believe it will be accepted. I will \nnot ask for a rollcall vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, I believe, closes the loop to the \nextent possible on an issue within this bill. A fundamental purpose of \nthis bill is to identify mandates which the Federal Government might, \nat a future date, be proposing to impose upon States, local \ngovernments, or tribal governments, and then as the preferred option, \nto have the Federal Government pay the cost of those mandates.\n  This amendment goes to the issue of how that appropriation to fund \nthe mandate will then be allocated back to the States, local \ngovernments, or tribal governments, which had created the need for that \nfunding in the first instance because they were the object of the \nmandate. There are at least two issues which I believe this amendment \nwill deal with. One is the issue of where the mandate is imposed on a \nparticular level of government. For instance, a mandate is imposed on \nschool districts because of requirements made to them that relate to \nthe educational or noneducational activities that are conducted by \nschools. If school districts are the level of government upon which the \nmandate falls, then school districts should be the level of government \nthat receives the funds which we appropriate for the purpose of \nalleviating the financial impact on that unit of government of the \nmandate which we have imposed. A commonsense approach.\n  Second is the distribution among units of government. We know that \nfrom time to time we will impose mandates that are not uniform across \nthe country. They may be mandates that relate, peculiarly, for \ninstance, to border States that have immigration problems, northern \nStates that have heating problems, States that have specialized \ngeological problems, such as those that would relate to earthquakes. \nThere should be a connection between the distribution of funds and \nwhere the mandate falls.\n  So this amendment states that if a mandate is funded in whole or in \npart, then the committee which has the responsibility for that \nparticular legislation will contain in its final report a statement of \nwhether the committee chose to allocate the money in a relationship to \nwhere the need was. They might indicate that they did not do so because \nof a deficiency of data upon which to make that judgment, or because \nthey felt that the Congressional Budget Office's assessment of the \nlocus of the need was irrational and, therefore, for good and \nsufficient reasons, adopted a different approach. Or should they have \nadopted the approach which the Congressional Budget Office utilized, \nhow the committee has created a mechanism to allocate the funding in a \n[[Page S1519]] manner which is reasonably consistent with the expected \ndirect cost among and between the respective levels of State, local, \nand tribal government.\n  So, in summary, Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nlink the mandate and the cost of that mandate to the method by which \nFederal funds will be allocated. I fear that if we do not have that \nlinkage, we are going to end up with a school district--to use my first \nanalogy--which had a mandate that costs that school district a million \ndollars, but because funds were not distributed in a manner consistent \nwith how the need was assessed, they might only receive a fraction of \nthat million dollars. So while we can say we funded the mandate on a \nglobal basis, as it relates to that school district, they are still \ncarrying a heavy burden of an unfunded mandate.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Florida for \nhis comments and for his diligence in working through the amendment \nwhich he has offered. I think his experience both as a former Governor \nand as a Senator has been very helpful in getting to this point.\n  On behalf of our side, I certainly will accept this amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I, too, want to accept on behalf of our \nside this amendment. I think the Senator from Florida has made a very \ngood point here. He is fleshing out some of the things that needed to \nbe spelled out better in this language. I compliment him on that. One \nof the things we want to make certain is that this is a workable \ndocument when it passes. He is addressing that problem. So we are happy \nto accept this on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 183), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as an original \ncosponsor of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. As a long-\ntime supporter and cosponsor of related legislation in the previous \nsession of Congress, I welcome the leadership of the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, and the bill's very able manager, Senator Kempthorne, for \nbringing S. 1 before the Senate so expeditiously.\n  In addition to unduly burdening our local governments, Congress, in \nits Big Brother role, often ignores States' rights in determining what \nis best for the States. It also demands that the States figure out how \nto pay for those unwanted mandates.\n  In the last Congress, officials in my own State of Virginia made a \nclear case concerning the enormous burden of unfunded mandates. \nVirginia's finance committee staff conducted a review on Federal \nmandates and the burdens they exact. I would like to share some of \nthose findings with my colleagues today.\n  While Federal mandates are in general the result of well-intentioned \ncongressional action, State governments are all too often left holding \nthe bag. Virginia views the pervasive Federal influence on its budget \nas a two-edged sword: Federal restrictions on the use of funds \nhamstring the Commonwealth's ability to determine spending priorities \nor respond to changing economic conditions.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, at least 20 percent of the State \nbudget is either driven, defined, or constrained by Federal laws, \nregulations, or Federal agency decisions. And, bear in mind, this is a \nconservative estimate--it does not take into account the impact of laws \nfor which no systematic survey has been done.\n  Let's take a look at the ways in which the Federal Government impacts \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia's ability to set budget priorities.\n  Recently, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality estimated \nthat it will cost local governments at least $1.8 billion over the next \n20 years to build the waste management facilities that comply with \nFederal requirements. In addition to solid waste, the department has \nestimated that local governments will need at least $4.2 billion over \nthe same period to construct new facilities or upgrade existing ones to \nsatisfy the requirements of the Clean Water Act. And that's not the end \nof the crunch. The Safe Drinking Water Act will cost localities some $2 \nbillion by the year 2000. Together, those mandates will demand \napproximately $700 million per year from local governments.\n  In Virginia, the greater Lynchburg area has a population of 165,000. \nStudies conducted by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality \nindicated that the combined sewer overflow requirements of the Clean \nWater Act for this area will cost an estimated $200 million. The city \nof Richmond is similarly impacted.\n  According to a recent survey conducted by the Virginia Municipal \nLeague of Cities, the city of Danville, population 55,000, will be \nrequired to spend an estimated $1,058,000 to comply with the Safe \nDrinking Water Act for fiscal year 1995. Included in that estimate are \nmonitoring costs, capital costs, and operation and maintenance costs \nfor surface water treatment, lead and copper regulation, the total \ncoliform rule, the fluoride rule, and standards under the national \nprimary drinking water regulations.\n  ISTEA, section 1038 imposes a mandate to use waste tires--crumb \nrubber--in hot mix asphalt [HMA] and it will require Virginia to use \napproximately 4 million pounds of crumb rubber in 1997 and beyond. The \naverage cost of hot mix asphalt in Virginia is about $27 per ton; the \nmandate to use crumb rubber will elevate the cost to approximately $55 \nper ton. And, while the requirement will use only 4 percent of the \nwaste tires generated in Virginia, it will impose an annual cost of $6 \nmillion.\n  In addition to must do, no Federal funds, the infamous unfunded \nmandates, there are may do, must match and may do, must maintain \nprograms, including education and health-related programs such \nvocational training, substance abuse and mental health block grants. \nThese problems are largely voluntary, but Virginia participates \nwherever it can.\n  Finally we have may do, no match, which are largely grants--but \nFederal funds used for these programs may not supplant general funds \nprovided for similar purposes.\n  And it is important to note that, unlike the Federal Government, \nVirginia has no choice but to balance its budget. Congressional good \nwill and benevolence often translates into unexpected and unfunded \nburdens.\n  Two areas in which Virginia is constantly challenged are education \nand health care.\n  The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, passed in 1974 to \nmainstream special education students in public schools, was a vastly \nambitious undertaking. Congress committed itself to providing 40 \npercent of total program cost. In reality, during fiscal year 1993, the \nFederal Government provided less than 8 percent of the funding \nnecessary to fully meet the mandate.\n  The jointly funded Medicaid Program presents a particular dilemma for \nmy State. Because of the relative affluence of Virginia, the \nCommonwealth must provide 50 percent of program costs. But Congress \ndetermines minimum eligibility standards for Medicaid recipients, as \nwell as the level of required service. While certainly well \nintentioned, congressional expansion of Medicaid is projected to cost \nVirginia more than $300 million over the next 2 years alone.\n  Virginia must also foot 50 percent of the bill for Aid to Families \nwith Dependent Children [AFDC], and State costs should be close to $115 \nmillion per year over the 1994-96 biennium.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government continually uses its own fiscal \nproblems to impose additional mandates on the States. There seem to be \nfew, if any, incentives for Congress to halt the trend: mandates are \nalmost magical, allowing Congress to fund costly programs without \nraising taxes or cutting other services.\n  Federal mandates continue to proliferate. In the 102d Congress, 15 \nbills were passed with mandates; the 103d had over 100 bills which \ninclude such edicts.\n  Several new mandates loom. For example, the Motor-Voter Act, which is \nexpected to cost over $100 million in the next 5 years nationwide. I \nopposed \n[[Page S1520]] the National Registration Act of 1993 and have \ncosponsored S. 91, to delay its implementation and put the brakes on a \nproject for which there is no money in the pot.\n  Recognizing the unbearable burdens imposed by unfunded mandates is \nnot enough. We must take steps to require the Federal Government to \neither shoulder its share of the burden or relieve the States from \ntheirs. The measure before us seeks to accomplish this by requiring \neither full funding for costly new mandates or scaling them down \ncommensurate with the level of available resources.\n  This is reasonable, rational policy which will not only be welcomed \nby the State and local governments--it will also provide Congress with \na better, more structured framework in which to design new laws.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to give S. 1 the broadest \npossible support and move the bill towards final passage.\n                      amendments nos. 187 and 188\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed en \nbloc to amendments numbered 187 and 188.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes \n     amendments en bloc numbered 187 and 188.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendments are printed in the Record of January 24, \n1995, under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss \namendments I have filed on S. 1. I came to the floor last week to raise \nquestions about the possible unintended consequences of this bill. I am \nnot certain all my concerns have been addressed, so I want to talk \nabout them a little more today.\n  My first amendment proposes that nuclear waste cleanup by the \nDepartment of Energy be exempted from S. 1. I filed this amendment \nbecause I am very concerned about the implications of this bill for \ncleanup of former weapons facilities that now pose environmental \ncleanup challenges.\n  Mr. President, Hanford Nuclear Reservation is in my State. It has \nnine shut-down reactors on the Columbia River. It has four processing \nplants. It has 177 nuclear waste tanks, 45 of which may be leaking. It \nhas numerous waste dumps scattered around the facility. Of all our \npollution problems, nuclear weapons plants like Hanford pose the \ngreatest dangers to the environment. They have the greatest potential \nthreats to human health and safety.\n  Mr. President, we won the cold war at this site. Now the bill is due; \ncleaning up Hanford is serious business. For the community; for the \nregion; and for the country.\n  As many of our colleagues know, there is a process underway at \nHanford--and many other DOE facilities--that governs the cleanup \nschedule. In Washington State, that process is embodied in the tri-\nparty agreement between DOE, the State, and EPA. As a coordinating \ntool, this agreement works pretty well. It ensures everyone has a seat \nat the table. It sets cleanup goals. It emphasizes economic transition \nfor the community. It gives people in my State access to DOE \ndecisionmakers.\n  In reality, there are no unfunded mandates at Hanford. It is safe to \nsay my State issues--and enforces--the largest hazardous waste permit \nin the world using voluntary authority under RCRA. For these \nactivities, the State levies a tax on low-level waste producers. For \nits responsibilities under the Superfund law, Washington receives \ndirect funding from DOE.\n  But these laws--RCRA, CERCLA, Federal Facilities Compliance Act, and \nothers--do contain some mandates. And\n some day, Congress must act to reauthorize them. What happens if we \nreauthorize RCRA? If S. 1 is enacted, even the most modest changes in \ncurrent law could unravel the triparty agreement. As I understand it, \nthis would be possible because the occupant of the chair--or some \nbureaucrat at CBO--would have the power to:\n\n  Bring Senate action to a halt over a point of order; and\n  Force all kinds of studies and delay that would only confuse the \ncleanup situation.\n  What would happen if CBO intervention stalled consideration of the \nreauthorization, and the law lapsed? Would the Hanford permit expire, \nand the cleanup stall?\n  The people of Washington State do not want some unelected CBO \nbureaucrat arbitrarily deciding the pace of Hanford cleanup in the \ncontext of a budget point-of-order on the Senate floor.\n  My amendment is simple. It exempts nuclear waste cleanup from the \nprocedures in S. 1, from points-of-order, from CBO review, and from any \nprocedural wrangling that might jeopardize the orderly process of \ncleanup--for any reason. When we act to reauthorize RCRA, I want to be \nable to tell people in Washington State that we will have a law on the \nbooks to support cleanup. When we push through a reconciliation, or an \nappropriations bill, I want my constituents to know their interests \nwill not fall victim to vagaries in new Senate debating procedures.\n  I offered this amendment for one simple reason: Some things are too \nimportant to subject to a new set of debating rules that we do not know \nwill function as ordered. The bill acknowledges this in section 4, \nwhere it excludes a series of critically important areas of Federal \nlaw. It exempts civil rights and nondiscrimination laws. It exempts \nnational security. It exempts emergency relief. These things are \ncritical to the national well-being, and therefore kept out of S. 1.\n  Why not add to this list our most serious environmental challenges? \nIt would seem to me a sensible precaution.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, the Senator from New Mexico [Senator \nBingaman] offered an amendment very similar to mine. I want to thank \nhim and commend him for bringing this very important issue to our \ncolleagues' attention. He knows a tremendous amount about these issues.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate defeated his amendment, in spite of the \nvery strong arguments he made. It is clear, therefore, my amendment \nwill probably meet a similar fate.\n  I was disappointed to see the result of last night's vote on Senator \nBingaman's amendment. He was raising very real questions about \nimportant, sensitive, high-risk areas of Federal law. Both his \namendment and mine point out the potential uncertainties in imposing an \narbitrary new set of debating rules on the U.S. Senate.\n  At the very least, I am hoping the managers of this bill can provide \nsome clarification of their intentions vis-a-vis defense waste cleanup. \nI will pose these questions, and then yield the floor in hopes of \ngetting some answers that will allay the concerns of people in my \nState.\n  First, do the managers intend that S. 1 have any adverse effects on \nDOE waste cleanup efforts, and the ability of affected States and \ncommunities to participate therein?\n  Second, do the managers contemplate that S. 1 will lead to the \nchange, repeal, or substantive alteration of any current law that \nenables DOE cleanup to move forward?\n  Finally, do the managers believe that consideration of current or \nprospective mandates pending on the Senate floor should delay \nconsideration provisions in the same bills affecting DOE waste cleanup \nprograms?\n  I assume no such onerous consequences are intended by the managers. \nBut I do not see it written anywhere, and I would like to have verbal \nclarification of those issues.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by saying the basic idea of S. 1 is \ngood: That the Federal Government ought to help make Federal laws \neasier and less costly to implement. I support this basic idea, and I \nwant to work with the managers to pass a good bill. But, like so many \nother broad-brush solutions we are hearing about these days, it is not \nas simple as it sounds. I look forward to hearing the answer to those \nquestions and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not speak for the managers in \nresponse to the questions the Senator asks, but \n[[Page S1521]] I might ask her to clarify a little further for me why \nanything has to be exempted here. We have an agreement, is that not \nright, that exists now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the manager yielded me time. I apologize.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe the Senator could explain to me, if you have an \nagreement out there now, how do you see this bill affecting that \nagreement? There is nothing in this bill that says this bill calls the \nagreement to be vitiated, canceled, or changed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for his question. My question to the \nmanagers on this bill is if they see anything in this bill that would \ncause consideration for us and we do have to reauthorize RCRA, CERCLA, \nother bills coming up in the future, if at that time a bill has both \nmandates in it and non-mandates in it and the mandates cause the bill \nto be stalled in any way because we are waiting for something back from \nCBO, how will this affect cleanup efforts such as exist in my State and \nothers?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, they exist in my State also at a different level.\n  But I would just say to the managers of the bill and in particular \nthe manager on our side of the bill, but I have spoken with Senator \nGlenn also, it seems to me we cannot say that any agreement predicated \nupon the laws of RCRA or any other environmental laws, that if those \nare changed in the future, we will hold anything exempt from it.\n That is future activities, to future agreements and understandings, \nbut if RCRA is deemed to need reauthorization, we surely could not \npredict for the State of Washington, the State of Oregon, the State of \nNew Mexico, many States that have DOD and DOE cleanup based on \nstandards, we cannot say it will not have any effect on those. That is \nmy position.\n\n  I hope the managers would say we are not exempting anything yet under \nthis agreement or this bill. I do not think we should exempt things we \ndo not even understand. I leave that up to the managers. I would surely \nrecommend we not accept the amendment, and if the Senator desires that \nwe have a clear exception for her State, that she work with the \nmanagers in some other way, but not exempt entire situations such as \nthis, that we do not understand. We do not know the consequences of \nchanging RCRA on your State or any other State. I yield back the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to the questions that were \nposed. Do the managers intend that Senate bill 1 have adverse effects \non DOE waste cleanup efforts and the ability of affected States to \nparticipate therein?\n  No, I have no intention, whatever, that this would have any adverse \naffects on DOE waste cleanup.\n  I say that, Mr. President, as a resolution of the State of Idaho, \nwhich also has significant DOE waste cleanup problems. So I would not \nbe an advocate that in any way would adversely affect DOE getting on \nwith the cleanup of Hanford, for example, or projects in the State of \nIdaho.\n  The second question that was asked, do you contemplate that Senate \nbill 1 will lead to the change, repeal or substantial alteration of \ncurrent law that enables DOE cleanup to move forward? No, Senate bill 1 \nwill not lead to that. Senate bill 1 is simply a process. It would be a \ndifferent motivation. Senate bill 1 also is prospective so that those \nmandates that are on the books now, even under reauthorization, those \nthat are currently on the books would not come under the process of \nSenate bill 1. Any changes to that, to those mandates, yes, they \npotentially would be subject to Senate bill 1 and then we would have to \ngo through the process. But, no, S. 1 would not be the impetus to cause \nthat to happen.\n  On the third point, I am not sure that I understand it so I would be \nmore than happy to have our respective staffs get together and discuss \nthat. Again, I understand your concerns with the Hanford facility. I \nhave concerns with similar situations in the State of Idaho.\n  I yield to my colleague from Ohio 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would respond in much the same way. There \nwas this in here, nothing in S. 1, that gives anyone any authority to \ngo change any agreement that is in affect. It could not be interpreted \nthat way to the best of my knowledge.\n  In the amendment that was proposed by the Senator, the provisions of \nthis act and the provisions made in this act shall not apply to any \nagreement between the Federal Government, State and local tribal for \nthe environment restoration and waste management.\n  Nothing in here could change, nothing does change, nor could it \nchange any agreement that is in effect right now. I hope that takes \ncare of concerns.\n  The cleanup efforts which the Senator from Idaho mentioned just a \nmoment ago, that it would not affect cleanup efforts, is a little bit \ndifferent than the agreements that were specifically addressed. Cleanup \nefforts are something that are going on under those agreements, \nslightly different. But this would not change either the level of \ncleanup efforts that are provided for by other budgeting and other \nlaws, nor would it change any agreements between the Federal \nGovernment, State, local, or tribal governments which the Senator is \naddressing.\n  I want to compliment the Senator for looking at this. I know the \nproblems in the State of Washington. Hanford is one of if not the very \nlargest problem areas we have in the way of nuclear cleanup. I have \nbeen involved with that ever since 1985 when we started some of the \nstudies at Fernald in Ohio, some of the difficulties in the nuclear \nweapons plants all over the country and wound up with some 17 different \nsites in 11 different States of which Hanford is one of the most \nimportant sites. It has more problems there for environmental \nrestoration than almost any other site in the country. Many, many, \nbillions of dollars.\n  I would only add since the cleanup effort was mentioned here, when we \nfirst started this back in 1985 and had the first surveys run of all \nthe 17 sites all over the country, it was indicated by the Department \nof Energy that they thought we could probably clean these up at an \nexpenditure of $8 billion to $12 billion.\n  Unfortunately, we have taken a new look at this whole thing. It has \ngone up and up and up, and the current estimate is right around $300 \nbillion over a 20- to 30-year period to do the cleanup that is \nnecessary. And the major place that will need cleanup is in the State \nof Washington at Hanford. I compliment the Senator for looking out for \nthis and would not want to do anything that would mean we would have \nlesser expenditures or anything in that legislation would change the \nagreements that are in existence now between the Federal Government, \nState, and local governments in that area.\n  I think, that we have addressed in this colloquy the concerns that \nthe Senator from Washington had. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for \ntheir responses to these questions and for their obvious concern for \ncontinuing cleanup at the Hanford site in my State. It is, indeed, a \ndeep concern to the people of the State of Washington that we do this. \nWe built this facility, used it for a national purpose, and we want to \nbe assured that it is going to continue to be cleaned up and share your \nconcerns about the costs. But we want to know that we are not going to \nbe at some point unable to continue that cleanup. I appreciate your \nconcerns.\n  I understand the managers are willing to prepare a colloquy for the \nrecord to respond to my questions, to protect cleanup at Hanford. I \nwill be prepared to withdraw this amendment after I speak to my other \namendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would yield myself 1 minute. In \nresponding to my friend from Washington, not only are we neighboring \nStates, but the concerns that the Senator just expressed, again, echo \nmany of the concerns that we in Idaho have.\n  I think on this nuclear issue in the future, nuclear waste, et \ncetera, there ought to be an opportunity for these Senators to begin to \nforge a partnership to deal with this issue. So I would \n[[Page S1522]] look forward to that opportunity because I think we \nunderstand one another.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho, and I \nlook forward to working with the Senator on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, I will continue speaking to my second amendment, I \nwant to be assured as we go through this debate that we will not be \ncreating a big, new, powerful bureaucracy at the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Mr. President, I believe that most of my concerns were \naddressed through the adoption of the Levin amendment and through the \ndefeat of the committee amendment that would have severely curtailed \nthe Budget Committee's role in this process.\n  In order to make sure that all my concerns have been thoroughly \nunderstood, I do want to make a statement now about what those concerns \nare. Mr. President, I am troubled by the fact that S. 1 might give CBO \ntremendous new powers to dictate the Senate's legislative agenda. I \nhave listened very carefully to the debate on this bill and I think it \nis fair to say that we all agree it is our responsibility, our \nresponsibility as legislators, to act carefully as we set policy for \nthe people we represent.\n  I would like to support a bill on unfunded mandates that is \nreasonable and reflects common sense. Mr. President, before the \nadoption of the Levin amendment and several others, this bill went too \nfar. The people of this country should understand exactly what this \nbill does. Everyone of us here in this Chamber, everyone of the people \nin the galleries, everyone watching us on C-Span, and everyone in this \ncountry has to realize that this bill will create a new bureaucracy at \nthe Congressional Budget Office. It will have wide-ranging powers.\n  The staff of that huge new bureaucracy will not be elected by anyone. \nThey will not be accountable to the American taxpayers but they will \nhave enormous power to control this legislative process. They can bring \nSenate debate to a halt on amendments or a bill or even dictate \nlegislative schedule.\n  This vast new power should give everyone of us pause. That is why I \nasked outgoing CBO Director Robert Reischauer about this this morning \nat the hearing in the Budget Committee. Dr. Reischauer is a fair man, a \nfine public servant. So I asked him how this bill will affect the \noperations of CBO. I asked him how the CBO would prioritize requests \nfor cost estimates that will come from the Senate and from the other \nbody. Dr. Reischauer responded that the Congressional Budget Office \nstaff was working ``flat out''--those are his words, not mine--trying \nto fulfill their obligations to the Congress at this point.\n  Dr. Reischauer said that the CBO would need more resources if we \nenact this bill. Then, Mr. President, I repeated my question about \nprioritizing requests. I asked the Director how he would decide which \nmandate to estimate first. His reply, frankly, troubled me. He said the \nCBO would rely on the guidance of the bipartisan leadership of the \nCongress to decide which one to do first. And then he added that the \nCBO has tried that approach with the health care debate last year, and \nit was a failure. That should concern every one of us in this country.\n  Dr. Reischauer's response has raised even more questions in my mind, \nquestions like: If I offer an amendment that does not have a CBO cost \nstatement, what happens?\n  If a point of order is raised against my amendment, is my \nunderstanding correct that the procedure is for the Parliamentarian \nimmediately to seek the advice of the Budget Committee on the cost \nstatement?\n  Am I further correct that the Budget Committee will turn to CBO for \nits advice on the cost estimate?\n  Of particular importance to me is what sort of timeframe is provided \nfor these cost statements?\n  Does the bill provide for any time limits on the Budget Committee and \nCBO's preparation of cost statements?\n  If the bill does not impose any time limits on the Budget Committee \nand, more importantly, CBO, what does the manager envision as \nreasonable time limits for this work?\n  How long does the manager envision the process taking?\n  How long, for example, does the Budget Committee have to get a reply \nfrom CBO?\n  How long does CBO have to reply?\n  More importantly, what happens while the Budget Committee and CBO are \ntrying to prepare a cost statement? Is my amendment laid aside? For how \nlong? Does the Senate keep working on underlying bills? If so, for how \nlong?\n  Mr. President, I want to be able to assure my friends and neighbors \nthat this bill will not take away their voice in setting priorities of \nthe issues this body considers. They do not want unelected bureaucrats \nto determine which bills or which amendments will be brought up on this \nfloor.\n  For example, the people of my State may feel that education reform \nshould be Congress' top priority. But if the CBO analysts over in the \noffice do not work on that bill, if they do not score it, Congress \ncannot consider it. The people of my State or your State, Mr. \nPresident, might want Congress to consider safeguards for school buses \nso they know their kids are safe riding on those buses to school \neveryday. But the bureaucrats at CBO might say, ``Tough, I'm too busy; \nI don't want to score the bill for''--this Senator or that Senator. I \nhave not gotten any guidance on that one.\n  The people of my State want to know that no matter where they go in \nthis country, they do not have to worry about E. coli, but the budget \nbureaucrats can say, ``Sorry, Senator Murray, we don't have time to \nscore that amendment of yours which deals with a public health \nemergency.''\n  I do believe we need reform. I believe Congress should be honest and \nup front with the American taxpayers about the cost of the laws it \npasses. But I do not believe that we should be creating new \nbureaucracies or putting American families in jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the Levin amendment will go far in \naddressing some of the concerns I have raised, but I also hope that we \nare all taking into account this new bureaucracy that will emerge as a \nresult of this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the \npoints raised by the Senator from Washington.\n  In this bill, we provide for additional funds to the Congressional \nBudget Office, knowing that we are giving them more assignments in the \nfuture to carry out.\n  Also, I will point out that the Commission that dealt with the \nstaffing levels of the different committees that was headed by Senator \nDomenici and Senator Mack, at the very outset, we made sure that they \nknew there would be these new requirements on the Congressional Budget \nOffice and, therefore, when they considered cuts across the board, that \nthat is one area we had flagged for them.\n  Also, in determining the amount of money that we included in this \nlegislation, that was done through the Budget Committee in continual \nconsultation with the Congressional Budget Office, so they provided us \nthe funds. That dollar amount came from the Congressional Budget Office \nas to what they felt was necessary in order to accomplish the requests \nand the requirements that we would put on them.\n  I appreciate the concern and the aspect about trying to bring about \ngreat efficiency for Congress, but I am afraid that the amendment \noffered may improve the efficiency, but it would make it much easier \nfor Congress to go ahead and inadvertently impose mandates on States \nand cities.\n  The amendment says that if cost estimates are not available within 1 \nweek for committee bills, the point of order does not lie against the \nbill. In other words, delay for whatever reason by CBO will moot the \nrelief States and cities need from unfunded Federal mandates. If CBO \nneeds time to do a good estimate, then there would be no estimate at \nall.\n  I think in this case it is better to inconvenience Congress than to \nimpose \n[[Page S1523]] mandates on States and cities that taxpayers must pay.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, because the \nchairman of the Budget Committee was here and was going to respond to \nsome of the specifics that the Senator had. He is not here at the \nmoment. So, again, we reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am wondering if the manager will yield \nfor a question. I am afraid it will have to be on his time because I do \nnot know if I can use the time of the Senator from Ohio, relative to \nthis amendment. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention, first of all, that the point of order \napply to amendments that are on the floor that do not have the \nestimate?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I am sorry; will you repeat the question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention that this bill's point of order apply \nto amendments that do not contain the estimates?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. With regard to mandates?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And is it the intention then, for instance, if somebody \noffers an amendment and it has an estimate in it but nobody knew that \namendment was going to be offered, and then somebody wants to come and \noffer a second-degree amendment and then asks the CBO to score that or \nestimate the second-degree amendment, is it the intention of the \nmanager that the Congress, as he put it, be inconvenienced, hold up \nconsideration of the bill until the estimate can be obtained from CBO? \nIs that the intention, that we hold up consideration of the bill until \nan estimate can be obtained from CBO?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to that, the burden of \nproof in this case would be upon the Senator raising the point of \norder. The originator of the amendment is not required to get the CBO \nestimate. I think that it would be good government for anyone bringing \nan amendment that potentially could exceed the $50 million threshold in \nthe public sector and $200 million threshold in the private sector, \nagain, through the budget process. I know that has been the normal \npractice.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I say, if the Senator will yield, there has never been a \npoint of order based on this kind of an estimate, costs on 87,000 \njurisdictions, local governments. There is nothing like this in \nexistence. That is why I phrased my question the way I did.\n  Somebody could offer a first-degree amendment and have an estimate \nbecause he or she knew they were going to offer a first-degree \namendment, but nobody else in the body knew, and now with a first-\ndegree amendment with an estimate being offered, somebody may say, \n``Well, wait a minute; I want to offer a second-degree amendment, and I \nbetter go get an estimate or my second-degree amendment is out of \norder.''\n  I am just wondering whether or not, if a point of order is raised \nwith that second-degree amendment, is it the intention of the managers \nthen that the body hold up consideration of that second-degree \namendment until an estimate could be obtained from the CBO?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the Senator from Idaho has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes \nso I can complete the thought.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. May I suggest we add 10 minutes for debate, 5 on each \nside, in order to clarify this question?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, what I would prefer--and first let me \nask unanimous consent for 2 minutes so we can resolve this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. What I will suggest, because I would like to confer \nwith the chairman of the Budget Committee, if the Senator will provide \nme those questions that she raised, I will be happy to then have a \ncolloquy so we can go into those and deal with it.\n  But what we are doing in S. 1 is not anything new from what we do \nwith appropriations where, if you have a second-degree amendment, you \nhave the Budget Committee staff that is here make a telephone call to \ntry to get an estimate by phone from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So again the process itself is not new that we are suggesting.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no time to yield to myself and comment on that \nother than to simply say that this is a new estimate, the likes of \nwhich has not been made before, involving costs indefinitely into the \nfuture on 87,000 local governments. That is very different from any \nkind of a scoring that the Budget Office has done for a Federal \nexpenditure up to now. I think my friend from Idaho would agree this is \na different kind of estimate than has ever been done by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  I have very serious concerns because I heard my colleague from Idaho, \nthe manager of the bill, say that CBO had, indeed, requested, I \nbelieve, $4.5 million additional to take care of this bill.\n  It is my understanding--I see the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee is in the Chamber; perhaps he can respond--that the \nlegislative branch is going to have to reduce its budget by $200 \nmillion, and here we are telling everybody up front that we are going \nto ask for $4.5 million more for CBO just under a guess estimate of \nwhat this might have in the way of an impact on CBO, and I do think \nthat is an important consideration we need to look at.\n  I appreciate the Senator's response that you would go into a colloquy \nwith me and answer some of the questions raised both by myself and \nSenator Levin. I had intended to withdraw this amendment, but I would \nlike to instead ask the manager--I intend to withdraw my first \namendment--if he would agree to let me lay aside this amendment until \nwe have the responses for my questions.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I have no problem with that.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then to lay aside \namendment No. 188 and unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 187) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as we move forward on the mandates \nlegislation, I would like to read a portion of a newspaper article that \nappeared in the Omaha World Herald on January 24. The headline reads: \n``States Fear Mandates, Expert Says; Balanced Budget Could Mean More,'' \nby David C. Beeder, of the Omaha World Herald Bureau in Washington, DC.\n  The story reads:\n\n       States will not support a constitutional amendment to \n     balance the Federal budget unless it includes a guarantee \n     they won't have to assume more Federal programs, a former \n     assistant attorney general said on Monday.\n\n  Charles Cooper, who practices consitutional law in Washington, said: \n``The States are already groaning under the cost of implementing \nFederal policies.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Cooper, who served in the Justice Department during the \n     Reagan administration, said he supports a balanced budget \n     amendment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that, at the conclusion of my remarks, Mr. \nPresident, the full article be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would simply point out that I am not sure \nthat the States, the Governors or, for that matter, maybe some of the \npeople \n[[Page S1524]] in the United States recognize and realize the difficult \nfinancial circumstances that the Federal Government--that they are a \npart of--is in.\n  I am an original cosponsor and am strongly for passing the mandates \nbill. I have been one of the floor leaders on this piece of \nlegislation. I predict that we will pass this legislation. I will \nprotect the rights of those who wish to offer amendments. I think they \nhave that right under the rules of the Senate, and I will do everything \nI can to protect that.\n  But I would simply say, on a very important bill like this, every \nSenator, regardless of which side of the aisle, should have the right \nto get up and offer amendments as they see fit. Then the body as a \nwhole has to vote as to whether or not that is a good concept.\n  The mandates bill is going to be followed, I suspect, in reasonably \nshort order by some kind of a discussion on the balanced budget \namendment. And they are somewhat tied in. While the States are now \nmoaning and groaning--and I think justifiably so--with regard to so-\ncalled unfunded mandates, unfunded mandates, unfortunately, have taken \non a very big life of their own.\n  The facts of the matter are that many of the States of the Union, \nincluding my State of Nebraska, get more money back from the Federal \nGovernment than the State of Nebraska pays in. The last figures I saw \nare that Nebraska gets back about $1.17 for every $1 that Nebraska \ncitizens pay into the Federal Government in the form of Federal taxes.\n  Now, one could argue, and probably justifiably so, that the total \namount of taxes could be reduced if the Federal Government would go \nback and reduce some of their spending. And I would agree with that. \nThat is what we are about with the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, when and if that becomes a part of our Constitution.\n  I simply am rising, Mr. President, to send a signal very loud and \nvery clear that this is not a one-way street. If we are going to exempt \nthe States and hold them harmless, if we are going to start down the \nlist and begin to exempt a whole lot of other people, then it will make \nit totally ``Mission Impossible'' to ever balance the Federal budget, \nlet alone by the year 2002.\n  Everyone should recognize and realize that, when we get spelled out \nin considerable detail a 7-year budget plan that I think can and should \nbe developed by the Budget Committee and presented to the Senate floor, \nit will be very evident there is going to be a lot of pain and \nsuffering, a lot of disappointments. And I would simply say that, by \nand large, I am not interested in starting down this road of exempting \nthis and exempting that, because I think this is going to be a painful \nenough process.\n  Therefore, I salute those who are bringing up questions about the \nmandates. Those of us who have long supported a constitutional \namendment on the Federal budget recognize and realize that there are \ntwo legitimate points of view. There are those who strongly oppose the \nmandate legislation and there will be even more that will strongly \noppose the follow-on piece of legislation known as the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  I think those who do not agree with this Senator perform a very \nworthwhile service, because, as is usual with most discussion and most \npropositions, there are two sides. All is not white and all is not \nblack or vice versa.\n  With that, Mr. President, I just want to say that there are some \npeople, including Mr. Cooper who I have quoted from this story, who \nsimply do not understand the situation. And when he says he is for a \nbalanced budget amendment so long as the States are protected, then \nthat is a caveat that I think we cannot accept.\n  I still am a strong supporter of the bill before us, but I am pleased \nto see there are some who do not agree with this piece of legislation \nand have pointed out some shortcomings with this legislation. They are \nproviding a great public service. I suspect that there have been few, \nif any, bills that we have ever passed in the U.S. Senate, regardless \nof how well-sounding they are, that are perfect legislation. The \nmandate legislation is not perfect legislation. It will not cure all of \nour ills.\n  When and if we pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nby the year 2002, and if that is ratified by 75 percent of the States, \nthat is not going to cure all of our problems. The devil is definitely \ngoing to be in the details when we get down to such matters as a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n                            [Exhibit No. 1]\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald, Jan. 24, 1995]\n\n                   States Fear Mandates, Expert Says\n\n                          (By David C.

Connie Mack, R-Fla, said Dellinger's arguments were \n     not ``of such magnitude that we should not move forward'' \n     with an amendment that would require a balanced budget by \n     2002 and a three-fifths vote to increase taxes.\n       Mack said he would recommend enforcement of the balanced \n     budget amendment by a spending-reduction commission \n     resembling a presidential commission that decided on military \n     base closing two years ago.\n       If Congress did not balance the federal budget by 2002, as \n     required by the amendment, the commission would recommend \n     spending reductions to meet the requirement.

Mr. President, I note that there is no other Senator \nseeking recognition at the moment. I would like to comment briefly \nabout the President's State of the Union speech last night.\n  I thought that the President received the most applause of the \nevening when he talked about reducing the size of Government. And I \nthink if there is one message which has come out of last November's \nelection it is that the people of the United States want to reduce the \nsize of the Federal Government. That is right in line with the pending \nlegislation which refers to eliminating unfunded mandates so that if \nthe Federal Government has legislation which the Congress wants to pass \nand that it represents a worthy Federal objective, let the Federal \nGovernment pay for it. Let us not keep putting one after another \nrequirements on the States for the States to pay for what we decide \nwhat we want them to do. That, of course, is in accordance with the \nbasic principle of federalism that we should have a central Government \nof limited powers.\n  When the President read that line in his speech last night about \nsmaller Government there seemed to be the greatest unanimity in the \nChamber than there was on any other point.\n   [[Page S1525]] A number of things that the President had to say I \nthought hard to achieve. I believe it will be very difficult when he \ntalks about a tax cut which is obviously, very, very popular, to do so \nin the context of still cutting the deficit and in the context of \nincreasing other governmental expenditures, as, for example, the \ndefense budget. I believe that the defense budget is now too lean. I \nwould like to see a tax cut. But I am not prepared to enter into the \ncompetitive bidding on a tax cut if it will mean adding to the deficit. \nThe way we are looking at this budget, realistically when we talk about \na middle-income tax cut and we figure how much it is on a per person \nbasis, that it is more important to avoid increasing the deficit in the \nUnited States today.\n  I was a little more than surprised when the President talked about \nthe North Korean agreement and talked about continuous inspections. \nThat is not the agreement that I have read. The agreement that I have \nread puts a 5-year moratorium on inspections on spent fuel rods, which \nis the best way for determining whether there is the development of \nnuclear weapons by North Korea. I have grave reservations about that \nagreement as to its substance, and that line particularly, and also the \nway it has been adopted.\n  As I read that agreement it has all the indications of a treaty, and \nunder the Constitution the treaty has to be ratified by the U.S. \nSenate. There have been a number of concerns raised in a number of \nquarters but so far it is an executive agreement and it has very, very \nprofound implications for the United States. Now only $4 billion is \ninvolved and the United States is the guarantor of that, but the \nmoratorium on inspections, I think, poses very, very substantial risks.\n  When we had hearings in the Intelligence Committee, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, a committee which I Chair, I was very concerned \nwhen the intelligence officials could not give any assurances or any \nreal ideas as to how long it might be before North Korea would have \nsufficient ballistic capability to reach the continent of the United \nStates. In the course of that hearing, it was disclosed that North \nKorea could now reach Alaska. It was disclosed further that North Korea \nand Iran are working jointly on testing ballistic missiles.\n  I was very much concerned, Mr. President, about the very limited \nattention given in the President's very long speech, very limited \nattention given to foreign policy. He spoke for 1 hour and 21 minutes, \nwhich some may have considered a little long. A little easier when you \nare watching C-SPAN 2 or watching the national networks. You have \ngreater control over the length of speakers. You have the ``off'' \nbutton. Perhaps many people are using it now on C-SPAN 2 as I make \nthese few comments. The paucity, the scarcity of comments about foreign \npolicy I thought was revealing and rather indicative of the lack of \nexperience, lack of capability, and, perhaps, lack of interest that is \ncoming out of the administration on this very important issue.\n  I think in toto, Mr. President, the most telling aspect of the speech \nlast night was the partisanship in the Chamber. That was the 15th State \nof the Union speech that I ever heard. I have not seen so much \npartisanship with one side clapping virtually at every sentence and the \nother side in stony silence on so many of the ideas which were \nadvanced. When I sense that kind of partisanship, it looks to me like \nwe are going to be in for a very tough year. I am hopeful that we will \nbe able to put aside partisanship and really move toward centralism \nwith both parties in addressing the really tremendous problems which \nconfront the people of this country: crime control, nuclear \nproliferation, health care reform, just some of the problems which we \nhave to address in the national interest.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1524-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1525-S1531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 198\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate considers amendment numbered 198, that there be 20 minutes for \ndebate to be equally divided in the usual form, that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order, and that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time, the Senate vote on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank both my friend from Idaho and the \nSenator from Michigan for their cooperation on this amendment. I \nbelieve it is an important amendment. I talked about it at length \nyesterday, Mr. President, and I know there is significant pending \nbusiness before the Senate. I believe we now still have about 30 more \namendments to consider, so I would be more than happy to yield back the \nbalance of my time if that is acceptable to both managers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to request if the Senator from \nMichigan or the Senator from Idaho have any further discussion on this \namendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from Arizona would \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. A question has arisen as to whether the words ``any \nlegislative provision'' on line 7 of his amendment are intended to \nmean, in effect, authorizing language.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It clearly means any authorizing language.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona. My understanding is that \nthe manager on this side supports the amendment. I understand that \nSenator Byrd is supportive of the amendment, and I would be happy to \nyield back any time that I might control.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment, No. 198, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his efforts and his diligence in that. I think it is a \nparticularly important amendment that he has offered. I appreciate the \nmanager on the other side of the aisle and his support on this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on Monday night I had a lengthy colloquy \nwith the managers, the principal sponsors of the bill, the Senators \nfrom Idaho and Ohio. A number of important questions were left \nunanswered. In some cases, the answers were conflicted. Those questions \nconcern issues that are central to the way this bill will work. They \nneed to be answered, I believe, before we conclude our work on this \nlegislation.\n  These are the questions which I have, and I have given a copy of \nthese questions to my friend from Idaho. I want to read them, put them \nin the Record, in effect, and ask they be answered by tomorrow at some \npoint. I am not seeking an answer, one-by-one at this point, because \nthey take some time, I would think, to attempt to answer, if, in fact, \nthey can be answered.\n  Here are the ones that we had left outstanding. First, the effective \ndate of the mandates. When is a mandate effective? That is an \nabsolutely critical issue because that date sets off a 5-year time \nperiod and if during any one of those 5 years there is an estimate that \nthe cost of the mandate is over $50 million, certain very significant \nthings are triggered.\n  So it is critical to know when is a mandate effective, and we had a \nlong discussion on that on Monday night with a chart.\n  If that is determined on a case-by-case basis, then who makes that \ndecision and when is that decision made?\n  The second group of questions relates to the question of whether an \nestimate can be given in the form of a range; could an estimate be that \nthat will cost from $20 million to $80 million a year, or any other \nrange? And here the questions are as follows:\n  Can the CBO estimate be in the form of a range?\n   [[Page S1526]] Can it be in the form of a range for the purpose of \nthe threshold?\n  Can it be in the form of a range for purposes of the total cost \nestimate?\n  If the CBO reports a range, what is the ``specific dollar amount'' \nfor purposes of the point of order? And who makes that decision?\n  Then there are a series of questions that relate to amendments and \ntheir coverage under this bill.\n  First, are the direct costs of an amendment, added to a bill in \ncommittee, to be included in the estimate of direct costs of the bill \nas reported?\n  What if the Senate rejects the committee amendment? For instance, let \nus say a bill is estimated to cost $30 million a year for each of the 5 \nfiscal years, so it is not over the threshold. But there is a committee \namendment that has been adopted in committee that adds another $30 \nmillion a year to the bill.\n  If the $30 million committee amendment is added to the $30 million \ncost to the bill that was taken up by committee, that would put it over \nthe $50 million and breach the threshold and the bill would not be in \norder to even be considered by the Senate. But is the committee \namendment cost to be included in the cost of the bill before it is \nadopted by the Senate? It is technically not part of the bill until the \nSenate adopts it, even though the committee has adopted it.\n  If it is included in the bill, what happens if the Senate rejects the \ncommittee amendment?\n  Is an amendment offered on the floor subject to a point of order \nbased on the estimate of direct costs of the amendment alone, or the \namendment if added to the bill?\n  Is an amendment offered on the floor out of order if it does not have \na CBO estimate of direct cost?\n  Then there are some questions relating to the exclusions:\n  Who will decide whether a bill is subject to one of the exclusions? \nWe have a number of exclusions here and there are always going to be \nquestions of interpretation as to whether or not an exclusion applies.\n  Who will decide that?\n  What will specifically be required to meet the terms of the bill with \nrespect to a finding of emergency?\n  And then the final set of questions relates to the length of the \nestimate, and here, rather than addressing the problem through a series \nof questions, I will be seeking consideration tonight of one of my \namendments which would place a time limit on the estimate.\n  I have given a copy of a modification to my amendment to the majority \nmanager. I do not know if they have had a chance to look at the \nmodification yet. But I will seek to get that issue resolved by a \nmodified amendment.\n  The issue here is a kind of fundamental one. Once that threshold is \nbreached, then you have to have an estimate of the direct costs of the \nbill or the amendment to State and local governments for as long as \nthere are costs. Unless there is a sunset provision in that \nauthorization bill, those costs have no time limit.\n  Then the CBO would be in the position of trying to estimate cost to \nState and local governments for decades, 50 years, 100 years. It is an \nimpossible burden which will raise even greater questions about the \naccuracy of the estimate. An awful lot rides on these estimates. The \nlife or death of a bill or amendment may ride on the estimate.\n  So I will be offering an amendment in this area to put a limit of 10 \nyears on that estimate so we can get something, hopefully, a little \nmore practical from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  But those are the questions which I would appreciate having answers \nto tomorrow. They go right to the question of whether this is a \nworkable piece of legislation. Its goals are very admirable. I \nsupported its predecessor. There is a whole new point of order that has \nbeen added this year which is going to create a real different \nsituation on the floor relative to bills and amendments, and we have to \nthink through this process in advance.\n  We are putting tremendous burdens on the CBO to suggest that they are \ngoing to be able to come up with estimates in a matter of hours, \nperhaps minutes, on amendments, and some people say, ``Well, if you \nknow you are going to offer an amendment, get it to the CBO a day \nbefore, 2 days before, 2 weeks before.'' Of course, some of these \nestimates can take months.\n  But there is also an answer to that, and that is that, in many cases, \nwe do not know and cannot know that we are going to offer an amendment \nbecause an amendment could be a second-degree amendment. We are not all \nprivy to everybody's first-degree amendments around here. We do not \nhave amendments printed in advance. I would like to see a rule, by the \nway, which would require amendments to be printed in advance, but we do \nnot have any such rule.\n  So you do not know who is going to call up an unprinted, unfiled \namendment to a bill. Somebody can call one up without previous notice, \nand then, if you want to offer a second-degree amendment, in order for \nit to be in order, you have to have an estimate from the CBO.\n  Now, what do we do? Do we hold up the processing of the whole U.S. \nSenate while the CBO tries to estimate the costs forever, maybe, on \n87,000 jurisdictions? We have to work through this in advance. It is a \ncomplicated issue and, again, when we had last year's bill, we did not \nhave that final point of order that had such an appropriations impact \nembedded in it, as we do in this year's bill.\n  So if the estimate was wrong last year, it did not have serious \nconsequences. It had consequences; the bill would be subject to a point \nof order if it did not have the estimate. But it did not have this \nadditional point of order with this appropriations aspect to it that \nthis year's bill has.\n  So, Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will offer, when the \nmajority is ready, this amendment putting a 10-year time limit on the \nestimate of the CBO because I think that is a relatively practical \nlength of time for which we can get an estimate.\n  The modification that I will seek unanimous consent for on this is \nthat the 10-year limit on the estimate apply to both the private sector \nestimate as well as the public sector estimate. I believe the way my \namendment was written and filed, it only applied to the public sector \nestimate. We should seek practicality and workability for both the \nprivate and public sector estimates.\n  I did not mean to rush the manager on the majority side. I know they \nmay not have had a chance yet to look at this, but whenever he is \nready, I am ready to offer this amendment.\n  Again, I also appreciate his engaging in these colloquies on this \nbill. He is performing a very important function by trying to clarify \nthe legislative intent, and the questions which I have read and which I \nwill now submit to the desk are questions which I would appreciate your \nattempting to answer by tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the spirit in which the \nSenator from Michigan has provided these questions, and I appreciate \nthe fact he is not requiring an immediate response. I always \nappreciated take-home exams instead of pop quizzes, but I will be happy \nto provide the answers, to the extent I am capable, sometime tomorrow. \nI appreciate his effort as we work through this bill.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Iowa is here and will be \ncalling up his amendment. I would like to inquire, I believe on the \nprevious unanimous-consent agreement, we had a time agreement of 30 \nminutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. And that no second-degree amendments were in order; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield just for one moment, for a \nparliamentary inquiry? Is there a unanimous-consent agreement in effect \non the Grassley amendment? Is there a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there a unanimous-consent agreement indicating when the \nGrassley amendment will be called up?\n   [[Page S1527]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n  Mr. LEVIN. At that point, I would note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, some of the Members are inquiring about the \nschedule for this evening. It is slow, I can tell you that. We are not \nmaking any progress. On the 11th day on this bill, we have had only \nthree votes. Two votes. It is worse than I thought.\n  Now, if this is not delay, I do not know what delay is. So we are \ngoing to be here a long time tonight, I am fearful. There will not be \nany window. We are going to vote as the amendments come up. We just \nhave to stay here and do it.\n  I regret that I cannot accommodate some of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. We are spending 90 minutes on immigration \namendments. A lot of things have nothing to do with this bill at all. \nAnything anybody can think of has been offered as an amendment--Social \nSecurity amendment having to do with a balanced budget. We have to \ndebate that again on this bill.\n  I have about reached the point where we will either file cloture \ntonight or start tabling these amendments unless they are offered and \nyou have limited debate. We do not need 40, 50, 60 minutes on some of \nthese amendments or rollcall votes on some of these amendments.\n  So I must say that I do not know any other alternative. If somebody \nstands back here and banters back and forth for a day, that is not my \nidea of progress. Eleven days ought to be enough. We could have \nfinished this bill in 4 or 5 days.\n  We will finish the bill this week. If it takes until 10 o'clock \ntonight, 11 o'clock tomorrow night, and 11 o'clock the next night, we \nwill finish the bill this week. But we may file cloture in the meantime \nif we continue. We may do that this evening. We have been all day long. \nNow it is dark outside. People want to be home with their families, so \nwe are going to start voting at 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 o'clock.\n  So I hope my colleagues will accommodate us--not the leader; I will \nbe here in any event, but accommodate our other colleagues who would \nlike to be home with their children and families. But we have not \naccomplished much today.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I can appreciate the wishes of the majority \nleader to move this through, but I would submit that we have disposed \nof about 12 amendments today.\n  If I could address the majority leader just a moment, we have \ndisposed of about 12 amendments today. We have worked with them. They \nhave gotten some withdrawn. We have some we have gotten agreement on, \nand I thought we had been making very good progress today. We are \nmoving right along on this. I had hoped we would be able to--I think we \nare making a great deal of progress.\n  Mr. DOLE. How many amendments remaining?\n  Mr. GLENN. I do not know how many are remaining. I do not know \nexactly. We have disposed of about 11 or 12 today. Not all of them had \nvotes on them. They either were withdrawn or we had some agreement on \nthem or they were accepted.\n  Mr. DOLE. We had 39 yesterday, and now we have 34 so I do not know--\nunless there are some that have not been properly cataloged on our side \nthat have been disposed of. But we still have 34 amendments after 11 \ndays on a bill. We were told last week that there were maybe 30 \namendments. Then we got up to 67, and 49, and now we are down to 34, 3 \ndays later. So if that is progress, it is very slow progress. But, \nagain, it is up to our colleagues. If they want to spend Saturday here, \nthat is fine with me.\n  Mr. GLENN. The procedures by which this bill was brought to the \nfloor, I would submit, are ones that engendered a lot of amendments. We \nare still trying to work out some of the things we normally would have \ntaken care of in committee had we been permitted to do so. We were not \npermitted to do any of the amendments in committee. It was sent back to \nthe floor. Had we been able to do that, I think we would have saved an \nawful lot of trouble and saved much of that 11 days we have been out \nhere in the Chamber, whatever it is now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. GLENN. I withhold.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will yield the floor if the manager \nwants it. I reserve my right to get the floor back after he is \ncompleted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 207, as modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I presented yesterday an amendment of \nmine. It has been modified, and I would like to send it to the desk and \nask unanimous consent that the modification be made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield for a question, please?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, Mr. President, I will yield.\n  Mr. GLENN. The modified language of his amendment, I do not believe \nwe have a copy of that. Does the Senator have a copy he can give us so \nwe will know?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We sure do. Just so the Senator knows I am not pulling \na fast one, it has been well known about what we are doing and we will \nget the Senator a copy so he can be sure of that.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the Senator restate the unanimous-consent request, \nplease. Was there a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. Mr. President, the unanimous-consent request I \nmade is for the modification according to the changes that have been \nmade at the request of various staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. I have no objection. I believe the Senator can modify his \namendment anyway, can he not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It requires unanimous consent under the \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. GLENN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 32, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . COST OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that Federal agencies should review and evaluate planned \n     regulations to ensure that the costs of Federal regulations \n     are within the cost estimates provided by the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n       (b) Statement of Cost.--At the written request of any \n     Senator, the Director shall, to the extent practicable, \n     prepare--\n       (1) an estimate of the costs of regulations implementing an \n     Act containing a Federal mandate covered by section 408 of \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, \n     as added by section 101(a) of this Act; and\n       (2) a comparison of the costs of such regulations with the \n     cost estimate provided for such Act by the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n       (c) Cooperation of Office of Management and Budget.--At the \n     request of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     provide data and cost estimates for regulations implementing \n     an Act containing a Federal mandate covered by section 408 of \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, \n     as added by section 101(a) of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I indicated yesterday, Senator Snowe \nis working with me on this approach.\n  This very simply expresses the sense of the Congress that Federal \nagencies should review and should evaluate planned regulations to \nensure the costs of Federal regulations are within the cost estimates \nthat are provided for the statute by the Congressional Budget Office.\n   [[Page S1528]] Then there is a second part that is not a sense of \nthe Senate. The second part would allow any Senator to request that CBO \nprovide an estimate of the cost of regulations and compare them with \nthe cost estimates provided by CBO as required for the statute that we \nare passing under S. 1.\n  This is just a commonsense amendment that when agencies implement a \nFederal mandate they should take steps and make a good-faith effort to \nkeep regulatory costs within the CBO estimates called for under S. 1. \nWe do not want to pass legislation, in Congress, thinking when we pass \nthe legislation that it might only be a $1 billion unfunded mandate and \nthen, after several months have passed--in some cases I suppose years \ncould pass--the agency unnecessarily implements regulations that would \nraise that cost, something above the $1 billion estimate?\n  I hope we could all agree to this amendment. I know at least on our \nside of the aisle, after discussing it with our distinguished floor \nmanager, Senator Kempthorne, he had some concerns about it. I think the \nmodifications will satisfy his concerns.\n  I think it ought to be stated as well that CBO has no problem with \nthe costs of carrying this out. And from that standpoint, this is \nlanguage similar to what was in the amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan [Mr. Levin] when he called up a previous amendment he got \nadopted, calling for a report at the instigation of any particular \nSenator.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield such time as he might need to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nIowa is proposing here. To me it seems like a very reasonable request, \nso again I thank him for his diligence. I will be supporting this \namendment. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following the next rollcall vote the Senate proceed to vote \non a resolution expressing our condolences to the nation of Japan, and \nI ask it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry, whose resolution is this?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it is a Dole-Daschle-Bingaman \nbipartisan resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is relative to Japan?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Iowa, the agencies are \nalready under strictures that come under the President's Executive \norder to examine costs and benefits before issuing regulations. It \nseems to me that should really be the test for any regulation--do the \nbenefits outweigh the costs? If they do, the regulations should go \nforward. If not, the regulations should be killed.\n  It seems to me the proposed Grassley amendment adds another stricture \nwithout taking benefits into account. If a benefit far outweighs a \ncost, why should the CBO cost estimate become a ceiling?\n  In other words, what we are doing here is saying CBO--as I understand \nit--CBO is to make an estimate of the cost. Then once that cost \nestimate is made, which at best is an estimate, then the cost of \nimplementing whatever the proposal is could not exceed the CBO cost, no \nmatter what? Is that the intent of the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will be glad to attempt to answer. I \nam not sure I can, because I am not sure I understand the question of \nthe Senator. But implicit in his question, I believe, is a feeling that \nthe purpose of my amendment is to stop the regulation from going into \neffect. That is not the purpose of the amendment. There is nothing in \nthe wording of the amendment that does that.\n  The purpose of the amendment is that if we pass a statute in the year \n1996, and CBO says it is going to cost $1 billion, and then 2 years \nlater--it takes a long time to get these regulations written--2 years \nlater the agency might issue regulations that cost something more.\n  My amendment does not make CBO study that, except at the request of a \nSenator. But if I would decide, looking at department X's regulations, \nit looks to me like these are a lot more expensive in unfunded mandates \nthan what we anticipated when we pass the legislation, I want CBO to \ntake a look at those regulations.\n  CBO takes a look at those regulations and they might say, no, this is \nnot over the $1 billion; or they might say it is $2 billion, it is \ngoing to make this statute cost $2 billion instead of $1 billion. My \namendment will not in any way keep those regulations from going into \neffect. But I surely think we ought to have a track record by which we \ncan measure whether or not an original estimate and intent of statute \nis realized. And if it is not, then at least we know that and it is a \nmatter of public record.\n  The other thing that might come as a benefit of my regulation is that \nthe regulation writers, if somebody might ask for a review, may be just \na little more careful to stay within the cost intent of the statute. I \nthink that is legitimate. I think if we write a statute that we think \nis going to be an unfunded mandate costing $1 billion, we should not \nallow some faceless bureaucrat to write regulations that make it cost \nmuch more and not be in keeping with congressional intent. That is all \nI am trying to do. I hope I have answered the Senator's question.\n  Mr. GLENN. I would have another question I would like to ask, too. \nThat is, it says, ``an estimate of the costs of regulations \nimplementing an Act containing a Federal mandate covered by section 408 \nof the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as \nadded by section 101(a) of this Act''--and then goes on, ``a comparison \nof the costs of such regulations with the cost estimate provide for \nsuch Act by the Congressional Budget Office.''\n  Would this mean that these would all be still prospective? Or does \nthis mean that, because we go back and reference the Congressional \nBudget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, that the CBO would be \nexpected upon written request to go back and estimate mandates and how \nthey worked out compared with CBO estimates, clear back over the last \n21 years?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. It is a very good question. And the \nanswer is it is prospective, and it just covers whatever S. 1 covers.\n  Mr. GLENN. I have a further question. Would the Senator be willing to \nhave the benefits and costs evaluated at the same time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No.\n  Mr. GLENN. The President's Executive order, I would say, covers that \nand I think that is a necessary part of this thing, to consider the \nbenefits as well as just the costs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I see the cost-benefit analysis as a \nvery worthwhile procedure. I think I supported that. I have not had a \nchance to vote on it in past Congresses. But I support the concept. I \nthink, as the Senator said, the concept is to end the rulemaking \nprocess. I happen to think that is not a very effective process that we \ngo through. I think it is not refined well enough. I do not think there \nis a bureaucratic inclination to abide by it in good faith. I support \nthat concept, but I do not think it has any relationship to what I am \ntrying to accomplish by my amendment.\n  It is a worthy goal the Senator suggests, but it is a little more. I \nbelieve it is much more in depth and serves a whole different purpose \nthan what I am trying to serve by my amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, if I might add another question in part A, \nsense of the Congress, it is the sense of the Congress that the Federal \nagency should review and evaluate planned regulations. And then the \nnext part is \n[[Page S1529]] to ensure that the costs of Federal regulations are \nwithin the cost estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  It seems to me that sets a ceiling beyond which you could not go. The \nCBO is at best making estimates. I do not see how you can say that the \nagency, trying to implement something that may be very involved, should \nbe limited to no more than the estimate of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I do not know whether that was the intent or not.\n  What we would be doing is saying with the legislation we pass, we are \nin effect passing our legislative responsibilities on to the CBO and \nsaying whatever they come up with is the absolute ceiling, when they \nare required on a rapid basis to give us their best estimates. That \ndoes not mean when it gets over to the agency, they get it in more \ndetail. It might exceed a little; it might go under some. But I think \nto make CBO the final authority on what the ceiling will be, with their \nrapidly arrived-at estimate of costs, I just do not see how that would \nwork.\n  Was not the intent to make the estimate of the Congressional Budget \nOffice a ceiling that could not be exceeded in the executive branch \nwhen they try to implement the law that we just passed, or implement a \nmandate?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I answer this question, there is \none further response I want to give to the Senator on his question \nabout the cost benefit. A more explicit answer to the question is, as I \nsaid, we only want to do what S. 1 does, and S. 1 deals just with cost.\n  On the point that the Senator from Ohio just made, there is not a \nreal solid answer I can give because of the very basis of my language \nbeing sense of the Senate. I think sense of the Senate implies, first \nof all, that the bureaucrats and regulation writers do a good-faith \neffort to be within the congressional intent of whatever the ceiling is \nof the unfunded mandate.\n  Second, sense of the Senate is not binding because it is only sense \nof the Senate. It is not statute. I would feel that the Congressional \nBudget Office, in making this estimate, could do no more under my \namendment than just simply say in a quantifiable way that the agency \ncost will be so much. That could be higher or lower. The extent to \nwhich it is higher, their statement that it is higher in no way, under \nthe statute or under the intent of my amendment, is going to keep the \nregulation from going into effect.\n  If I could be perfectly candid with the Senator from Ohio, I think if \nunfunded mandates legislation is going to mean anything, eventually you \nhave to get to that point where the regulation writers are within the \nintent of Congress on what the cost is, or else we do not have a very \neffective statute. But I cannot do that now. I do not know whether now \nis the time to do that because this legislation is a pioneering piece \nof legislation. So we ought to feel our way along to that point. I \nthink my sense of the Senate ought to be looked at as giving Congress \nsome additional tools down the road, a track record by which we can \nmake better judgments if this statute needs to be refined.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the Senator treats sense of the Senate just \na little more lightly than I think a sense of the Senate should be \ntreated in this regard. Legislative history is made here on the floor, \nand we talk about sense of the Senate and all the other things that go \non in debate. All of these things give the regulation writers the sense \nof the Senate as to where we want to go. They follow this. They are \nsupposed to follow it.\n  This is used in its entirety, of course, and sense of the Senate is \nnot as binding as regular legislation. But we are telling the agency \nthat the agencies should review and evaluate planned regulations, not \njust to think about it. We are saying to ensure that the costs are \nwithin the cost estimates provided by CBO.\n  That is a mighty potent statement, it seems to me. If we are saying \nit is sense of the Congress, but we really do not mean that, and you \npeople over there just go ahead and do what you think ought to be done, \nthen that is a different thing. But what we are saying is we are \ntelling them it is our sense of the Senate and the Congress to ensure \nthat they stay within the CBO estimate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. Certainly.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this would require further modification. \nBut first of all, before I suggest something, I do not want it to be \nsuggested that I think my amendment does more or is intended to do more \nthan what I said I wanted it to do. I did not doctor up the sense-of-\nthe-Senate language because I do not know how much weaker you can get \nin any statement of public policy that this body makes in sense-of-the-\nSenate language. Maybe the Senator from Ohio puts it on a higher plane \nthan I do. But I do not think it deserves such a high plane.\n  So I did not think about adjusting it any, because I do not think you \ncan be much weaker than a sense of the Senate. But if it would help the \nSenator, we could put in the same words that we put in the second part \nof the amendment, and say ``to the extent practicable.''\n  Mr. GLENN. I am not exactly sure how that would change it that much, \nMr. President. I think when you are trying to direct them to ensure \nthat whatever they do with regard to rules and regulations will not go \nbeyond the Congressional Budget Office estimate, no matter what we \npassed on the floor here, and how many amendments we had, and all the \nother provisions we may have put on the floor, we are in effect going \nback to CBO and saying: You are the legislating authority on this \nbecause your estimate that you gave us, that might be very sketchy, \narrived at in a few hours at best, we are saying that becomes the \ndefinitive figure on this thing as far as guidance for the Federal \nagencies goes, and we want to ensure that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to save some of my time, so I do not want to \nyield. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. GLENN. I am sorry we did not know the time here. That is my \nfault. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin be granted an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then I want 5 minutes on this side.\n  Mr. GLENN. We have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, may I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, again, I did not make my suggestion very \nclear to the Senator from Ohio because he kept concentrating on the \nword ``ensured.'' We could eliminate ``ensured'' and put in there ``to \nthe extent practicable'' and that may solve the problem. I do not want \nto do that unless it will solve the problem because I think this is \nabout as weak as you can get.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the trouble with this sense-of-the-Senate \nlanguage is that it delegates the legislative responsibility to the \nCongressional Budget Office. This is what the Senator from Ohio was \nalerting us to in his last couple of minutes.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, if we are lucky, is going to be able \nto make an estimate of what the cost will be to 87,000 State and local \ngovernments for some period, which could last forever, the way the bill \nis currently worded. But it is going to be decades into the future. \nThese are, at best, going to be guesstimates. We have example after \nexample that they have told us where they cannot make a good estimate. \nThese are not scientific statements of costs; these are guesstimates \nthat are going to be coming out of the CBO. We cannot take that \nguesstimate and say that it is the sense of the Senate that the agency \nshould ensure that a regulation complies with that guesstimate instead \nof law.\n  Let us say we pass a law that says airports must introduce security \ndevices that will pick up levels of metal down to a certain amount. We \nare doing that for the safety of the passengers of the United States, \nthe American citizens that walk through metal detectors and get on \nairplanes want to \n[[Page S1530]] feel safe. We pass a law that says you must get down to \na certain level of detection in these metal detectors. That is the law. \nWe have adopted that law. Now we get an estimate. The CBO gets us an \nestimate as to how much that is going to cost State and local \ngovernment. Their estimate comes out that it is going to cost $50 \nmillion for all these jurisdictions in one of those years. We have \nwritten a law saying you have to do something for the safety of the \nAmerican people, but we have a CBO guesstimate over there that says $50 \nmillion.\n  It turns out, down the road, that when those detectors are put in, \nthey are going to cost more than $50 million. Are we going to say \ntonight that we want the agency to abide by the estimate of the CBO \ninstead of our law? Are we putting a CBO guesstimate on a pedestal so \nthat it will take precedence over what we have said is essential for \nthe safety of the American people? Is that our intent? It is not my \nintent. I am not going to put that guesstimate on a pedestal. I am \ntroubled about the ambiguities of these guesstimates.\n  We surely do not want that guesstimate of the unelected CBO, for some \nperiod out in the future, to supersede the elected representative of \nthe people of the United States. If we say the law is that there must \nbe metal detectors that can capture metal or other material down to a \ncertain level, that is our intent. And we have a guesstimate that says \nit is going to cost a certain amount in a certain year, OK, that will \ngive us some guidance. But do not give that precedence over what our \ndecision is as to what the law should be, because you are just \ndelegating to the CBO what we as elected officials are responsible to \ndo.\n  That is one of the difficulties with my friend's amendment. When he \nsays that agencies should evaluate planned regulations to ensure--the \nkey word is ``ensure''--that they are within cost estimates in the \nbudget office, he is just giving the legislative authority away to the \nbudget office and saying, yes, we want those metal detectors to capture \na certain level of metal, but we are not really saying that. So I would \nsuggest that we let the staff try to work out some language here. I \nthink I know what the Senator is driving at. I think this language goes \ntoo far. I suggest that his staff and the staff of Senator Glenn, and \nperhaps mine, and any other interested Senator, might get together to \nwork out language to avoid the result that this could otherwise lead \nto.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, the Senator from Michigan \nwants us to believe that the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is going to \nbind every regulator who is working under the constitutional authority \nof the President--that they will not perform their responsibilities; \nthat a sense-of-the-Senate resolution will somehow amend the \nConstitution, take away statutory authority of the bureaucrat. No \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment can or will do that or ever has done \nthat.\n  The other point is that Congress does not turn anything over to the \nCongressional Budget Office through this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. This is our decision to make. There is no regulation that \nin any way can be stalled by either part of my amendment. It is not \nintended to do that. For the Senator from Michigan, it is not intended \nto take, nor will it take away any statutory responsibilities or \nconstitutional responsibilities of any employee or officer of the \nexecutive branch.\n  I am always willing to work something out, but I think we have \nreached a point where yesterday and today we have tried to work out \nthings in this area. One of the very concerns that the Senator from \nMichigan had previously with my amendment, in some of the discussions \nbefore, was the extent to which CBO could do this within their budget. \nFrom that standpoint, the Senator from Michigan just got an amendment \nadopted by this body that, within the same budget limitation of the \nCBO, asked them to do exactly what I am doing with my amendment.\n  So I think it is a little bit wrong for the Senator from Michigan to \ncome here and say that I am asking too much of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, or that a sense-of-the-Senate resolution will reduce the \nstatutory responsibilities or the congressional responsibilities of any \nperson within the executive branch.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I have not \nobjected to your part B which relates to the statement of cost of the \nCongressional Budget Office. I have not raised an objection.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think it is because we have satisfied you with our \nchanges in our language.\n  Mr. LEVIN. For whatever reason, I have not objected to the Senator's \namendment as it relates to the additional duty of the CBO.\n  Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I stand corrected from the standpoint that that may \nhave referred to the entire language of the bill.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under your language, it is the sense of the Congress that \nthe Federal agency should do something to ensure something, and I want \nto give the Senator a hypothetical.\n  Assume that the estimate of the CBO was that the metal detector would \ncost $50 million. But the way the agency reads our law requiring them \nto get these new metal detectors installed to protect the American \npeople, it turns out that those metal detectors required by our law \nwill cost $75 million. Should the agency ensure the $50 million in that \nevent, even though they read our law to require metal detectors which \nas it turns out a couple years down the road will cost $75 million? Or \nis it your sense that they should go with the cheaper $50 million metal \ndetector, which will not do the job, because that was the CBO estimate? \nOr is it the Senators intention that they comply with our law because \nthe better metal detector will be better?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think it is a relatively easy question to answer. \nFirst of all, S. 1, as far as the unfunded mandates are concerned, the \nstatutory authority that the regulator has to fulfill their \nresponsibilities to protect the public is binding. That is not the \nsense of the Senate. But I am not saying that because I want to bring \nless significance to my sense of the Senate. I am saying that because \nthat is the role--that is the place of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions \nin policymaking in our constitutional system of Government.\n  The regulator would go ahead and put in the more expensive product to \nprotect the public. But, if I, Senator Grassley, 6 months later said, \n``Well, you know, I have some doubts about this. Is it within the \ncost?'' I ask the CBO to study what the cost is. Let us suppose CBO \ncomes up with the fact that it is over the unfunded mandate estimate.\n  That is a quantifiable fact that does not affect the decision of the \nregulators. And that is the intent. But, to be perfectly candid to both \nof my colleagues who have spoken in opposition to this, I would expect \nmaybe at reauthorization time that that fact could be a basis for maybe \ntightening up some of the statutes so that regulations cannot \ncircumvent the original intent of the statute.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And the other side has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the \nRepublican manager of the bill. Is it the Senator's desire, then, if I \nwould yield back my time, that we would immediately go to a vote on my \namendment?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that would be my intent.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n   [[Page S1531]] Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that, with respect to the Lautenberg amendment numbered 199, \nthere be 40 minutes of debate prior to the motion to table, to be \ndivided in the usual form; and that, upon the expiration or yielding \nback of time, the majority manager or his designee be recognized to \nmake a motion to table. I also ask unanimous consent that there be no \nsecond degree amendments in order to the Lautenberg amendment prior to \nthe motion to table the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 207, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have been able to arrive at some \nlanguage that satisfies myself and satisfies the Democratic side of the \naisle. Pursuant to that, I will have to ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be modified as written on this paper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 32, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . COST OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that Federal agencies should review and evaluate planned \n     regulations to ensure that cost estimates provided by the \n     Congressional Budget Office will be carefully considered as \n     regulations are promulgated.\n       (b) Statement of Cost.--At the written request of any \n     Senator, the Director shall, to the extent practicable, \n     prepare--\n       (1) an estimate of the costs of regulations implementing an \n     Act containing a Federal mandate covered by section 408 of \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, \n     as added by section 101(a) of this Act; and\n       (2) a comparison of the costs of such regulations with the \n     cost estimate provided for such Act by the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n       (c) Cooperation of Office of Management and Budget.--At the \n     request of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     provide data and cost estimates for regulations implementing \n     an Act containing a Federal mandate covered by section 408 of \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, \n     as added by section 101(a) of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will yield back my remaining time, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n             Vote on Amendment No. 207, as Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote now occurs on the amendment No. 207, \nas further modified, offered by the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield to the majority leader?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there is not a ``no more vote'' sign out \nthere because I did say--and I am reminded by the Senator from \nKentucky--that we would be here until 11 o'clock tonight, tomorrow \nnight, whatever it took.\n  I assume now we will debate this amendment and two additional \namendments. We will probably be here until about 9:30. The question is \nwhether we want to have a vote at that time, or have the vote tomorrow \nmorning. I am prepared to do it either way. There are a number of our \ncolleagues at a press dinner. Some would not be displeased if they were \ncalled back about 9 o'clock. Others who are on the program would be; \nbut whatever the wishes of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I did not know it was all left up to me.\n  Mr. DOLE. No. I said we have not said that there would be no more \nvotes. I am prepared to do it either way.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader that I \nunderstand the problem that he got into, and he probably will not get \nin this deep again for awhile. The Senator from New Jersey has an \namendment. I am willing to debate him tonight and stack the votes until \ntomorrow. I would prefer that we have 40 minutes tomorrow in the \nmorning, that we debate it tomorrow, and then have the motion as \nproposed by the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n That is my preference. In order to accommodate the leader, I am \nperfectly willing to debate it tonight. However, we can vote on it \ntomorrow, and the votes apparently are going to be stacked. Two or \nthree votes will be stacked, and I will be part of that. I am willing \nto acquiesce to that.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Or we give you 5 minutes each before the vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. FORD. That would suit me fine, but I am trying to be--like my \ndaddy told me, ``When you sell it and they ask you when do you want to \nbe paid for it, say right now is fine.'' I have tried to accommodate \nthe leader. Now you are trying to stick me over to tomorrow and divide \nme up. Let us debate it tonight and put the vote off until tomorrow. \nBut do not have it too early. Those fellows over at the press dinner \nprobably are going to have such a good time they will want to sleep in \nthe morning.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am still sleepy from last night. In any event, that press \ndinner does last a while. It is live on C-SPAN. If you are not able to \ngo, but you would like to watch it--which I prefer--it will be on about \nfrom 9:45 until 10:30.\n  So if that is agreeable, I appreciate the consideration by my friend \nfrom Kentucky. There will be the debate on the Lautenberg amendment, \nwhich is 40 minutes, I understand, equally divided. Two Levin \namendments will be offered. I do not know of any time on that. If there \nare any rollcall votes ordered on any of the amendments, they will be \npostponed until tomorrow morning.\n  At 9 o'clock there will be an immigration amendment, we hope. I guess \nthe point is that none of the votes will occur until disposition of the \nimmigration amendment, and we will try to stack the votes, probably \nafter 10, maybe later than that.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished majority leader, \nare we coming in at 9?\n  Mr. DOLE. We will come in at 9.\n  Mr. FORD. Then morning business?\n  Mr. DOLE. We are not going to have morning business. We will get \nright on the bill.\n  Mr. FORD. But you will go to the immigration amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. There is an hour agreement on that. So that will be at \nleast 10 o'clock. That vote will occur at 10, followed by a vote on \nLautenberg, or any other votes ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. At 10 o'clock, or a minute or two after that. After the \nprayer and so forth, there will be an hour, which will take us to a few \nminutes after 10, when the first vote will occur.\n  Mr. DOLE. There will be no votes before 10, if that is all right with \nthe Democratic leader. If that is agreeable to everybody, there will be \nno more votes this evening.\n  Mr. GLENN. The majority leader mentioned immigration. We are trying \nto work on differences on both sides on immigration. Did you not have \nthat as part of any agreement?\n  Mr. DOLE. I did not make a request. But we can put it in writing if \nit works out. We still will not have any votes before 10, I can assure \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. GLENN. Is that when we go back on the bill?\n  Mr. DOLE. That will be at 9.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 199\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to turn to the \nconsideration of my amendment No. 199 at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 199 is the pending business.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I felt like a spectator as I was \nwatching this debate occur. The majority leader knew that he had my \ngood will as part of his dialog here. Since I was not asked, I just \nkind of shook my head. I was glad to be here. Obviously, those of us \nwithout a sense of humor are here because tonight is the funny night \ndown there. It may be funnier here.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the managers of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio and the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, for their interest in moving this legislation. I marvel at their \npatience and their good temperament, because it has not been easy, \nespecially when there are those of us who think that the legislation is \nappropriate, but at the same time want to amend it to make it as good \nas we can in our own views and our own perspectives.\n  So I rise to speak for the fourth time on the subject of unfunded \nmandates. I understand I have 20 minutes, and I do not know whether I \nwill use it all--probably not. But I will use sufficient time to \ndiscuss the subject now.\n  I offer this amendment which is as simple as it is compelling. I \noffer it because I believe that some laws are so important to the well-\nbeing of our citizens that regardless of whether the Federal Government \nfully pays for them, State and local governments should be required to \nimplement them.\n  The authors of this bill recognized this fundamental truth, and that \nis why they created exclusions to S. 1. Federal legislation designed to \nenforce the constitutional rights of individuals are exempt from the \nstrictures of the unfunded mandate law. So is legislation designed to \nprotect statutory rights when they are threatened by discrimination. So \nis legislation deemed to be necessary to protect our national security.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would expand the list of exemptions to S. \n1 to include limits of or on exposure to known human carcinogens. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has a list of substances which are \nbelieved to be causally connected to cancer in human beings. Evidence \nfrom human studies confirms a relationship between exposure to these \nsubstances and cancer.\n   [[Page S1533]] These known carcinogens include: arsenic, asbestos, \nbenzene, nickel, radon, and environmental tobacco smoke.\n  I ask unanimous consent that EPA's complete list of Group A \ncarcinogens be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       EPA's Group A Carcinogens\n\n       Group A: known human carcinogens:\n       ``This group is used only when there is sufficient evidence \n     from epidemiologic studies to support a causal association \n     between exposure to the agents and cancer''. (EPA's Risk \n     Assessment Guidelines of 1986)\n       Arsenic.\n       Asbestos.\n       Benzene.\n       Benzidine.\n       Bis(chloromethyl)ether.\n       Chromium VI.\n       Coke oven emissions.\n       Diethylstilbestrol.\n       direct black 38--benzidine-based dye.\n       direct blue 6----benzidine-based dye.\n       direct brown 95----benzidine-based dye.\n       Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).*\n       2-naphthylamine.\n       Nickel.\n       Radon (and other radionuclides).\n       Vinyl chloride.\n       *ETS is the only carcinogen in Group A for which the cancer \n     risk in humans was detected at environmental exposure levels, \n     rather than occupational or pharmaceutical levels.\n       ETS is also the only Group A carcinogen which is not \n     subject to regulation by EPA.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. My view is that protecting our citizens from \navoidable risks is an essential responsibility of government. It is an \nobligation which State and local government must accept and discharge--\neven if the Federal Government does not pay all the costs of doing so.\n  On another level, though, I recognize that States and cities are \noften unable to afford the cost of Federal mandates. They need the \nflexibility to set their own priorities and implement Federal mandates \nefficiently. There is a commonsense appeal to this statement.\n  But we must also recognize that problems which cross State borders \ncan only be effectively addressed at the Federal level.\n  Pollution, for example, knows no State borders. If each State \ndevelops its own pollution policy, some States will adopt stricter laws \nthan others. As a result, a State with strong environmental laws, such \nas New Jersey, might fall victim to pollution from a nearby State with \nweaker standards. The cost of dealing with this foreign pollution would \nbe unfairly borne by New Jersey taxpayers.\n  During the last few weeks, I have discussed the problem of State \nshopping that might result from this bill. With a patchwork of \ndiffering standards across the States, why wouldn't companies build \nfactories in States with the least stringent environmental standards? \nIn order to remain competitive, why wouldn't States with higher \nstandards, lower them? This dangerous race to the bottom would lower \nthe quality of life for all Americans. And I believe the Federal \nGovernment has a moral responsibility to discourage it.\n  The cancer-causing group A substances identified in my amendment are \nso deadly, and the Federal role in efforts to reduce our exposure to \nthem are so important that I believe efforts to restrict human exposure \nto them should be exempt from the points of order in S. 1.\n  I commend the Senator from Idaho for his tenacity which ensured \nunfunded mandates would be a priority. I also want to commend the \nSenator from Ohio for his hard work in committee and on the floor to \nimprove this bill. Together, they have forged a bill that would create \nbetter intergovernmental relations.\n  But central to this bill is the recognition that certain laws are so \nimportant to our Nation's welfare that they must be enacted and \nenforced--regardless of whether State and local governments will have \nto pay to implement them.\n  Mr. President, I think legislation to control known human carcinogens \nis so important that it warrants special consideration. Certainly, \nprotection from deadly exposure to cancer-causing substances is as \ncritical as any of the exclusions currently found in S. 1. Those who \nhave lost loved ones to this disease can tell you that.\n  I believe this bill, as currently drafted, could hamper congressional \nefforts to protect the public from cancer-causing agents. Let me \nexplain why.\n  Some of my colleagues might say that once the EPA determines \nsomething to be a group A carcinogen, there would be a broad consensus \nto protect children from it. But that is not the case at all.\n  Consider the case of radon. Radon, an invisible, toxic gas, is very \nthreatening. Radon is one of the most serious environmental health \nrisks facing the country. In my State, radon is the most prevalent \nenvironmental cause of cancer. Nationwide studies show elevated radon \nlevels in 25 percent of our homes and in 20 percent of our schools. \nRadon testing and mitigation are relatively inexpensive. Still, because \nthis problem is so widespread, a mandate to test for and reduce radon \nlevels in schools would certainly pass the $50 million threshold \ncontained in S. 1.\n  Last year, I offered, and the Environment and Public Works Committee \nreported, a bill to do radon testing in schools. It was never \nconsidered on the floor of the U.S. Senate. And one of the reasons is \nwas not, was because some objected to the cost that would have to be \nassumed if tests revealed unacceptable levels of radon.\n  S. 1 would institutionalize those concerns and roadblocks. It would \ntie our hands and prevent us from passing legislation that requires \nradon testing and mitigation in schools. Someone would argue that radon \nis just a medium-risk hazard. And, as a result, progress in the fight \nagainst radon-related disease would be threatened. After smoking, radon \nis the second leading cause of lung cancer. Is not protecting our \nchildren from this risk important enough to support Federal \nlegislation?\n  Again, I ask my colleagues: Are we prepared to surrender to all the \ndifferent States the basic obligation of protecting the health--and in \nthis case, the lives--of American citizens? Are we prepared to allow \nthousands of American children to be exposed to proven carcinogens? Is \nit a defense--or even an excuse--to say we are leaving this up to the \nStates? I hope not.\n  I will conclude my remarks, Mr. President, to allow others to speak \nabout my amendment. But I would ask my colleagues to think about the \nchildren whose health might be affected if we are unable to effectively \nregulate group A carcinogens. My youngest daughter is about to give \nbirth to my second grandchild and I cannot help wondering how this \nbill, as written, might affect his or her health.\n  I feel that it is my obligation to protect that child with all of the \nmight and the power that I can muster. I am sure that everyone else \nfeels similarly about their children and grandchildren and the \ngenerations that follow.\n  As a consequence of that, I hope that we will have the support to \namend S. 1 to include this very important exemption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bradley from New \nJersey and Senator Boxer from California be listed as cosponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nI ask unanimous consent that the time that we are in a quorum call be \nequally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will not object, but I must note \nthat the time that I used was because I was here and prepared to speak \non the amendment.\n  I hope that my colleague from Kentucky is ready to speak.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Idaho \nyield me at least 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am more than happy to yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. That is probably twice what I will need. I usually like to \nwork and not talk.\n  Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague from New Jersey \nis unwise. Since the proposed amendment would give the Environmental \n[[Page S1534]] Protection Agency authority in deciding what causes are \nworthy of exemption from this bill, I feel it deserves closer attention \nthan could be afforded a floor amendment on an unrelated bill. The \namendment before the Senate is a powerful amendment. It adds to a list \nof special exemptions for items that are so important to the fabric of \nour Nation that they should receive preferential treatment.\n  I question why we should give an agency whose credibility is in such \nquestion. I am not the first to raise the issue of the EPA falling down \non the job. By some people's judgment, if it was not for rash and \npolitically motivated regulations and decisions by the EPA, we might \nnot even need the unfunded mandates bill.\n  I have a report here that outlines the problems at the EPA. It is \ncalled ``Safeguarding the Future: Credible Science, Credible \nDecisions.'' It was produced by an expert panel on the role of science \nat EPA. The reason that the EPA needed such a report was simple: The \nagency has been unable to base its actions on unpoliticized science. \nIts findings are nothing short of startling.\n  Furthermore, the EPA is not even sure what is a class A carcinogen. I \nsubmit a letter from the EPA that states that putting an ``exact number \nof chemicals on this unofficial `A' list is tricky * * *.'' Some \nchemicals are grouped with others, some don't appear on EPA's risk \nhotline called IRIS, with this kind of information coming out of the \nEPA, we have no idea what this amendment could lead to down the road.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency dated June 21, 1994, to my office, be \nincluded in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter is ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1994.\n     To: Matthew Rapp.\n     From: Jeanette A. Wiltse, Ph.D., Deputy Director, Office of \n         Health and Environmental Assessment (8601).\n     Re: EPA Classification of Suspected Carcinogens.\n       Attached is the information that you requested on \n     substances identified by EPA as Class A carcinogens. We have \n     provided both use and health effects information.\n       Please be aware that the exact number of chemicals on this \n     unofficial ``A'' list is tricky depending on how they are \n     grouped. Often you will see just nickel listed, while on IRIS \n     two nickel compounds are listed separately. Also, you may see \n     radionuclides and radon listed separately or just radon \n     mentioned as a catch-all for the whole group. As you know, \n     there are at least 300 different radionuclides.\n       If you need additional information please call me at 202-\n     260-7315.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, a prime example of what could happen is \nchlorine. Chlorine, according to a recent newspaper article:\n\n       * * * is found in such diverse products as Teflon, compact \n     discs, photographic film, sofa cushions, linoleum and lawn \n     chemicals. It is used in 85 percent of all pesticides, \n     purifies 98 percent of all U.S. drinking water, and directly \n     affects 1.3 million American jobs. Chlorine is so important, \n     in fact, that it is used in 60 percent of all chemical \n     transactions--which amounts to 40 percent of our total gross \n     national product.\n\n  Guess which product is likely to get on EPA's unofficial group A \nlist? Chlorine. The EPA stated last year that it should ``develop a \nnational strategy for subjecting, reducing, or prohibiting the use of \nchlorine and chlorinated compounds.''\n  Mr. President, to me this proves we should not give the EPA this new \nauthority, and should not by our actions condone its behavior.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes and 56 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the manager of the bill at this point whether \nthere are additional speakers?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to my friend from New \nJersey, no. I would have a quick comment at the conclusion of this. I \nthink that will be all the speakers tonight.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need, \nand in the interest of trying to reduce this debate to its shortest \npossible period I want to respond to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky by just saying that I understand why he is raising those \nquestions. Certainly there is a lot there that can be questioned.\n  In this case, Mr. President, I, too, have a letter and I assume it is \nnot the same letter that the Senator from Kentucky submitted for the \nRecord because he ascribed a June date to that and this letter is \nJanuary issue. It is addressed to me from Miss Browner, who is the \nAdministrator of the EPA, and she says--and I will put the full letter \nin the Record:\n\n       Group A carcinogens are, as explained at length in EPA's \n     Risk Assessment Guidelines, those which have, in fact, caused \n     cancer in humans. Group A classification does not derive from \n     laboratory studies and inferences, assumptions or other \n     uncertainties. These are instances which have resulted in \n     cancer.\n\n  That is a pretty specific statement. When actions are needed to \neffectively limit exposure to these substances, EPA should be able to \nmove expeditiously to do so.\n  She goes on further to say, ``Your amendment would provide an \nexemption from the procedural and other requirements of S. 1 that could \ndelay or prevent congressional or other actions to limit exposure to \nknown human carcinogens,'' signed Carol M. Browner, Administrator for \nEPA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter is ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I applaud your effort to ensure \n     there is no hindrance to Environmental Protection Agency \n     regulatory actions to limit human exposure to Group A \n     carcinogens.\n       Group A carcinogens are, as explained at length in EPA's \n     Risk Assessment Guidelines, those which have in fact caused \n     cancer in humans. Group A classification does not derive from \n     laboratory studies and inferences, assumptions, or other \n     uncertainties; these are substances which have resulted in \n     cancer. When actions are needed to effectively limit exposure \n     to these substances, EPA should be able to move expeditiously \n     to do so.\n       Your amendment would provide an exemption from the \n     procedural and other requirements of S. 1 that could delay or \n     prevent Congressional or other actions to limit exposure to \n     known human carcinogens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carol M. Browner.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I just say this to the distinguished minority whip, \nand that is that chlorine is now under question review. Despite its \nomnipresence, we know the material is used effectively all over. But we \ndo not know the full health effects. It is, I think, appropriate to \nreview it.\n  I think back to the days when asbestos was used for installation in \nevery conceivable type of product: Wallboard, ceilings, pipes, et \ncetera. Then one day a terrible discovery was made. That was that \nasbestos is, in fact, cancer-causing material. There have been lawsuits \nthat confirm that. Lots of people whose health was injured and, as a \nmatter of fact, their lives terminated.\n  So the fact that something has been used extensively does not mean, \nof course, that it is, therefore, acceptable from a science or health-\nbased review.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, and would yield the floor at this moment. \nIf there is no further discussion I would be happy to yield back the \nbalance of my time, but that depends on what happens with the \nopponents' statement.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern that my \nfriend from New Jersey has expressed. I enjoy serving on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee with him. I know of his \nsincerity in this issue. I appreciate his concerns about class A \ncarcinogens and I share that concern. I may vote with my friend from \nNew Jersey to waive a point of order on this when and if it comes to \nthe floor. However, I do not support the amendment.\n  For example, we have the issue of radon on safe drinking water. What \nwas the cost of that? Some estimate $10 billion. But should we know \nthat cost up front? Was there a less costly alternative? This is \nexactly the purpose of Senate bill 1, to provide this process so that \nthe issues that have been raised concerning this amendment can be \nbrought to the floor to allow informed debate, accountability. And I \nbelieve that a complete exemption not only prevents us from knowing \ncost but prevents us from agreeing if, in fact, a waiver is deserved. \nAgain, \n[[Page S1535]] there may be a time in the future that I would support \nhim in seeking a waiver of the point of order, but I cannot support the \nidea of an exemption. So we could never get to that part of the \nprocess.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask the manager of the bill whether \nhe is going to ask for the yeas and nays for the purpose of tabling the \nmotion.\n  If that is the end of the discussion, I am happy to yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, an inquiry. Is it now in order for me \nto move to table the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has yielded back \nhis time. It would be in order for the Senator to do so.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, just to make this certain so that everybody \nknows and they know it in the offices also, it was understood that the \nvote on this would occur in the morning, if a rollcall vote is \nrequested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the agreement was that the \nvote will be not prior to 10 in the morning. If the Senator would \npropound a unanimous-consent in that regard.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask to set the pending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 177, As Modified\n\n         (Purpose: To clarify use of the term ``direct cost'')\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to modify amendment No. 177.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I believe the majority has a copy of \nthat modification.\n  Mr. President, I believe the modification is at the desk now.\n  The amendment, with its modification, is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 19 strike ``expected''.\n       On page 22, line 12 strike ``estimated''.\n       On page 22, line 22 strike ``estimated''.\n       On page 23, line 2 strike ``estimated''.\n       On page 23, line 5 strike ``estimate'' and ``full''.\n       On page 24, line 8 strike ``estimated''.\n       On page 24, line 15 strike ``estimated''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think it is also required that I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate return to consideration of amendment \nNo. 177.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment may seem like a technical \namendment, but it has substantive ramifications to it. There are eight \nplaces in the bill where the term ``direct costs'' is used, and that is \na very critical term in the bill. But in five of those eight instances, \nthere are some adjectives which are used which confuse the bill. For \ninstance, sometimes it is referred to as ``estimated direct costs,'' \neven though the word ``estimate'' is already in the definition of \ndirect costs in the definition section.\n  Once it is referred to as ``expected direct costs.'' Another time it \nis referred to as ``full direct costs,'' which raises an implication \nabout, well, on those other occasions when you refer to direct costs, \nare they something other than full direct costs.\n  So in order to clear up these ambiguities and potential problems with \nthose times direct costs is referred to in the bill, this amendment \nstrikes the adjectives which I have indicated which are in the \namendment and just simply leaves the words ``direct costs.'' That would \nthen be as defined in the definition section of the bill.\n  I understand that the floor managers will accept this amendment. It \nis, frankly, a good reason why it is important that we take some time \nto make sure this bill is as clear as can possibly be achieved, and \nwhile there has been some suggestion by some that there has been an \neffort to delay this bill, there is no effort that I know of to delay \nthis bill. The effort is being made to improve this bill in a number of \nvery important ways, to clarify the bill where there are ambiguities, \nand this is one instance where there are ambiguities which need to be \ncleared up.\n  I believe the managers of the bill concur in this and, if so, this \ndoes not require a rollcall vote, as far as I am concerned. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we view this as a technical amendment \nwhich eliminates several redundancies in the language of the bill, as \nthe Senator from Michigan pointed out. Because the term ``direct \ncosts'' is defined to mean aggregate estimated amounts, there really is \nno need for the word ``estimated'' to be used elsewhere in the bill \nwith the term ``direct costs.'' Therefore, this amendment strikes such \nusage.\n  This side of the aisle is ready to accept this amendment. Again, we \nappreciate the Senator from Michigan for his efforts.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, once again, I think the Senator from \nMichigan has shown his dedication to making this a good piece of \nlegislation by going into some of the details and defining before we \npass this, and correcting some of the things that might give trouble a \nlittle later on or that could be misinterpreted.\n  I want to congratulate him on that, and I am glad it has been \naccepted on the other side. We are happy to accept it on this side, \nalso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 177, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 177), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for a moment?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I withhold.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1532-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1535-S1536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   HOW TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have heard recently requests from a \nnumber of colleagues and the President for an explanation of exactly \nhow those of us who support the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution propose to achieve that goal after the States have \nratified the amendment.\n  Frankly, the demand for details has come from some of the same \nindividuals who opposed the balanced budget constitutional amendment \nwhen it was considered last year and it is my belief that no matter how \ndetailed a plan was presented, they would find fault with it.\n  However, I do believe it is worth demonstrating to my inquiring \ncolleagues that there is a specific, legislative path that we can \nfollow in order to balance the Federal budget--S. 149, the Balanced \nBudget Implementation Act, which I introduced on January 4 of this \nyear, the first day of the 104th Congress and which I originally \nintroduced on February 16, 1993, as S. 377.\n  The legislation outlines the procedures necessary to bring the \nFederal \n[[Page S1536]] budget into balance, including such reforms as a \nrequirement that the annual budget resolution be signed into law by the \nPresident, the implementation of zero-based budgeting which requires \nthe reauthorization of most current Federal spending programs in order \nfor them to remain eligible for funding; the application of the Social \nSecurity spending formula to other entitlement programs; and an \nextension to the year 2002 of the limits placed on discretionary \nspending. These requirements will be enforced with 60-vote points of \norder and other mechanisms.\n  This is the path to a balanced budget. I hope those of my colleagues \nwho have requested such guidance will join me in following it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed explanation of the \nlegislation be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the explanation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n              Balanced Budget Implementation Act--Outline\n\n                        (By Senator Phil Gramm)\n\n       A bill to require and implement a balanced budget by the \n     year 2002.\n\n\n   title 1.--require a joint budget resolution to force joint action \n                   between congress and the president\n\n       (A) Joint resolution on the Budget: To remedy the lack of \n     cooperation and coordination between the President and \n     Congress resulting from the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974 which created two budgets--\n     one Executive and one Congressional--the Balanced Budget \n     Implementation Act converts the present concurrent resolution \n     on the budget into a joint resolution on the budget which \n     must be signed by the President, ensuring joint Congressional \n     and Executive branch consensus on and commitment to each \n     annual budget.\n\n\n         title 2.--zero-based budgeting & decennial sunsetting\n\n       (A) For FY 1996 and FY 1997, Congress must re-authorize all \n     discretionary programs and all unearned entitlements: The \n     Balanced Budget Implementation Act adopts President Carter's \n     zero-based budgeting concept, mandating that before FY 1996 \n     begins, the spending authority for all unearned entitlements, \n     and the spending authority for the most expensive one-third \n     of discretionary programs will expire. Entitlements earned by \n     service or paid for in total or in part by assessments or \n     contributions shall be deemed as earned, and their \n     authorization shall not expire. Entitlements not sunsetted \n     include Social Security, veterans benefits, retirement \n     programs, Medicare and others. Before FY 1997, the spending \n     authority of the remaining discretionary programs will \n     expire.\n     Specifics\n       By the beginning of FY 1997, all unearned entitlements and \n     discretionary programs will be subject to re-authorization. \n     If a specific unearned entitlement or discretionary program \n     is not re-authorized in a non-appropriations bill, it cannot \n     be funded and will be terminated.\n       (B) Unauthorized programs cannot receive appropriations: \n     The Balanced Budget Implementation Act creates a point of \n     order in both Houses against any bill or provision thereof \n     that appropriates funds to a program for which no \n     authorization exists.\n     Specifics\n       Such point of order can be waived only by the affirmative \n     vote of 3/5ths of the whole membership of each House. Appeals \n     of the ruling of the Chair on such points of order also \n     require a 3/5ths affirmative vote of the whole membership of \n     each House.\n       A 3/5ths point of order shall lie against any authorization \n     that is contained in an appropriation bill.\n       (C) All discretionary programs and unearned entitlements \n     must be reauthorized every ten years: In the first session of \n     the Congress which follows the decennial Census \n     reapportionment, the spending authority for all unearned \n     entitlements and the most expensive one-third of all \n     discretionary programs will expire for the fiscal year that \n     begins in that session. In the second session of that \n     Congress, the spending authority for the remaining \n     discretionary programs will expire for the fiscal year that \n     begins in that session. This provision will be enforced by \n     the points of order contained in Section B) above.\n\n\ntitle 3.--limit the growth of entitlements to the growth rate of social \n                                security\n\n       (A) The Balanced Budget Implementation Act adopts President \n     Bush's proposal to limit the aggregate growth of all \n     entitlements other than Social Security to the growth rate \n     formula of Social Security for the period FY 1996 to FY 2002: \n     The aggregate growth of all entitlements other than Social \n     Security is limited to the growth rate formula of Social \n     Security, which is the consumer price index and the growth in \n     eligible population.\n       (B) The Balanced Budget Implementation Act provides \n     flexibility in the growth rate of entitlement programs: An \n     individual entitlement program can grow faster than the \n     overall entitlement cap as long as the aggregate growth in \n     all entitlements (other than Social Security) does not exceed \n     the entitlement cap.\n       (C) From FY 1996 to FY 2002, the aggregate spending growth \n     cap on entitlements will be enforced by an entitlement \n     sequester: The Balanced Budget Implementation Act provides \n     that if aggregate spending growth in entitlements exceeds the \n     total growth in consumer prices and eligible population, an \n     across-the-board sequester to eliminate excess spending \n     growth will occur on all entitlements other than Social \n     Security. A 3/5ths vote point of order lies against any \n     effort to exclude any entitlement from this sequester. This \n     sequester would be in effect until Congress passes \n     legislation which brings the entitlement program back within \n     the cap, and the President signs the bill.\n   TITLE 4.--ESTABLISH FIXED DEFICIT TARGETS, RESTORE AND STRENGTHEN \n          GRAMM-RUDMAN, AND REQUIRE A BALANCED BUDGET BY 2002\n\n       (A) Restore the fixed deficit targets of Gramm-Rudman (GR) \n     enacted by President Reagan: The Balanced Budget \n     Implementation Act modifies the existing GR maximum deficit \n     amounts and extends the GR sequester mechanism to balance the \n     budget by FY2002 and annually thereafter.\n       The Fixed deficit targets established for the next seven \n     fiscal years will result in a balanced budget by the fiscal \n     year 2002:\n\nFiscal year:                                                   Billions\n  1996.............................................................$145\n  1997..............................................................120\n  1998...............................................................97\n  1999...............................................................72\n  2000...............................................................48\n  2001...............................................................24\n  2002................................................................0\n\n       The new maximum deficit amounts will be enforced by the \n     existing GR deficit sequester. After reaching a balanced \n     budget, the GR sequester mechanism will become permanent to \n     ensure the budget stays in balance.\n       (B) Strengthen the GR points of order: The Balanced Budget \n     Implementation Act requires the strengthening of the existing \n     GR budget points of order.\n     Specifics\n       A point of order will lie against all actions that 1) \n     increase the deficit or 2) increase the limit on national \n     debt held by the public beyond the deficit levels required in \n     Section A & B (above). This point of order will lie in both \n     Houses, and may be waived only by a 3/5ths vote of the whole \n     membership of each House. An appeal of the point of order can \n     only be waived by a 3/5ths vote. No rule in either House can \n     permit waiver of such a point of order by less than 3/5ths \n     affirmative vote of the whole membership of such House nor \n     can such point of order be waived for more than one bill per \n     vote on such point of order.\n       Once the budget is balanced, all points of order will \n     become permanent to ensure the budget stays in balance.\n       (C) Protect Social Security: Social Security will be \n     protected fully by 1) preserving the existing points of order \n     to protect the Social Security trust fund; an 2) providing \n     expedited procedures in 2002 for consideration of additional \n     legislation to balance the budget excluding the Social \n     Security Trust Fund.\n       (D) Extend the Discretionary Spending Caps: President \n     Clinton proposed extending the existing caps on total \n     discretionary budget authority and outlays to cover the \n     fiscal years 1999 and 2000. That cap will be extended to also \n     apply to the fiscal year 2001 and 2002, at the same level of \n     President Clinton's proposed extension.\n                                Outlays\n\nFiscal year:                                                   Billions\n  1998...........................................................$542.4\n  1999............................................................542.4\n  2000............................................................542.4\n  2001............................................................542.4\n  2002............................................................542.4\n\n       (E) Look Back Sequester: In the last quarter of every \n     fiscal year, a ``look back'' sequestration is required to \n     eliminate any excess deficit for the current year. This look \n     back sequester will guarantee that the actual deficit target \n     set for that year is achieved.\n     Specifics\n       On July 1 of every fiscal year, the Office of Management \n     and Budget (OMB) will order an initial look back sequester \n     based on the most recent OMB deficit estimates. On July 15, \n     the OMB Mid-Session Review will update and finalize the \n     sequester order. The final order will stay in effect unless \n     offset by appropriate legislation to bring the deficit into \n     compliance with that year's target.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1535-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1536-S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The acting majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, although progress has been made today, there \nare still approximately 30 amendments on the list to be considered. The \nmanagers say many of those approximately 30, at least some of them, \nwill not be offered. But until they are formally stricken from the \nlist, there is still the risk they could each be called up. The \nmajority leader has made it very clear. He has been very patient in \ntrying to work through this bill and the amendments thereto. The bill's \nmanagers certainly have been working very assiduously to try to reduce \nthe amendment list and bring this to closure.\n  Also, the leader has made it clear he intends for us to complete this \nbill this week. In order to do that we have to work through this list, \neither have them stricken or acted on. If we do not get them completed \ntomorrow at a reasonable time, then it would go beyond that.\n  I understand there are only a few issues that still really need to be \nresolved. However, if they cannot be resolved amicably then it may be \nnecessary to close off debate. If cloture is invoked, I am not sure \nexactly how many of these amendments are not germane, but those that \nare not germane would then be dealt with through the cloture motion and \nwe could move on to the remaining amendments.\n  If going through cloture appears to be necessary tomorrow afternoon, \nit will be agreeable to this side of the aisle to waive the intervening \nday and have the cloture vote tomorrow. But I know there would be \ndiscussion between the majority leader and the minority leader before \nthat would be done. I just wanted to put that out on the Record \ntonight. Perhaps we can get this thing really moving tomorrow, and it \nwill not be necessary. But in order to deal with the time requirements, \nit was essential we put the cloture motion down at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the hour is late. I do not plan to debate \nthis. In fact, there is no debate on a cloture motion, obviously. It \ncan be filed at any time.\n  I am sorry it has to be filed or the majority feels it has to be \nfiled in that I think we have had a very productive day here. We have \nworked very hard all day today. I just asked staff to total up what we \nhad done today. We had five amendments accepted, one was withdrawn, and \none was set aside. In that breakdown of five that were accepted, three \nwere Democratic ones and two Republican. We had one amendment debated \nthat was put over for vote tomorrow, and that vote will occur tomorrow \nmorning. And we had three amendments tabled.\n  That is 11 effective actions on this bill today. I think that is \nrather good progress. I would say to my friend from Mississippi --we \nwill not go into the whole litany of how we got to where we are--but we \nlost the first several days working on this bill basically because of \nwhat happened in committee, where we had actions taken in committee to \nspeed this to the floor that prohibited any amendments. We were \nguaranteed once this reached the floor there would be plenty of time \nfor all the amendments, to take them up on the floor. Now we get to the \nfloor and the attempt is made to restrict or at least discourage \namendments from coming up. That violates at least the spirit of what we \nwere told in committee.\n  In committee also, the action there that caused us to lose quite a \nbit of time was the action wherein there was not a committee report \nsent. For those who are not familiar with how important a committee \nreport is, it is what in layman's language explains to all the Senators \nand their staffs what the technical legalese language is in the bill \nitself. So on something like this that really is landmark legislation, \nthat report was very important. We objected to the bill being filed \nwithout the report. We were voted down on that, and that was the issue \nthat Senator Byrd took up--and quite successfully. On that issue alone, \nwe spent some 2 or 2\\1/2\\ days.\n  Then we are finally told we can get the report, but then when the \ntime came for the report to be filed it was not filed and we lost \nanother day. Then we found out the Budget Committee, which also has \njurisdiction over this, had not filed their report and that took \nanother day.\n  So about the first 5 days, in fact the first week that this \nlegislation was up, I submit we lost that time basically because of the \nactions that were taken in committee that I have never seen--in my 20 \nyears here, I have never seen actions like that, where the minority was \ndenied a report.\n  I know I chaired the Committee on Governmental Affairs for some 8 \nyears, and the only time we ever sent a bill to the floor without a \nreport was with the complete acceptance of that move by the minority. \nSo I think the first 5 days we can mark off as being days, rancorous \nthough they were here on the floor, that were caused by the attempt to \nbypass the normal procedures of the Senate.\n  I think with all that behind us, we are back on track now. We are \ndealing with this. I want to move as forcefully and as fast as \npossible. We had a good day yesterday. I do not have a summary of what \nhappened yesterday, but today we have had 11 effective actions and I \njust hope we can continue moving tomorrow and I hope we do not have to \nexercise a cloture motion. I just wanted to spell that out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to say again I know the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio has worked very hard to try to move it forward. I \nknow it has not been easy. I know he worked on it last year and great \nprogress was made last year. That effort made it possible for us to \nhave a bill this early in this session. I acknowledge that, and I want \nto take this opportunity on behalf of all his colleagues to commend \nhim, and certainly our distinguished colleague from Idaho, Senator \nKempthorne, who has really been very diligent in trying to work through \nthis, also.\n  But I do want to point out a couple of things. This is the 9th day \nthat we have been on this bipartisan, I thought relatively \nnoncontroversial, bill. There have been some actions that have been \ntaken that have added some language to the bill. I believe the Senator \nwould say he has made some improvements as he has gone along.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure.\n  Mr. GLENN. As I pointed out a moment ago, 9 days is correct that we \nhave been on this bill. The first 5 days we lost, as far as effective \naction on the bill goes, because of what happened in the committee and \nthe speed of putting in the bill in the Senate one day, having a \nhearing the next day, the markup the third day, no report, and over our \nobjections in the minority. We had repeated votes in committee, and it \nwas a wrangle over that here on the floor--my distinguished colleague \nfrom West Virginia was involved. It was that wrangle on the floor about \nthe filing of reports that were not filed when they were supposed to \nbe, even after agreement they would be filed--it was that issue alone \nthat caused us to lose the first 5 days.\n  The last 4 days, where we have really been operating on this bill, \nespecially the last 2 days, we have made excellent progress. As I \nsaid--we read off the list \n[[Page S1538]] that we had today--we have had 11 effective actions on \nthis bill today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that, when you \nsay 11 effective actions, do you mean 11 amendments? Or seven \namendments? How many amendments were disposed of?\n  Mr. GLENN. As I said a while ago, Mr. President, we had accepted five \namendments; there were three on the Democratic side and two on the \nRepublican side that were accepted--effective actions. We had one that \nwas withdrawn. We had one that was set aside. We had one that was \ndebated with the vote to occur tomorrow, and three were tabled. That is \n11 effective actions, as I total them up.\n  So we are moving on this, is my point. I know cloture has been filed. \nThis is not the time to debate cloture.\n  I just want to balance all of the blame we have been getting and the \nheat around us over here. I think it is not justified. At least the \nfirst 5 days that this was on the floor were not effective days for \nother reasons. They were noneffective days because of what happened in \ncommittee, which I think was unwarranted.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly understand what the Senator has \nsaid. I would like to note that, while I think progress was made today, \nwe would all acknowledge that, at that pace, since we dealt with I \nguess 5 amendments today, on that basis it would still take us another \n5 or 6 days with approximately 30 amendments pending. Even though we \nmade good progress, if we are able to dispose of five or six a day, \nthis thing could keep going on down the line. Certainly in the first \ncouple of days a lot of discussion was delivered or exchanged on \nreports.\n  I point out that objection was heard, and an effort was made to get \nthe reports filed. I have before me the two reports. In fact, the \nreport from the Governmental Affairs Committee was available on the \n12th of January. That is a Thursday. It is 45 pages long. I am sure the \nSenators have had more than ample time to review that in these \nsucceeding days. Then the report from the Budget Committee was \navailable on Friday the 13th. There are 38 pages there. Certainly there \nwas time to review that.\n  So the objection was made, and the reports then were printed and made \navailable in a way that everybody could have a chance to review them. I \nwant to make sure that point is made, that the reports have been \navailable now for 12 or 13 days.\n  Then also just one other point. Talking about the time lost the first \ncouple of days, I think it is fair to note that the majority leader \nproperly and because of his appreciation for the family and the need \nfor various Senators to attend a funeral earlier this week, we in fact \ndid not have any votes. There was not a lot of action on Monday even \nthough we were scheduled to have votes any time after 4 p.m. In fact, \nthey did not occur until late on Tuesday to accommodate a lot of \nSenators. We do not blame anybody for that. Those things happen. A \ncompassionate leader would always honor that.\n  There are arguments on both sides. But I think the leader wanted to \nmake sure that he took action to try to deal with this problem. For \ninstance, if maybe we could get some information as to how many of \nthese amendments will be stricken from the list, that would help. I \nunderstand that has not been available. If it is not approximately 30, \nif in fact it is 15, then that would make a lot of difference.\n  Mr. GLENN. The Senator is absolutely correct. I agree with that. We \nhave already asked that be checked on our side to see how many will \nprobably not be called up so we will know what is on the list. There \nare serious amendments left. And I am hoping the same thing can be done \non the Republican side so we can combine things and maybe start getting \nsome time agreements and so on.\n  Just one further statement on this. One of the reasons I think there \nwere some amendments filed on this is because when people finally had a \nchance to read the reports and understand what was in the legislation, \nthey had some concern about it. So they started filing their \namendments. These have been substantive amendments which we have been \nconsidering.\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the Senator mean today or yesterday?\n  Mr. GLENN. Most of them yesterday and today. The ones that Senator \nLevin put in and several others here today. Some not dealing directly \nwith this would have been accepted in committee. I grant that. But I \nthink because we finally got the report people had a chance to look at \nit and understand what was in the bill. That is one reason we had so \nmany amendments. Had we been permitted to do this in committee, I think \nthere would not be nearly the number of amendments when we got to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LOTT. One response, if I could, I understand. Like the Senator \nfrom Ohio, I do not want to go on at great length. A lot of these \namendments in that long list of about 100 certainly were not germane \nand not relevant to this bill. We spend a lot of time on both sides on \nthings like history standards, the abortion clinic violence, and maybe \nthe pornography--a lot of amendments in which it would be a huge leap \nto say that they really were urgent right now and that they were really \nrelevant to this bill. But I think maybe we have been through that \nexercise and now we are down to really trying to deal with the \namendments that have been offered that really are of concern.\n  I hope maybe we can complete that, and maybe in the spirit that the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio was exhibiting here tonight we will \nmove right along tomorrow and be able to bring it to a conclusion.\n  Mr. GLENN. We will do our best.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will have a final closing statement, \nunless any other Senator would like to be heard at this time.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1537-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following measure was read the first and second times by \nunanimous consent and placed on the calendar:\n\n       S.

A bill entitled the ``Old Faithful Protection Act of 1995''; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    THE OLD FAITHFUL PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Americans first heard about Yellowstone \nNational Park back in the 1850's, from an old mountain man by the name \nof Jim Bridger.\n  Bridger told about a place where water ran so quickly it heated the \nstream bed through friction. He said steam rose up from the edges.\n  He told folks about how you could cook a trout without taking it off \nthe line--just catch the fish in the Firehole River and swing it into \none of the steam cauldrons on the bank.\n  Folks back then were a little hard pressed to believe Jim Bridger. \nBut when they saw it for themselves, they were convinced. President \nUlysses S. Grant made it our first national park on March 1, 1872.\n  Today, millions of Americans have visited Yellowstone to see the \ngeysers and mudpots and hot springs that make this a unique place. And \nI think we all want to make sure we keep it forever.\n  That is why today, I am introducing the Old Faithful Protection Act \nof 1995. This legislation guarantees that Yellowstone--our Nation's \nfirst national park--will remain the marvel that it was, is, and should \nalways be.\n  Why am I doing this? Because while Jim Bridger was a great man, he \nwas no geologist. Yellowstone has geysers, paint pots, and steam \ncauldrons not because of fast-running streams, but because of the \ngeothermal characteristics of the underlying rock formations.\n  These structures are fragile. In the past, some have been tempted to \ntap into them for energy. And when that has happened elsewhere the \ngeysers have vanished.\n  A 1991 National Park Service report found that geothermal development \nhas dried up 7 of the world's 10 major geyser systems. Systems have \ndisappeared in China, Russia, Chile, and Iceland. Next door in Nevada, \n30 geysers were active as recently as 1958. Extensive geothermal \ndevelopment has dried them all up. They are gone forever.\n  The same thing could happen in Yellowstone. And as the Park Service \nreport concludes, ``any risk, no matter how small, to Yellowstone's \ngeothernal resource is too much risk.''\n  The Old Faithful Protection Act guarantees complete protection to \nYellowstone's world famous geysers, paint pots, mud volcanoes, and hot \nsprings.\n  It forbids geothermal development on Federal lands within \napproximately 15 miles of Yellowstone's boundaries.\n  It lets Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming regulate geothermal development \non State and private lands within this 15-mile buffer zone provided \nthat each State develops a regulatory program that adequately protects \nYellowstone.\n  In summary, the Old Faithful Protection Act makes sure that \nYellowstone is protected, private property rights are respected, and \nthe appropriate role of the States in managing the water resource is \nrecognized.\n  We owe it to future generations to preserve Yellowstone so that they \ncan see the same wondrous sights that Jim Bridger saw 140 years ago.\n  And we owe it to the many people whose jobs depend on Yellowstone--\nguides, small businesses, nearby hotels and more--to keep their \nlivelihood safe.\n  And I want to put my colleagues on notice about this bill. Last \nCongress, my friend and colleague Congressman Pat Williams brought this \nthrough the House on an overwhelming vote.\n  Unfortunately, it was held up here in the Senate. I will not let that \nhappen again. I have written to the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, asking for an immediate hearing and rapid action \non the bill. And if that does not happen, I will \n[[Page S1540]] bring this bill to the floor at every opportunity, \nbecause I believe Yellowstone is that important to me and to Montana.\n  As Teddy Roosevelt said 90 years ago:\n\n       There can be nothing in the world more beautiful than the \n     Yosemite, the groves of giant sequoias and redwoods, the \n     Canyon of the Colorado, the Yellowstone * * * and our people \n     should see to it that they are preserved for their children \n     and their children's children forever, with their majestic \n     beauty all unmarred.\n\n  Yellowstone compares with Yosemite National Park, one of Teddy \nRoosevelt's favorites.\n  Mr. President, no risk to the park is too small to ignore. I consider \nthis bill a top priority. And I urge my colleagues to give it their \nstrong support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Today I am introducing the ``Old \n     Faithful Protection Act of 1995.'' This legislation is \n     intended to protect the hydrothermal systems associated with \n     Yellowstone National Park, an objective I have long been a \n     strong advocate of. I have gone to great lengths to tailor \n     this legislation so that it protects Yellowstone, while \n     respecting private property rights and the important role of \n     states in managing their water.\n       The importance of this legislation to maintaining the \n     integrity of Yellowstone National Park cannot be understated. \n     It is my intention to do everything I can to see this bill to \n     final passage during this Congress, and I would very much \n     appreciate your assistance. Toward that end, I ask that you \n     hold a hearing on this legislation at as early a date as \n     possible.\n       I look forward to hearing from you in the near future on \n     this matter.\n       With best personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     Max Baucus.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 1995.\n     Hon.

A bill to provide for criminal penalties for defrauding \nfinancial institutions carrying out programs under the Small Business \nAct and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the small business financial institution protection act\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to address \nthe problem of bank fraud that is being perpetuated against the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration [SBA]. The SBA besides specializing in \nsmall business loans also gets heavily involved in loans for disaster \nrelief areas. Currently there are over 5,000 loans in default with the \nSBA. These defaulted loans represent a loss over $1.8 billion to the \nSBA and the financial institutions that processed the loans. Since \n1990, the SBA has repurchased in excess of $878 million of these \ndefaulted loans yielding a direct loss to the U.S. Government. The \nremaining $300 million lost in this process was incurred by the \nfederally insured financial institutions that processed the loans. The \nSBA guidelines for approving loans are adopted by the financial \ninstitution, these guidelines are clearly deficient. The background \ninvestigation and financial checks for SBA loan approval are basically \nnonexistent. The amount of fraud associated with SBA loans is \nextraordinary.\n  In addition to the internal loan approval problems present in the \nSBA, there are several problematic areas within the prosecution of \nthese violations. Currently SBA violations are prosecuted under title \n18 USC, section 1001 (False Statements) and section 287 (False, \nfictitious or fraudulent claims). Both of these sections are merely 5-\nyear counts. The U.S. Attorney's offices nationwide, due to the large \ncaseload, have to prioritize their prosecutions. Five-year violations \nare usually declined due to lack of prosecutive merit. Furthermore, \nthis meager judicial penalty allows for these violations to be cost \neffective for the defendants. Most of the SBA defaulted loans are over \n$100,000. These violations rarely result in prison terms, therefore \ncrime truly does pay.\n  The second problematic area within the prosecution of these \nviolations is that neither of these sections have asset forfeiture \nprovisions. Therefore, the SBA must make a business decision to \nprosecute or proceed civilly.\n  My legislation will address all these issues. First, by incorporating \nSBA violations under title 18 USC, section 1344--(Bank Fraud) \nprosecutive thresholds will be met in virtually all U.S. attorney's \noffices. Second, this section will raise the penalties associated with \nthese violations. This in effect will send the message out that we will \nnot tolerate abuses against our financial systems of the U.S. \nGovernment. The current penalties for violation of section 1344 impose \na fine of not more than $1 million or imprisonment of not more than 30 \nyears, or both. This increased exposure tells would-be defendants that \ncrime does not pay. And lastly, section 1344 has asset forfeiture \nprovisions. This allows both for the return of the illegally gained \nproceeds to the Government and the victim financial institutions and \nfor the prosecution of those involved. As is clearly demonstrated by \nthe above figures, SBA fraud is already a form of bank fraud in that \nfederally insured financial institutions share in the losses when SBA \nloans are defaulted. The recent indictment in Los Angeles of 16 \ndefendants, highlights the necessity for this change. These defendants \nwere responsible for approximately $10 million in losses. Just in my \nState alone during the last 4 years over $20 million in losses were \nincurred by defaulted SBA loans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Financial \n     Institution Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CRIMINAL PENALTIES.\n\n       Section 1344 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``or the Small Business \n     Administration'' after ``financial institution''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``or the Small Business \n     Administration'' after ``financial institution,''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 277. A bill to impose comprehensive economic sanctions against \nIran; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              the comprehensive iran sanctions act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce the Comprehensive Iran \nSanctions Act of 1995. This act will institute a total trade embargo \nbetween the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. This \nembargo will also include a prohibition on all trade engaged in by a \nU.S. national abroad, but exempt all humanitarian supplies.\n  This legislation is modeled after a provision in the Cuban Democracy \nAct, and forbids any United States-owned foreign subsidiary from doing \nbusiness with Iran. Moreover, it will end the ability of United States \noil companies to buy Iranian oil and then resell it on the open market. \nWe must stop subsidizing Iranian terrorism. Our purchase of Iranian oil \ndoes just that. In 1993, oil purchases by United States companies of \nIranian crude oil bought and resold \n[[Page S1541]] in foreign markets amounted to $3.5 billion, or 25 \npercent of all Iranian crude oil sales.\n  United States companies supply annually over $750 million in exports \nto Iran. In the first 6 months after the imposition of the sanctions in \nOctober 1992, $461 million in exports to Iran required G-DEST or \nGeneral Destination licenses. Companies using G-DEST licenses do not \nsubmit individual license applications, thereby removing the State and \nDefense Departments from the review process. This process makes it \neasier to slip dual-use material through the oversight process and for \nIran to continue receiving exports that it can convert for use in its \nmilitary and nuclear program. This is exactly what Iraq did during the \n1980's and we allowed it to happen. We cannot allow the same mistake to \nbe repeated.\n  Iran is arming itself to the teeth, and we are simply ignoring it. \nIran conducted a $12 billion shopping spree for arms in 1990, and is \nstockpiling Chinese and North Korean Scud missiles. In 1991, Iran \npurchased Chinese nuclear technology and a nuclear reactor. This, in \naddition to its ongoing receipt of U.S. dual-use exports, portends a \nvery dangerous situation.\n  Iran set forth 2 years ago, an arms budget estimated at over $50 \nbillion for the following 5 years. This should make it clear to all \nthat Iran aims to build itself into a regional nuclear power intent on \nspreading its will by force. We cannot sit back and allow this \nbloodthirsty band of terrorists to grow into a monster too big for \nanyone to handle.\n  Moreover, Iran's territorial expansion into North Africa and Central \nAsia is seemingly being ignored. Iranian-supported terrorists are \nactive in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Yemen, and in Israel. Iran \nis also making serious efforts at spreading its influence into \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan. While this may seem tangential, Iran's \nspreading influence is indicative of a wider, more dangerous effort, \ndesigned to build an anti-American bloc. This much has even been \nalleged, regarding suggestions of some Sudanese role in the bombing of \nthe World Trade Center.\n  Iran's actions, speak louder than words and its continued effort at \nobtaining weapons of mass destruction, as well as its pursuit of an \nIslamic fundamentalist, anti-American bloc, speak volumes about its \nintent in the world today.\n  With Iran's goals in mind, the United States should not be providing \nit with the capabilities to build such weapons to fulfill its aims. \nUnfortunately, the Commerce Department has found no illegal exports, \nbut is investigating some potentially suspect cases. I would suggest \nthat if the administration is sincere about true export control, it \nshould reexamine its policy vis-a-vis Iran. Over a year ago, Secretary \nof State Christopher announced an American intention to isolate Iran, \nyet the continued export of dual-use material to this country and the \nAmerican purchase of Iranian oil, seems to run counter to this \npronouncement.\n  If the world community wishes to avoid another Middle Eastern war, we \nmust join together to take any and all steps necessary to prevent Iran \nfrom its goal of nuclear domination of the Middle East. In 1981, Israel \nforesaw the danger in Iraq. In 1995, let us not ignore the danger again \nwith Iran and miss an opportunity to stop this problem before it gets \ntoo big.\n  We must sever any remaining trade between the United States and Iran, \nto ensure that we do not provide them with anything that will come back \nto haunt us. We must take the lead and begin a worldwide effort at \nhalting all exports to Iran until it sheds its violence and antagonism \ntowards the West. When Iran agrees to join the rest of the civilized \nworld, then we can consider lifting sanctions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 277\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Iran Sanctions \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Iran's Violations of Human Rights.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to Iran's violations of \n     human rights:\n       (1) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, Amnesty International, and \n     the United States Department of State, the Government of Iran \n     has conducted assassinations outside of Iran, such as that of \n     former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar for which the \n     Government of France issued arrest warrants for several \n     Iranian governmental officials.\n       (2) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights and by Amnesty International, \n     the Government of Iran has conducted revolutionary trials \n     which do not meet internationally recognized standards of \n     fairness or justice. These trials have included such \n     violations as a lack of procedural safeguards, trial times of \n     5 minutes or less, limited access to defense counsel, forced \n     confessions, and summary executions.\n       (3) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n     systematically represses its Baha'i population. Persecutions \n     of this small religious community include assassinations, \n     arbitrary arrests, electoral prohibitions, and denial of \n     applications for documents such as passports.\n       (4) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n     suppresses opposition to its government. Political \n     organizations such as the Freedom Movement are banned from \n     parliamentary elections, have their telephones tapped and \n     their mail opened, and are systematically harassed and \n     intimidated.\n       (5) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights and Amnesty International, the \n     Government of Iran has failed to recognize the importance of \n     international human rights. This includes suppression of \n     Iranian human rights movements such as the Freedom Movement, \n     lack of cooperation with international human rights \n     organizations such as the International Red Cross, and an \n     overall apathy toward human rights in general. This lack of \n     concern prompted the Special Representative to state in his \n     report that Iran had made ``no appreciable progress towards \n     improved compliance with human rights in accordance with the \n     current international instruments''.\n       (6) As cited by Amnesty International, the Government of \n     Iran continues to torture its political prisoners. Torture \n     methods include burns, arbitrary blows, severe beatings, and \n     positions inducing pain.\n       (b) Iran's Acts of International Terrorism.--The Congress \n     makes the following findings, based on the records of the \n     Department of State, with respect to Iran's acts of \n     international terrorism:\n       (1) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran was the greatest supporter of state terrorism in 1992, \n     supporting over 20 terrorist acts, including the bombing of \n     the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people.\n       (2) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran is a sponsor of radical religious groups that have used \n     terrorism as a tool. These include such groups as Hezballah, \n     HAMAS, the Turkish Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for \n     the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC).\n       (3) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran has resorted to international terrorism as a means of \n     obtaining political gain.

(for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Helms, Mr. Robb, and Mr. \nThomas) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n                             S. Con. Res. 4\n\n       Whereas the Agreed Framework Between the United States and \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of October 21, \n     1994, states in Article III, paragraph (2), that ``[t]he DPRK \n     will consistently take steps to implement the North-South \n     Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean \n     Peninsula'';\n       Whereas the Agreed Framework also states the ``[t]he DPRK \n     will engage in North-South dialogue, as this Agreed Framework \n     will help create an atmosphere that promotes such dialogue'';\n       Whereas the two agreements entered into between North and \n     South Korea in 1992, namely the North-South Denuclearization \n     Agreement and the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression \n     and Exchanges and Cooperation, provide an existing and \n     detailed framework for dialogue between North and South \n     Korea;\n       Whereas the North Korean nuclear program is just one of the \n     lingering threats to peace on the Korean Peninsula; and\n       Whereas the reduction of tensions between North and South \n     Korea directly serve United States interests, given the \n     substantial defense commitment of the United States to South \n     Korea and the presence on the Korean Peninsula of United \n     States troops: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY.\n\n       The President should appoint a senior official with \n     appropriate experience to represent him in communicating \n     directly with the North Korean government regarding the steps \n     and measures set forth in section 1, and to consult with \n     South Korea and other concerned allies regarding such \n     communications.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       The President should report to the Congress, within 90 days \n     after the adoption of this concurrent resolution, regarding \n     the progress made in carrying out sections 1 and 2.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this concurrent resolution--\n       (1) the term ``North Korea'' means the Democratic People's \n     Republic of Korea; and\n       (2) the term ``South Korea'' means the Republic of Korea.\n\n     SEC. 5. DELIVERY OF RESOLUTION TO PRESIDENT.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I submit a concurrent resolution \nthat expresses the Sense of the Congress regarding the serious issue of \nNorth Korea-South Korea dialog as part of the United States-North Korea \nAgreed Framework on the nuclear issue. I am joined today by my \ncolleagues Senator Simon, Helms, Robb, and Thomas in submitting this \nresolution. Several of our colleagues on the House side have submitted \na similar resolution today.\n  I do not intend at this time to launch into a lengthy critique of the \nagreed framework signed between the United States and the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea [DPRK]. I chaired a hearing last week in the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to examine the agreement \nin greater detail. Other hearings on the agreed framework are being \nheld in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services \nCommittee this week. And I believe this body will have an opportunity \nto debate the entire agreement in detail when the administration seeks \nadditional funding to carry out the provisions of the agreed framework.\n  Today, however, I want to focus on a specific, and critical, element \nof the agreed framework: the necessity of a meaningful North-South \ndialog. Without such a dialog, I am convinced that implementation of \nthe agreed framework is unworkable.\n  Section III(2) of the agreed framework specifies that ``[t]he DPRK \nwill consistently take steps to implement the North-South Joint \nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'' The \nagreed framework goes on to say in section III.(3) that ``[t]he DPRK \nwill engage in North-South dialogue, as this agreed framework will help \ncreate an atmosphere that promotes such dialogue.'' Yesterday, in \ntestimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of \nState Warren Christopher had this to say about these provisions: ``As \npart of the framework, North Korea has pledged to resume dialogue with \nSouth Korea on matters affecting peace and security on the peninsula. \nWe have made clear that resuming North-South dialogue is essential to \nthe success of the framework--so important that we were prepared to \nwalk away from the framework if North Korea had not been willing to \nmeet that condition.''\n  I am gratified that the United States negotiators held firm on \nincluding references to these two North-South issues, but I am greatly \nconcerned that the requirements were not spelled out in greater detail \nin the agreement. For instance, what is the time line for progress? At \nwhat point will the United States stop fulfilling its commitments under \nthe agreed framework if there has been progress in North-South \nrelations.\n  It is this lack of specificity that has led me and my colleagues to \nintroduce this resolution. The resolution calls on the executive branch \nto take steps to ensure that the implementation of the agreed framework \nis linked to substantive and rapid progress in the dialogue between \nNorth and South Korea, including developing timetables for achieving \nmeasures to reduce tensions between North and South Korea. Although not \na comprehensive list, positive measures could include: First, hold a \nNorth-South summit; second, prompt dismantlement of North Korea's \nreprocessing facility; third, initiation of mutual nuclear facility \ninspections; fourth, establishment of North-South Liaison offices; \nfifth, establishment of a North-South joint military commission; sixth, \nexpansion of trade relations; seventh, promotion of freedom to travel; \neighth, exchanges and cooperation in science and technology, education, \nthe arts; health, sports, the environment, publishing, journalism, and \nother fields of mutual interest; ninth, establishment of postal and \ntelecommunications services; and tenth, reconnection of railroads and \nroadways.\n  The resolution also calls on President Clinton to appoint a senior \nofficial to communicate directly with the North Korean Government \nregarding the steps and measures, and to consult with South Korea and \nother concerned allies regarding such communications. In addition, the \nresolution calls on the President to report to Congress within 90 days \nregarding the progress made in the specific steps.\n  Mr. President. I do not need to remind my colleagues that 37,000 \nAmerican soldiers stationed on the demilitarized zone remain in harm's \nway. We all received a grim reminder of this when a U.S. helicopter was \nshot down on December 17, 1994, killing one U.S. airman and detaining \nanother on false charges of American espionage.\n  These American troops are part of the nearly 2 million troops who \nface each other across a heavily fortified demilitarized zone. Three \ndecades of on-again, off-again talks between Pyongyang and Seoul have \nproduced no significant progress in reducing tensions. Although a \ncease-fire ended the Korean war in 1953, the two sides technically \nremain at war. The agreed framework does not adequately address the \nunderlying tensions between North and South Korea. Nor do I believe \nthat North and South Korea will simply work everything out without some \noutside assistance. For that reason, I believe that the Clinton \nadministration must take specific steps to ensure that North Korea \nlives up to its commitment under the agreed framework.\n  I hope this resolution will take us a step in the right \ndirection.\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there are many trouble spots in the \nworld. But there may be no more dangerous border right now than the one \nthat divides North and South Korea. Approximately 1 million troops, \nNorth Korean, South Korean, and United States, are arrayed along either \nside of that 150-mile-long line. And yet, with all that firepower ready \nto use, there is practically no communication across that line. It is \none of the most hermetic borders in the world, rivalled, perhaps, only \nby those of Albania in its heyday.\n  Last December my colleague Senator Frank Murkowski and I saw that \nformidable border with our own eyes, when we crossed the demilitarized \nzone from North to South. And that same month we all saw some of the \nconsequences of the lack of communication, when a United States \nhelicopter was shot down over North Korea. What in other circumstances \nmight have been handled as a routine incident became a protracted war \nof nerves, with the freedom of one U.S. airman and the remains of \nanother hanging in the balance. Why? Because there are so few trusted \nchannels of communication between North and South.\n  When Senator Murkowski and I visited Asia last month, the agreed \nframework between the United States and North Korea was the focus of \nour discussions in both Pyongyang and Seoul. The agreement, while not \nperfect, offers an important opportunity to end North Korea's nuclear \nprogram. It also--and this is extremely important as well--can open new \nchannels of communication between North and South, and thereby reduce \ntensions in northwest Asia.\n  The sense of the Senate resolution that I am proud to submit today \nwith my colleague Senator Murkowski expands the channels of \ncommunication envisaged in the agreed framework. The resolution calls \nfor the executive branch to establish timetables for a range of \ntension-reducing measures between North and South Korea. Dismantlement \nof North Korea's nuclear reprocessing facility would be a major step, \nbut only one step, in that area. Other important measures connecting \nNorth and South would be: liaison offices; a joint military commission \nwith a particular focus on information exchange and threat reduction; \nexpanded \n[[Page S1545]] trade relations; freedom of travel between the Koreas; \nscientific, cultural, educational and sports exchanges; postal and \ntelecommunications services between North and South; and reconstruction \nof road and rail links between the two countries. The President should \nappoint a senior official to work on all those steps with North and \nSouth Korea.\n  All the measures I just listed add up to communication. Opening North \nKorea to outside influences will not be easy, will not happen \novernight, and will not bring overnight results. It is an effort, \nthough, that we should make, because the payoff in reduced tensions on \nthe Korean peninsula could be very great indeed. This resolution aims \nto support the nuclear accord, and build on it in constructive, \npositive ways.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1543-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                SENATE RESOLUTION 72--RELATIVE TO JAPAN\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dole, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Pell, and Mr. Robb) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 72\n\n       Whereas, on the morning of January 17, 1995 a devastating \n     and deadly earthquake shook the cities of Kobe and Osaka, \n     Japan killing more than 5,000 people, injuring more than \n     25,000 and leaving more than 300,000 temporarily homeless:\n       Whereas, the earthquake of January 17, 1995 has left more \n     than 46,440 buildings in ruin, destroyed highways, train \n     lines and other infrastructure and has caused losses of as \n     much as $80 billion in Kobe alone:\n       Whereas, the tradition of strength, courage, determination \n     and community of the people of Japan has been displayed time \n     again by the citizens of Kobe and Osaka and, indeed, all of \n     Japan since the earthquake and has served as an inspiration \n     to all of the world:\n       Whereas, the nations and people of the United States and \n     Japan share a strong, decades old history of friendship and \n     mutual interests and respect:\n       Whereas, the people of the United States, having suffered a \n     similar tragedy almost a year ago to the day of the Kobe and \n     Osaka earthquake, share in the pain and hope of the people of \n     Japan.\n       Therefore be it resolved by the Senate that--\n       (1) The Senate expresses its deepest sympathies to the \n     Nation of Japan and the citizens of Kobe and Osaka for the \n     tragic losses suffered as a result of the earthquake of \n     January 17, 1995.\n       (2) The Senate expresses its support to the people of Japan \n     as they continue their noble efforts to rebuild their cities \n     and their lives.\n       (3) The Senate expresses its friendship to the people of \n     Kobe and Osaka and pledges its support for their efforts in \n     the face of this disaster.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit Senate Resolution \n72 expressing the Senate's deepest sympathies to the people of Kobe and \nOsaka, Japan.\n  Mr. President, by now we are all aware of the frightening devastation \nthat was caused by the earthquake that struck Kobe and Osaka in the \nearly morning of January 17, 1995. We have seen the terrible \ndestruction of homes and businesses, we have heard the enormous numbers \nof dead and wounded and we have read the remarkable stories of courage \nand hope that have sprung daily from the rubble and ruins of Kobe and \nOsaka.\n  Mr. President, the memories of the earthquake that struck California \nalmost a year ago to the day of the Kobe and Osaka earthquake have not \ndiminished in the short period of time that has elapsed. We remember \nall too well the feelings of disbelief and loss as we learned of the \ndestruction that the California earthquake reeked on our own citizens. \nAs it was a year ago, so it has been throughout the past week as we \nwatched the events unfold in Kobe and Osaka.\n  Mr. President, we do not need a disaster to remind us of our \nfriendship and mutual commitment with the people of Japan; however, at \na time of tragedy such as this, we do have an opportunity to again \nreaffirm that friendship and to say to the people of Japan that America \ndoes care.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join with me today in \nsupporting Senate Resolution 72 and will join with all of America in \nexpressing our deepest sympathies and pledging our support and \nfriendship to the people of Japan.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1545-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1545-S1549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 73--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING BIENNIAL \n                EXPENDITURES BY COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Rules and Administration, reported \nthe following original resolution, which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I would like to insert a statement \nby Keith Geiger in the Congressional Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n               [From the National Education Association]\n\n                   Children, TV, and the Public Good\n\n                           (By Keith Geiger)\n\n       Do you believe that ``Super Mario Brothers,'' the cartoon \n     based on the popular video game, teaches children self-\n     confidence? Would you call television broadcasts of ``G.I. \n     Joe,'' ``The Flintstones,'' and ``The Jetsons'' educational \n     programming?\n       Welcome to the world of children's television--where these \n     and other equally astounding assertions are made regularly by \n     TV stations applying to the Federal Communications Commission \n     for license renewal. Even more remarkable,the FCC agrees that \n     these programs serve ``the educational and informational \n     needs of children'' as required by the Children's Television \n     Act.\n       Here we are, a nation deeply concerned about the lack of \n     values, the level of violence, and the academic achievement \n     of our children and youth. But flip through the channels and \n     Saturday morning or weekday afternoon. You'll find program \n     after program glorifying space-age shoot-em-ups, ninja \n     warriors, brutality and mayhem. Many of the shows are nothing \n     more than promotional vehicles for toys.\n       With a very few--immediately obvious--exceptions, \n     television aimed at children is the domain of toy \n     manufacturers. In the words of Shari Lewis of Lamb Chop fame, \n     ``Our kids are very much for sale to the highest bidder.''\n       This isn't a new phenomenon. It's the reason the Children's \n     Television Act was passed four years ago. The problem is, \n     this act hasn't changed children's programming. It was \n     written very broadly, and the FCC rules governing its \n     implementation are weak. There's no definition of what \n     constitutes educational programming--or of how much of it a \n     station must provide.\n       So ``G.I. Joe'' and ``Super Mario Brothers'' become \n     ``educational.'' And millions of U.S. children watch ``Mighty \n     Morphin Power Rangers,'' which has been taken off the air in \n     Canada and New Zealand because of excessive violence.\n       When asked recently to define quality children's \n     television, Shari Lewis replied: ``You must role model for \n     kids the kind of behavior you want. If the intention is to do \n     a program that seduces children to watch through explosions, \n     chases, crashes, verbal and physical hostility, and \n     aggression, I don't care if you tack on a pro-social message \n     at the end of the show.''\n       That is exactly what has happened under the Children's \n     Television Act. Broadcasters have produced some so-called \n     educational programs. But what many of these programs do, in \n     the words of a Christian Science Monitor editorial, is to \n     ``hide a smidgen of educational nutrition inside a candy bar \n     of frenetic entertainment.'' And the truth remains that \n     children learn far more from all the action and freneticism \n     than they do from the moralistic words.\n       The FCC is currently deciding if it should strengthen the \n     regulations that implement the Children's Television Act. The \n     National Education Association is one of more than a dozen \n     education and children's advocacy organizations urging the \n     Commission to put real teeth into its rules. We want the FCC \n     to define educational programs and to require that stations \n     schedule at least one hour of such programming for children \n     each day. These programs should be of standard length (not \n     announcements or shorts) and be shown between 7 a.m. and 10 \n     p.m. (nearly half of educational programs now air between \n     midnight and 6:30 a.m.).\n       Given the fact that 70 million children in our country \n     watch an average of four hours of television a day. I'd like \n     to issue a challenge. Let every station agree that from 8 \n     a.m. to 10 a.m. on Saturdays, all its children's shows will \n     be truly educational. That should take care of any \n     competitive worries. And it would give our children two \n     options: watch an educational show or turn off the TV. \n     Whichever they choose, America wins.\n       Television wields immense influence over children. It \n     defines the games they play, the clothes they wear, the way \n     they view their world. It's time we confront the power of \n     this medium and insist that those who profit from it also \n     have a social responsibility to use it to contribute to the \n     public good.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1550-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    THE BETHEL NEW LIFE ORGANIZATION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nachievements of the Bethel New Life Organization of Chicago, IL. Bethel \nNew Life has been chosen as one of the 24 winners of this year's Renew \nAmerica for Environmental Sustainability Award.\n  Bethel New Life is dedicated to reversing the trend toward urban \ndecay and has focused its efforts in Chicago's west side neighborhoods. \nBuilding on established community resources, Bethel has developed \nseveral job-creation programs. Bethel also concentrates on the needs of \nChicago's elderly by sustaining a home-based elder care program that \nwill create 325 new jobs in the area.\n  Additionally, Bethel is working with Argonne National Laboratory to \ndevelop a local recycling and manufacturing center with a materials \nprocessing plant already in operation. Community involvement is crucial \nto the success of Bethel's program, and this is accomplished through \nBethel's support of neighborhood block clubs where local high school \nstudents improve math and science skills by learning to monitor the \nlocal air quality.\n  I commend the Bethel New Life Organization for its dedication and \ncommitment to job creation and enrichment in Chicago's urban areas. It \nis my hope that Bethel will serve as a model for other community \norganizations working to better their neighborhoods.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1550-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        AMENDMENT OF TITLE 2, UNITED STATES CODE, SECTION 61H-6\n\n  The text of the bill (S. 273) to amend title 2, United States Code, \nsection 61h-6, as passed by the Senate on January 24, 1995, is as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     section 61h-6 of title 2; The Congress, Chapter 4--Officers \n     and Employees of Senate and House of Representatives; United \n     States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 61h-6.

Mr. President, last night the President spoke to the \nCongress and to the Nation. He set out an agenda for action. He told us \nwhere he wants to take the country and how he will accomplish his \ngoals.\n  While the audience in the House chamber looked somewhat different \nfrom last year's audience, the President's message remained the same: \nWe must help working families who are squeezed between rising prices \nand stagnant incomes.\n  The President spoke for all Democrats when he said we believe in \nopportunity for every American willing to work hard enough to earn it.\n  We believe in political reform that puts regular people ahead of \nlobbyists and special interests.\n  We believe in recasting Government to make it leaner and more \nresponsive to society's contemporary needs.\n  And we believe that middle-class families are the backbone of this \nNation and that Government actions should reflect their values and \nbeliefs.\n  That agenda responds directly to the Nation's needs, and many of his \ngoals have bipartisan support:\n  Providing tax cuts for middle-class families that are paid for with \nreal spending cuts; implementing health insurance reforms to protect \npeople against the arbitrary denial of health benefits for which they \nhave paid premiums; replacing welfare as we know it with work as most \nof us know it; securing our border against illegal entrants; reducing \nthe size of Government, and shifting resources and decision making from \nbureaucrats to citizens.\n  On other goals the chance for bipartisan support is unclear, but I am \nhopeful we can achieve it:\n  Addressing fundamental national needs like immunization against \nchildhood disease, school lunches, Head Start, medical care and \nnutrition for pregnant women and infants, and meeting Government's \nresponsibilities to its people by promoting educational opportunity and \nprotecting veterans, Social Security, and Medicare.\n  We know that there will be partisan fights ahead. Some will reflect \nprincipled differences of belief. Some will probably reflect \nmaneuvering for short-term political advantage.\n  Americans are used to that. It is inevitable in a competitive \npolitical system such as ours.\n  What was more compelling about the President's speech, however, was \nhis\n reminder to all of us, private citizens and members of Congress alike, \nthat, in many cases, none of us has to wait for the Government or \nanyone else to tell us how to do the right thing.\n\n  He is talking about citizenship. And that is a tenet and \nresponsibility to which all of us subscribe, but sometimes forget.\n  Members of Congress must adopt true congressional reforms that \naddress the undue influence of lobbyists and special interests. And, as \nthe President said, that reform must include campaign finance reform.\n  The President asked businesses whose sales are up and whose profits \nare healthy to share their good fortune with their workers; to keep \nAmerican plants open in America; to give workers a bonus when the \ncompany does well. Every employer in this country knows what the \nPresident was talking about.\n  We who have been blessed beyond others in our Nation know that we \ndidn't achieve our successes along. Each and every one of us can \nremember the helping hand, the encouragement, the push when we needed \nit--from a parent, a teacher, a colleague, a fellow American.\n  The President spoke to our greatest national tradition as a people, \nthe tradition of giving back. I think he spoke wisely and well, to \nAmericans in private life as well as to government officials.\n  The President's address was important. But what we do over the next 2 \nyears in the critical issue. Democrats and Republicans need to work \ntogether, and Democrats are ready to do that.\n  It is my hope that Republicans will join the President and us in the \neffort to address the real world concerns of the middle class and bring \ngenuine reform to Washington.\n  On behalf of my colleagues, I congratulate the President on his State \nof the Union Address. We look forward to the challenging agenda he has \nset out for all of us this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nPresident's address be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   President William Jefferson Clinton's State of the Union Address, \n                            January 24, 1995\n\n       Mr. President. Mr. Speaker, Members of the 104th Congress. \n     My fellow Americans:\n       Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once \n     again our democracy has spoken. To all of you in the 104th \n     Congress, to you, Mr. Speaker: Congratulations.\n       If we agree on nothing else, we must agree that the \n     American people voted for change in 1992 and 1994. We didn't \n     hear America singing--we heard America shouting. Now, we must \n     say: We hear you. We will work together to earn your trust.\n       For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be \n     faithful to it in this new era. Over two hundred years ago, \n     our Founders changed the course of history by joining \n     together to create a new country based on a powerful idea: We \n     hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with \n     certain inalienable rights; that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n       It has fallen to every generation since to preserve that \n     idea--the American idea--and to expand its meaning in new and \n     different times. To Lincoln and his Congress: To preserve the \n     Union and end slavery. To Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow \n     Wilson: To restrain the abuses and excesses of the Industrial \n     Revolution, and to assert America's leadership in the world. \n     To Franklin Roosevelt; To fight the failure of the Great \n     Depression and our century's great struggle against fascism. \n     To all our Presidents since: To fight the Cold War. \n     Especially to two, who struggled in partnership with \n     Congresses of the opposite party. To Harry Truman, who \n     summoned us to unparralled prosperity at home and constructed \n     the architecture of the Cold War world. And to Ronald Reagan, \n     who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle \n     against Communism was won.\n       In another time of change and challenge, I became the first \n     President to be elected in the post-Cold War era, an era \n     marked by the global economy, the information revolution, \n     unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for \n     ordinary Americans. I came to this hallowed chamber two years \n     ago on a mission: To restore the American Dream for all our \n     people and to ensure that we move into the 21st Century still \n     the world's strongest force for freedom and democracy.\n       I was determined to tackle tough problems, too long \n     ignored. In these efforts I have\n      made my mistakes and learned again the importance of \n     humility in all human endeavor. But I am proud to say \n     that, tonight, our country is stronger than it was two \n     years ago.\n       Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new \n     global economy. We are at peace and a force for peace and \n     freedom throughout the world. We have almost six million new \n     jobs since I became President. We have the lowest combined \n     rate of unemployment and inflation in over 25 years. We \n     [[Page S1552]] have expanded trade, put more police on our \n     streets, given our citizens more tools to get an education \n     and rebuild their communities. But the rising tide is not \n     lifting all boats.\n       While our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many \n     of our people are still working harder and harder for less \n     and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing \n     more competitive, too many of our people can't be sure of \n     even having a job next year or even next month. And far more \n     than our material riches are threatened: Things far more \n     precious--our children, our families, our values.\n       Our civil life is suffering. Citizens are working together \n     less, shorting at each other more. The common bonds of \n     community which have been the great strength of this country \n     from its beginning are badly frayed.\n       What are we do to about it? More than 60 years ago, at the \n     dawn of another new era, Franklin Roosevelt told the nation: \n     ``New conditions impose new requirements on government and \n     those who conduct government'' From that simple proposition, \n     he shaped the New Deal, which helped restore our nation to \n     prosperity and defined the relationship between Americans and \n     their government for half a century.\n       That approach worked in its time. But we today, we face a \n     new time and different conditions. We are moving from an \n     Industrial Age built on gears and sweat, to an Information \n     Age that will demand more skills and learning. Our \n     government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen \n     as a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our \n     citizens, instead of equipping them to get ahead. The values \n     that used to hold us together are coming apart.\n       So, tonight, we must forge a new social compact, to meet \n     the challenges of our time. As we enter a new era, we need a \n     new set of understandings, not just with our government but \n     more important, with one another.\n       That is what I want to talk to you about tonight. I call it \n     a New Covenant, but it is grounded in a very old idea: That \n     all Americans have not just a right, but a responsibility to \n     rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can \n     take them, and to give something back to their communities \n     and their country in return.\n       Opportunity and responsibility go hand-in-hand. We can't \n     have one without the other. And our national community can't \n     hold together without both.\n       Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we \n     can equip our people to meet the challenges of the new \n     economy, how we can change the way our government works to \n     fit a different time and, above all, how we can repair the \n     damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our \n     common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, \n     in our government and in ourselves.\n       Let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship, \n     pettiness, and pride. As we embark on a new course, let us \n     put our country first, remembering that regardless of our \n     party labels, we are all Americans. Let the final test of any \n     action we take be a simple one: is it good for the American \n     people?\n       We cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not \n     better servants. We've made a start this week by enacting a \n     law applying to Congress the laws you apply to the private \n     sector. But we have a lot more to do.\n       Three times as many lobbyists roam the streets and \n     corridors of Washington as did 20 years ago. The American \n     people look at their nation's capital, and they see a city \n     where the well-connected and the well-protected milk the \n     system, and the interests of ordinary citizens are too often \n     left out.\n       As this new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still \n     at work. Free travel, expensive gifts . . . business as \n     usual. Twice this month, you have voted not to stop these \n     gifts. Well, there doesn't have to be a law for everything. \n     Tonight, I challenge you to just stop taking them--now, \n     without waiting for legislation to pass. Then, send me the \n     strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign it.\n       Require the lobbyists to tell the people who they work for, \n     what they're spending and what they want. And let's curb the \n     role of big money in our elections, by capping the cost of \n     campaigns and limiting the influence of PACs, and opening the \n     people's airwaves to be an instrument of democracy, by giving \n     free TV time to candidates.\n       When Congress killed political reform last year, the \n     lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred building \n     and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home \n     something to cheer about.\n       More important, let's change the government--let's make it \n     smaller, less costly and smarter--leaner, not meaner.\n       The New Covenant is an approach to governing that is \n     different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is \n     from the manual typewriter. The old way protected the \n     organized interests. The New Covenant looks out for the \n     interests of ordinary people, the old way divided us by \n     interests, constituency or class. The New Covenant unites us \n     behind a common vision of what's best for our country.\n       The old way dispensed services through large, hierarchical, \n     inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant shifts resources \n     and decision-making from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting \n     choice, competition and individual responsibility into \n     national policy.\n       The old way seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant has \n     built-in incentives to reward success. The old way was \n     centralized in Washington. The New Covenant must take hold in \n     communities across the country.\n       Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy: To \n     empower people to make the most of their own lives; to \n     enhance our security at home and abroad.\n       We must go beyond the sterile debate between the illusion \n     that there is a program for every problem and the illusion \n     that government is the source of all our problems. Our job is \n     to get rid of yesterday's government so our people can meet \n     today's and tomorrow's needs.\n       For years before I became President, others had been saying \n     they would cut government, but not much happened. We did it. \n     We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more \n     than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from \n     the federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone. Based on \n     decisions we have already made, we will have cut a total of \n     more than a quarter million positions, making the federal \n     government the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was \n     President.\n       Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our \n     initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion. The age \n     of the $500 hammer is gone. Deadwood programs like mohair \n     subsidies are gone. We have streamlined the Agriculture \n     Department by more than 1,200 offices. Slashed the Small \n     business loan form from an inch-thick to a single page and \n     thrown away the government's 10,000 page personnel manual. \n     FEMA--the federal disaster agency--has gone from being a \n     disaster to helping people. Government workers--hand-in-hand \n     with private business--rebuilt southern California's \n     fractured freeways in record time and under budget. And \n     because the federal government moved fast, all but one of the \n     650 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business \n     educating our children.\n       University administrators tell me that they are saving \n     weeks of time on college loan applications because of our new \n     college loan program that cut costs to the taxpayers, cuts \n     costs to students, and gives people a better way to pay back \n     their college loans, and cut out bureaucracy.\n       Previous government reform reports gathered dust. We are \n     getting results. And we're not through. There is going to be \n     a second round of reinventing government. We propose to cut \n     $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending \n     our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing \n     programs down to three. Getting rid of over 100 programs we \n     don't need--like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the \n     helium reserve program.\n       These programs have outlived their usefulness. We have to \n     cut yesterday's government to help solve tomorrow's problems.\n       And we need to get government closer to the people it's \n     meant to serve. Where states and communities, private \n     citizens and the private sector can do a better job, we \n     should get out of the way. We're taking power away from \n     federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and \n     individuals. And it's time for Congress to stop passing on to \n     the states the cost of the decisions we make here in \n     Washington.\n       For years, Congress has concealed in the budget scores of \n     pet spending projects--and last year was no different: A \n     million dollars to study stress in plants, $12 million for a \n     tick-removal programs that didn't even work. Give me the line \n     item veto and I'll save the taxpayers money.\n       But when we cut, let's remember that government still has \n     important responsibilities: Our young people hold our future \n     in their hands; we owe a debt to our veterans who were \n     willing to risk their lives for us; the elderly have made us \n     what we are. My budget cuts a lot, but it protects education, \n     veterans, Social Security, and Medicare and so should you.\n       And when we give more flexibility to the states, let's \n     remember certain fundamental national needs that should be \n     addressed in every state. Immunization against childhood \n     disease; school lunches; Head Start; medical care and \n     nutrition for pregnant women and infants--they're in the \n     national interest.\n       I applaud your desire to get rid of costly, unnecessary \n     regulations. But when we deregulate, let's remember what \n     national action in the national interest has given us: Safer \n     food for our families; safer toys for our kids; safer nursing \n     homes for you parents. Safer cars and highways. And safer \n     workplaces. Clean water and clean air.\n       Do we need more common sense and fairness in our \n     regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and \n     still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness \n     and still clean up toxic waste dumps. And we ought to do it.\n       Should we cut the deficit more? Of course, we should. We \n     must bring down spending in a way that protects the economic \n     recovery and does not punish the middle class or seniors\n       I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced \n     budget amendment. We all want to balance the budget. Our \n     administration has done more to bring the budget closer to \n     balance than any one in a long time. But if you're going to \n     pass this amendment, you have to be straight with the \n     American people. They have a right to\n      know what you are going to cut and how it would affect them. \n     And you should tell them before you change the \n     Constitution.\n       In the New Covenant there are problems we have the \n     responsibility to face.\n       [[Page S1553]] Nothing has done more to undermine our sense \n     of responsibility than our failed welfare system. It rewards \n     welfare over work. It undermines family values. It lets \n     millions of parents get away without paying child support.\n       That is why I have worked so long to reform welfare. We \n     have made a good start. In the last two years, my \n     administration has given more states the chance to find their \n     own ways to reform welfare than the past two administration \n     combined. Last year, I introduced the most sweeping welfare \n     reform plan ever presented by an administration.\n       We have to make welfare what it was meant to be: a second \n     chance, not a way of life. We'll help those on welfare move \n     to work as quickly as possible, provide child care and teach \n     skills if they need them for up to two years. But after that, \n     the rule will be simple: Anyone who can work must go to work.\n       If a parent isn't paying child support, we'll make them \n     pay. We'll suspend their driver's licenses, track them across \n     state lines and make them work off what they owe. Governments \n     don't raise children. Parents do.\n       I want to work with you to pass welfare reform. But our \n     goal must be to liberate people and lift them up--from \n     dependence to independence, welfare to work, mere \n     childbearing to responsible parenting--not punish them \n     because they happen to be poor. We should require work and \n     mutual responsibility, but we shouldn't cut people off \n     because they are poor, young, unmarried. We should promote \n     responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home \n     with their parents or in other supervised settings and finish \n     school, not by putting them and their children out on the \n     street. We shouldn't punish poor children for the mistakes of \n     their parents.\n       Let this be the year we end welfare as we know it. But let \n     this also be the year we stop using this issue to divide \n     America. No one is more eager to end welfare than the people \n     that are trapped on it. Let's promote education, work, good \n     parenting. Let's punish bad behavior and the refusal to be a \n     student, a worker, a responsible parent. Let's not punish \n     poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made mistakes. None \n     of us can change our yesterday's, but all of us can change \n     tomorrow's. Just ask Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off \n     welfare and is now a congresswoman from California.\n       I know it has become fashionable to embrace Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt. So let's remember exactly what he said: ``Human \n     kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber \n     of a free people. A nation does not have to be cruel in order \n     to be tough.''\n       I know members of this Congress are concerned about crime. \n     But I would remind you that last year we passed a very tough \n     crime bill--longer sentences, three strikes and you're out, \n     more prevention, more prisons, and 100,000 more police. And \n     we paid for it all by reducing the size of the federal \n     bureaucracy and giving money back to local communities to \n     lower the crime rate. There may be other things we can do to \n     be tougher on crime and to help lower the crime rate, and \n     let's do them. But let's not take back the good things we've \n     already done. That's what local community leaders think. And \n     that's what the police who put their lives on the line every \n     day think.\n       Secondly, the last Congress passed the Brady Bill and the \n     ban on nineteen assault weapons. I think everybody in this \n     room knows that several members of the last Congress who \n     voted for the assault weapons ban and the Brady Bill lost \n     their seats because of it. Neither the bill supporters nor I \n     believe anything should be done to infringe upon the \n     legitimate right of our citizens to bear arms for hunting and \n     sporting purposes. Those people laid down their seats in \n     Congress to try to keep more police and children from laying \n     down their lives in our streets under a hail of assault \n     weapons' bullets. And I will not see that ban repealed.\n       We shouldn't cut government programs that help to prepare \n     us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are \n     organized from the grass roots up, not by federal \n     bureaucracies. The best example of that is the national \n     service program--Americorps--which today has 20,000 \n     Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace \n     Corps, working all over America, helping people--person to \n     person--in local volunteer groups, solving problems and \n     earning some money for their education. This is citizenship \n     at its best. It's good for the Americorps members and good \n     for the rest of us. It's the essence of the New Covenant. And \n     we shouldn't stop it.\n       All Americans are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of \n     illegal immigrants entering this country. The jobs they hold \n     might otherwise be held by our citizens or legal immigrants, \n     and the public services they use impose burdens on our \n     taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved \n     aggressively to secure our borders by hiring a record number \n     of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal \n     aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal aliens who \n     try to take American jobs, and by barring welfare benefits to \n     illegal aliens.\n       In the budget I will present to you, we will do more to try \n     to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested \n     for crimes, and to better identify illegal aliens in the \n     workplace, as recommended by the commission headed by former \n     Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.\n       This is a nation of immigrants. But it is also a nation of \n     law. And it is wrong, and ultimately self-defeating for a \n     nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our \n     immigration laws we have seen in recent years.\n       The most important job of government is to empower people \n     to succeed in the new global economy. America has always been \n     the land of opportunity, a land where if you work hard you \n     can get ahead. We are a middle class country. Middle class \n     values sustain us. We must expand the middle class and shrink \n     the underclass, while supporting the millions who are already \n     successful in the new economy.\n       America is once again the world's strongest economy. Almost \n     six million jobs in two years. Exports booming. Inflation \n     down. High wage jobs coming back. A record number of American \n     entrepreneurs living the American dream. If we want to stay \n     that way, those who work and lift our nation must have more \n     of its benefits.\n       Today too many of those people are being left out. They are \n     working harder for less security, less income, less certainty \n     they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their \n     children or retirement for themselves. We cannot let this \n     continue.\n       If we don't act, our economy will probably do what it's \n     done since 1978: Provide high income growth to those at the \n     top, give very little to everyone in the middle, and leave \n     the people at the bottom to fall even farther behind, no \n     matter how hard they work.\n       We must have a government that can be a partner in making \n     this new economy work for all Americans--a government that \n     helps each and every one of us get an education and have the \n     opportunity to renew our skills.\n       That's why we worked so hard to increase educational \n     opportunity from Head Start, to public schools, to \n     apprenticeships, to job training, to make college loans \n     available and more affordable for 20 million people. That's \n     the first thing we have to do.\n       The second thing we can do to raise incomes is to lower \n     taxes. In 1993, we took the first step with a working family \n     tax cut for 15 million families with incomes of under $27,000 \n     and a tax cut to most small and new businesses. Before we \n     could do more than that, we first had to bring down the \n     deficit we inherited. And we had to get economic growth up. \n     We have done both.\n       Now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way. Tax cuts \n     must promote and reinforce our first obligation, empowering \n     citizens with education and training to make the most of \n     their lives. The tax relief spotlight must shine on those who \n     make the right choices for their families and communities.\n       I have proposed the Middle Class Bill of Rights--which \n     should be called a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, \n     because its provisions only benefit those who are working to \n     educate and raise their children or to improve their own \n     lives. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise \n     incomes in the short and long runs in a way that benefits all \n     of us.\n       There are four provisions: First, a tax deduction for all \n     education and training after high school. Education is even \n     more important now than ever to the economic well-being of \n     America, and we should do everything we can to encourage it. \n     If businesses can get a deduction for investing in factories, \n     why shouldn't families for investment in their future?\n       Second, a $500 tax credit for all children under thirteen \n     in middle class households.\n       Third, an individual retirement account with penalty-free \n     withdrawal rights for the cost of education, health care, \n     first-time home buying, and care of a parent.\n       And fourth, a G.I. Bill for American workers. We propose to \n     collapse nearly 70 federal programs and offer vouchers \n     directly to eligible American workers. If you are laid off, \n     or make a low wage, you will get a voucher worth $2,600 a \n     year for up to two years to go to your local community \n     college or get private or public job training to raise your \n     job skills.\n       Anyone can call for a tax cut, but I will not accept one \n     that explodes the deficit and puts our economic recovery at \n     risk. We must pay for any tax cuts, fully and honestly. Two \n     years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the \n     strength to cut the deficit. Thanks to the courage of many \n     people here, and many who did not return to take their seats \n     in this House, we began to do what others said they would do \n     for years.\n       We Democrats cut the deficit by over $600 billion--that's \n     nearly $10,000 for every family of four in this country. The \n     deficit is coming down three years in a row for the first \n     time since President Truman was in office.\n       In the budget I will send you, the Middle Class Bill of \n     Rights is fully paid for by budget cuts, cuts in bureaucracy, \n     cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the \n     spending cuts will more than double tax cuts. My budget pays \n     for the Middle Class Bill of Rights without any cuts in \n     Medicare. And I will oppose any attempt to pay for tax cuts \n     with Medicare cuts.\n       I know a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief. I \n     want to work with you. My test for any proposal is: Will it \n     create jobs and raise incomes? Will it strengthen families \n     and support children? Will it build the middle class and \n     shrink the underclass? Is it paid for? If it does, I will \n     support it. If it doesn't, I will oppose it.\n       That's why I will ask you to support raising the minimum \n     wage. It rewards work. Two and a half million Americans, \n     often women with children, work for $4.25 an hour. \n     [[Page S1554]] In terms of real buying power, by next year, \n     that minimum wage will be at a 40 year low.\n       I have studied the arguments and evidence for and against a \n     minimum wage increase. The weight of evidence is that a \n     modest increase does not cost jobs, and may even lure people \n     into the job market. But the plain fact is you can't make a \n     living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have kids to \n     support.\n       In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue. \n     It should be again. I challenge you to get together and find \n     a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.\n       Members of Congress have been on the job less than a month. \n     But by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, each \n     Congressman has already earned as much in Congressional \n     salary as people who work under minimum wage make in an \n     entire year.\n       And everyone in this chamber has something else that too \n     many Americans go without; health care. Last year, we almost \n     came to blows over health care, but nothing was done. But the \n     hard, cold fact is that, since we started this debate, we \n     know that more than 1.1 million Americans in working families \n     have lost their coverage. The hard, cold fact is that \n     millions more, mostly workers who are farmers, self-employed, \n     and in small businesses, have seen their coverage erode with \n     higher premium costs, higher deductibles, and higher co-\n     payments.\n       I still believe we must move out nation towards providing \n     health security for every American family. Last year, we bit \n     off more than we could chew. This year, let's work together, \n     step by step, and get something done.\n       Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no \n     American risks losing coverage or facing skyrocketing prices \n     when they change jobs, or lose a job, or a family member \n     falls ill. I want to work together with the Democratic \n     leadership and Republications like Bob Dole, who have a \n     longtime commitment to health reform.\n       Let's make sure that self-employed people and small \n     businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through \n     voluntary purchasing pools. Let's help families provide long-\n     term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. Let's help \n     workers who lose their jobs keep health insurance coverage \n     for a year while they look for work. And let's find a way to \n     make sure our children have health care. Let's work together. \n     This is too important for politics as usual.\n       Much of what is on the American people's mind is devoted to \n     internal security concerns--the security of our jobs and \n     incomes, our children, our streets, our health, our borders. \n     Now that the Cold War is past, it is tempting to believe that \n     all security issues, with the possible exception of trade, \n     reside within our borders. That is not so.\n       Our security depends upon our continued world leadership \n     for peace, freedom, and democracy. We cannot be strong at \n     home without being strong abroad.\n       The financial crisis in Mexico is a powerful case in point. \n     We have to act--for the sake of millions of Americans whose \n     livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being. If we want to \n     secure American jobs, preserve American exports and safeguard \n     America's borders, we must pass our stabilization program and \n     help put Mexico back on track. And let me repeat--this is not \n     a loan, this is not foreign aid, this is not a bail-out. \n     We'll be giving a\n      guarantee, like co-signing a note with good collateral that \n     will cover our risk. This legislation is right for \n     America, and together with the bipartisan leadership, I \n     call on Congress to pass it quickly.\n       Tonight, not a single Russian missile is aimed at our homes \n     or our children. And we, with them, are on the way to \n     destroying missiles and bombers that carry 9000 nuclear \n     warheads.\n       We've come so far so fast in the post-Cold War world that \n     it is easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat of \n     granted. But it is still there, and we are not finished yet.\n       This year, I am asking the Senate to approve START II--and \n     eliminate weapons that carry 5000 more warheads. The United \n     States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive \n     nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons. To stop, \n     and roll back, North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear \n     program, we will continue to implement the agreement we have \n     reached with that nation. It's a smart, tough deal based on \n     continuing inspection, with safeguards for our allies and \n     ourselves.\n       This year I will submit to Congress comprehensive \n     legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, \n     whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who \n     bombed the World Trade Center can testify, the United States \n     will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.\n       Just this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel \n     killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American \n     people I extend our deepest sympathy to the families of the \n     victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard to \n     go forward. But the terrorists are the past, not the future. \n     We must--and we will--persist in our pursuit of a \n     comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in \n     the Middle East. Accordingly, last night I signed an \n     Executive Order that will block the assets in the United \n     States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt \n     the Middle East peace process and prohibits financial \n     transactions with these groups. Tonight, I call on our \n     allies, and peace-loving nations around the world, to join us \n     with renewed fervor in the global effort to combat terrorism.\n       From my first day in office I have pledged that our nation \n     would maintain the best equipped, best trained and best \n     prepared fighting force on Earth. We have--and they are. They \n     have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces since the \n     Cold War with remarkable skill and spirit. To make sure our \n     military is ready for action--and to provide the pay and \n     quality of life that the military and their families \n     deserve--I am asking this Congress to add $25 billion more in \n     defense spending over the next six years. Tonight I repeat \n     that request. We ask much of our armed forces. They are \n     called to service in many ways--and we must give them and \n     their families what the times demand and they deserve.\n       Time after time, in the last year, our troops showed \n     America at its best; helping to save hundreds of thousands of \n     lives in Rwanda. Moving with lightning speed to head off \n     another Iraqi threat to Kuwait. And giving freedom and \n     democracy back to the people of Haiti.\n       The United States has proudly supported peace, prosperity, \n     freedom and democracy, from South Africa to Northern Ireland, \n     from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America \n     to the Middle East. All these endeavors make America's future \n     more confident and more secure.\n       This, then, my fellow Americans, is our agenda--expanding \n     opportunity, not bureaucracy, enhancing security at home and \n     abroad empowering people to make the most of their own lives.\n       It is ambitious and achievable, but it is not enough. We \n     need more than new ideas changing the world, or equipping all \n     Americans to compete in the new economy. More than a \n     government that is smaller, smarter and wiser. More than all \n     the changes we can make from the outside in. Our fortunes and \n     our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer \n     questions from within, from the values and the voices that \n     speak to our hearts, voices that tell us we must accept \n     responsibility for ourselves, for our families, for our \n     communities and, yes, for our fellow citizens.\n       We see our families and our communities coming apart. Our \n     common ground is shifting out from under us. The PTA, the \n     town hall meeting, the ball park--it's hard for many \n     overworked Americans to find the time and space for the \n     things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation \n     among citizens. And too many of our children don't have the \n     parents and grandparents who can give them the experiences \n     they need to build character and strengthen identity.\n       We all know that while we here in this chamber can make a \n     difference, the real differences in America must be made by \n     our fellow citizens where they work and where they live. More \n     than ever before, as we move to the twenty-first century, \n     everyone matters and we don't have a person to waste.\n       That means the new covenant is for everybody. For our \n     corporate and business leaders: We are working to bring down \n     the deficit and expand markets and to support your success in \n     every way. But you have an obligation when you are doing well \n     to keep jobs in our communities and give American workers a \n     fair share of the prosperity they generate.\n       For those in the entertainment industry: We applaud your \n     creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your \n     freedom of expression. But you have a responsibility to \n     assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage \n     that comes from the incessant, repetitive and mindless \n     violence, and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media. \n     Not because we will make you, but because you should.\n       For our community leaders: We've got to stop the epidemic \n     of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I \n     have sent Congress a plan to target schools all over the \n     country with anti-pregnancy programs that work. But \n     government can only do so much. Tonight, I am calling on \n     parents and leaders across the country to join together in a \n     National Campaign Against Teen Pregnancy--to make a \n     difference.\n       For our religious leaders: You can ignite your \n     congregations to carry their faith into action, reaching out \n     to all our children, to those in distress, to those who have \n     been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear. Because so \n     much of what has to be done must come from the inside out. \n     You can make all the difference.\n       Responsibility is for all our citizens. It takes a lot of \n     people to help all the kids in trouble to stay off the \n     streets and in school, to build the Habitat for Humanity \n     houses, to provide the people power for all the civic \n     organizations that make our communities grow. It takes every \n     parent to teach their children the difference between right \n     and wrong, and to encourage them to learn and grow, to say no \n     to the wrong things in life and to believe they can become \n     whatever they want to be.\n       I know it is hard when you are working harder for less \n     money and you are under great stress to do these things. I \n     also know it's hard to do the work of citizenship when for \n     years, politicians in both parties have treated you like \n     consumers and spectators, promising you something for nothing \n     and playing on your fears and frustrations. And more and more \n     of the information you get comes in very negative ways, not \n     conducive to real conversation. But the truth is, we have got \n     to stop seeing each other as enemies, even when we have \n     different views. If you go back to the very beginning of this \n     country, the great strength of America has \n     [[Page S1555]] always been our ability to associate with \n     people who were different from ourselves and to work together \n     to find common ground. And in the present day, everybody has \n     a responsibility to do more of that.\n       That is the first law of democracy, the oldest lesson of \n     most of our faiths: That we are stronger together than alone. \n     That we all gain when we give.That is why we must make \n     citizenship matter again. Here are five shining examples of \n     citizenship:\n       Cindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps, \n     in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives: She is a mother \n     of four, and she says that her service ``inspired'' her to \n     get her high-school equivalency last year. Now, like \n     thousands of other members, she will use her scholarship from \n     AmeriCorps to go to college to equip herself to compete and \n     win in the new economy.\n       With so many forces pulling us apart, we cannot stop a \n     force like AmeriCorps that's pulling us together.\n       Chief Stephen Bishop gains when he gives: He has worked \n     with AmeriCorps to build\n      community policing in Kansas City--and has seen crime go \n     down because of it. He stood up for our Crime Bill and the \n     Assault Weapons ban, and knows that the people he serves \n     and the people he leads are all safer because of it.\n       Corporal Gregory Depestre gains when he gives: He went to \n     Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure \n     democracy. And he saw the people of his native land--Haiti--\n     are restoring democracy for themselves.\n       And Jack Lucas gained when he gave. Fifty crowded years \n     ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, he taught and he learned the \n     lessons of citizenship. February 20, 1945 was no ordinary day \n     for a small-town boy. As he and his three buddies moved along \n     a slope, they encountered the enemy--and two grenades at \n     their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on them both, and, in \n     that moment, saved the lives of his companions. And what did \n     he gain? In the next instant, a medic saved his life. He \n     gained a foothold for freedom. And he gained this: Jack \n     Lucas--at 17 years old, just a year older than his grandson \n     is today--became the youngest Marine in our history, the \n     youngest man in this century, to be awarded the Congressional \n     Medal of Honor.\n       All these years later, here's what he says about that day: \n     ``It didn't matter where you were from, who you were. You \n     relied on one another. You did it for your country.''\n       We all gain when we give. We reap whatever we sow. That's \n     at the heart of the New Covenant: Responsibility. \n     Citizenship. Opportunity. They are more than stale chapter \n     headings in some remote civics book. They are the virtues by \n     which we can fulfill ourselves and our God-given potential--\n     the virtues by which we can live out, the eternal promise of \n     America, the enduring dream of that first and most sacred \n     covenant: That we hold these truths to be self-evident, that \n     all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their \n     Creator with certain inalienable rights. And that among these \n     are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n       This is a very great country. And our best days are yet to \n     come. God bless you, and God bless the United States of \n     America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/25/senate-section/article/S1551-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECESS UNTIL THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1995, AT 9 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
