Mr. President, I would like to take a little time this \nmorning to speak about an issue that has simply not received the kind \nof scrutiny and attention that it deserves. That is the renomination, \nor possible renomination of Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board. Arguably, perhaps, the second most powerful person in \nAmerica today with regards to our economy and unemployment and interest \nrates and how fast our economy will grow or how slow it will grow is \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  Some have said the most important person is the President, but I \nguess to my way of thinking I think perhaps the Federal Reserve Board \nChairman is the single most important and most powerful person in \nAmerica today regarding decisions about what our economic life is going \nto be like in the months and few years ahead.\n  I say that not to denigrate the office of the President, but simply \nto point out that because of the downsizing of Government, because of \nbudget cuts, because of shifting more power from the Federal Government \nto the States, because of the diminishing role of the Federal \nGovernment in the economic life of our country--I do not mean to get \ninto a debate of whether that is good or bad. We have those debates all \nthe time around here. The fact is it is happening. Thus, it devolves to \nthe Federal Reserve Board in their deliberations about interest rates \nand discount rates and Federal fund rates to decide just what is going \nto happen in the economy. That has more of an impact on the economic \nlife of America today than anything the President can do and arguably \nmore important than anything we can do here in the Congress of the \nUnited States. Yet, this position of so much power and so much \nauthority is kind of kept in the dark corners. We have not shown much \nsunlight on the Federal Reserve, or the chairmanship of the Federal \nReserve and on who should be the Chairman.\n  Mr. Greenspan is finishing a 4-year term as Chairman. His time is up, \nI believe, in just a few days. It will be up to the President, under \nthe law, to either reappoint Mr. Greenspan or to choose someone else to \nsend to the Senate for confirmation as the new Chair of the Federal \nReserve Board.\n  I make the argument today, as I did over a week ago, Mr. President, \non the \n\n[[Page S1270]]\nfloor of the Senate, that Mr. Greenspan's time has come and gone, that \nhis feet are firmly planted in the past and that his policies are no-\ngrowth policies. They are policies of high interest rates, no growth \nthat is going to throttle our economy. Mr. Greenspan's policy has \nbeen--and I think a close scrutiny of his comments and his tenure both \nat the Federal Reserve and years ago on the Council of Economic \nAdvisers will show--that here is an individual that has little concern \nfor unemployment or what is happening to average Americans. Like a \nlaser beam, his sight is only on inflation and the bond market and \nnothing else.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that has worked to the detriment of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, it was 50 years ago today that President Truman signed \nthe Employment Act of 1946 into law--50 years ago this day. That is why \nI feel my words today are so important. That measure that signed into \nlaw 50 years ago today said that we should make it a matter of national \npolicy to help create and maintain conditions to promote maximum \nemployment, maximum production and purchasing power in our country. \nNote that it said ``maximum employment,'' to promote it as a national \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of rhetoric about the need to promote \nstrong families, but when one talks about strong families, having a \ndecent job is a crucial component of whether or not you have a strong \nfamily.\n  To further the goals of the Employment Act of 1946, Congress passed \nthe Humphrey-Hawkins Act in 1978, which by law set out a requirement \nthat the Federal Reserve have a goal to maximize full employment along \nwith stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. In other \nwords, what we were saying is, you do not just take one; they all have \nto be kept in balance: full employment, stable prices, and moderate \nlong-term interest rates.\n  Mr. President, we ought to be reaffirming those goals, but \nunfortunately some now say we should limit them instead. They want to \nprescribe low or no inflation as the sole criterion, as the sole cure \nfor all of our economic ills. Well, you can have zero inflation and you \ncan have it with very high unemployment. I do not think that is what \nour country wants.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, has a bill to provide that \nthe single goal of the Federal Reserve should be long-term price \nstability with only a secondary concern for the effects of employment. \nThe bill says the single goal of the Federal Reserve should be long-\nterm price stability. In other words, Senator Mack's bill basically \ntakes that part of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 that says that we \nshould have a goal to maximize full employment and takes that out of \nappropriate consideration.\n  Imagine that, that we should not be concerned about unemployment. I \ntell you I find that mind-boggling, that someone would even suggest \nthat we should not properly consider unemployment, we should only \nconsider long-term price stability.\n  I might understand that a Senator or Congressman or more than one \nmight prefer that option as a matter of policy, propose it at least for \ndebate. I must admit I have not spoken personally to my friend Senator \nMack--and he is my friend, the great Senator from Florida--I have not \nspoken with him personally about it. Maybe he only wants this open for \ndebate. I do not know. But the disturbing part is not that Senator Mack \nintroduced this bill, the disturbing point is that Alan Greenspan, the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, has endorsed that legislation.\n  Now, lest anyone think I am making this up, I have the hearing \ntranscript where Mr. Greenspan basically, in open hearings, said he \nendorsed that legislation. Mr. President, here is the hearing record. \nThis is a verbatim transcript from September 22, 1995, before the \nSenate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. I will just read \nthe portion about Mr. Greenspan. It says:\n\n       Your bill [referring to Senator Mack] which we fully \n     support--\n\n  The rest does not make much sense. The most important, he said, \n``Your bill, which we fully support.''\n  Mr. Greenspan has come out in support of taking out of consideration, \nin setting their policies, any concern for unemployment.\n  We will look now at the history. Between February 1994 and February \n1995, 1 year, he raised interest rates by 3 full percentage points. \nWhy? Well, in the fear that inflation might happen. But when asked, Mr. \nGreenspan himself said there was no inflation. Yet he raised interest \nrates 3 percentage points. I might point out, Mr. President, that Mr. \nGreenspan raised those interest rates five times before the election of \n1994--five times he raised interest rates. The economy came to a \ngrinding halt. Wages were depressed. People were not hiring. Business \ncould not invest. The economy became more stagnant in 1994.\n  I might also point out there has been some talk lately that the Fed \nis loosening up and starting to reduce interest rates. I can imagine \nMr. Greenspan wanting to get reappointed as Fed Chairman and wanting to \nlook good so he brought interest rates down a little bit. In 1 year, \nFebruary 1994 to February 1995, Mr. Greenspan raised interest rates 3 \npercentage points. From February 1995 to this February, they have only \ngone down three-quarters of 1 point--three-quarters of 1 point. I think \nthat says it all.\n  Again, he raised interest rates, no inflation in sight. But because \nof Mr. Greenspan's narrow vision, he damaged our economy and limited \nthe opportunity of millions of Americans to secure employment. Rather \nthan viewing rising incomes of average Americans as a good thing, Alan \nGreenspan used it as a threat of future inflation.\n  Mr. President, inflation today is at its lowest point in 30 years, \nwith only 1 year being an exception. Unemployment is now at 5.7 percent \nand has been below 6 percent for 17 months. I might point out that the \nlaw stipulates as a goal 4 percent unemployment, not 6 percent.\n  Mr. President, unemployment is high, just below 6 percent while \nInflation is down. All is not well in our economy. Real incomes of \naverage families have been falling. This past Sunday's Washington Post \nhad a chart which showed the family incomes from 1979 to 1993. The top \n20th of our Nation had their incomes rise by 29 percent, better than 2 \npercent per year for the top 5 percent of our country. However, those \nin the middle saw their standard of living drop by 2.6 percent. The top \n5 percent had their incomes rise by 29 percent; the middle had a drop \nof 2.6 percent. Those families in the bottom 40 percent of our \npopulation saw their incomes actually fall during that period of time--\nnot go up, but actually fall. For the bottom 20 percent, they fell by \nmore than 1 percent a year; the top 5 percent in income in our country \nincreased their incomes by better than 2 percent a year. The bottom 20 \npercent saw their incomes fall by 1 percent a year over that same \nperiod of time.\n  It has not always been that way. From 1966 to 1979 all groups saw \nrising incomes of more than 1 percent a year--all groups. Each one-\nfifth of the population saw real, genuine gains above 1 percent per \nyear in sharing in America's growth. Not anymore. A few at the top are \nmaking more and more and the people in the middle are either staying \nstagnant or they are going down. Now, there are probably a lot of \nreasons for this change. One of the reasons we are seeing this lack of \nincome growth across the board is a purposeful, deliberate, slow-growth \npolicy pushed by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Always \nfearful of inflation, even when little threat exists, he has used his \nposition to maximize interest rates relative to inflation, smothering \nany hint of substantial growth.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Greenspan cannot have it both ways. He cannot \nraise interest rates by 3 percent, say that there is some threat of \ninflation out there but he cannot put his finger on it, and then turn \nright around as he is raising those interest rates and suggest that the \nConsumer Price Index possibly overstates inflation by as much as 1 to \n1.5 percent. How can he say that inflation is threatening and then turn \naround and say that the Consumer Price Index overstates it by 1 to 1.5 \npercent when inflation is only about 2.5 percent per year right now. \nYet Mr. Greenspan has tried to have it both ways.\n  The President and the CBO are looking at the economy right now \ngrowing at about 2.5 percent over the long term. \n\n[[Page S1271]]\n We had a big debate here last year, Mr. President, about what the \neconomy is going to do in the future, what our budget ought to be and \neverything. If the economy can grow by an extra point, say 3.5 percent, \nthe impact on Americans' standard of living over a period of time would \nbe huge. How much? Trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars in \nadditional income for America, thousands of dollars for the average \nfamily a year, if we had a progrowth policy at the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n  Even if we cannot get to 3.5 percent, if we could get it to 3 \npercent, we could wipe out our deficit, balance our budget, provide \nbetter wages for Americans, more job opportunities and probably reduce \nunemployment. But it is going to take a different person at the helm of \nthe Federal Reserve to make this happen.\n  Now, I had in the past called upon the President to nominate a \ndifferent person, someone with a more progrowth policy to head the \nFederal Reserve. I am pleased that the President has suggested we need \na debate about the ability of the economy to perform at a higher growth \nrate over the long term. As I understand it, from reading the \nnewspapers last week, the President wanted to appoint Felix Rohatyn to \nbe Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I do not know this, but I \nassume the President felt that with Mr. Rohatyn, who is a progrowth \nindividual, there would be good debate at the Federal Reserve about the \nneed for progrowth policies. But there was solid opposition from some \non the other side of the aisle here in the Senate on the Banking \nCommittee, and they said no way would they permit Felix Rohatyn to be \napproved and to go through for confirmation.\n  I find that very disturbing, Mr. President, that a person of the \ncaliber of Felix Rohatyn is turned down before we even have one \nhearing, turned down by people on the other side of the aisle, I think, \nbecause they did not want this debate to take place. That is a shame. I \nthink it is a great loss. If America is to achieve greatness, we have \nto allow the economy to grow faster.\n  Now, bond traders on Wall Street will always be pushing for a tighter \nmonetary policy. I understand that. But the President and the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board need to look more broadly at the needs of \nthe whole economy and the welfare of American families who need an \nimproved standard of living and not just the welfare of the bonds \ntraders on Wall Street.\n  Mr. President, so I do not seem like a voice crying in the \nwilderness, I will read parts of an article by the editor in chief of \nU.S. News & World Report, Mortimer Zuckerman, February 12, 1996, \nentitled ``Chairman Greenspan, Retired.''\n  I want to read a couple parts of this, from the February 12, 1996, \nU.S. News & World Report:\n\n       The Federal Reserve Board cut the federal funds rate last \n     week, right? Wrong! Yes, nominal rates went down a minuscule \n     one quarter of 1 percent.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan looked good saying he is cutting interest rates. Mr. \nZuckerman is pointing out they really did not go down.\n\n       But real rates, adjusted for inflation, actually have \n     increased because the inflation rate has fallen faster over \n     the past several months than has the Federal funds rate. \n     Running scared from a phantom inflation, Alan Greenspan's \n     ``dear money\" leadership has caused the Fed to exert a \n     monetary choke hold on one of the weakest economic recoveries \n     since World War II, at the cost of billions of dollars in \n     lost output and tens of thousands of uncreated jobs.\n\n  Mr. Zuckerman has it right. He goes on:\n\n       Just to keep real rates where they were, the federal funds \n     rate would have had to have gone down by as much as a full \n     percentage point. Instead, we have a fed funds rate that is \n     still nearly 3 points above the most recent quarterly \n     inflation rate, much higher than normal by historical \n     standards. What's more, this is not only the wrong battle, it \n     is the wrong target. Higher interest rates hurt manufacturing \n     more than services, yet manufacturing inflation has not been \n     a problem. In fact, we are experiencing the worst \n     manufacturing slow down since 1991, and the indicators \n     suggest even more weakness ahead. Just last month, for \n     example, nonfarm employment fell by 201,000 jobs. No wonder \n     more and more businesspeople, from the National Association \n     of Manufacturers to Main Street and Wall Street, are so \n     unhappy with Federal Reserve policy.\n\n  Mr. Zuckerman goes on, in another part of his article, to say this:\n\n       The jobless recovery of the early 1990s has become the \n     wageless expansion of the mid-1990s. We have no wage pressure \n     on prices. We also have no import inflation because of a \n     stronger dollar. At the consumer level, spending is very \n     weak, reflecting stagnant personal income and real wages. \n     Retail sales growth, which averaged 7.8 percent during 1994, \n     declined to less than 5 percent in 1995. In the final quarter \n     of the year, consumer spending was growing at an annual rate \n     of 1 percent or so; adjusted for inflation, that's an actual \n     decline. As a result, so-called demand-pull inflation--when \n     hot consumer spending pulls up prices--is nonexistent. What \n     we do have is a buildup in inventories, especially of durable \n     goods, that is bound to slow the economy even more.\n\n  Last, Mr. Zuckerman closes his article by saying the following:\n\n       We must do better. The fear of inflation has proved to be a \n     chimera. Short rates have come down too little and too late \n     to boost a weakening economy. The country does not have to \n     endure the effects of the Fed's misjudgments in 1995 being \n     extended into 1996.\n       Alan Greenspan's term as Fed chairman would not survive a \n     Democratic Congress. It ought not survive a Republican one \n     either. Congressional Republicans should recognize that none \n     of their programs to cut back government will survive a slow-\n     growing economy that fails to provide Americans with good \n     jobs and a sense of optimism about the future. The \n     inflationary obsession of the Fed is not healthy; it is \n     reactionary. It is cramping out todays and sacrificing our \n     tomorrows.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Mr. \nZuckerman's article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, Feb. 12, 1996]\n\n                      Chairman Greenspan, Retired\n\n                       (By Mortimer B. Zuckerman)\n\n       The Federal Reserve Board cut the federal funds rate last \n     week, right? Wrong! Yes, nominal rates went down a minuscule \n     one quarter of 1 percent. But real rates, adjusted for \n     inflation, actually have increased because the inflation rate \n     has fallen faster over the past several months than has the \n     federal funds rate. Running scared from a phantom inflation, \n     Alan Greenspan's ``dear money'' leadership has caused the Fed \n     to exert a monetary choke hold on one of the weakest economic \n     recoveries since World War II, at the cost of billions of \n     dollars in lost output and tens of thousands of uncreated \n     jobs.\n       Just to keep real rates where they were, the federal funds \n     rate would have had to have gone down by as much as a full \n     percentage point. Instead, we have a fed funds rate that is \n     still nearly 3 points above the most recent quarterly \n     inflation rate, much higher than normal by historical \n     standards.

Just last month, for example, \n     nonfarm employment fell by 201,000 jobs. No wonder more and \n     more businesspeople, from the National Association of \n     Manufacturers to Main Street and Wall Street, are so unhappy \n     with Federal Reserve policy.\n       The traditional central bank role is to take away the booze \n     when the party gets too raucous. But what we have today is a \n     glass of water served to a gathering of teetotalers. There is \n     no inflation to fight. The nominal rate is about 2 percent \n     for the last quarter of 1995, and even that is overstated by \n     as much as 1 percentage point. In short, inflation is \n     declining instead of rising, as it usually does at this point \n     in a business cycle--a clear tip-off that the economy is not \n     in good shape. Even the Fed's key indicator of inflation--the \n     time it takes for vendors to make deliveries of capital \n     goods--is stable, in contrast to the stretching out that \n     occurred at the end of 1994. Unit labor costs (wages and \n     benefits adjusted for productivity), which make up two thirds \n     of a product's price, are no higher today than they were a \n     year ago--the first time we have had zero growth in this \n     index for 30 years.\n       The jobless recovery of the early 1990s has become the \n     wageless expansion of the mid-1990s. We have no wage pressure \n     on prices. We also have no import inflation because of a \n     stronger dollar. At the consumer level, spending is very \n     weak, reflecting stagnant personal income and real wages. \n     Retail sales growth, which averaged 7.8 percent during 1994, \n     declined to less than 5 percent in 1995. In the final quarter \n     of the year, consumer spending was growing at an annual rate \n     of 1 percent or so; adjusted for inflation, that's an actual \n     decline. As a result, so-called demand-pull inflation--when \n     hot consumer spending pulls up prices--is nonexistent. What \n     we do have is a buildup in inventories, especially of durable \n     goods, that is bound to slow economy even more.\n       Meanwhile, the deficit continues to decline and in 1996 and \n     1997 will create more fiscal drag because no agreement has \n     been reached on the budget, thereby squeezing discretionary \n     government spending even more harshly. Exports are \n     constrained by the weakness of our biggest trading partners. \n     \n[[Page S1272]]\n\n       Only corporate investment is booming, boosting supply more \n     rapidly than consumption--another clear antidote to any \n     inflationary pressure. But it isn't enough: Merrill Lynch is \n     justified in lowering its forecast for U.S. economic growth \n     to less than 2 percent for 1996, the first half being \n     particularly weak.\n       We must do better. The fear of inflation has proved to be a \n     chimera. Short rates have come down too little and too late \n     to boost a weakening economy. The country does not have to \n     endure the effects of the Fed's misjudgments in 1995 being \n     extended into 1996.\n       Alan Greenspan's term as Fed chairman would not survive a \n     Democratic Congress. It ought not survive a Republican one \n     either. Congressional Republicans should recognize that none \n     of their programs to cut back government will survive a slow-\n     growing economy that fails to provide Americans with good \n     jobs and a sense of optimism about the future. The \n     inflationary obsession of the Fed is not healthy; it is \n     reactionary. It is cramping our todays and sacrificing our \n     tomorrows.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as Mr. Zuckerman has said, we need to stop \nchasing the ghost of inflation. We need to appoint a respected \nindividual who will take a balanced view about the needs of our economy \nand not place a choke hold on our Nation each time it strives to move \nforward with any real speed. Since Alan Greenspan became Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, the economy has grown by a dismal 2.1 percent, \ncompared to 3.4 percent from 1959 through 1987.\n  Again, the cost is in the mega-billions of dollars, that it has cost \nour economy because of Mr. Greenspan's position. Many economists are \nnow looking at growth for 1996 at around 2 percent with the current \nFederal Reserve policies.\n  Mr. President, there is another meeting of the Open Market Committee \non March 26. In reading the popular press, there is some indication \nthat Mr. Greenspan has kind of leaked out that there could possibly be \nanother cut in interest rates. What, a quarter of a percent? As Mr. \nZuckerman says, the last quarter of a percent actually was not a cut at \nall. It needed to go down by a full percentage point. So, even if Mr. \nGreenspan reduces interest rates by another quarter of a percent, which \nhe is probably going to do, it does not mean that much.\n  One last thing. We should also be concerned about Mr. Greenspan's \nseeming inability to see upcoming recessions, even when he is right in \nthe middle of them. Again, what does the record show?\n  Alan Greenspan was the Chairman of Gerald Ford's Council of Economic \nAdvisers. I understand that he is the author of the famous WIN button. \nThose of us who started our political careers about that time remember \nthe button: WIN, Whip Inflation Now. Everybody wore those. President \nFord heeded Alan Greenspan's advice as he derailed job-creation \nmeasures and our Nation plunged into a recession.\n  We need to focus on Mr. Greenspan's time as Chairman of the Council \nof Economic Advisers in 1974 and 1975. It was clearly a time of high \ninflation, mainly caused by the first oil shock. But it was also a time \nof sharp recession.\n  As the Nation was moving into recession, Alan Greenspan was, \nreportedly favorable to tax increases as a means to fight inflation. He \nurged President Ford to kill legislation designed to create jobs and \nstimulate the economy.\n  A few months later, when the recession was fully in bloom, he changed \nhis mind and wanted tax cuts. But that was too late for many families, \nas unemployment exploded from 5.4 percent in the summer of 1974, \npassing 8 percent by June of 1975. I am not saying Alan Greenspan \ncaused the recession of 1974. What I am saying is he was so focused on \ninflation he could not see it coming, and he proposed just the opposite \nremedy, and that is what President Ford followed.\n  More recently, in 1990 and 1991, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, \nAlan Greenspan was very slow in reducing interest rates. Last month the \nWall Street Journal reported on the just-released Fed transcripts of \n1990. Mr. President, the transcripts of Federal Reserve Board meetings \nare kept secret for 5 years, and then they are released. We just got \nthe transcripts of the meetings back in 1990. On January 24, 1996, the \nWall Street Journal had an article by David Wessel, talking about those \ntranscripts. Here is what the article said.\n\n       Newly released transcripts of closed-door deliberations at \n     the Fed show that Mr. Greenspan didn't see a recession \n     unfolding until very late that year.\n       ``There are forecasts of thunderstorms and everyone is \n     saying, `Well, the thunder has occurred and the lightning has \n     occurred and it's raining.' But nobody has stuck his hand out \n     the window,'' Mr. Greenspan told fellow Fed policymakers on \n     Oct. 2, 1990.\n       ``And at the moment,'' he added, ``it isn't raining. . . . \n     The economy has not yet slipped into a recession.''\n       The recession, the official arbiters at the National Bureau \n     of Economic Research determined much later, began in July \n     1990, a month before Iraq invaded Kuwait.\n\n  And yet, by October, Mr. Greenspan still could not see that we were \nin a recession.\n  There is more in the Wall Street Journal article I would like to \nread, Mr. President, but I see others on the floor who would like to \nspeak. It talks about the meetings that were held in 1990 and 1991, \nwhen we were clearly in a recession. Yet, Mr. Greenspan could not see \nit.\n  ``By December 18,'' almost 6 months after the recession started, \n``Mr. Greenspan finally had enough data to conclude that a recession--\nthen nearly 5 months old--had begun.'' Again, quotes from his minutes.\n\n       ``We have severe recessionary pressures,'' he told the Open \n     Market Committee,'' but recessions always end.\n       ``At some point,'' he said confidently, ``we're going to \n     come out of this.''\n       He was right, the recession officially ended in March 1991.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this entire January 24, 1996 \nWall Street Journal article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 24, 1996.]\n\nEconomy--Even the Fed's Greenspan Is Fallible When Trying To Predict a \n                               Recession\n\n                           (By David Wessel)\n\n       Washington.--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, often \n     caricatured as a dour pessimist, didn't see the gathering \n     storm clouds when he peered into his crystal ball in 1990.\n       Newly released transcripts of closed-door deliberations at \n     the Fed show that Mr. Greenspan didn't see a recession \n     unfolding until very late that year.\n       ``There are forecasts of thunderstorms and everyone is \n     saying, `Well, the thunder has occurred and the lightning has \n     occurred and it's raining.' But nobody has stuck his hand out \n     the window,'' Mr. Greenspan told fellow Fed policymakers on \n     Oct. 2, 1990.\n       ``And at the moment,'' he added, ``it isn't raining. . . . \n     The economy has not yet slipped into a recession.''\n       The recession, the official arbiters at the National Bureau \n     of Economic Research determined much later, began in July \n     1990, a month before Iraq invaded Kuwait.\n       The Fed cut short-term interest rates one-quarter \n     percentage point in July 1990, explaining the move as a one-\n     time attempt to offset the effects of a credit crunch. But \n     despite concerns expressed inside and outside the Fed about \n     the weakening economy, Mr. Greenspan resisted cutting rates \n     again until Oct. 29, 1990, after Congress and President Bush \n     agreed on a deficit-reduction accord. That quarter-point rate \n     cut was followed by three more of the same size before the \n     end of the year.\n       At the time, the Fed was criticized by some--and by many in \n     the months that followed--for responding too sluggishly to a \n     deteriorating economy. But in public comments, Mr. Greenspan \n     has been reluctant to confess he erred, given the information \n     available to him at the time.\n       The transcripts, released yesterday after the customary \n     delay of five years, show that the Fed was contemplating \n     interest rate increases for much of the earlier part of 1990.\n       By summer, signs that a credit crunch was hurting the \n     economy proliferated. For that reason, Mr. Greenspan \n     persuaded the Fed to cut interest rates by \\1/4\\-percentage \n     point. Still, in early July, he told Fed officials that the \n     reluctance of businesses and consumers to borrow and bankers \n     to lend, ``which I believe historically would almost \n     always have dumped us into a recession, failed to do so. . \n     . .''\n       Although other Fed officials were worried about the \n     economy, they didn't anticipate a recession either. ``It's \n     clear to me the economy is weaker than as projected,'' Fed \n     governor David Mullins said in July, ``but there are no \n     compelling signs that we are headed for a recession.''\n       At a pivotal meeting on Aug. 21, however, there was growing \n     sentiment for cutting interest rates to stimulate the \n     economy, but also concern about the inflationary pressures \n     created by rising oil prices. With Mr. Greenspan's blessing, \n     the Fed agreed that interest rate cuts were likely soon.\n       But the chairman, backed by Fed staff economists, continued \n     to resist the notion that the U.S. had entered a recession. \n     ``I think there are several things we can stipulate with some \n     degree of certainty,'' he told the Fed at the Aug. 21 \n     meeting, ``namely that those who argue that we are already in \n\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n     a recession . . . are reasonably certain to be wrong.''\n       They weren't wrong, of course. But Mr. Greenspan argued \n     that there was little the Fed could do to help the economy \n     because everything hinged on oil prices. ``I would suspect at \n     this point,'' the chairman said, ``that the Pentagon has more \n     policymaking clout than we do because it's fairly obvious \n     looking around the world that if oil [prices] go up and oil \n     [production] comes down, that will have profound effects. . . \n     .''\n       Although Mr. Greenspan had the leeway to cut rates sooner, \n     he waited until Congress approved a deficit-reduction accord \n     in October. Even then, Fed economists remained optimistic \n     about the economy. ``Incoming data . . . have not provided \n     clear-cut indications that we are headed toward even a mild \n     recession,'' chief Fed forecaster Michael Prell told \n     officials in October, three months after the recession had \n     begun.\n       By mid-November, the Fed staff was losing confidence in its \n     sunny forecast. ``The signals of a downturn still are \n     limited,'' Mr. Prell told officials, ``but there certainly \n     are some now.'' Mr. Mullins, then Fed vice chairman, no \n     longer was mincing words. ``I think we have a recessionary \n     psychology in full bloom,'' he declared.\n       But even as Mr. Greenspan told Fed officials in a telephone \n     conference call on Dec. 7 that he had just cut short-term \n     interest rates to help stimulate the weak economy, he sounded \n     skeptical that it had slid into recession. New factory orders \n     still weren't showing the typical recession pattern, he \n     argued, though he continued to worry about damage from the \n     credit crunch.\n       By Dec. 18, Mr. Greenspan finally had enough data to \n     conclude that a recession--then nearly five months old--had \n     begun. ``We have severe recessionary pressures,'' he told the \n     Open Market committee. ``But recessions always end.''\n       ``At some point,'' he said confidently, ``we're going to \n     come out of this.''\n       He was right. The recession officially ended in March 1991.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we face another period of high risk for \nthe economy to plunge into recession. Do we want Alan Greenspan, whose \nmain focus has always been on inflation, to be in charge of Federal \nReserve policy? I think the answer is clearly no.\n  There are two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board. As I said \nearlier, the President wanted to appoint Felix Rohaytn to one of those \npositions, making him Vice Chairman of the Board. Mr. Rohaytn is a man \nwith an extremely distinguished career. Most notably, he is credited as \nthe guiding hand that led New York City from the edge of default and \neconomic ruin back to health.\n  I remember that debate. I was in the House of Representatives at the \ntime. I represented a very rural district from Iowa. I listened to Mr. \nRohaytn at the time as he made his case for the New York City bailout, \nas it was called, and for the Federal Government and for the Congress \nto assist in that process. It was not in my best interests, \nrepresenting a rural district, to vote for New York City. In fact, I \ntook some pretty bad political hits for doing so. But I believed it was \nthe right thing to do.\n  Congress passed it. New York City was able to pay its bills and avoid \ndefault. It solved many of its problems with a growth policy initiated \nby Felix Rohaytn.\n  He believes in growth. I find it hard to believe that anyone would \nwant to oppose his nomination. This is particularly true when the \ndiscussion was to have him as a counterweight to Alan Greenspan's \norientation to focus on inflation; to have, as I understand it, with \nthe present one, to have a debate about the policy of the Fed. But \nopposition from some on the other side of the aisle has, frankly, \nkilled the nomination of Felix Rohaytn.\n  President Clinton said last Friday that we need a debate within the \nFederal Reserve to see if the economy can grow faster than the \nconventional wisdom of a 2.5 percent average, without triggering \ninflation. We need that debate. That debate will not take place under \nAlan Greenspan.\n  The question of taking the Federal Reserve's heavy hand of high \ninterest rates off the throttle of our economy is crucial to the long-\nterm growth of our Nation. But to not even allow an appointment to move \nforward, of Mr. Rohaytn, so we can engender that debate, start that \ndebate, is absolutely wrong.\n  As I said in my remarks last week, Mr. Greenspan's feet are firmly \nplanted in the past. Mr. Greenspan's focus is not on average, hard-\nworking Americans. It is not on our families in the middle-income \nbrackets of America. It is not on the manufacturing sector that has to \ninvest and create the kind of climate that will employ people and let \nwages go up. No, Mr. Greenspan's focus is not there. His focus is some \nphantom inflation out there, and as long as inflation can be kept at \nthe lowest possible position all is right with the world in Mr. \nGreenspan's view. But as we have said in the past, Mr. President, it is \nnot just inflation that we have to be concerned about. We have to be \nconcerned about unemployment and economic growth. And Mr. Greenspan is \nnot concerned about either one of those.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I call upon President Clinton to pick \nsomeone else to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, someone who \nhas a concept of growth and what growth will mean to our economy and \nthe incomes of average Americans. We can have a debate this year. I \nthink we will have it. I hope it will happen in the Presidential races. \nI hope that we have it in all of the Senate and House races which are \nup this year--about what the proper rate of growth ought to be in this \ncountry.\n  Should it be 2.5 percent? Should it be 2 percent, or can we \nreasonably expect to grow at a faster rate? I happen to come down on \nthe side of progrowth. I believe our economy has all of the \nunderpinnings to grow at least 3.5 percent a year. I might even make \nthe argument that it can grow faster than that without triggering \ninflation.\n  We are truly in a global economy. Markets abroad can send in goods to \nthis country, and even services, to keep any kind of inflation under \ncontrol and under check. Rising wages will not push up inflation \nbecause the rising wages will just barely keep up with the rising \nproductivity of American workers. Our American workers are more \nproductive than ever before. Yet, their wages are not keeping up with \ntheir productivity. If we let wages go up a little bit, it will kind of \nkeep up with productivity. That means people have a little bit more \nmoney to go out and buy some goods. That means that our economy will \ngrow.\n  We are not having that debate. We can have that debate. As I said, I \nhope we do have it in the Presidential races, and I hope we have it in \nall of our races this year. But if we have an individual in charge of \nthe Federal Reserve who believes that growth cannot be above 2 or 2.5 \npercent, you can have all of the debates in the world, because the \nFederal Reserve is independent and they are under Mr. Greenspan's \ncontrol to throttle down on that economy. We will see a no-growth \npolicy from the Federal Reserve regardless of what we might say in our \nindividual campaigns, or what we in the Senate or the House might want \nto do in the future.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is unfortunate that the debate about \nthe policies of the Fed and about the leadership of the Fed is not \nundergoing more scrutiny than it is in our news media today. We are all \nwrapped up, I know, in the New Hampshire primary, and before that in \nthe Iowa caucuses--who is ahead? Who is behind? --and a flat tax, and \nall the other stuff. Yet, the single most powerful position in America \nthat has to do with our economy, what our future is going to be like, \nwhat our kids' future is going to be like, what our incomes and wages \nand job possibilities are going to be like, no one is talking about it.\n  Thank God that Mortimer Zuckerman at least wrote an editorial in U.S. \nNews & World Report. You see little about it in the Washington Post and \nnewspapers around the country. Everyone just assumes that Mr. Greenspan \nis going to be renominated and take the position. I do not make that \nassumption. And if Mr. Greenspan is in fact renominated by the \nPresident, he will come here for hearings.\n  I intend, if that is the case in the coming weeks, to delve more into \nMr. Greenspan's background and his philosophy and what he has done in \nthe past, and why his past actions should warrant a no vote on the \nSenate floor for his reconfirmation, if in fact the President \nrenominates him.\n  So I say--not a warning, simply as a statement of fact--that this is \none Senator who is not going to allow Mr. Greenspan, if he is \nrenominated, to sail through here without any debate. I intend to make \nit an issue, and I intend to talk about it and talk about his \nstewardship and to talk about his no-growth policies, because I think \nit is that important for our economy and for our country. \n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1269-6", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1274-S1275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on January 26 the Congress passed the so-\ncalled continuing resolution which temporarily funds the Government \nthrough March 15. This was greeted by headlines across the country. The \nheadline that touches this ran in the Washington Post saying that the \nCongress had approved a funding extension averting the third shutdown \nof Government.\n  The focus of the press and media was understandable because, in fact, \nthat continuing resolution did allow us to continue the Government \nthrough March 15. But what was not really known to the public and did \nnot become clear until later was that embedded in that continuing \nresolution was a massive cut in education, hitting programs which I \nthink most of us on a bipartisan basis in this Chamber know work.\n  There was an effort made to restore those education funds in the \ncontinuing resolution. That effort received more than a majority of the \nvotes: 51 of us voted to restore those education funds and 40 of us \nvoted against. But, because of the technicalities of the Budget Act, \nthere had to be a waiver which required 60 votes. So a majority did not \nrule on that effort to restore these education funds.\n  When I traveled around my home State of Michigan in these last few \nweeks, I must tell you I find amazement when the public realizes, I \nthink for the first time, that in that resolution that was passed to \nkeep the Government going until March 15 were historic cuts in \neducation. This was not about cuts in the growth. That is not the issue \nin this one.\n  Sometimes there is a debate around here as to whether you are slowing \ngrowth or cutting the program. On these education cuts, these are \ndollar reductions from current spending levels of a historic proportion \nin programs that most of us I think believe in. I am going to get into \nsome of those cuts in a moment.\n  But what was truly ironic is that the same day that we were cutting \nfunding for math and science teaching by $1 billion, that we were \ncutting Pell grants, and School to Work grants, which is a newer form \nof vocational education, that we were cutting college loan programs and \na whole host of other programs including Head Start, the same day that \nwe were cutting education by $3 billion on an annualized basis, we \npassed a new version of a conference report on defense spending which \nincreased it by $7 billion above the Pentagon request mainly for planes \nand ships that the Pentagon did not ask for.\n  So, on the one hand, within hours of each other we cut programs for \neducation, which are critically important, by over $3 billion on an \nannualized basis and increased defense spending by $7 billion for items \nthat the Pentagon did not request. That is a pretty dramatic \njuxtaposition, it seems to me, and terrible priorities.\n  When my people back home found out about this in a whole host of \nmeetings which I held around Michigan, they are truly against what \nhappened and are pleading with me when we come back to try to reverse \nthese cuts, because this is not a done deal. These cuts are cuts in \nprograms through March 15, which, if annualized, lead to a $3 billion \ncut. They do not have to, and they should not.\n  When this resolution was presented to us, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, said the following. He \nsaid:\n\n       I cannot for the life of me understand the action of the \n     House [of Representatives]. I believe it is wrong. It puts \n     the gun to our heads.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We have found ourselves in an extraordinary parliamentary \n     situation that requires unanimous consent to take further \n     action. Unable to secure that consent, we have been unable to \n     once again uphold a Senate position or even to have the \n     Senate consider a compromise.\n\n  Senator Hatfield pointed out correctly that the gun is to the \nSenate's head, which resulted in the passage of a resolution which will \nhave a dramatic negative impact on the funding of education in America. \nWe have to remove that gun from our head before March 15.\n  We should be here during these few weeks negotiating these issues so \nthat gun is not again put at our head, so that it is removed, and so \nthat we can try to repair the damage that resulted the last time it was \nplaced to our head.\n  The title I program, which provides crucial help in reading, math, \nand writing to over a million American children, which I think has the \nsupport of the education community across the land, that title I \nprogram was cut by $1 billion. That was a 17-percent cut in title I. By \nthe way, one of the ships which was added which was not requested by \nthe Pentagon was slightly less than $1 billion.\n  The innovative School-to-Work Program was cut by 22 percent. This is \na program which helps young people in high school make the transition \nfrom school to work. The new part of this program, which was missing in \nthe old vocational education days, is that the business community is \nworking with the high schools to design programs which will prepare \nyoung people for real jobs.\n  I have been to these programs all over the State of Michigan. I have \nbeen in a number of places where businesspeople at a meeting with \nstudents are telling the students, ``When you complete this program, \nwhen you achieve these skills that you are going to get in these \nschool-to-work programs in your high school, we guarantee you a job.''\n  I never remember anything like that happening when I was in high \nschool in the vocational education days of yore, when the business \ncommunity was deeply involved in a partnership with the schools and was \nso confident that the skills which would be provided to students would \nbe useful to them that they would sit in a room--in one case with 50 \nstudents--and tell every one of them, ``If you graduate from this \nprogram, you've got a job with our company.'' That program, that \ninnovative School-to-Work Program, was cut by 22 percent.\n  These are not 2- and 3-percent cuts across the board to help us \nreduce the deficit. These are massive reductions in programs that are \nworking. It is a 22-percent reduction in School-to-Work money.\n  Head Start was cut. In higher education, Pell grants were cut by 7 \npercent. The Perkins Loan Program was cut by 25 percent. State student \nincentive grants were cut by 25 percent. Again, I emphasize these are \nnot just slowdowns in the rate of growth; these are actual reductions \nfrom the level of funding in the last year.\n  I know there are some candidates out there who have recently \ndiscovered that middle-income Americans are in the middle of a long-\nterm economic squeeze. As the Senator from Iowa said, middle America's \nincome has dropped over the last 20 years in real terms after inflation \nand after taxes. There is a real squeeze that has been going on for a \nlong time.\n  The fact that some folks out there are discovering it for the first \ntime is not the point of my remarks this morning. What is the point of \nmy remarks this morning is that I am glad they have finally discovered \nit and that one of the ways to address it is through education.\n  We know that there is a clear relationship between the educational \nachievement of people in general and their incomes. As a matter of \nfact, the relationship between education, training, and income is \nclearer than ever and more dramatic than ever. The gap between a lack \nof education and income is greater than ever. In the last 15 years, the \ndifference in pay between college-educated workers and those with a \nhigh school education has just about doubled. There has always been a \ndifference, but that difference in just a 15-year period has about \ndoubled.\n  So we know what education can do. We know what training can do in \nterms of income. We know we face an income squeeze. So what is the \nresponse of this Congress? A significant reduction in education \nprograms that are working.\n  Head Start is working. This is not a program that has failed. This is \na program that has produced demonstrable achievement across the \ncountry. The surveys of Head Start programs show that people who \ngraduate, these 3- and 4-year-olds who are in Head Start, 10 \n\n[[Page S1275]]\nyears later and 20 years later do much better in their careers. In just \nabout every other measurable way, the 3- and 4-year-olds who had Head \nStart 10 years ago and 20 years ago or 15 years ago are doing much \nbetter than those who did not. Yet only about half of our children who \nare 3 and 4 years old who are eligible for Head Start get Head Start \nbecause of the lack of funding.\n  So what did this bill do? It cut Head Start, a program which I think, \nif not universally applauded, is about as supported a program as any I \nknow of. This is not a case where we are cutting programs which are not \nworking. This is a case where we are cutting programs which are working \nand which are essential to this country.\n\n  I know some of these cuts were used as threats, particularly by some \npeople over in the House who are determined to get their way on bigger \nbudget issues. These Members of the House who take the position, ``It \nis my way or else; it is my way or else the Government is coming to a \nhalt; it is my way or else we are going to have major cuts in \neducation; it is my way or else our debts are not going to be paid, \nwe're not going to pay interest on the national debt or on the \nobligations of this country,'' those ``my way or else'' Members of the \nHouse got their way in this continuing resolution. They should not \nhave.\n  We should not let them have their way again. I think there are enough \npeople in the Senate on a bipartisan basis who object deeply to these \ncuts in education that, if we will pull together, we can let the House \nknow, particularly those 60 or so Republicans in the House who have \ntaken this position that unless they get their way the Government is to \nshut down, it has to be their way or else the full faith and credit of \nthe United States is going to be damaged--they had their way in this \ncontinuing resolution.\n  These cuts are a reflection of a tactic, an extreme tactic, an \nirresponsible tactic of closing the Government down unless they get \ntheir way. That tactic had, I think, negative and damaging results in \nthis continuing resolution which we tried to repair. Fifty-one of us \nvoted to repair it. Then ultimately the resolution passed because, I \nthink, as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee felt, there was \nno choice. The gun was at our head.\n  We have to take that gun away, not just on keeping the Government \ngoing and restoring these education cuts, but also on the full faith \nand credit of the United States. This is a pattern which should not be \nrepeated.\n  I hope that the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, sends a strong signal \nto Speaker Gingrich that we are not going to tolerate this again and \nthat we are going to seek to restore the cuts which have so damaged \neducation programs and so left educators in a quandary as to what the \nfunding is going to be for next fall. They do not know.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to pay \ntribute and bid a fond farewell to a very distinguished statesman, a \ngood friend to the United States and a dear friend of mine--Siddhartha \nShankar Ray, India's Ambassador to the United States. Ambassador Ray \nhas decided to return to his home country, and more specifically to \nWest Bengal, to run for a seat in the Indian Parliament. I wish him \ngreat success in this and in his future endeavors.\n  As all my colleagues know Ambassador Ray has worked tirelessly during \nhis more than 3 years here to strengthen Indo-United States relations. \nIt is safe to say he has performed his duties with great distinction \nand even greater success. His service to his country here in Washington \ncame at a vital period in Indo-United States relations. With the end of \nthe cold war, past barriers to better relations with India have gone \nwith it, and vast new opportunities have emerged. We have seen \nincreased investment, trade, and cultural exchanges between our two \ncountries. We also are laying the groundwork for discussions on \nsecurity issues. Ambassador Ray has played a vital role in this \nexciting new era. I am certain he will continue to do so.\n  Ambassador Ray is an industrious and articulate diplomat, and a \ntenacious advocate for his country. The secret of Ambassador Ray's \nsuccess is simple. As Sister Mary Lauretta once stated: ``To be \nsuccessful, the first thing to do is fall in love with your work.'' \nAmbassador Ray loves India. He believes in India's future. His love of \ncountry and faith in his fellow citizens were evident throughout his \nservice here.\n  I had the opportunity to spend time with Ambassador Ray and his wife, \nMaya, last week at his farewell dinner. Both have been positive forces \nfor their country. Now, they intend to continue their already \ndistinguished service at home. No matter what path Ambassador Ray may \ntake, I am certain that all of India will stand to benefit.\n  Ambassador and Mrs. Ray will be sorely missed by all of us in the \nWashington community. But it is safe to say we can always look to \nAmbassador Ray to be an essential element in our strengthening ties \nwith India. Again, I wish my friend Ambassador Ray and his family the \nvery best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1275-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE MOORE'S FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, these are trying times for the family in \nAmerica. Unfortunately, too many broken homes have become part of our \nnational culture. It is tragic that nearly half of all couples married \ntoday will see their union dissolve into divorce. The effects of \ndivorce on families and particularly the children of broken families \nare devastating. In such an era, I believe it is both instructive and \nimportant to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``til death \nus do part'' seriously and have successfully demonstrated the timeless \nprinciples of love, honor, and fidelity, to build a strong family. \nThese qualities make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Mr. and Mrs. \nAlbert Moore who on February 24 celebrated their 50th wedding \nanniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can \ncelebrate a similar milestone. The Moore's commitment to the principles \nand values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized. I \nwish them and their family all the best as they celebrate this \nsubstantial marker on their journey together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1275-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1275-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1275-S1276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\n\n   REPORT CONCERNING THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR \n   DEMOCRACY FOR FISCAL YEAR 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 122\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the provisions of section 504(h) of Public Law 98-164, as \namended (22 U.S.C. 4413(i)), I transmit herewith the 12th Annual Report \nof the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers fiscal year 1995.\n  As the report demonstrates, the National Endowment for Democracy \nremains at the forefront of our efforts to expand and consolidate \ndemocratic gains around the globe.

A bill to provide for one additional Federal judge for the \nmiddle district of Louisiana; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 LOUISIANA FEDERAL JUDICIAL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BREAUX.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that will correct a \nserious inequity in Louisiana's judicial districts.\n  My legislation adds an additional judge to the middle district of \nLouisiana, based in Baton Rouge. U.S. District Judges John Parker and \nFrank Polozola, the two Baton Rouge judges, each have almost 2,000 \ncases pending. The national average for Federal judges is 400 cases \npending. Case filings in the middle district have totaled more than \nfour times the national average. The Baton Rouge district also ranks \nfirst among the Nation's 97 Federal court districts in total filings, \ncivil filings, weighted filings and in the percent change in total \nfilings last year.\n  Louisiana's middle district is composed of nine parishes. The State \ncapital and many of the State's adult and juvenile prisons and forensic \nfacilities are located in this district. The court is regularly \nrequired to hear most of the litigation challenging the \nconstitutionality of State laws and the actions of State agencies and \nofficials. The district now has several reapportionment and election \ncases pending on the docket which generally require the immediate \nattention of the court. Additionally, because numerous chemical, oil, \nand industrial plants and hazardous waste sites are located in the \nmiddle district, the court has in the past and will continue to handle \ncomplex mass tort cases. One environmental case alone, involving over \n7,000 plaintiffs and numerous defendants, is being handled by a judge \nfrom another district because both of the middle district's judges were \nrecused.\n  Since 1984, the middle district has sought an additional judge \nbecause of its concern that its caseload would continue to rise despite \nthe fact that its judges' termination rate exceeded that national \naverage and ranked among the highest in numerical standing within the \nUnited States and the fifth circuit. Both the judicial conference and \nthe Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit have approved the middle \ndistrict's request for an additional judgeship after each biennial \nsurvey from 1984 through 1994.\n  Mr. President, I know that my colleagues will agree with me that the \nclear solution to this obvious inequity is to assign an additional \njudge to Louisiana's middle district. I look forward to the Senate's \nresolution of this important matter.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1570. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that the \nrestriction on the assignment or alienation of pension plan benefits \nshall not apply to court-ordered criminal fines or victim restitution; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              RESTITUTION FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide crime victims a real opportunity to receive their due \nrestitution from convicted criminals. This bill would enhance \ncollections on criminal restitution orders for crime victims by \nallowing the Federal Government to garnish the pension plan benefits of \nconvicted felons.\n  Currently, courts may not garnish pension benefits provided under the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA] to satisfy criminal \nrestitution orders. As a result, criminals can avoid paying fines or \nmaking restitution to their victims when their only income consists of \npension money. In fact, in most cases, criminals have pension money as \ntheir only source of income, and therefore, they never pay off their \ndebt.\n  The amount of criminal debt had ballooned to nearly $4.5 billion by \nthe close of fiscal year 1994. The largest amount of that criminal debt \nis owed by defendants who have been ordered to pay restitution directly \nto crime victims. Over $3 billion is outstanding on these criminal \nrestitution orders.\n  We must not sit idly by and watch these criminal debt figures \ncontinue to mount year after year. Our Nation's crime victims deserve \nrestitution. It is unfair that criminals are allowed to shield their \npension funds from being garnished when those funds are necessary to \nprovide much needed restitution to their victims.\n  Mr. President, the National Victim Center supports this legislation \nand best expressed the principle behind this bill by recognizing that \ncrime shouldn't pay, but criminals should.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It will \nincrease \n\n[[Page S1277]]\ncriminal fine collection by allowing a new source of the offender's \nincome to be collected, and will help ensure that victims are properly \nand fairly compensated in a timely manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from David Beatty, \nacting executive director of the National Victim Center, be printed.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       National Victim Center,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, February 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Senator McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     express our views concerning your proposed amendment to the \n     Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 and the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n       Offender accountability has long been a corner stone of the \n     American criminal justice system. Such Accountability \n     includes not only the offender's payment of his debt to \n     society but also financial responsibility to the innocent \n     victims who suffer the severe economic consequences of the \n     crimes inflicted upon them.\n       Requiring offenders to pay restitution to their victims for \n     the harm that resulted from their criminal acts serves the \n     ends of justice in several ways. First and foremost, \n     restitution reimburses crime victims for the goods and \n     services that are essential to their physical, emotional and \n     financial recovery.\n       It also provides the kind of direct accountability to \n     victims that helps satisfy their sense of fairness and their \n     desire for justice. By engendering a greater sense of \n     personal responsibility, restitution also serves the broader \n     criminal justice objectives of deterrence and even \n     rehabilitation.\n       Studies have shown that there is a clear correlation \n     between restitution and lower recidivism rates. Offenders who \n     are held financially responsible to their victims develop a \n     greater appreciation for the hardship and human suffering \n     cause by their thoughtless criminal acts. Offenders who gain \n     a moral sense of responsibility by making payment directly to \n     their victims are less likely to commit such crimes in the \n     future.\n       Yet, none of the advantages restitution have to offer will \n     be fulfilled unless offenders are actually made to pay. Not \n     surprisingly, offenders' failures to pay have all but \n     defeated the principle and purpose of restitution as a \n     practical matter. Given the perplexity involved in locating \n     and seizing the economic resource of offenders, it is \n     extremely difficult to force offenders to pay the restitution \n     they owe.\n       Senator McCain has introduced an amendment that helps solve \n     the restitution payment problem--at least in those cases \n     where the government is already in possession of assets \n     belonging to the offender. The amendment would allow \n     government officials to divert federal pension benefits and \n     tax refunds owed to the offender directly to the victims to \n     whom the offender owes restitution. This simple and sensible \n     solution allows government officials to avoid the time and \n     expense of searching out and seizing those assets already in \n     the hands of offenders. In short, this approach is the \n     perfect incarnation of the old adage that, ``A bird in the \n     hand is worth two in the bush''.\n       Currently, the federal government is paying convicted \n     offenders who are refusing to pay their victims. The McCain \n     Amendment will effectively put an end to this unconscionable \n     practice.\n       The McCain Amendment would apply these same interception \n     mechanisms to the collection of federal fines. Since federal \n     fines are used to fund victim compensation and assistance \n     programs nationwide, crime victims have a great stake in \n     seeing that every effort is made to fully collect such fines. \n     Again, this amendment would ensure that monies owed offenders \n     by the federal government would be used to serve victims \n     rather than enrich their perpetrators. In other words, \n     ``Crime shouldn't pay, but criminals should''.\n       It is for these reasons that the Board of Directors and \n     staff of the National Victim Center fully support Senator \n     McCain's efforts to divert government payments owed to \n     offenders to benefit their victims.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Beatty,\n     Acting Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1276-6", "month":

Mr. President, Portland State University is \ncelebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Although that is a \nrelatively short life in the history of America's higher education \nmovement, Portland State University has quickly developed into one of \nthe Nation's premier urban universities.\n  This remarkable university began as the Vanport Extension Center, \nlocated in one of Portland's public housing projects. It was an \neducational resource for many of Oregon's returning World War II \nveterans. Two years after the Center was established, the famous \nMemorial Day flood destroyed the campus, but not the college. Even the \nChristian Science Monitor published a national story about the \nVanport's resurrection, calling it ``The College That Would Not Die.''\n  The college relocated to its current site in the South Park blocks \narea of downtown Portland in 1952. In 1955, my first term in the Oregon \nState Senate, the legislature officially designated it as Portland \nState College. At that time, the enrollment at PSC was more than 3,300 \nstudents--up from 221 Vanport students enrolled during its first term. \nIn 1969, as the college introduced its first doctoral program, the \nlegislature granted it university status.\n  Today, Portland State University is a national model of the urban \nuniversity. Its mission is to enhance the intellectual, social, \ncultural, and economic qualities of urban life, and to promote the \ndevelopment of community-institutional networks and collaborations to \naddress community priorities through academic and research programs. \nThe university offers 32 bachelor's and 398 master's degrees in the \nhumanities, sciences, social sciences, and professions, as well as \ndoctoral degrees in seven areas: Education, electrical and computer \nengineering, environmental sciences and resources, public \nadministration and policy, social work and social research, systems \nscience, and urban studies and planning. PSU's programs are so widely \naccepted in Oregon that it offers one-quarter of the State's graduate \ndegrees annually.\n  My wife, Antoinette, and I have been involved in this great \nuniversity since its early days. Antoinette attended Vanport Extension \nand eventually returned to Portland State College as its counselor to \nwomen. During my tenure \n\n[[Page S1279]]\nin state government, the institution emerged as one of the State's \nmajor educational resources. As Governor, I was proud to sign the \nlegislation that authorized funding for Portland State University's \nprestigious graduate school of social work. During my service as \nSenator, I have been pleased to work with Portland State University on \nlegislation that established and funded the Urban Community Services \nProgram in the Department of Education. Portland State University was \none of the first universities in the Nation to qualify for one of these \ngrants that provides seed money to help extend academic resources to \nurban communities.\n  Celebrating the 50-year milestone is important--for institutions and \nfor individuals--but Portland State University is looking toward the \nfuture and making its mark in the national higher education movement. \nIf the past half century is any indication, we can expect Portland \nState University to make significant contributions in Oregon and in the \nNation as it approaches its centennial celebration. Portland State \nUniversity is developing a model learning community in the heart of \ndowntown that will include new, multifamily affordable housing, \nconnections with public transit and the light rail system, expansion of \nretail and commercial businesses in the neighborhood, and the \ndevelopment of urban open spaces and parks. I know of no other \nuniversity in the country that is working so closely with local \ngovernment to link its resources to the needs of the community and \nrevitalize its neighborhood.\n  Portland State University has received national recognition for \nimproving its general education curriculum. Students now take courses \nthat are communication-intensive, interdisciplinary and team-taught, \nand include extensive community involvement and service learning \ncomponents. This new curriculum responds to concerns expressed by \nbusiness, policy leaders, and students that traditional general \neducation programs have not served today's students well. Called the \nUniversity Studies Program, this innovative approach to providing \nundergraduates and integrated overview of the core subject areas is a \nmodel for colleges and universities across the country.\n  Portland State University is also a success story because of its \napproach to administrative reform and commitment to the principles of \nquality management. In recent years, the university has engaged in an \nextensive reorganization of its management operation. Portland State \nUniversity has reduced its administrative and management staff while \nstill maintaining a high level of service and productivity. The \nnational consulting group, KPMG Peat Marwick has called PSU ``a \nnational model'' for efficient management. And, the National \nAssociation of College and University Business Officers recently \npresented the university with a national award for its management \nreform efforts.\n  Making a difference, that is what Portland State University is all \nabout. When it began, it made a difference to those veterans returning \nhome from World War II. It provided them the chance to get an education \nwhile working and living in Portland. And, it continues to make a \ndifference in the lives of Oregonians. Today, Portland State \nUniversity--in partnership with community organizations--makes a \ndifference in the lives of inner-city youngsters by exposing them to \nhigher education early in life so they can realize that a college \ndegree is within their grasp. Portland State University makes a \ndifference in the lives of high school students who otherwise might not \nbe able to afford a college education away from home. Portland State \nUniversity makes a difference to the working professional who needs an \nadvanced degree in order to stay current in their field, earn a higher \nwage, or qualify for a promotion. In short, Portland State University \nis crucial to Oregon's citizens and its economic future.\n  On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, I want to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to the faculty, staff, and students who have \ncontributed to PSU's success. I look forward to the exciting \ncontributions this remarkable institution will make in the 21st \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1278-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for \nS. 953, the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Commemorative Coin Act. \nThe coin will be minted to assist the effort to build a national \nmemorial to these often overlooked soldiers in our War for \nIndependence. Tax dollars will not be used to build this memorial, and, \nconsequently, its construction will be funded from the proceeds of the \nsales of this coin.\n  Their stories are tales of sacrifice and valor in battle, and, \nalthough the names of these patriots are not found in most textbooks, \nthese soldiers fought for their young nation in some of the great \nengagements of the Revolutionary War. Record Primes, for example, \ncompiled a long record and fought in some of the most storied battles \nof the War. He served in Colonel Williams' North Carolina regiment at \nthe battles of Camden and Kings Mountain in 1780 and Guilford Court \nHouse, Yorktown, Eutaw Springs, and Cowpens in 1781.\n  There are others, courageous black North Carolinians such as Joel \nTaburn, who battled the British under Colonels Archibald Lytle and \nHardy Murfree in their North Carolina regiment. He fought at the siege \nof Charleston in 1780 and at Eutaw Springs in 1781. For example, \nWilliam Steward, who had signed on with Col. John Patten's North \nCarolina regiment, saw action at Monmouth. Isaac Perkins, William \nTaburn, and Dempsey Stewart also fought for North Carolina regiments, \nand, Mr. President, these are the soldiers whom the memorial will \nhonor.\n  These men volunteered for duty--they were not compelled to serve--and \nthis memorial, which will be on a site just north of the reflecting \npool, will honor their sacrifice in the cause of freedom. I therefore \nurge my colleagues to lend their support to this bill and wish to thank \nSenator Chafee for his efforts on its behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1279-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1279-S1280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MAN OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's \nattention the accomplishments of an amazing young man. I first met Doug \nWilson in connection with legislation that I sponsored to encourage \nStates to pass universal motorcycle helmet laws. This legislation was \nincluded in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n1991 [ISTEA] and Doug was very helpful to me in getting this law \npassed. But Doug didn't stop there. He has worked tirelessly at the \nState level, encouraging State legislatures to pass effective \nmotorcycle helmet laws. Doug was instrumental in convincing the \nMaryland Legislature to pass a universal motorcycle helmet law.\n  Doug is a very convincing young man. Unfortunately, one of the \nreasons he is so convincing is because he has experienced first hand \nthe consequences of being involved in a motorcycle crash without a \nhelmet. Doug's injuries were minor except for a severe brain injury--\nthe result of hitting his head on the pavement. His journey to recovery \nhas been long and difficult but it also has been extraordinary. His \naccomplishments are many and the Journal in Maryland has just named \nDoug Wilson its ``Man of the Year.''\n  Mr. President, I cannot think of a more deserving person to be the \n``Man of the Year.'' Since Congress unfortunately repealed the Federal \nmotorcycle requirements recently in the National Highway System \nDesignation Act, I am particularly grateful that Doug, and others like \nhim, are working at the State level to educate people about the \nbenefits of wearing motorcycle helmets and the terrible consequences \nwhen they do not. I want to congratulate Doug and wish him the very \nbest in whatever he chooses to undertake in the future. I ask that the \nJournal article recognizing Doug's accomplishments be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n              After a Brush With Death, He Leads Full Life\n\n                            (By Sean Scully)\n\n       Doug Wilson was never supposed to walk or talk again \n     following a severe motorcycle accident almost five years ago.\n       But in September, he ran a 5-kilometer race--the third \n     annual Doug Wilson Thumbs Up race--and he's eager to talk \n     about it.\n     \n[[Page S1280]]\n\n       ``I was in the hospital for three months [in 1991],'' \n     Wilson said. ``It never made me upset because I said I was \n     going to be fine, I never thought [running] was something I'd \n     never be able to do again.''\n       In the spring of 1991, Wilson was a senior at the \n     University of South Carolina, only six weeks away from an \n     economics degree. The athletic and good-looking Wilson had \n     been a soccer player at Churchill High School in Potomac and \n     a place-kicker for the university's Gamecocks football team. \n     He seemed to have it all.\n       Then it came crashing down. For a still-unknown reason, \n     Wilson lost control of his motorcycle on a clear, straight \n     road. He fell and struck his head on the pavement. He wasn't \n     wearing a helmet.\n       The accident only broke three bones, but it jarred his \n     brain severely, causing swelling and plunging Wilson into an \n     eight-day coma.\n       He spent three months in the hospital and six months in a \n     wheelchair. Over the next four years, he had to relearn the \n     tasks most of us take for granted.\n       ``I have an appreciation for certain things most of the \n     whole world wouldn't understand,'' said Wilson, who has only \n     the slightest hesitation of speech, along with a shuffle in \n     his walk, giving clues to the serious injury he has overcome.\n       But Wilson's recovery is more than a personal journey for \n     him. It has involved his entire community.\n       When he first began to walk again, Wilson said, he \n     volunteered to help with local youth sports. Kids and parents \n     rallied around him, he said. The kids would pick him to play \n     on basketball teams, even though he could barely walk, let \n     alone run and jump.\n       ``They said, `we don't care, we just want you on the team,' \n     '' Wilson said.\n       He received so much support that he's made it a mission to \n     give something back.\n       ``I learned to respect kids,'' Wilson said, ``I help them \n     because they helped me.''\n       Wilson, now 27, lives with his parents In Potomac.\n       His list of activities is impressive, long enough that he \n     has trouble remembering them all: He is one of the original \n     volunteers at Club Friday, a youth program at the Potomac \n     Community Center, he is a youth soccer instructor for \n     Montgomery Soccer Inc.; he serves on two county recreational \n     advisory boards; he helped found the Potomac Adaptive \n     Basketball Association; he is an active member of the Rotary \n     Club of Potomac, and he founded the annual 5-kilometer race, \n     which benefits Club Friday and the Brain Injury Association \n     of Maryland.\n       ``To me, he's just a super human being,'' said Potomac \n     resident Randy Zeibert, whose children played on a soccer \n     team coached by Wilson. ``He does all these things and asks \n     nothing in return.''\n       In the wake of his accident, Wilson made it a personal \n     quest to see Maryland and other states adopt mandatory \n     motorcycle helmet laws. His testimony was a key factor in \n     Maryland's law, which narrowly passed the General Assembly \n     four years ago, said former state Sen. Howard Denis.\n       Denis said he was wavering on the bill, torn between his \n     desire to prevent devastating injuries and his belief that \n     the government should not place to many restrictions on the \n     public. In the end, Wilson pushed Denis to back the law.\n       ``Doug was a particularly compelling witness because he had \n     lived through it and he was very articulate,'' Denis said.\n       On top of all his other activities, Wilson returned to \n     South Carolina for a semester in 1993 and earned his degree.\n       ``I wasn't supposed to walk again, so I walked,'' Wilson \n     said. ``I wasn't supposed to go to college and take classes, \n     so I went back and graduated with my best semester in \n     college.''\n       Despite volunteering at least 50 hours a week,'' Wilson has \n     started a business, called ``We'll Keep It Clean,'' hiring \n     disabled people to clean and maintain people's property; yard \n     work, pool cleaning, and the like.\n       Disabled people, he said, make excellent workers because. \n     ``they're not interested in doing it for the money; they're \n     out there trying to prove they can do it.''\n       On top of that, Wilson lobbies state lawmakers nationwide \n     to pass motorcycle helmet laws similar to the one he helped \n     pass in Maryland.\n       ``He's just gung-ho about life,'' said Sam Eammelli, past \n     president of the Rotary Club. ``I think it's great.''\n       The key, Wilson said, is to set goals high. That way people \n     can fall a little bit short and still do better than anybody \n     else expects.\n       And his goals remain high.\n       ``Maybe someday,'' he said with a twinkle in his eye, ``I'm \n     going to try out for an NFL team.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. \n2036, the Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act. This bill, which on \nJanuary 31, 1996, passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of \n402 to 19, amends the so-called land ban provisions of the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act. Senator Nickles introduced a similar bill in the Senate, \nS. 1497, which was cosponsored by Senators Smith, Pryor, Bond, Bumpers, \nInhofe, Lott, Breaux, Johnston, Abraham, Kempthorne, Lieberman, \nFaircloth, Glenn, and Warner.\n  H.R. 2036 and its Senate companion, S. 1497, provide a model for \nmoving targeted, commonsense legislation that maintains protection of \nhuman health and the environment while removing duplicative or \noverlapping layers of regulation. It is proof that we can fix those \nparts of our environmental laws that need to be fixed without gutting, \nrepealing, or rolling back environmental protection.\n  H.R. 2036 passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming \nmargin. The legislation is strongly supported by the Clinton \nadministration. A joint letter signed by EPA, CEQ, and OMB stated that \nthe bill ``would eliminate a mandate that the Environmental Protection \nAgency'' promulgate stringent and costly treatment standards for \ncertain low-risk wastes that already are regulated in Clean Water Act \nor Safe Drinking Water Act units.'' I believe that H.R. 2036, as \namended today, ensures protection of human health and the environment \nwhile easing two specific regulatory burdens imposed by the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act. In both instances, EPA tried to reduce these regulatory \nburdens through administrative action but the Agency was rebuffed by \nthe courts. That is why this legislation is necessary. Time is of the \nessence because the Agency is under court order to promulgate new rules \nunder the current law. If we are going to provide relief, now is the \ntime to do it.\n  The primary purpose of this bill is to prevent duplicative and \ninconsistent regulation of a specific, limited category of wastes under \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act. The premise underlying the bill is that \ncertain low risk, high volume waste streams that are treated to remove \nany hazardous characteristics and that are subsequently discharged in a \nmanner meeting the standards of section 402 of the Clean Water Act or \nare injected in class I wells that have received individual permits \nunder the Safe Drinking Water Act, need not be subject to the land \ndisposal restrictions under RCRA.\n  In 1990 regulations to implement the Solid Waste Disposal Act's land \nban provisions, EPA reasoned that if low risk, high volume wastes were \nbeing treated in a manner that protects human health and the \nenvironment under the Clean Water Act in a treatment system or are \ninjected into a Safe Drinking Water Act permitted deep well injection \nsystem, then there was insufficient justification for imposing \nadditional, and perhaps inconsistent land ban treatment standards under \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act. EPA's rule was challenged in court, and \nthe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned EPA's \napproach.\n  This bill will allow EPA to grant some relief from the requirements \nof the Solid Waste Disposal Act while undertaking a study to assure \nthat the conclusions the Agency reached in 1990 are still valid. It is \nimportant to note that this bill retains the Agency's authority to \nimpose land ban restrictions and treatment standards under the Solid \nWaste Disposal Act if it is found to be necessary in the future.\n  The bill will also allow EPA to reimpose another rule vacated by the \ncourts; a rule exempting certain small municipal solid waste landfills \nfrom groundwater monitoring requirements. This provision in H.R. 2036, \nas added by this amendment, conforms with the language in S. 534, the \nInterstate Transportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act, which passed \nthe Senate on May 16, 1995.\n  This amendment contains several modifications to the House-passed \nbill that will ensure that risks to human health or the environment \nfrom decharacterized wastes receiving treatment equivalent to that \nrequired by section 402 of the Clean Water Act or injected in deep well \ninjection units that have received individual permits under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act are minimized. The amendment provides that all of \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act inspection and enforcement authorities are \npreserved and will continue to apply to so-called decharacterized \nwastes even if the waste is not subject to the land disposal ban \nrequirements as a result of this bill. The amendment protects against \npotential misuse and the use of ``sham'' treatment systems by requiring \ntreatment in Clean Water Act impoundments, not merely holding or \nstoring waste in the impoundment while it evaporates or settles or, \nworst of all, leaches into ground water. The amendment also makes it \nclear that the Administrator may act to impose additional requirements \nupon receipt of information regarding the risks posed to human health \nand the environment by the wastes managed under this act. If the \nAdministrator decides the imposition of additional requirements is \nwarranted, the authority is there to do so. The Administrator does not \nhave to wait for the results of the study.\n  I want to thank Senator Nickles, Senator Smith, chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nhazardous waste, and the other cosponsors of the bill for bringing \nthese issues to the attention of the Senate. I especially want to thank \nmy colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee for \nagreeing to clear H.R. 2036 for rapid floor action. I urge your support \nfor this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3464) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to urge the \nadoption of H.R. 2036 as modified by an amendment of the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works. The underlying House \nlegislation is virtually the same as S. 1497, the Land Disposal and \nProgram Flexibility Act of 1995 that Senator Nickles and I, along with \na broad bipartisan coalition of our colleagues, introduced on December \n21, 1995.\n  Under the current land disposal restrictions [LDR's], individuals are \ngenerally prohibited from the land disposal of hazardous wastes unless \nthese wastes have first been treated to meet EPA standards. In Chemical \nWaste Management versus EPA in 1992, the D.C. Circuit Court determined \nthat these LDR's would also be extended to nonhazardous wastes managed \nin wastewater systems that are already regulated under the Clean Water \nAct or the underground injection control [UIC] program of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. The court adopted this position despite the fact \nthat the EPA had previously adopted a rule authorizing the appropriate \ntreatment and disposal of these materials, and despite the fact that \nthe Agency believed that such strict standards are inappropriate.\n  Section 2 of H.R. 2036, as modified by the Senate, would counteract \nthe court's decision and would restore the EPA's original regulatory \ndetermination allowing these materials to be safely treated and \ndisposed of in permitted treatment units and injection \n\n[[Page S1282]]\nwells. This change represents a very straightforward yet significant \nmodification to the Solid Waste Disposal Act that has the potential to \nsave our society as much as $800 million in annual compliance costs--an \nexpense that the EPA agrees will provide no environmental benefit.\n\n  Another issue that is addressed in the Senate amended version of H.R. \n2036 is the issue of ground water monitoring legislation. In October \n1991, the EPA promulgated regulations to exempt certain categories of \nmunicipal solid waste landfills from ground water monitoring \nrequirements. Specifically, this exemption was intended to provide \nrelief for communities that had a daily disposal rate of less than 20 \ntons of solid waste and which have very little annual precipitation. \nThe EPA's authority to issue these regulations was overturned by the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Natural Resources Defense Council \nversus EPA, 1993.\n  Section 3 of H.R. 2036, as amended by the Senate amendment, is a \nvirtually identical version of ground water monitoring language that \nthe Senate passed on May 16, 1995, when it adopted the Interstate \nTransportation of Municipal Solid Waste Act of 1995. This section will \nprovide EPA with the necessary authority to implement the ground water \nmonitoring regulations that were struck down in Natural Resources \nDefense Council versus EPA.\n  As the chairman of the Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment \nSubcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this legislation, I believe \nthat this bill is a good example of a cooperative, bipartisan effort to \ncorrect expensive and needless environmental overregulation. I \nappreciate the significant time and effort that were spent by my fellow \nMembers, the White House, the EPA, our House colleagues, and staff, \ntoward speeding the adoption of this much needed legislation. In \naddition to this support, I would note that H.R. 2036 is also supported \nby the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management \nOfficials, the National Association of Counties, and the Ground Water \nProtection Council.\n  We need to act quickly to adopt this legislation. If we fail to act, \nthe EPA, due to court order, will be forced to implement additional LDR \nregulations in the next few weeks--regulations that they believe are \nboth unnecessary from an environmental standpoint as well as needlessly \ncostly for the private sector. Our House colleagues understood this \nurgency and passed H.R. 2036 on January 31 by a vote of 402 to 19. \nGiven the level of support for this important legislation, I would urge \nmy colleagues to unanimously adopt this legislation as amended so we \ncan send it to President Clinton as soon as possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the House has sent us a bill, H.R. 2036, to \namend the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, to prevent the \nduplication of regulation on dischargers of nonhazardous waste and \nthereby save hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary compliance \ncosts. It is a laudable bill.\n  Unfortunately, the House has yet to send to the Senate another needed \nchange to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in this Congress, \na bill to resolve a matter of great importance to me and to most of the \n80,000 units of local government in this country. I am talking about \naddressing their jeopardized ability to regulate the inflow and outflow \nof solid waste in their jurisdiction.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate passed S. 534, the Interstate \nTransportation of Solid Waste Act of 1995, in May of last year. This \nbill is not perfect but it contains amendments needed to resolve some \nof the interstate waste and flow control issues raised in Supreme Court \ndecisions from several years ago.\n  Interstate transportation and flow control of solid waste are \npressing matters, as is H.R. 2036. Despite this, the House has yet to \nact on S. 534 or similar legislation. This concerns me. Last week, I \nsought to add S. 534 as an amendment to H.R. 2036 by unanimous consent, \nbut was met with objections.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee if he would help me in \ninsisting that the House promptly address this matter so that we might \nget a swift resolution.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan states the \nsituation accurately. It is unfortunate that the House has not yet \nacted on S. 534 or a similar bill. I will certainly work with him to \nensure that the House understands that enactment of S. 534 is a \npriority for the Senate in this Congress. And, the Senator certainly \nretains his right to offer S. 534 to other vehicles, should he so \nchoose. In the meantime, I appreciate his willingness not to stall \nprogress on moving H.R. 2036.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I hope he will work \nwith me on other vehicles to which I can attach S. 534 in the very near \nfuture, if the House fails to act promptly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed \nread a third time, passed as amended, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2036), as amended, was deemed read the third time \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/20/senate-section/article/S1280-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF GEORGE W.

As in executive session, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the Agreement \nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, 1982, relating to the \nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly \nmigratory fish stocks, with annexes, which was adopted by the U.N. \nheadquarters in New York by consensus of the U.N. Conference on \nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks on August 4, \n1995, and signed by the United States on December 4, 1995, (Treaty \nDocument 104-24), transmitted to the Senate by the President on \nFebruary 20, 1996; and ask that the treaty be considered as having been \nread the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that \nthe President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement for the Implementation \nof the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of \nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, with Annexes \n(``the Agreement''), which was adopted at United Nations Headquarters \nin New York by consensus of the United Nations Conference on Straddling \nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks on August 4, 1995, and \nsigned by the United \n\n[[Page S1283]]\nStates on December 4, 1995. I also transmit, for the information of the \nSenate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the \nAgreement.\n  The Agreement represents a considerable achievement for the United \nStates in promoting better stewardship of living marine resources. It \nstrikes a sound balance between the interests of coastal States in \nprotecting offshore fishery resources and those of States whose fishing \nvessels operate on the high seas. If widely ratified and properly \nimplemented, the Agreement should significantly improve the prospects \nfor sustainable fisheries worldwide.\n  The Agreement builds directly upon, and strengthens, the fishery \nprovisions contained in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law \nof the Sea (``the Convention''), which I transmitted to the Senate for \nadvice and consent on October 6, 1994. As such, the Agreement further \nreflects the central role of the Convention in governing the maritime \nrelations of the international community.\n  Perhaps more than any other nation, the United States stands to \nbenefit from widespread adherence to this Agreement. The Agreement will \nhelp to ensure that the harvesting of fish by vessels of other nations \nin waters beyond our exclusive economic zone does not undermine our \ndomestic management of fisheries within the U.S. jurisdiction. In \naddition, by promoting sound conservation practices generally, the \nAgreement can restore and maintain productive ocean fisheries for the \nbenefit of American consumers and for U.S. fishing vessels wherever \nthey operate.\n  With regard to disputes concerning the interpretation or application \nof the Agreement, I intend to choose a special arbitral tribunal \nconstituted in accordance with Annex VIII of the Convention, as \nrecommended in the accompanying report of the Department of State.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Agreement and give its advice and consent to its ratification.\n                                                  William J.
