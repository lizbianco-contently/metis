Mr. President, the first legislative action I took when \nI came to Congress in 1979 was to introduce a constitutional amendment \nto require a balanced budget.\n  I believed 16 years ago, as I believe today, that Government must \nlearn to live within its means. I believed then, as I believe now, that \nwe must trim the fat, cut the waste, and make the tough choices \nnecessary to control spending.\n  I supported a balanced budget amendment then and I remain committed \nto an honest, fair, and forthright amendment now.\n  However, I have concluded I cannot support the one which is now being \npushed through the body, without amendment or compromise.\n  The magnitude of the decision about how we propose to amend the \nConstitution should not be lost on anyone. A balanced budget amendment, \nif passed and ratified, will have a dramatic effect on the very nature \nof government and its relationship to the American people in all \nperpetuity. We cannot come back next year or next Congress and clean up \nour mistakes.\n  When we embark on such a path--to amend the Constitution--we must \nknow that it is the best amendment we can write, that it incorporates \nthe best ideas and the most carefully written words we have to offer.\n  It is critical now, as we contemplate amending the Constitution for \nonly the 28th time, that we refuse to succumb to the notion that what \nwe do is, as the old adage goes, ``good enough for Government work.''\n  This effort had a noble beginning. It was the result of the tireless \nwork of the Senator from Illinois, the Senator \n[[Page S2772]] from Utah, the Senator from Idaho, and many others to \nenforce fiscal discipline, something we all recognize is necessary.\n  The refusal to consider legitimate amendments, amendments that would \nmake this constitutional amendment even stronger, has reduced this \neffort to something far less than our best.\n  When this debate began I expressed my concerns about the balanced \nbudget amendment proposal before Members. I expressed a sincere hope \nthat we could work together to address them and craft the best \nconstitutional amendment this Senate could write on behalf of all the \nAmerican people.\n  First, as many argued last year, Social Security should be viewed as \nan indelible contract between the Government and the American people, \nfunded by a dedicated trust fund that should be left out of budgetary \ncalculations. As written, it is clear that the current proposal uses \nthe Social Security trust fund to mask the true size of the deficit, \nsomething that is patently inconsistent with our goal to balance the \nbudget.\n  As a result it is estimated that $705 billion of Social Security \ntrust fund revenue will be used to mask the real size of the national \ndeficit between now and the year 2002. In fact, that very issue was \nconfirmed again this morning in the Wall Street Journal.\n  A speech that the majority leader gave yesterday to a group indicated \nthat he saw the size of the deficit over the course of the next 7 years \nto be somewhere in the vicinity of $685 billion, which would require \nsome form of health care reductions to reduce that deficit to below the \n$685 billion mark he suggests. Mr. President, $685 billion, if that is \nthe size of the deficit as my Republican colleagues would see it, \nclearly implies that the $705 billion for Social Security is still on \nthe table in spite of all of the best efforts made by many Members on \nthe other side to indicate the contrary.\n  Second, I believe that budgetary discipline, common sense, and our \nlong-term investment goals warrant the establishment of a budget that \ndistinguishes between investment and consumption. We ought to use this \nopportunity once and for all to establish the same budgetary principles \nused by businesses and by most State governments.\n  Finally, as we have argued at some length during this debate, the \nAmerican people have an absolute right to know how we plan to fulfill \nthe promise of a balanced budget before they are called upon to ratify \nit. Working with my Democratic colleagues, we have proposed three \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment approaches in a good-faith \nattempt to address those concerns and make the underlying amendment \nmore sound.\n  Unfortunately, each of those amendments has been rejected essentially \nalong party lines. The only way I can interpret those votes is that the \nmajority is saying, ``We want our balanced budget amendment or no \namendment at all.'' They are telling the American people to put their \ntrust in good intentions and to live with consequences that are yet \nunknown.\n  We should support a balanced budget amendment. But we should never \nviolate America's contract with its senior citizens merely because we \nare unwilling to make the tough choices now. Balancing the budget by \ncutting Social Security is no balanced budget at all.\n  Making tough choices is also an important part of what every family \nand every business must do. When a family balances its budget, we \nseparate investments in our future, our home, our savings for our \nchildren's education, from the day-to-day expenditures on things like \nfood and clothing. We are willing to borrow money to buy a home or pay \nfor college but we cannot afford to take on too much debt because the \ninterest is part of our day-to-day expenses and cannot exceed our \nincome.\n  In short, we separate our capital budget from our operating budget. \nNearly every State, nearly every business, small or large, does exactly \nthe same thing. Everybody separates these two budgets except for the \nFederal Government. Just yesterday we proposed an amendment that said, \nlet's be honest with the American people about the budget process. \nSeparate investment from daily operating expenses. Do at the Federal \nlevel what has always been done in the States.\n But that proposal, too, was rejected.\n\n  I support a balanced budget amendment, but I also share the belief \nthat we owe it to the American people to tell them how we will do what \nthe amendment requires. We must not substitute political slogans for \nstraight talk. We must not cover up the reality with rhetoric. We must \nnot ask South Dakotans, or any Americans, to trust us or future \nCongresses if we are not willing to give them good reason to do so.\n  We cannot build a house of credibility if we do not produce the \nblueprint first. Neither can we build that house without knowing what \ntools to use. The American people have a right to know how we are going \nto achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Two years ago when a Democratic Congress cut $500 billion from the \ndeficit, we gave the Congress and the country a blueprint of our list \nof budget-cutting tools--page after page of painful cuts. Everyone \nrecognizes what an unpopular vote that was, how difficult it was to \nmake those choices, to lay out with specificity, line by line, item by \nitem, exactly what we were going to do over the course of the next 5 \nyears to reduce spending by $500 billion. And because it was tough, \nbecause it was specific, it passed by a single vote.\n  Today the American people have the same right to know. They have a \nright to know what is in the plan. They have a right to know whether \nthe majority plans to cut Medicare, student loans, or veterans \nbenefits.\n  Our deficit reduction target is at least $1.2 trillion--$1.2 \ntrillion--over the course of the next 7 years. It is not going to get \nsmaller, and with each year of delay, it is going to be exacerbated. It \nis a daunting goal, we all recognize that, but we all recognize, too, \nthat it must be met.\n  The question, frankly, is how. How are we going to do it? How are we \ngoing to do what the speech by the majority leader yesterday suggested? \nAre we going to keep Social Security on the table and talk about a debt \nthat is only $685 billion? Are we going to include everything, put it \non the table, recognize that if we are going to increase defense \nspending, if we are going to cut taxes, if we are going to protect \nSocial Security and do all of this in the next 7 years, that we are \ngoing to do it using the tools that we have available to us?\n  Americans have a right to know. We have a responsibility to tell \nthem.\n  I proposed the right-to-know amendment to the Constitution that would \nboth require a balanced budget and require Democrats and Republicans to \nwork together to draft a plan and make it public. But the amendment was \ndefeated, and the result will be that this Congress will collectively \nsay ``no'' to being honest with the American people, leaving us with \nonly the hope--only the hope--that we can accomplish our goals. No \nblueprint, no mechanism in place, no real plan. Just a hope that \nsomehow we can do something in 7 years that we have not been able to do \nin decades.\n  Everyone would agree that the idea of a balanced budget in the \nabstract has universal support. But no budget is balanced in the \nabstract. Budgets are balanced in the context of existing \ncircumstances. We have a new majority in Congress that claims it will \ncut taxes, increase defense spending and balance the budget, but \nrefuses to explain how and refuses to guarantee that it will be \naccomplished fairly.\n  Last year, I supported a balanced budget amendment. This year, in \nthis context, I cannot.\n  Last year, a Democratic Congress was committed to protecting Social \nSecurity and Medicare. This year, the new majority has been unwilling \nto do so in law. Last year, Congress honored the people's right to \nknow. Last year, Congress was committed to an open, honest debate about \nhow to reduce Government spending.\n  Last year, Congress leveled with the American people. This year, the \nmajority refuses to acknowledge Americans' right to know.\n  This country is in need of a serious, principled debate about our \nfuture and our increasing national indebtedness. It should be a debate \nabout the generational debt that we owe our children and how best to \ndischarge it. It should be a debate about the ways past Government \ncommitments to Americans will always be kept. It should be a \n[[Page S2773]] debate about rational fiscal policy, about consumption \nversus investment, savings over spending, and all of the elements that \ntogether make up a sound basis for future economic growth. It should be \na debate about what we hold to be most important now and in the future.\n  That debate may never come. Yet, I deeply hope it will come, and when \nit does, I hope we will have an opportunity to write an amendment to \nthe Constitution that represents our best effort, one which will stand \nthe test of time, a balanced budget amendment that honors our past \ncommitments, protects our future investment, and tells the American \npeople the truth. It must be a serious obligation, not merely a \nstatement made of good intentions.\n  Finally, while I believe we need an honest and fair balanced budget \namendment, I know we need an honest and fair balanced budget even more. \nWe can and we must get immediately to the real work of deficit \nreduction. I know I speak for my Democratic colleagues when I say we \nare ready to work with the majority right now to develop a budget \nresolution that cuts spending and balances the budget. It is an effort \nwhich requires bipartisan cooperation as well as concentration.\n  So, Mr. President, whatever the fate of this amendment, it is time \nfor us to work together to fulfill that promise and renew the hope of \nall American people that at long last--at long last--we can accomplish \nwhat we all want and what our children deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2771-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2773-S2774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader's remarks. I know he is very serious \nabout the issue of debts and the deficit that we have each year. I know \nhe is serious about a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget \nbecause he voted for it just 1 year ago. And I believe and certainly \nhope that in the end, he will vote for the balanced budget amendment \nthis year.\n  I believe this has been a very serious, principled debate. This \nlegislation, which is identical to the balanced budget amendment the \nDemocratic leader voted for last year, has been carefully drafted. I \nremind my colleagues that it passed the other body by a vote of 300 to \n132--an overwhelming bipartisan vote after serious consideration in the \ndebate before the House of Representatives. Our own Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported it out after careful consideration on a bipartisan \nvote.\n  A number of amendments have been offered, considered, debated, and \nvoted on, and all of them have been defeated by bipartisan votes. On \none of the votes yesterday, there were actually nine Democrats who \nvoted to table it, while eight Republicans voted against tabling it. So \nwe are having a very serious debate here with Members voting their \nconscience.\n  We are now in the 18th day of debate on this constitutional amendment \nfor a balanced budget. Last year, we had an extended floor debate and a \nvote on this exact amendment. I think the high water mark, up until \nthis year, for debate on a constitutional amendment for a balanced \nbudget has been about 11 days. So we certainly are giving it plenty of \ntime for thoughtful consideration. And because of delays in getting an \nagreement when we might bring this to a conclusion, we apparently will \nstill be on this amendment next week. It will have been a full month \nthat we have taken to consider this legislation. That is fine because, \nin the end, I believe we are going to pass it with a good, strong \nbipartisan vote.\n  Let me quote some very strong words in support of the balanced budget \namendment:\n\n       To remedy our fiscal situation, we must stop spending \n     beyond our means. This will not require the emasculation of \n     important domestic priorities as some suggest.\n       In this debate on a balanced budget amendment, we are being \n     forced to face the consequences of our inaction. Quite \n     simply, we are building a legacy of debt for our children and \n     grandchildren and hamstringing our ability to address \n     pressing national priorities.\n\n  Those are the words of the distinguished Democratic leader just last \nyear, February 28, 1994, in support of a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  With regard to the right to know, we need to work together on this. \nWe cannot say today everything that we are going to do in a budget \nresolution this year or next year or in 5 or 7 years. It will depend on \nthe Budget Committee, the vote and actions on the floor of the Senate. \nIt will take all of us working together, no matter where we are from, \nwhat party or what philosophy.\n  With regard to the right to know, this is what the distinguished \nDemocratic leader said just last year:\n\n       Congress and the President will have 7 years to address the \n     current deficit and reach a consensus on our Nation's budget \n     priorities. We will have time to find ways to live within our \n     means and still meet existing obligations to our citizens, \n     particularly the elderly.\n\n  I agree.\n  But this year, we debated the right-to-know amendment, and it was \nrejected with 56 votes against it--again a bipartisan vote.\n  With regard to protecting our seniors, minority leader Daschle last \nyear said:\n\n       Requiring the Government to operate within its budget does \n     not mean * * *  we would be forced to renege on our current \n     obligations to America's seniors. For my part, such a \n     requirement would not lessen our commitment to * * * \n     protecting Social Security.\n\n  I agree. Last year, the minority leader also said:\n\n       By the year 2020, most of the baby boom generation will \n     have retired, and those retirees will be supported by a \n     smaller working population. In order to ensure that we can \n     meet our commitments to future retirees without jeopardizing \n     the standard of living of working men and women, we must seek \n     to maximize economic growth during the early 21st century. \n     Our current budget deficit is eating away at that growth and \n     undermining our economic potential.\n\n  The point the minority leader made last year is that if we do not \nhave a balanced budget amendment, if we do not get our fiscal house in \norder, the people who will suffer the most are our seniors. So I think \nthe minority leader's comments--and I have many others--just 1 year ago \non the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget were excellent. I \nagree with them. I voted with him then, and I hope we are going to vote \ntogether this time because this is exactly the same amendment we both \nvoted for just last year.\n  I remind my colleagues, too, that just 1 year ago when I offered an \namendment to try to block tax increases on Social Security retirees, \nsome of the same people who are now pleading their concern for our \nseniors and their Social Security benefits, where were they when we \nwere trying to block on a bipartisan vote tax increases on their \nretirement benefits? Where were they last year? Why were they not \nworried about Social Security retirees, Medicare and Medicaid, then?\n  Where were they last year when the President proposed billions of \ndollars in cuts in Medicare in his health care proposal? President \nClinton proposed to cut Medicare by $124 billion over 5 years in his \nhealth care plan. And in 1993, the President cut $53 billion from \nMedicare as a part of his tax bill. Were they not worried about the \nseniors then? Were they not worried about Medicare then?\n  Look, the issue of right-to-know is another red herring; it is simply \nan attempt to scare seniors about Social Security. It boils down to a \nvery simple question: Are you for a constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget or not? If you are, you vote yes. If you are not, vote \nno. And the people will know how you feel about this. Are you prepared \nto explain how this year you are against the balanced budget amendment \nbut last year you voted for it? Why? Is it because there is a different \nmajority? I cannot believe that.\n  We have an opportunity here to do what is right for our country--to \nhave the additional pressure on Congress to control spending, not raise \ntaxes.\n  Everybody keeps saying, Oh, we reduced the deficit in 1993. The so-\ncalled \n[[Page S2774]] 1993 deficit reduction bill was attempted to reduce the \ndeficit through massive tax increases. We can move this whole debate in \na different direction. And I have been here through 22 years of trying \nto deal with the deficit--through Gramm-Rudman, through the Gang of 17, \nand through the budget negotiations at Andrews Air Force Base. Congress \nhas tried time and time again to balance the budget, but we never quite \ncarry through with it.\n  We need this constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. The \nAmerican people support it overwhelmingly. This is our opportunity. And \nwe must, must find a way to come together to pass it. I know it is \ngoing to be a bipartisan vote; one of our key proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment has been the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Simon.\n  The balanced budget amendment has already passed the House. It is up \nto the Senate. If we vote now, it goes to the States. The people will \nhave a chance to decide. The only thing standing between the people's \nopportunity to vote on this and its passage is how the Senate will \nvote.\n  I urge my colleagues, let us begin to bring this to a conclusion. Let \nus quit talking about red herrings. Let us face up to the real issue \nand vote for a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. My friend, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, \nmade reference to some comments I made last year. Let me respond \nbriefly because I know there are others waiting.\n  I made them in earnest last year, and I stand by them this year. \nNothing the Senator from Mississippi said with regard to my comments \nlast year are any less true this year. What I said then applies now, \nand that is my whole point. If we are going to have a balanced Federal \nbudget, good intentions are not enough. It is not enough to just say we \nare going to do it. We must be serious about it, and that is the \nquestion.\n  When I made those comments last year, we were serious, and we proved \nwe were serious with a $500 billion deficit reduction plan that laid \nout with specificity exactly what we were going to do.\n  Where is the plan this year? How are we going to do it this year? On \njust a hope, somehow the expectation that it is all going to magically \ncome together?\n  That is what we are saying. That is why this right to know amendment \nis so important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair might intervene for a moment to say \nto the distinguished Democratic leader, his time has expired under the \nprevious order, and the time is now under the control of the acting \nmajority leader. If he chooses to yield time to the minority leader to \ncomplete his remarks, up until 10 o'clock, he may do so.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know our two leaders will be speaking at \n10 a.m. for 15 minutes each. Unless there is a problem with his other \ncolleagues, I will be glad to yield the remaining 4 minutes to the \nleader to conclude his remarks.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the willingness of the whip to do \nso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader may proceed, then.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me finish very briefly.\n  Mr. President, I agree with exactly what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi said about what the issue is, with the exception of \none word. He said the issue is very simply do we support a balanced \nFederal budget, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I think that is a legitimate question, and the answer should be yes. \nBut it should not be are we willing to support any constitutional \namendment to balance the Federal budget, any constitutional amendment. \nThe answer is no. This is going to be with us for all perpetuity, all \nposterity, and if it is going to be with us that long and if it is that \nimportant and will have that far-reaching a consequence, we had better \ndo it right because we will not get a second chance.\n  With that, again, I thank the Senator for yielding, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, I refer to the distinguished Democratic leader's \ncomments last year because they were so persuasive then, and I believe \nthey are now. I will just quote these two paragraphs and yield the time \nfor others.\n\n       Some of my colleagues feel, as does President Clinton--\n  This is Senator Daschle speaking.\n\n     that we can make these tough budget choices without amending \n     the Constitution. I wish they were right, but history \n     indicates they are not.\n       By adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \n     we as a nation are embracing the principle that government \n     should not spend beyond its means. This is a principle worthy \n     of inclusion in the document that sets forth the limits of \n     governmental power and protects the rights of individual \n     citizens.\n\n  Those are the words of Senator Daschle, the distinguished Democratic \nleader.

Mr. President, I rise today to remind Americans of one of \nthe costliest battles of World War II, and the sacrifices made by the \nmen of the United States Marine Corps. This Sunday will be the 50th \nanniversary of the Marine Corps landing on Iwo Jima, a place where, as \nAdmiral Nimitz said ``Uncommon valor was a common virtue.''\n  After 36 days of fighting and at a cost of 6,821 Americans killed and \n19,217 wounded, the island was captured. The cost to the Japanese \ndefenders was over 22,000 lives. Only about 1,000 Japanese survived the \nbattle.\n  The Japanese had long prepared for the February 19, 1945, invasion. \nAfter the battle was over, it was revealed that the enemy had \nconstructed 642 blockhouses, pillboxes, and other gun positions. The \nmarines landing on Iwo Jima were certainly stepping into the very jaws \nof the enemy--and I might say, the very jaws of hell.\n  At 9 o'clock in the morning, the massive assault wave of the 4th and \n5th Marine Divisions hit the beach at Iwo Jima. A Japanese observer \nwatching the drama unfold from a cave on the slopes of Mount Suribachi \nreported: ``At 9 in the morning, several hundred landing crafts with \namphibious tanks in the lead rushed ashore like an enormous tidal \nwave.'' Within minutes, 6,000 marines were ashore, and initial \ncasualties were lighter than expected.\n  Then the pounding started as the Japanese commander unleashed \nhundreds of heavy artillery pieces, giant mortars, rockets, and \nantitank weapons that had been carefully arranged around the landing \nbeaches now clogged with troops and materials. The ensuing bombardment \nwas as deadly and terrifying as the marines had ever experienced. \nCasualties mounted appallingly on what would become the costliest \nsingle day in the U.S. Marine Corps history. By the day's end, nearly \n2,500 Marines were killed or wounded.\n  Typical of the marine heroism and sacrifice of that first day on Iwo \nJima, and not unlike what I had witnessed while serving in the Marine \nCorps with the 9th Regiment in the Pacific, were the actions of \nlegendary Marine Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone. ``Manila John,'' as he \nwas fondly called by his fellow marines, had been awarded the \n[[Page S2775]] Congressional Medal of Honor in recognition of his \noutstanding heroism at Guadalcanal. On Iwo Jima, Basilone single-\nhandedly destroyed a Japanese blockhouse while braving the deadly \nassault of enemy heavy caliber fire. For his exploits he was \nposthumously awarded the Navy cross.\n  The battle for Iwo Jima raged for 36 long days, and on many days the \nadvances of the American forces could be measured in yards. Though I \nwas not there because I was recovering from a wound I received during \nthe battle of Guam, my outfit, the 3rd Division, served as the floating \nreserve for this battle.\n  Entering the fray on February 21, when the fighting was at its worst, \nthe soldiers of the 3rd Marine Division were tasked with clearing the \ncentral plateau of the island. This area held many prepared enemy \ndefensive positions, but very little cover for the advancing Marines. \nBy the time the plateau was taken, the regimental casualties exceeded \n50 percent. Some companies suffered casualty rates in excess of 200 \npercent, including my old company, A Company, of the 9th Regiment.\n  Considering the magnitude of these casualties, one may wonder what \ndrove these men to carry on. From my own experience, I would say these \nmen drew their strength from the support of their fellow marines, an \nesprit de corps that is unique in military history, and the knowledge \nthat taking this island was important to the war effort. Most \nimportant, however, they fought because they knew they had to fight. \nThey had to take that hill, that they had to take that island. The \nCommander in Chief had said it, and these men knew it in their hearts, \nvictory was the only way home.\n  On March 26, 1945, finally, the Japanese were defeated and the island \nwas ours.\n  On Sunday, the 50th anniversary of the landing on Iwo Jima, \napproximately 5,000 survivors of the battle will gather at the Iwo Jima \nMemorial here in Washington to remember and to pay reverence to those \nwho gave their lives.\n  Mount Suribachi, and the flag raising on that mount, stands as a \nsymbol of the courage of the U.S. Marine Corps. Mount Suribachi was 556 \nfeet high. It bristled with over 200 guns, and 21 blockhouses. It had \nto be taken, because it was delivering devastating fire on the beaches \nand to the marines that were below. The marines assigned were willing \nto risk their lives for the sake of their comrades and their country. \nSo, through personal courage and esprit de corps, on February 23 the \nJapanese defending Mount Suribachi were overcome and the Stars and \nStripes were raised.\n  And as the flag was raised on that mount, it gave additional strength \nto the marines below to move forward, on to victory. We salute the \nsurvivors of Iwo Jima and wish them well as they commemorate that very \nimportant battle of World War II.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2774-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2775-S2777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE CLOTURE VOTE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at 10:30, in less than 25 minutes, there \nwill be a vote on the majority leader's cloture motion. I want to take \na couple of minutes to comment on that prior to the time we vote.\n  I regret we have to take a vote at this time. I believe, frankly, as \nI said the other day, it is unnecessary. I am concerned that it sends \nthe wrong message to the American people about how seriously we \nconsider the process of amending the U.S. Constitution.\n  The implicit suggestion behind the motion is that shutting off debate \non this very serious and complicated issue is necessary because \nDemocratic Senators are filibustering the balanced budget amendment and \nobstructing the debate, when the truth is just the opposite. There is \nno filibuster here. There have been very few quorum calls over the last \nseveral days. The Senate floor has been busy, virtually every minute. \nSenators have been on the floor. They have been here offering \namendments, debating the issues. They have been busy doing exactly what \nwe are all elected to do, to consider carefully some of the most far-\nreaching issues that they and the American people face.\n  Democratic Senators have not employed dilatory tactics. To the \ncontrary, we have offered legitimate and very serious amendments that \nought to be given serious consideration by all Senators--several \namendments that, in my view, as I said just a moment ago, would have \nmade this particular balanced budget amendment much stronger. \nUnfortunately, the obstruction has come from the other side. Every \nDemocratic amendment has been tabled--virtually along party lines. \nAnyone who has been on or watched this debate over the last several \ndays knows very well that the substance of these amendments has been \nseemingly of little concern. They have been tabled, not because of \ntheir content, but simply because they were offered.\n  This issue is far too serious to simply step aside and avoid the \nstampede. Amending the Constitution is just about the most serious step \nthe Congress and States can take. It should not be taken lightly. And \nit should reflect the most thoughtful and inclusive debate that we have \nto offer. It should reflect the best ideas we have to offer. A vote to \ncut off this debate artificially is a vote to obstruct that thoughtful \nand inclusive process. It is premature, it is unnecessary, and, under \nthese circumstances, I view it as a disservice to the American people.\n  It is also a direct threat to the rights of all Democratic Senators, \neach of whom have a right to offer amendments. As I said, there have \nbeen virtually no quorum calls; virtually every amendment has been \nrelevant. In recent days nearly every Democratic Senator has agreed to \na time limit on the debate on his or her amendment. And these have been \nimportant amendments.\n  We debated, as we again talked this morning, about the right to know, \nand spelling out to the American people how we are going to accomplish \na balanced Federal budget--what kind of blueprint we are going to use, \nwhat kind of tools we will acquire and utilize to accomplish a balanced \nbudget in just 7 years.\n  We talked about Social Security and the need to protect it, to take \nit off the table to ensure that we are not going to mask the size of \nthe debt with the size of the Social Security trust fund.\n  We talked about enforcement. Simply saying we are going to balance \nthe budget with no legal mechanism in place to ensure that we are going \nto enforce what we say we are going to do makes anyone wonder just how \nserious we are about doing it in the first place.\n  We talked about the need to separate operating capital from \ninvestments in the future--how we do that in business, how we do that \nin State governments, how we need to compare apples and apples when we \ncompare the Federal Government to the State government and how a \ncapital budget would allow us to do that.\n  We talked about circumstances relating to natural disasters. The \nSenator from California raised a very difficult issue. How do we \naddress serious problems relating to the disasters that occur in every \npart of the country all too frequently once we have a balanced Federal \nbudget?\n  It is very disconcerting that virtually every amendment was defeated \non a near party-line vote. Regardless of the vote, there are many more \nvery important, relevant amendments that deserve our careful \nconsideration. Not all amendments that are pending will be offered. I \nknow that mention was made yesterday about how many amendments are \nstill pending. Some of those amendments were offered just to protect \nDemocratic Senators in case there is a cloture vote and it passes. We \nknow what happens when cloture votes are filed. Amendments are also \nfiled simply to ensure that every Senator has a right to protect \nhimself or herself. That is really what has gone on in the last couple \nof days. Senators want to know that they have the opportunity to be \ninvolved in this debate and to commit to a process by which these \nissues can be raised. That is what filing amendments is all about in \nsituations as we have this morning.\n  We may be able to come to some agreement. In fact, I would almost \nensure, to our colleagues on the other side, that we will come to some \nagreement with regard to a finite list of amendments and some way with \nwhich to work through them as we have done in several of our bills \nalready this year.\n  The point is no one is trying to delay a final vote. We know that the \nfinal \n[[Page S2776]] vote will come in the not too distant future. But it is \nabsolutely critical, especially on an issue of this importance, that \nall Members have a right to be heard.\n  So this cloture vote is not necessarily reflective of how one will \nultimately vote on the balanced budget amendment. This vote is about \nwhether Democratic Senators have a right to raise legitimate issues \nthat they believe would improve the amendment before us.\n  So I certainly urge my colleagues to reject the motion to invoke \ncloture at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have a great deal of affection for the \nminority leader, both as a person and as a leader. I think he is doing \na very good job for his side of the floor. I understand that this is an \nimportant vote and that it is more of a procedural vote this morning. \nWe all know how it is going to turn out. But I will just say this. As \nsomeone who has conducted a few filibusters in my 18 years, some of \nwhich have been successful and some of which have not, I know a \nfilibuster when I see one. I am sure the distinguished minority leader \ndoes not feel that his side is filibustering or the opposition to the \namendment is filibustering. But last evening, for instance, we wanted \nto go to one more amendment before the evening was up. We could not \nfind one person to offer an amendment that we could vote on that \nevening.\n  Be that as it may, I am not going to criticize what the distinguished \nminority leader has said, and we will have more days of debate. That is \nonly fair. This is a very, very important amendment. And it involves \nthe future of our country. It involves the future of our children and \nour grandchildren. It is going to make a difference, if we pass it, \nwhether our children and grandchildren have a future. If we do not pass \nit, I just say, ``Katie, bar the door.''\n  Just to make that point a little bit better, we are now in our 18th \nday on this amendment. There are very few things in the history of the \nSenate that take 18 days. We are now in our 18th day on our balanced \nbudget amendment debt tracker, the increase as we debate. There is a \n$4.8 trillion national debt that we start with, and we are now in our \n18th day. I will put up the information indicating the additional debt \nthat is going to accumulate by the end of this day for the taxpayers to \npay and pay interest on it. It is almost $15 billion, just the amount \nof debt that has accumulated since we started 18 days ago.\n  Mr. President, what about the vote to bring this debate to a close? I \nthink we need to stop talking and start working on getting our fiscal \nhouse in order by passing the balanced budget amendment and working \ntogether to balance the budget. The American people want and need us to \ndo this.\n  Mr. President, our large national debt and the yearly deficits that \nhelp it grow hurt real people, average working people all across our \ncountry. And continuing down the path we are on will only make matters \nworse for all of us and our children.\n  Last week there was an article in the Washington Post by James \nGlassman, a person I have a great deal of regard for, who I believe did \nan excellent job of stating in an understandable way how and why the \ndeficit hurts the average working American. He called this discussion \n``The Plain English Guide to the Federal Budget,'' and it began with \nthe sage assertion that ``Big deficits can make you poor. They tend to \nretard the growth of the private sector, raise interest rates, and \nweaken our economy.''\n  We are talking about $15 billion just in the 18 days that we have \ndebated here. We are fiddling while the country is burning. That is \nreally what is happening.\n  He says, ``They tend to retard the growth of the private sector, \nraise interest rates, and weaken our economy.''\n  This is exactly why we need the balanced budget constitutional \namendment--because Congress' fiscal madness is destroying the ability \nof the working American to make enough money to survive.\n  Every year hard-working Americans pay the price for our profligacy. \nThe Tax Foundation has calculated that in 1994 the average American \nworked from January 1 to May 5 just to pay his or her taxes--January 4 \nto May 5. They did not get to keep 1 cent of the money they earned \nuntil May 6. Is not that incredible? Put another way, in an 8-hour work \nday, the average American works the first 2 hours and 45 minutes just \nto pay taxes. So for 8 hours we are working almost 3 to pay taxes. This \nis bad enough. But it is not the end of the story.\n  The increasing Federal debt will force us to raise taxes to \nastronomical rates just to keep the country solvent. The National \nTaxpayers Union has estimated that a child born today, on average, will \npay over $100,000 in extra taxes over the course of his or her lifetime \njust to pay the interest on the national debt which accumulated in the \nfirst 18 years of that child's life. Just think, Mr. President. By the \ntime the child becomes old enough to vote--I am talking about our \nchildren and our grandchildren--there will be a $100,000 tax bill \nlooming on his or her horizon. And that is only to pay the interest on \nthe debt accumulated in that child's first 18 years. That is pathetic. \nThat is the legacy we are leaving to our children and grandchildren.\n  The National Taxpayers Union has determined that for every year we \nendure another $200 billion deficit--and the President's budget says we \nare going to endure them ad infinitum, $200 billion budget deficits for \n12 years--for every year that we endure that, it costs the average \nchild over $5,000 over his or her lifetime--every year we do that.\n  Mr. President, the budget submitted by President Clinton projects \n$200 billion deficits for each of the next 5 years--actually, each of \nthe next 12 years. By conceding defeat on deficit reduction, President \nClinton is condemning every child in America to an additional $25,000 \nin taxes racked up just over the next 5 years. There is no refuting \nthat unless we do something about it. We are, too, as a Congress, \nunless we do something about it and change.\n  But the bad news about the debt does not end there either. The \nCompetitiveness Policy Council has shown that rising budget deficits \nhave led to a 15 percent decline in real wages in the last 15 years, \nand the National Taxpayers Union has further calculated that in the \nnext 45 years, unless we get spending under control, after-tax incomes \nwill rise over that 45 years, cumulatively rise, $125--average \nincomes--unless we get the debt under control or our spending under \ncontrol. Can you imagine? In 45 years the most you are going to get out \nof the whole 45 years is an additional $125. That is not a year; that \nis over 45 years.\n  These deficits are strangling middle-class Americans throughout our \ncountry. How can people expect to bear the burden of stagnating wages \nand higher tax rates?\n  We simply cannot continue blindly down this road to economic \noblivion. Look at those 18 days on the chart; 18 days, just going up \nlike that. That is the debt that is accumulating while we fiddle here \nin Washington.\n  We must get the Government spending under control, and the only way \nto do that is to change the way Congress does business with a permanent \nunavoidable rule, and the only rule we can get is the balanced budget \namendment. It will force Congress to consider the costs as well as the \nbenefits of every program in the Federal Government. We will lower the \nunbelievable amount of Government spending and bring the deficit under \ncontrol.\n  All other attempts to balance the budget have failed, and they have \nfailed miserably. Over the full 19 years I have been here, we have had \nattempt after attempt, and they have all failed because they have been \nstatutes and the minute somebody passes a 51-percent majority vote, \nthey are changed. Every year the debt grows, relentlessly sapping the \nlife of the American economy as it does. Under the President's latest \nplan, the debt is going to grow--under his best assertions, and these \nare assuming optimistic assertions--another $1 trillion. By the end of \nthe next 5 years we will be over $6 trillion in debt, and we are \ncomplaining about $4.8 \n[[Page S2777]] trillion now. Because it is going up almost $1 billion a \nday, we will be $6 trillion in debt. His budget is not an attempt to \nreduce the deficit. It is a recognition that unless we change the \nbudget process to eliminate Congress spending bias, it is going to be \nimpossible to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. President, we have the opportunity to make a historic change \nhere. We can pass the balanced budget amendment and preserve the future \nfor our children, our grandchildren, and this country. We can stop this \nrunaway Federal train of spending and taxing that is out of control \nright now. I urge my colleagues to support the balanced budget \namendment today so that we and our children will have a prosperous \ntomorrow.\n  This morning will end our third full week of debate on this \namendment. We started debate on the subject matter even before the bill \nwas brought to the floor during the unfunded mandates debate. We have \nhad 11 votes on amendments and spent 14 days on floor debate on this \nconstitutional amendment so far, more than we have ever spent debating \na balanced budget amendment before. Back in 1982, which was the next \ntoughest debate, we debated 11 days before passing the balanced budget \namendment by 69 votes. I hope that our longer debate this year will \nmean our margin of victory will be proportionately higher.\n  As we have said, every day while we talk, the debt we leave our \nchildren and grandchildren continues going up to a shocking point. This \nmust end and must end soon. Mr. President, let us tell the American \npeople in this cloture vote when we will stop talking and start acting \nto bring this country to fiscal sanity. Let us pass the balanced budget \namendment to the States for ratification and get on with balancing the \nbudget.\n  We have had 11 votes, and every one we have won on a bipartisan vote. \nDemocrats and Republicans have voted with us, every one. There is \nnothing partisan about this. Anybody who tries to say this is a \npartisan debate just has not watched it and has not looked at the \nvoters and has not realized that this balanced budget amendment is a \nbipartisan consensus, a Democrat-Republican effort, to save our \ncountry, and to help our children and grandchildren have the futures \nthat we all had when we were born.\n  I was born in poverty. We did not have indoor facilities. We lost our \nfirst home shortly after I was born. We did not have indoor facilities \nin the second home for years. I thought all homes were kind of brown \nand dark because my dad built our home out of a torn-down old burnt-out \nbuilding. Frankly, I thought everyone had a Pillsbury flour sign on the \nside of their home. I thought that was a pretty unique thing, and it \nreally was.\n  To make a long story short, I had a future even though I was born in \nthe Depression, because Congresses had not run the country totally into \nthe ground from a national debt standpoint. But we have done it now, \nand we have to change our way of doing things around here.\n  I emphasize again that the first vote was 56 to 44. There were a \nnumber of Democrats voting with us. The Dole amendment passed 87 to 10, \na lot of Democrats. The Reid amendment was defeated on a motion to \ntable, 57 to 41, a lot of Democrats with us. The next was 70 to 28, a \nlot of Democrats. Then 66 to 32, 52 to 45, Senator Hollings, that was a \nclose vote. Still a number of Democrats helped to defeat that. Then 59 \nto 40, 59 to 40, and 52 to 47 last night; eight or nine Democrats voted \nwith us on that. Then 51 to 38, 61 to 33, the last vote, and a lot of \nDemocrats voted on that. This is a bipartisan effort. There is no \nreason for a filibuster or delay here. There is no reason not to get \nabout business. There is no reason not to come up with amendments when \nthe time comes.\n  I am willing to proceed and happy to proceed in any way our \ncolleagues want to do this. But do not try to present this as partisan, \na Democrat-Republican difference here. This is a bipartisan effort. We \nhave made it that. I am proud of my Democratic colleagues that are \nstanding up on this amendment. All we need are 15 to stand up and we \nwill pass this, 15 out of 47. That is all we need. Gee, there ought to \nbe 15 Democrats in the Senate out of 47 who will help us. I know of 13. \nI think I know of 14. Who is going to be that 15th vote, or the one \nthat defeats this, if that is what happens? I do not believe it will.\n  I do not believe that our colleagues, when we put forth this kind of \na bipartisan, heartfelt, eager effort, are going to shoot this down for \nthe one time in history, after the House of Representatives had the \nguts to pass it, with the help of I believe 78 courageous Democrats in \nthe House. We need 15 courageous Democrats here and I think we will get \nthem. I believe we will get them, because this is the time in history \nwhen we can make a statement against what has been going on, this \nrunaway train of Federal spending, this abdication of responsibility, \nthis rejection of our children's and grandchildrens' future. Let us do \nsomething about it and quit talking partisan politics, and let us work \ntogether to get it done.\n  To the extent that this delay and a final vote will continue after \ntoday, let us do the best we can to bring up as many amendments as we \ncan and debate them, and we are happy to do that. I think the debate \nhas been healthy. I commend Senators on both sides of the aisle for the \nexcellent debate they have given to us, and I hope our colleagues will \nvote for cloture today so that we can end the delay and have the \nresponsible amendments that are left brought up. And let us vote on \nthem and then let us pass the balanced budget amendment for the benefit \nof everybody--Democrats, Republicans, all loyal Americans--but most of \nall, for our children and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2775-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  May I take just a moment here to compliment the Republican Senators \nwho have been sitting in the chair from the very beginning of this \nsession. In the main, I think they have done very well. They have \npresided over the Senate with dignity, except in a few cases when there \nprobably ought to be a little less talking up there at the desk because \nthe cameras are often focused right on that desk. State legislators, \nprofessors, students, and the people at large expect this Senate to be \nthe premier deliberative body in the world. It is not a State \nlegislature. And I do not say that to cast any aspersions on State \nlegislatures. I have been a member of both houses many years ago in \nWest Virginia.\n  Generally speaking, the presiding officers have been alert and have \nbeen paying attention to the debate, as they should.\n  Madam President, the original Constitution and the amendments \nheretofore adopted serve two basic functions: One, they create a \nstructure of government and establish three departments thereof: the \nLegislative, the Executive, and the Judicial, and they allocate the \npowers of government among the three branches of the Federal Government \nand between the two Houses of Congress.\n  The Constitution also prohibits the States from taking certain \nactions, and all powers that are not delegated to the Congress by the \nConstitution shall be reserved to the States or the people.\n  So this is a Constitutional system, with checks and balances and a \nseparation of powers, thus establishing an equilibrium between and \namong the three departments--the Legislative, the Executive, and the \nJudicial.\n  Two, the original Constitution and the amendments thereto, protect \nthe most fundamental individual rights, such as life, liberty, and \nproperty; free speech; freedom of assembly; freedom of religion; \nfreedom of the press; and equal justice under law.\n  So the Framers wisely left the determination of fiscal policy to the \nelected representatives of the people. Deciding when or whether to \nbalance the budget, and whether and when to risk a deficit, calls for a \njudgment of policy, the kind of political judgment left by the Founding \nFathers to the majoritarian processes of representative democracy. The \nConstitution and the amendments thereto do not undertake to resolve \nquestions of fiscal policy. And for 206 years, that Constitution has \nnot been amended to include fiscal policy.\n  Under the constitutional amendment that the Senate has been debating, \nsuch a judgment of fiscal policy, and when or whether to apply \ncountercyclical measures would, to a considerable degree, be inhibited. \nSection 3 of the amendment, for example, would fetter and hamstring the \nPresident in the proper exercise of his powers.\n  Let me read section 3 of the proposed amendment to the Constitution.\n  I quote. This is section 3, from the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget.\n\n       Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays \n     do not exceed total receipts.\n\n  I think it is important that we recognize that this amendment to the \nConstitution, by virtue of section 3, would, if adopted, hamper the \nPresident. It would fetter the President. It would hamstring the \nPresident in the proper exercise of his powers by requiring him to \nsubmit a balanced budget even though he may consider a deficit to be \nnecessary as a countercyclical measure to combat a recession that may \nbe already underway. Countercyclical stabilizers are rendered even more \ndifficult in a period of economic decline by the requirement of a \nsupermajority vote to waive the section 1 mandate for a balanced budget \nin every fiscal year. Such requirement for a supermajority can prove to \nbe a very troubling recipe for gridlock.\n  The amendment now being debated by the Senate provides that outlays \nin any given year shall not exceed receipts; that Congress may \nappropriate money in excess of anticipated revenues only by a three-\nfifths vote of the full membership of both Houses, and not by lesser \nmajorities; that Congress may enact revenue increases only by majority \nvotes of the full membership of both Houses on rollcall votes, and not \nby lesser majorities.\n  Let me state that again.\n  The constitutional amendment that is before the Senate requires that \nCongress may enact revenue increases only by majority votes of the full \nmembership of both Houses--of both Houses--on rollcall votes.\n  In other words, in the Senate that would mean by no less than 51 \nvotes and in the House that would mean no less than 218 votes.\n  The amendment also provides that Congress may raise the ceiling on \nthe national debt, but only by a three-fifths vote of the full \nmembership of both Houses, and not by lesser majorities.\n  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was right when he warned that the \nConstitution ought not ``embody a particular economic theory.'' In \nkeeping with that wisdom, the Framers remitted Federal fiscal policy, \nnot to special supermajorities, but rather to the crucible of ordinary \nmajoritarian democratic politics. Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, gives \nCongress the power to tax and spend for the common defense and general \nwelfare, and to borrow money on the credit of the United States--all \nobviously by simple majorities.\n  [[Page S2779]] So basic is the majoritarian premise of Article I of \nthe United States Constitution that it is barely mentioned, except for \nthe statement in Article I, Section 5, Clause 1, that ``a majority of \neach House shall constitute a quorum to do business.'' The \ncontemporaneous history supports the majoritarian premise, for the \nFramers entertained, but rejected, the idea requiring that ordinary \nlegislation on any particular subject matter be passed by a \nsupermajority. For example, Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist No. \n22, warned:\n\n       To give a minority a negative upon the majority--\n\n  Which is always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a \ndecision--\n\n     is, in its tendency, to subject the sense of the greater \n     number to that of the lesser number. . . . The public \n     business must in some way or other go forward.\n\n  This is Hamilton speaking.\n\n     If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a \n     majority respecting the best mode of conducting it--\n\n  Meaning the public business.\n\n     the majority, in order that something may be done, must \n     conform to the views of the minority; and thus--\n\n  Says Hamilton.\n\n     the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the \n     greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings. Hence, \n     tedious delays--continual negotiation and intrigue--\n     contemptible compromises of the public good. . . . For upon \n     some occasions, things will not admit of accommodation; and \n     then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended \n     or fatally defeated. It is often, by the impracticability of \n     obtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes--\n\n  This is Hamilton speaking. Let me begin again that sentence.\n\n     It is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the \n     concurrence of the necessary number of votes, kept in a state \n     of inaction. Its situation must always savour a weakness--\n     sometimes border upon anarchy.\n\n  That was Alexander Hamilton. Where are all these Senators who are \nproponents of this amendment? It would not hurt them to hear the \nConstitution read today, from the beginning to the end. I do not intend \nto inflict that kind of punishment on them, but they certainly would do \nwell to read and to hear read those portions of the Constitution which \nimpact upon this constitutional amendment on the balanced budget.\n  Madison added his warning against supermajorities, in the Federalist \nNo. 58:\n\n       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum, and in particular cases, if not \n     in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision. . . \n     . [But] . . . In all cases where justice or the general good \n     might require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be \n     pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would \n     be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would \n     rule;\n\n  This is Madison speaking.\n\n     the power would be transferred to the minority. Were the \n     defensive privilege limited to particular cases, an \n     interested minority might take advantage of it to screen \n     themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal, or \n     in particular emergencies, to extort unreasonable \n     indulgences.\n\n  That is Madison.\n  That is James Madison. He referred to particular emergencies and the \nsupermajorities that are included in this nefarious constitutional \namendment to balance the budget to deal with ``particular \nemergencies.'' I am using Madison's words--``particular emergencies.''.\n  Let me read again what Madison said.\n\n       Were the defensive privilege limited to particular cases, \n     an interested minority might take advantage of it to screen \n     themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal, or \n     in particular emergencies, to extort unreasonable \n     indulgences.\n\n  Where are the proponents of this amendment? Why do they not \ninterrogate James Madison? Why do they not hearken to his words and \nHamilton's words? No. They do not want to hear. As was said in Homer's \nIliad, ``Not if I had 10 tongues and 10 mouths, a voice that could not \ntire, lung of brass in my bosom,'' would they hear me. They have eyes \nthat cannot see and ears that cannot hear, and minds that are unwilling \nto comprehend the warnings of the Framers of the Constitution. Should \none conclude that they pretend to be wiser men than those who wrote the \nConstitution?\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment would reject the wisdom \nboth of Hamilton and Madison by adopting supermajority requirements \nthat would transfer power from majorities to minority factions. And \nGeorge Washington in his Farewell Address warned against parties and \nfactions. Sections 1 and 2 of the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget would require that deficit spending and increases in the \nstatutory debt limit be approved by three-fifths of the whole number of \neach House. Section 4 would impose a minisupermajority requirement, in \nthat revenue increases must be authorized by a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House. Meaning in the Senate, 51 votes would be required \nto increase revenues, and in the House 218 votes would be required, 217 \nwould not be enough, 218 votes would be required to pass legislation in \nthe House to increase revenues--rather than, as is usual, by a majority \nof Members present and voting. Were the Framers wise? To ask the \nquestion is to answer it. This minisupermajority that is required for \nrevenue increases flies in the face of Madison's warning against a \nrequirement of ``more than a majority of a quorum for a decision.''\n  Defenders of the balanced budget amendment often say, what is so bad \nabout supermajority requirements? After all, the Senate in its own \nrules requires a supermajority for cloture on filibusters. So why is it \nso bad to have in the Constitution a requirement of a supermajority? \nThe proponents also refer to the supermajorities that are mentioned in \nthe Constitution and the amendments thereto. But these existing \nsupermajority requirements furnish no precedent for those in the \nbalanced budget amendment, for they are fundamentally different in \nkind.\n  Rules on parliamentary procedures that the Senate adopts for its own \ngovernance are surely no model for an alteration of the Nation's \nfundamental charter. Anybody who argues that point simply does not, and \nhas not stopped to think, knows very little about the Senate rules, and \nvery little, in all likelihood, about the Constitution. Such rules of \nthe Senate can be changed by the Senate acting itself alone, and are \nnot comparable to an amendment to the Constitution, which requires the \nsupport of both Houses of Congress by a two-thirds vote and three-\nfourths of the State legislatures for adoption.\n  Although the Constitution does impose some supermajority \nrequirements, it does so quite sparingly, and only for good reasons, \nnamely, to provide one branch a check upon another branch --for \nexample, treaty ratification and veto overrides. In the case of a \ntreaty approval, the legislative branch--one component thereof; namely, \nthe Senate--acts as a check upon the executive, in the ratification of \ntreaties that bind this Nation in its relations with other nations. It \nis a check and balance. A supermajority is also required for a veto \noverride, and again provides a check and balance between the executive \nand the legislative branch. One of the Framers stated that the one \nreason for the veto itself was that the President, the Executive, could \nprovide protection for himself and his office, against the legislative \nbranch.\n So he was given the veto. That is check and balance. Other \nsupermajorities in the original Constitution were to protect individual \nrights. For example, in the case of the expulsion of a Member of the \nSenate or of the House, a Member cannot be expelled by a simple \nmajority. It requires two-thirds of the Senate to expel a Senator, two-\nthirds of the House to expel a House Member. These supermajorities are \nprovided for the protection of individual rights, the individual rights \nof the Members of the two bodies, else a simple majority could expel \nMembers of the minority, get rid of them, send them home, expel them by \na simple majority. A supermajority is there for the protection of the \nindividual rights of the elected representatives of the people.\n\n  The same is the case with impeachment. Were there not a supermajority \nrequired, then an impulsive and partisan majority in the Senate could \nconvict a President in an impeachment trial. That almost happened with \nAndrew Johnson, as we all know. So that supermajority is required to \nprotect individual rights, the rights of a President, the rights of \nother officers who \n[[Page S2780]] may be impeached, the rights of Federal judges who may \nbe impeached. The supermajority required in article V is to insure that \nthe fundamental charter of this Republic not itself be too freely \namended.\n  Amending the Constitution is provided for, but the Framers wisely \nestablished that amendments not be adopted and ratified too freely. \nThus, we have only seen 17 amendments added to the original \nConstitution and Bill of Rights. They were wise men.\n  Then there are certain other supermajorities. Amendment XII of the \nConstitution deals with the election of a Vice President by the Senate. \nIn the 14th amendment, a supermajority is required to waive the \ndisability upon individuals who, having previously taken the oath of \noffice to support the Constitution, later engage in rebellion against \nthe United States. It requires a supermajority in both Houses to lift \nthat disability from such individual. I am not against amending the \nConstitution. Our forefathers provide for that situation, and I have \nvoted for five constitutional amendments to the Constitution.\n  Hence, there are nine supermajorities of one kind or another in the \noriginal Constitution and the amendments thereto. I think it is very \nunwise, however, to provide a constitutional amendment that requires a \nsupermajority in the enactment of a fiscal policy.\n  There is one other supermajority, and that is the supermajority \nwritten into the original Constitution that dealt with the matter of a \nquorum in the election of a President when such election is thrown into \nthe House of Representatives.\n  So there you have it. These are all structural concerns or, as I say, \nthey provide basic protections for individual rights. They are \nstructural concerns that deal with the structure of this form of \ngovernment as established by the original Framers--and the States and \npeople thereof, who ratified the Constitution--or they deal with rights \nof individuals.\n  The supermajority requirements of this balanced budget amendment \nembody no such structural concerns and no protections of individual \nrights. Rather, the supermajority requirements to the balanced budget \namendment would for the first time in our constitutional history--the \nfirst time in 206 years--inject a minority veto into the ordinary \nprocesses of the determination of fiscal policy within the legislative \nbranch. The danger of supermajority requirements in this policymaking \ncontext is that a minority of either House can hold the legislative \nagenda hostage, blocking majority choices until the minority factions \nobtain the policy concessions that they want. James Madison described \nthis very danger in Federalist No. 58, where he warned that \nsupermajority requirements permit the minority--permit the minority--to \n``extort unreasonable indulgences'' from the majority. In the business \nof budget balancing, permitting such minority vetoes might actually be \ncounterproductive if it fostered minority demands for expensive pet \nprograms as the price of deficit spending authorizations.\n  The rules laid down, therefore, are those of parliamentary procedure, \nwhich may belong in the rules of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, but not in the Constitution.\n To insert parliamentary rules into the Constitution cheapens--\ncheapens--that basic charter and erodes the respect upon which its \nvitality and usefulness depend.\n\n  There would be years in which three-fifths majorities of the full \nmembership of both Houses of Congress authorized spending in excess of \nreceipts, and there would be years in which expenditures outran \nreceipts because actual receipts fell short of honest and careful \nestimates, or because actual expenditures exceeded the best and most \ncareful estimates. As these deficit years occur down the road, what \nwould be the reaction of the citizens who supported this amendment and \nwho were told that the amendment would produce a balanced budget each \nyear? The result surely would be disillusionment, cynicism, distrust of \nthose who govern, and loss of confidence in our basic, fundamental, \norganic law: the Constitution of the United States.\n  The operation of the budget, appropriations, and revenue processes \nare so highly complex that disputes are bound to arise. Forecasts with \nregard to both receipts and outlays vary so widely that violations of \nthe requirement that outlays shall not exceed receipts in a given year \nare bound--bound--to occur.\n  I have shown that. I have shown charts that demonstrate that fact \ntime and time again.\n  Old disputes about the separation of powers, reminiscent of the \nimpoundment controversy of the Nixon administration, would be reopened.\n  How many Senators here today were Members of this body when that \ncontroversy occurred? Very few.\n  The powers of the executive vis-a-vis the legislative branch will, in \nall likelihood, be substantially enlarged.\n  Who are the proponents of this balanced budget amendment? Are they \nmonarchists? Are they monarchists who want to see the power shifted to \nthe executive? Do they want an all-powerful, imperial President?\n  To rivet into the Constitution this amendment calling for a balanced \nbudget annually would be to Constitutionalize fiscal policy, and would \ngive rise to disputes cast in Constitutional terms, which must either \ngo unresolved or bring the courts into the determination of fiscal \npolicy. Few judges, if any, have expertise in such matters as fiscal \npolicy, budgets, and appropriations, and lack the experience to guide \ntheir decisions. The courts would lack judicially manageable standards \nto guide their decisions, and drawing the Judiciary into budgetary, \nappropriations, revenue and other fiscal matters would mean an \nintrusion--an intrusion--into an area that Congress and the President \nhave long regarded as their--their--exclusive domain. As a result, the \nstage would be set to injure the prestige and authority of the courts, \nas well as to impair the effectiveness of the Judiciary in preserving \nthe ancient framework of republican government and protecting the \nConstitutional liberties of the nation's citizens. The people's faith \nin both the Judiciary and the Constitution would be seriously damaged.\n  Hence, the implications of an amendment for the constitutional \nstructure of our Government and for the status of our Constitution as \npartisan law would be very, very serious.\n  That is what this amendment is. It is a partisan amendment. It is a \npolitical amendment supported by a political party. It is the \nRepublican Party as of today in the Senate and the House that is \npressing for this amendment. And they want to do it now, do it here--\n``Do it now; do it here; we can't wait''--because they have it in their \nso-called Contract With America. That so-called contract is supposed to \nsupplant the Constitution when it comes to this amendment.\n  Should the measure be enforced by the judiciary, it would produce an \nunprecedented restructuring of the balance of power among the three \nbranches of Government. There are no two ways about it. It would \nproduce an unprecedented restructuring of the balance of power among \nthe three branches of Government.\n  To crucify the Constitution upon the cross of the so-called Contract \nWith America is of little consequence, provided you will give us the \nBarabbas of temporary partisan and political gain!\n  That Constitution bears the stains of blood from thousands of men and \nwomen throughout the history of this Nation--men and women who gave \ntheir lives at Valley Forge, at Saratoga, at Yorktown, at Lexington, \nand Concord.\n  Nathan Hale. Who is he? Never heard of him. Who was Nathan Hale?\n  Well, Nathan Hale was a young man, 21 years of age, who was a \nschoolteacher.\n  He responded to General George Washington's request for a volunteer \nto go behind the British lines and to bring back the drawings of \nfortifications. Nathan Hale responded as that old patriarch did in \nbiblical times, ``Speak Lord, thy servant heareth.'' Nathan Hale \nresponded, knowing that that task was fraught with danger and might \ncost him his life.\n  He went behind the British lines, disguised as a Dutch schoolmaster. \nHis mission was almost finished when, on the night before he was ready \nto return to the American lines, he was discovered with notes and \nletters on his person, and he was arrested. The next morning, on \nSeptember 22, 1776, he was \n[[Page S2781]] brought before the gallows. He saw before him the \ngallows. He saw to one side, the wooden coffin which would soon claim \nhis lifeless body. He requested a Bible. His request was refused.\n  The British officer, who was a major by the name of Cunningham said, \n``Do you have anything to say?'' Nathan Hale replied, ``I regret that I \nhave only one life to lose for my country.'' The British officer \nangrily commanded, ``String the rebel up,'' and Nathan Hale died. He \nonly had one life to give for his country.\n  Yet, there are some who are unwilling to give one vote for their \ncountry--one vote. Not everybody sees this as I do, of course. I see it \nthrough the context of many, many years of dedicated service to this \ninstitution, having sworn 13 times to support and defend the \nConstitution--13 times over a period of 48 years. Some of those who \nsupport this amendment are undoubtedly--undoubtedly--sincere, and they \nconscientiously believe that this is the only way to get deficits under \ncontrol.\n  But not all, I would say--and I attempt to be the judge of no man and \nno woman, but I have talked with many Senators around here on this \nmatter, and some have expressed strange reasons for not supporting this \namendment. Some think that we ought to just wash our hands of it, let \nit go to the States. ``The States will not ratify it,'' they say. Some \nsay if the States ratify it, the backlash will destroy the Republican \nParty in time.\n  Madam President, we cannot say, ``Let this cup pass from me.'' Harry \nTruman, even if he were in the White House today, could not say, ``The \nbuck stops here.'' This constitutional amendment does not stop on its \nway to the President. It does not go to the President's desk. So where \ndoes the buck stop? The buck stops here--right here in the Senate.\n  I hope that Senators will think again, those who may be guided by \npolitical motives to vote for this amendment. I hope they will think \nagain. Nathan Hale gave one life, and thousands have given their lives \nto sustain the freedoms that are guaranteed by the Constitution of the \nUnited States. That Constitution, as I say, is stained with the blood \nof thousands.\n  There is not one proponent of this amendment to the Constitution \nagainst whom the blood of that Constitution will not cry out as loudly \nas did the blood of Abel against Cain, if it is adopted. Not one!\n  There are those who say, ``Well, he is the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He is the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. You would not expect him to do anything else. He is the \n`king of pork.' No wonder he is against this amendment.''\n  Fie on such little men who think in such little terms, who have \nthemselves, in all likelihood, never taken an oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States. I have taken that oath, \nand every other Member here--man and woman--has taken that oath.\n  Montesquieu said when it came to the oath, the Romans were the most \nreligious people on Earth. Marcus Atilius Regulus, a Roman consul, \ncaptured by the Carthaginians in the year 258 B.C., was sent by the \nCarthaginians with an embassy to Rome to plead the case of the \nCarthaginians before the Roman Senate and to attempt, if possible, to \narrange for an exchange of prisoners, also, to endeavor to bring about \na truce on terms that would be favorable to the Carthaginians. Marcus \nAtilius Regulus, however, when he spoke to the Roman Senate, advised \nthe Senate against entering into any such arrangement or agreement or \ntreaty with the Carthaginians, because such an arrangement would not be \nbeneficial to Rome.\n  Regulus said, ``I know that they will know what I have said here and \nthat I will pay with my life.'' The Roman Senate offered to protect \nRegulus against his being returned to Carthage. But Regulus said, ``No, \nI gave them my word. I swore an oath to them, which they made me do. I \nswore an oath to them that I would return.'' And he said, ``I will keep \nmy oath, even when given to the enemy.''\n  Against the pleadings and the tears of his wife and children, Marcus \nAtilius Regulus returned to Carthage, and he was tortured. He was \nforced to lie on spikes in a specially-built enclosure from which he \ncould only see the Sun. The Carthaginians cut off his eyelids, and he \nwas forced to look at the Sun all day long. He soon perished!\n  He was a Roman who believed in keeping his oath. So we can understand \nwhat Montesquieu meant when he said that when it comes to the oath, the \nRomans are the most religious people in the world. I, too, am from a \ngeneration that believed in keeping its oath, when sworn before God and \nwith one hand on the Bible.\n  Mr. President, if this constitutional amendment proves to be \nunenforceable, it would create an equally troubling hazard; namely, by \ninscribing an empty promise into the fundamental charter of our \nGovernment, thus breeding cynicism both toward our Government and the \nConstitution as well for the rule of law.\n  Before I diverted my thoughts to the Romans, I talked about what our \nconstitutional form of Government would suffer in the event that the \nbalanced budget amendment were to be ratified and enforced.\n  But now I say, on the other hand, if the amendment proved to be \nunenforceable, it would create an equally troubling hazard; namely, by \ninscribing an empty promise into the fundamental charter of our \nGovernment, thus breeding cynicism both toward our Government and the \nConstitution, as well as for the rule of law.\n  Keep in mind that not only would Federal judges--keep in mind that \nnot only would Federal judges--become involved in fiscal policy, but \nState judges would also be required to make fundamental decisions about \ntaxing and spending. And these are issues, I say to my friend from \nGeorgia, these are issues that judges on both the State and Federal \nlevels lack the institutional capacity to decide in any remotely \nsatisfactory manner.\n  Some proponents of the amendment may be of the opinion that the \n``political question'' doctrine or limitations on standing would \npreclude litigation that would ensnare the judiciary in the thicket of \nbudgetary politics.\n  Some recent decisions of the Supreme Court, however, suggest that the \nCourt is prepared--is prepared--to resolve questions that might once \nhave been considered political. For example, in Missouri v. Jenkins, \n1990, the Supreme Court upheld the power of a Federal district court to \norder a local board of education to levy higher taxes to build magnate \nschools in order to promote desegregation. And the Court even held open \nas a last resort the possibility that the district court might itself \nlevy the taxes.\n  Now get that. ``Oh,'' they say, ``the courts won't enter that \npolitical thicket.'' It is not so much that it is a thicket, it is \npolitical. It is political. Judges are not elected by the people. \nJudges are not out there rubbing shoulders and elbows with the American \npeople and hearing from them as to their advice on making law. But it \nis otherwise with the elected representatives of the people, who daily \nwork and move in a political thicket.\n  It might not happen, but if the proposed amendment is adopted and \nratified, no one, no man, no man--it reminds me, may I say to my good \nfriend, one of the fine Senators who is on the ``Republican response \nteam''--and I love him, I think a lot of the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, I really do--but it reminds me of Odysseus.\n  Odysseus, Senators will recall from that great story, the \n``Odyssey,'' written by Homer, who supposedly lived circa 800 years \nbefore Christ, was blind, blind like Milton who wrote ``Paradise \nLost.'' Homer was blind. But he went around singing songs and poetry. \nPerhaps Homer's words have come down to us through the centuries, the \nearly, early centuries, by repetition, by other men relating, speaking, \nand conveying the thoughts and words of Homer.\n  But let us say it was ``written'' by Homer. I think that is fair \nenough. The ``Odyssey.'' In the ``Odyssey,'' we will remember that \nOdysseus found himself imprisoned in a cave by the Cyclops, the giant \nwith one eye in the middle of his forehead. He probably still had more \nvision than some of the proponents of this amendment. In any event, the \nCyclopean giant asked Odysseus his name. Odysseus said, ``No Man.'' His \nname was Noman. No-man.\n  Well, I will not proceed with the story, but let me just say that no \nman, and no woman, no one should be very surprised to find a Federal \ncourt made \n[[Page S2782]] up of unelected judges, appointed for life, enjoining \nexpenditures selected by the court or requiring the levy of a tax. \nPeople up in New Hampshire would not stand still for that, for \nunelected judges levying a tax. We fought one war over taxation without \nrepresentation, and the people of New Hampshire know about that.\n  Even if taxpayers and Members of Congress were not granted standing, \nthe amendment could lead to litigation by recipients whose benefits, \nmandated by law, were curtailed by the President through impoundment of \nfunds or a line-item veto, in reliance upon the amendment. The \nPresident might well conclude that the Constitutional command that \n``total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts'' \nmust take precedence over mere statutes, including appropriation bills, \nentitlement laws, and the Impoundment Act of 1974.\n  If a Presidential decision were made to order a reduction in pension \npayments, or in social security payments, or in Medicare payments, or \nin veterans compensation payments, the President could argue in defense \nof his action that there was a conflict between the statutes requiring \nthese outlays and the Constitutional provision commanding that ``total \noutlays shall not exceed total receipts,'' and that to execute the \nspending statutes would result in the Constitution's being violated.\n  Assuming that a President concludes that his duty to comply with the \nConstitutional amendment implicitly includes the impoundment power or \nenhanced rescissions power or a line-item veto power necessary to \nensure that the budget is in fact balanced, the result would be an \ninevitable shift of power from the Legislative Branch to the Executive \nBranch. At the very heart of our Constitutional system of government is \nthe proposition that power over the raising of revenues and the \nappropriation of funds rests with the people's elected representatives \nin Congress. The shift to unrestrained Presidential impoundment and \nline-item veto or rescissions authority would effectively take from \nCongress the ``power over the purse'' and confer that power on the \nPresident.\n  The placing of the power of the purse in the hands of the Legislative \nBranch--and not in the hands of the Executive or Judicial Branches--was \na decision that was not lightly made by the Framers of the \nConstitution. James Madison wrote in the 58th Federalist:\n\n       This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the \n     most effectual weapon with which any Constitution can arm the \n     immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a \n     redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect \n     every just and salutary measure.\n\n  That was Madison. Let me state it again. James Madison wrote in the \n58th Federalist:\n\n       This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the \n     most effectual weapon with which any Constitution can arm the \n     immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a \n     redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect \n     every just and salutary measure.\n\n  So the Framers, Mr. President, explicity rejected the notion that \nsuch a crucial power should rest either with the Executive or with the \nJudiciary.\n  As I have already stated, the Courts lack not only the experience and \nthe resources, but also the close link to the general public needed for \nresponsible budgetary decisions. It would be a profound--a profound--\nmistake for Congress to adopt an amendment to the Constitution that \ncould transfer such a vital Legislative power to an unelected \nJudiciary.\n  The Framers were well acquainted with the history of England. They \nwere very familiar with the long and bloody struggle in which the \nEnglish people had wrested from tyrannical monarchs the power of the \npurse and vested that power in the elected representatives of the \npeople in Parliament. The Framers, consequently, considered that the \nappropriations of money were a bulwark against Executive usurpations, \nand they, therefore, carefully wrote into the organic law the \nprovisions of Article I, Section 9, which guarantee that no monies \nshall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations \nmade by the laws of Congress. It is hard to imagine that the \npossibility of such a dramatic reform of the basic structure of our \ngovernment would be contemplated in this amendment, by the Members of \nboth Houses of Congress, all of whom have sworn an oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.\n  On the other hand, if the amendment is to be only an empty promise \nwelded into the fundamental charter of our government, only to have \nthis new provision of the Constitution routinely violated, it would \ninevitably make all other provisions of the Constitution seem far less \ninviolable. Let us soberly reflect on that.\n  As Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 25:\n\n       Wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the \n     government with restrictions that cannot be observed, because \n     they know that every breach of the fundamental laws, though \n     dictated by necessity, impairs that sacred reverence which \n     ought to be maintained in the breast of rulers toward the \n     Constitution of a country, and forms a precedent for other \n     breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at \n     all, or is less urgent and palpable.\n\n  Mr. President, unless a Senator has a question of me, I am prepared \nto yield to the Senator from Arkansas for not to exceed 15 minutes \nwithout losing my right to the floor. I do not intend to hold the floor \nall afternoon, but I do have some other things that I wish to say in \nopposition to the amendment to balance the budget.\n  Do not forget, I support a balanced budget. I supported lowering the \ndeficits in the 1993 deficit reduction bill. So I support the goal of \nachieving balanced budgets. But I do not support the prostitution and \nrape of the Constitution of the United States by a Constitutional \namendment that will not achieve a balanced budget but will destroy the \nvery form of our government with its separation of powers and checks \nand balances.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the \nSenator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for not to exceed 15 minutes without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Is there objection? The Chair \nhears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for yielding this amount of \ntime to me.\n  The other afternoon I was down visiting on the steps, the steps in \nthe Senate where the pages sit. I gathered up four or five of the pages \nwho diligently serve us around here and perform many, many wonderful \nduties for this institution and for us individually and collectively. I \ngathered them up and I said:\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to remember something. \n     When I speak, or when a lot of us speak in the Senate, maybe \n     from time to time you do not have to listen too carefully to \n     what some of us have to say. But remember that when Senator \n     Byrd of West Virginia speaks, you take time, and you listen, \n     and listen intently to what he has to say, because you will \n     learn something. You will learn something about this body, \n     you will learn something about this country, you will learn \n     something about the Constitution, and you will learn \n     something about what makes the Senate one of the unique \n     institutions in the world. I learn from the Senator \n     constantly.\n\n  I thank him not only for his message today but his continuing message \non this issue, relative to the balanced budget amendment.\n  When I was young and growing up in Camden, AR, I remember at birthday \nparties we used to play a game. In fact, when I raised my sons, they \nplayed the same game. Perhaps other Members of this body played a game \ncalled pin the tail on the donkey. One of us would be blindfolded, and \nwe would be given the donkey's tail and someway or another we would try \nto go up to the wall or the board and find the proper place to attach \nthe tail on the donkey. Sometimes, because we could not see it--we were \nblindfolded--we would not even be near our destination, or near our \ntarget.\n  In the last several weeks, relative to this debate--not only in this \nChamber but in the other body and on the talk shows, in the media, in \nthe public, wherever--somehow or another I am reminded of that game \nonce again, of pin the tail on the donkey.\n  I think there is a lot of blame being passed around--the Democrats \nblame the Republicans, the Republicans blame the Democrats. We might \nblame this Senator or that Congressman, we \n[[Page S2783]] blame this act or this particular time or effort or law \nor regulation as to why we got to this point and how we got to this \npoint at this time in our country's history.\n  We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble. And this morning I heard \nthe distinguished majority whip, Senator Lott, as he quoted a statement \nthat Senator Daschle had made 1 year ago in this debate on the \nconstitutional amendment. At that time, Senator Daschle voted for that \namendment, and Senator Daschle was quoted as giving the reasons why he \nwas supporting that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I invite the distinguished Republican whip to go back \nto 1982, to go back to 1986, and he can find some statements of this \nSenator from the State of Arkansas who at that time also not only spoke \non this floor but back in my home State, as to why at that moment in \nour history, that window of opportunity, that I thought we had to \nsupport a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I believed it \nthen. I believed it in 1982. I believed it in 1986.\n  Not long after those votes, I also voted for two extremely far-\nreaching, extremely strict, you might say, proposals that would have \nfrozen spending across the board. In the early 1980's, I supported \nthose particular freezes.\n  But, Mr. President, something has happened since that period of time. \nSomething has happened to have dramatically and drastically changed the \neconomic and fiscal landscape of America. What has happened is very \nsimple, and I will use the analogy that after the mid-1980's we let the \nhorse get out of the barn.\n  The horse got out of the barn, and today, we are being asked for \nsupport by our wonderful friends, like Senator Simon of Illinois, who \nbelieves with all of his heart that this constitutional amendment is \nthe way to get this horse back in the barn.\n  Mr. President, I respect my friend from Illinois. I respect my friend \nfrom New Hampshire. I respect my friend from Utah--in their belief that \na constitutional amendment, where we would balance the budget in the \nnext 7 years is the proper way to get the horse back in the barn. I \ntruly believe it is wrong to attempt to amend the Constitution to bring \nthe horse back in the barn. I think what we are doing, if I may use \nthis analogy, is we are attempting with a constitutional amendment to \nlasso an elephant with a piece of thread. It cannot be done.\n  The trouble is not in the Constitution. This is not where the trouble \nis. It is not in the Constitution that was passed in Philadelphia over \n200 years ago. The trouble is in us. That is where the problem lies.\n  The problem is in me, Senator Pryor from Arkansas. In 1981, I voted \nfor then-President Ronald Reagan's proposal to increase spending and to \ndecrease taxes. There were 11 Members of the U.S. Senate who voted \nagainst that package, and I wish I could say today I had been one of \nthose 11, or that I had made number 12. I was not. I bought on to the \nidea: We have a new President, let us give him an opportunity to show \nus what he can do. And I supported President Reagan's package.\n  In retrospect, I was wrong. So I would like to stand here today and \ntake blame. I will take the blame for making a mistake that helped \ncause these massive deficits and this gargantuan, absolutely awesome \nnational debt.\n  So here we are, almost on the eve of voting whether or not we want to \nrefer to the States an amendment to cause, demand, and mandate a \nbalanced budget.\n  Last Friday morning, I happened to be in this body, fortunately \nenough, as the Senate was opened with a prayer by Rev. Richard C. \nHalverson, Jr. I thought the prayer was timely, and I thought it was \npoignant. I would like to quote, if I might, Mr. President, from that \nprayer of Dr. Halverson.\n\n       Once again, in the urgency of this hour, we beseech Thee \n     for divine assistance. We pray for a hedge of enlightened \n     restraint around this ``necessary fence'' of the Senate. For \n     through this body, regulations must pass that will either \n     strengthen or weaken our country.\n\n  Dr. Halverson's ``necessary fence,'' of course, is a reference to \nJames Madison who called the Senate, this body, this institution, ``a \nnecessary fence to protect the rights and property of its citizens \nagainst an impetuous public.''\n  Mr. President, James Madison feared that the Congress from time to \ntime might act impetuously to please the public. Reverend Halverson \ncontinued in his prayer last Friday morning, and once again I quote.\n\n       As pressures mount for instant solutions to complex \n     problems, grant those who hold this ``senatorial trust'' the \n     calm resolve to be not driven by public restlessness, nor \n     drifting in stubborn idleness, but drawn by Thy vision of \n     righteousness--which upholdeth the Nation.\n\n  That was an insightful prayer, Mr. President. I hope that Dr. \nHalverson's prayer are the words that set the tone for this debate. The \npublic is restless. They are demanding instant solutions. They are \ndemanding action, and one instant answer is this very imperfect \nbalanced-budget amendment is before us today.\n  It is like a bottle of snake oil because it promises to solve all of \nour budget problems. But what it delivers are loopholes and false \nhopes. It gives politicians the easy and the temporary cover to go back \nhome and to say we have voted to balance the budget.\n  There are loopholes, Mr. President, throughout this proposal. And \ntheir inclusion assures that false hopes will be created and this is \njust what our country and just what Americans do not need right now.\n  Loophole No. 1. Right at the top of this balanced-budget amendment is \nthe three-fifths loophole. Section 1 says that three-fifths of the \nHouse and three-fifths of the Senate can vote to completely waive the \nbalanced-budget requirement for a year. I believe the framers of the \nConstitution placed provisions in the Constitution which they held \ninviolate.\n  For example, in the first amendment of the Constitution, it does not \nsay that ``Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of \nreligion unless three-fifths of each House passes legislation \nspecifying otherwise.''\n  The 13th amendment, for example, does not provide that slavery or \ninvoluntary servitude shall exist in the United States unless three-\nfifths of each House passes legislation specifying otherwise.\n  Mr. President, the reason that the three-fifths requirement sounds \nridiculous is because it is ridiculous.\n  I do not believe that we should pass this amendment. I do not believe \nwe should pass it with or without this particular loophole. But if the \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment think it is the panacea to \nall of our problems, why create a three-fifths loophole? Why not, if we \nare going to require a balanced budget? Why do we not require a \nbalanced budget, period?\n  This is the second loophole, Mr. President. That loophole is the \ndefinitions game. Section 6 of the balanced budget amendment provides \nthat estimates of outlays and receipts may be used by Congress when \ndrafting legislation to enforce and implement the provisions of this \namendment. Nowhere in this amendment before this body today, and \nnowhere in the Constitution, are the words ``outlays or receipts'' \ndefined.\n  Why would the word ``outlays'' need to be defined? Because outlays \nare the moneys that the Government spends. And without an airtight \ndefinition of what constitutes spending we had better realize that \nclever lawyers are going to find many ways to circumvent the intention \nof this amendment, whatever it may be.\n  The same goes for the definition of ``receipts.''\n  Take the example of sales of Government assets. If someone were to \npropose that we sell Mount Rushmore, would the money collected when we \nsold Mount Rushmore represent a receipt under this amendment? It might \nand it might not.\n  How about user fees? Will moneys collected from new user fees be \nconsidered a receipt? They might. But they might not.\n  It is no wonder that Judge Bork has recently said that we had better \nanticipate not only hundreds but perhaps thousands of lawsuits and \nother forms of litigation in this particular area.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator will yield me \nperhaps 5 additional minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield an \nadditional 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas [Mr. \nPryor] \n[[Page S2784]] under the same terms as heretofore agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator is very generous. I thank him.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing today is looking at a possibility of \nadopting perhaps the greatest sea change in the relationship between \nthe judiciary, the executive branches of Government, and the \nlegislative branches of Government that we have ever concerned \nourselves with. The definitional games are going to be played \nnecessarily on what is or is not an outlay or what is or is not a \nreceipt. But the definition games will not be limited to just these \nissues. And I can say, in my opinion, there are not going to be any \nwinners in this definitional game under these false promises.\n  Mr. President, there is a third loophole. There are many loopholes. \nBut No. 3 is, I think, one of the more serious--determining what an \nestimate is.\n  Who makes those estimates? If one estimator's ``estimate'' comes out \none way, the budget may be in balance. If we use another estimator's \nestimate, we will no doubt have different estimates and then be out of \nbalance. More lawsuits will ensue.\n  It sounds like estimators, not Congress, would control the measure of \nour outlays and receipts, and ultimately, the decisions effecting our \nlives.\n  The point is that estimates can differ, and they can differ \ndrastically. Estimates can be flat wrong. Human nature being what it \nis, estimates can also be manipulated. In any case, do we really want \nsomething as unreliable as economic estimates to become the \nunderpinning of the United States Constitution? I do not believe, \nnotwithstanding that the people of our country want us to balance the \nbudget, that they want to underpin the U.S. Constitution with something \nthis illusory.\n  The estimation game is one more loophole through which runaway \nGovernment spending is going to continue. It will take the \ndecisionmaking process out of the hands of the people and the Congress, \nand place it in the hands of the economists and the estimators who \nseldom agree on anything.\n  The fourth loophole, Mr. President--Let us assume that all of our \nnumbers, estimates, statistics and forecasts are correct, and we are \nstruggling to meet the requirement of a balanced budget. Then what \nCongress will do is probably start playing budget games.\n  Is there not one of us who has been here for any length of time who \nhas seen the game of putting certain functions of Government on budget \nor off budget? Mr. President, I predict under this constitutional \namendment, if it were a part of our Federal Constitution, that we would \nspend the majority of our time not balancing the budget, but figuring \nout which Government programs were on budget and off budget, which \nprograms raise money, and which programs cost money. And we will have \nmany, many heated debates on what should and should not be included in \nthat budget.\n  The temptation to take deficit programs ``off budget'' is going to be \ngreat. For example, today under section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement \nAct, we forbid the use of Social Security trust fund surpluses to \noffset the Federal deficit.\n  However, under this constitutional amendment, we are going to \napparently use Social Security surpluses for that purpose. Many, many \nexperts are predicting that in the year 2013, Social Security will \nbegin to run its own deficit. At that point, the temptation will be to \nput Social Security off budget in order to meet the balanced budget \nconstitutional requirement.\n  Nothing in this amendment prevents this chicanery, and we all know it \nwill occur. Will this inspire confidence? No. Will it balance the \nbudget? No.\n  Mr. President, there are big questions about this amendment. I have \ndiscussed just a few loopholes and gimmicks. This amendment to the \nConstitution deserves as much time as necessary to clear the air.\n  I am almost out of time. But I want to simply state that I think this \nhas been a splendid debate. I think that we have not, in any way, \ncaused anyone to truly believe that we are attempting a filibuster on \nthis side of the aisle. We have had very few quorum calls. We have had, \nin my opinion, a debate that is one that will go down in the record \nbooks. I truly believe it is one of the better debates that the U.S. \nSenate has ever engaged in.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I do not feel that our situation today \nwith regard to these awesome Federal deficits is the fault of the \nConstitution. It is our fault and it is our obligation to cure those \nproblems by making the hard decisions, the tough decisions that all of \nus know we have to make to balance the budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] \nfor his lucid, incisive observations.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, [Mr. Smith] with the understanding that I do not lose my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I do appreciate the Senator yielding \nbriefly to me. In the spirit of friendly debate, I ask the Senator if \nthere was any significance to the fact that when I happened to come on \nthe floor to give relief to Senator Hatch, who has been out here many \nhours during this debate, he mentioned Cyclops. I wondered whether \nthere was any significance to that fact that when he saw me on the \nfloor, immediately the debate went to Cyclops. I think he is a better \nexpert on history than I am, for sure, but the Cyclops had one eye, as \nI remember. I suppose there is some relevance here, because it is going \nto take more than one eye to stay focused on where this debate is going \nand where this debt is going in this country.\n  I do not know if the Senator wishes to respond, but I did take notice \nof that fact that immediately, Cyclops became the topic of discussion \nwhen I came on the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will indulge me briefly.\n  Mr. President, I will try to answer the Senator's question. Indeed, \nthe Senator's appearance did not have any part in my reference to the \nCyclopean giant. I just wish that, if I ever became involved in a \nstreet brawl in this city, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nwould be around close by. If I could have him and Senator Hollings \nthere to help me, I would feel like fighting rather than running. He is \na genuinely congenial Senator and I have enjoyed my service here with \nhim. We have often talked and discussed matters together. I value his \nfriendship and his advice and counsel. I do not always follow it, but I \ncertainly listen to what he has to say. I will say that I really was \npleased to see him come on the floor, because he is one of those \ndistinguished Members of the ``Republican response team,'' and he is a \nvery worthy one. He has been around here a while. I consider him as a \nformidable and respectable protagonist of the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget.\n  I think that answers the question, except there is one further matter \nhe mentioned, the matter of having one eye. The giant in the story by \nHomer had one eye, and the distinguished Senator referred to the \nnational debt, namely that an individual would need more than one eye \nto see the national debt because it is so high.\n  I remember that during the early first administration of President \nReagan, I saw the President on television. He was very effective. He \nhad a chart and he pointed to that chart which had a line drawn to \nrepresent the national debt at that time, in terms of $1,000 bills. He \nsaid, if I recall, that if one had $1,000 bills stacked 4 inches high, \nthe stack of $1,000 bills would represent $1 million. Mr. Reagan \nindicated by the chart that the stack of $1,000 bills necessary to \nreach the then sum of the national debt, which at that time was just a \nlittle under $1 trillion, would require a stack of $1,000 bills 63 \nmiles high.\n  That was the last time Mr. Reagan ever appeared on television using \nthat chart, because when he left office at the conclusion of his second \nadministration, that stack of bills, using his chart, would by then \nhave reached about 237 or 240 miles into the stratosphere--because the \nNation had added to its debt almost an additional $3 trillion during \nhis 8 years in office. And then, of course, under the administration of \nMr. Bush, the debt continued to grow.\n  I thank the Senator for reminding me of that chart.\n   [[Page S2785]] Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator continue to yield to me?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator mentioned he might like to have me on his side \nin a fight at some point. This is my fifth year in the Senate. It does \nnot come anywhere near the number of years the distinguished Senator \nhas served here, but I am hoping that someday before either one of our \nterms is over in the Senate we might be on the same side on an issue, \nas he is a very worthy adversary.\n  The Senator referred to a comment that I made a few days ago that \nmade the national press; that it was our goal to wear the Senator from \nWest Virginia out so we could get the balanced budget amendment to a \nvote. And the Senator is a very worthy adversary, because we have not \nbeen able to do that yet. Even though we have had a number of us out \nhere relieving one another, the Senator still stands on his feet and \nstill continues to debate, which is really the great thing about the \nSenate.\n  Over behind my desk, there is the desk of Daniel Webster, one of the \ngreatest orators in the Senate. The Senator from West Virginia \ncertainly ranks up there in oratorical skills with those great Senators \nof that time--Clay, Webster, Calhoun, and so many others.\n  But it does remind you that the time we spend here is very fleeting; \nthat we are only temporary stewards of this country.\n  But I think, in that perspective, if the Senator would continue to \nyield just for a moment, it is important to realize the significance of \nthis debate. I think this is a debate of historical significance.\n  The Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Arkansas \nmentioned the fact that the debt went up significantly during the \nReagan years when Reagan was President. That is accurate.\n  However, during those years, there were a lot in the Senator's party \nin Congress who certainly contributed to that. All of the Reagan \nbudgets, at least from when I was here from 1985 through 1988-89 during \nthe Reagan years, they were always dead on arrival and so predicted \nbefore they got here. And then they were increased by the party in \npower in the Congress. So the debt went up, true, while Reagan was \nPresident, but whether or not it went up all because of Ronald Reagan I \nthink is something that I would take pretty sharp issue on with the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SMITH. It is the time of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Number one, the Senator has stated that all of the Reagan \nbudgets were dead on arrival. I call the distinguished Senator's \nattention to the fact that some of those budgets were subjected to a \nvote in this body or the other body or both and the Republican Members \ndid not vote for those Reagan budgets. I believe I am correct in that. \nIf I am not, I will be glad for someone to correct me.\n  Second, the Senator is in error--I know this to be a fact--when he \nindicated, as I thought I understood him to so indicate, that in the \ncase of all of Mr. Reagan's budgets the Congress increased those \nbudgets. That is not the case, if I understood the Senator correctly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Congress reduced them.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Congress reduced Mr. Reagan's budgets in some of those \nyears, in some of the Reagan years.\n  Going back to 1945, the accumulated requests of all the Presidents \nexceeded the accumulated appropriations by the Congress--exceeded the \naccumulated appropriations by the Congress--over that same period.\n  But precisely under Mr. Reagan, I say again, the Congress did not \nexceed his budgets in every year. In fact, in some years Congress \nappropriated less than the budget requests.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. SMITH. But the Senator knows, as an expert on the Constitution, \nthat the Congress of the United States controls the purse strings. The \nPresident does not spend any money without the approval of Congress.\n  So I think, to be fair about it, it would be fair to say that \nCongress is ultimately responsible, not the President, for increasing \nthe debt. The President's budget is purely advisory. We do not have to \nagree to it. We can increase it, decrease it, ignore it, kill it, do \nwhatever we want to do with it. But the Congress appropriates the \nmoney. The Congress authorizes the spending. And it is the spending \nthat drove the debt up over that period of years.\n  And I would accept that there is certainly enough blame to go around \nbetween the two parties. But my point is, I think it is unfair to say \nthat Ronald Reagan alone was responsible for the debt that we have \ntoday.\n  Mr. BYRD. As the Senator says, there is enough blame to go around. \nBut the President, Mr. Reagan, never once submitted a balanced budget \nto the Congress.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is accurate. He should have, but he did not. The \nSenator is right. And neither did the Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. Pardon?\n  Mr. SMITH. Neither did the Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, President Carter did. President Carter once submitted \na balanced budget.\n  I sat right over here in room 211. I was then the majority leader of \nthe Senate. I sat over in room 211 on a weekend, brought my little \npaper bag, with some coal miner's ``steaks''--slices of baloney--in \nthat little paper bag. We had the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, and others. We had the \nPresident's men in that room, and we sat through Saturday and Sunday--\nand I believe Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, who is now on the floor, \nwas there at that time--and we hammered out a balanced budget.\n  But, the President also has a veto pen. And Mr. Reagan never once \nvetoed any appropriation bill for that reason, in particular. He vetoed \nsome bills for other reasons.\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator yield for just a brief response to that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is true. But, as the Senator knows, the Congress \nduring those years rolled these huge continuing resolutions in to the \nPresident with everything from Social Security to defense and every \nlittle program that could possibly hurt anybody in America all rolled \ninto one, essentially saying, ``Well, Mr. President, if you veto this, \nthen we will shut the Government down and stop the Social Security \nchecks.''\n  So, as I say, I think the reason we are here today is because of the \nirresponsibility, essentially, of the Congress, not any President, over \nthe years.\n  As we debate today right now on the floor of the Senate, $9,600 a \nsecond the national debt increases. It increases $576,000 a minute, \n$34,560,000 an hour, and $829 million a day--almost a $1-billion-a-day \nincrease as this debate continues.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, ``You cram these words into mine ears against the \nstomach of my sense.''\n  The Senator spoke of the omnibus continuing resolution. I have a \nlittle grandson who would say, ``Do you know what?''\n  Well, do you know what? On that continuing resolution that was so \nheavy and that Mr. Reagan dropped on the table before a joint session \nof the Congress, do you know what? He asked that those appropriations \nbe sent to him in one bill. I was here. I know. He asked that they be \ngiven to him in one bill.\n  Any further questions?\n  Mr. SMITH. Well, you did not give him any choice.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, yes. He asked for it.\n  Mr. SMITH. Not really. If Congress controls the purse strings, I say \nto the Senator from West Virginia, and the national debt increased $3 \ntrillion during those years, how can we blame the President? I mean, \nwhose responsibility is it?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, there is enough to go around, but in the case of the \n1993 budget deficit reduction package,\n I would shift the blame in large measure, to those who did not support \nthat deficit reduction package.\n\n  They sat here in the Senate. They sat in the House. We had a 1993 \ndeficit reduction package that reduced the deficit over a period of 5 \nyears by $482 billion. Somewhere between $450 and $500 billion. Not one \nRepublican Senator \n[[Page S2786]] voted for that deficit reduction package.\n  Actually, the deficits have been reduced more than that. They have \ncome down 3 consecutive years. Not one Republican Senator voted for \nthat package. Why?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would be happy to answer on behalf of the \nSenator from New Hampshire. The Senator from New Hampshire voted \nagainst that package for a number of reasons.\n  One, $250 billion in increased taxes on the American people was in \nit. No. 2, the projections beyond the 5 years in that budget that the \nSenator mentioned, the deficits go up. As we see from the follow-on \nbudget that the President has sent, we are looking at an annual average \nincrease of $200 billion a year. And the deficits will add $1.5 \ntrillion more to the debt by the turn of the century. He did not take \nthe corrective action that was necessary to continue the downward \nspiral.\n  True, deficits went down for over a 5-year projected period, largely \ndue to the tax increases, not a lot of spending cuts. When we look at \nthe outyears, the six, seventh, the eighth, they go like this, and \nunder the President's projections those deficits will be over $350 \nbillion as we turn into the 21st century.\n  That is not making the corrective decisions that need to be made to \nturn the country around, which is why we need the amendment. If \nCongress had the discipline we would not be here. They do not have the \ndiscipline. This chart proves it.\n  There are a number of attempts at balancing the budget of \ncongressional action over the years that were taken but they never got \nthe job done. One of the more recent ones is Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Lot \nof fanfare. What happened? We walked away from it because Congress did \nnot have the discipline to do it.\n  A comparison or analogy would be the Base Closing Commission. \nCongress did not have the courage to close bases that we did not need, \nso they created a commission. Some said we should create a commission \nto balance the budget. The point is the amendment forces us. It is \nunfortunate, I agree with the Senator. I wish we would not have to be \nhere saying we needed a balanced budget amendment to clutter the \nConstitution to balance the Federal budget. We should do it. But we do \nnot do it, and we will not do it until we have the amendment.\n  That is why we have to have it. If we do not, I would say to the \nSenator, our grandchildren are going to have a country that I cannot \nimagine. I can imagine a press conference by a President in the future, \nmaybe not too many years, where he comes on television and says, ``My \nfellow Americans, I have some very dismal news to share. We cannot meet \nour fiscal obligations, and I will go to Mexico and Japan and China, \nwho knows where, and see if I cannot borrow some money to meet our \nobligations.''\n  That is going to happen, I say to the Senator from West Virginia, \nbecause he knows we have to meet obligations. We are going to get to \nthe point where we cannot. Interest is consuming us. Interest is now 16 \npercent of our budget. Sixteen percent of our budget, and defense is 16 \npercent of our budget. Interest is going this way and defense is going \nthis way.\n  I would say to the Senator, where do we stop it?\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator allow me to answer the question?\n  Where do we stop? We have to, in order to stop it, we will have to \nswallow some tough medicine. We have already seen the Republican \nSenators turn tail and run when it came to tough medicine in the 1993 \nbudget deficit reduction package.\n  Well, that was tough medicine. I assume, by what my friend has said, \nit was tough medicine because it raised taxes. The Senator must come to \na conclusion at some point in time that this budget cannot be balanced \nsimply by cutting, cutting, cutting. Discretionary spending has been \ncut to the bone.\n  There has to be at some point in time, a combination of cuts and tax \nincreases. There has to be.\n  I heard a Senator on the Republican side of the aisle the other day \nsay he would never, never vote for a tax increase. Well, he has the \nright to take that position if that is the way he feels.\n  That kind of an attitude is never going to get this budget in \nbalance. The Senator talks about our children and grandchildren. I \nsuppose then, that rather than vote for a tax increase we should just \nput this burden of debt over on our children and grandchildren. I have \nchildren, I have grandchildren. Are we going to stand here and say to \nthem, ``You children, you future generations will have to raise taxes \nbecause we do not have the guts to do it''?\n  We have been on a national credit card since 1981. I can remember \nthose good-feel messages that used to be issued during the Reagan years \nfrom the oval office. Every morning. ``Good morning in America, \neverything is fine.'' There really is a free lunch.\n  But we say we will not raise taxes. We have more than one tool by \nwhich to bring budgets into balance. That effort must not be limited \nsimply to cutting programs. I have voted to cut spending programs. I \nwill vote further to cut spending programs. But we cannot put aside the \ntool of revenue increases. The men who framed the Constitution provided \nfor revenues to be increased to pay the debts to provide for the common \ndefense and the general welfare.\n  But if we are going to take the position that the only thing we will \nsupport is to cut, cut, cut, programs but we will not raise taxes, then \nwe are cheating our children and grandchildren.\n  I say we have to combine these tools if we really, really, really \nmean business.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for one more point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me first yield to Mr. Sarbanes. He has \nbeen asking me to yield, and then I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I wanted to direct an inquiry to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia with respect to the \nsupermajorities that are provided for in this amendment.\n  As the distinguished Senator has very ably pointed out, the Founding \nFathers rejected supermajorities. Both Hamilton and Madison are very \nexplicit in the Federalist Papers about the dangers of supermajorities \nand the power we place in the hands of minorities.\n  The argument has been made here on the floor by proponents of this \namendment that they have certain waiver provisions in the amendment and \nif we ever found ourselves in the difficult circumstance clearly a \nwaiver would be obtained and we would be able to address issues of \nnational importance.\n  The Senator earlier talked about the fiscal provisions, but I wanted \nto direct his attention to another section, and that is the national \nsecurity section. I submit to my colleagues that this is very serious \nbusiness and it is time to stop playing games. The Senator from West \nVirginia just pointed out one game. People are for the balanced budget \namendment but they will not vote for the deficit reduction package. \nThere is a tough deficit reduction package and they say, ``No, I cannot \nvote for that but I am for amending the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget.''\n  Let me leave that for a moment and let me talk about the national \nsecurity section which is section 5. I want Members to stop and think \nabout this very carefully because we obviously need to stop, look, and \nlisten before we place ourself into any framework that could \nconceivably endanger the national security of our country.\n  The provision says that Congress may waive the provisions of this \narticle for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect.\n  We do not have many declarations of war. We can get involved in a \nsituation we have to deal with, but we do not have a declaration of \nwar. It then goes on to say:\n\n       The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and if so declared by a joint \n     resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House, which becomes law.\n\n  In other words, if you are facing a threat, an imminent threat the \namendment may be waived. The amendment \n[[Page S2787]] does not even address the situation in which we are not \nyet engaged in military conflict.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, who is on the \nfloor, suppose we are not engaged in a military conflict, there is just \nthe danger of a military conflict breaking out which requires us to \ntake action involving the expenditure of moneys. Could you waive that \nwith a joint resolution? I ask the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland for the purpose of his engaging \nin a colloquy, if they so wish, with the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwithout my losing the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator. It says, if engaged in military \nconflict, you may waive it. Suppose you are not engaged in military \nconflict but you need to prepare for a possible engagement in military \nconflict; you need to take actions which will cost money, which will \nunbalance your budget, in order to deter the potential of a forthcoming \nmilitary conflict. Can you waive that under this provision?\n  Mr. SMITH. Would the Senator like me to respond to that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator knows very well that this debate is simply an \nattempt to divert attention from the real problem. You just mentioned a \nmoment ago the tough deficit reduction----\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, no, I yield to the Senator to respond to my \nquestion. The question is on the national security issue. The question \nis specifically addressed to section 5 of House Joint Resolution 1, and \nit specifically goes to the question of whether you could have a waiver \nwhere we were not engaged in military conflict but needed to take \naction in order to address a potential military conflict.\n  Mr. SMITH. Well, since the Senator wants me to respond to certain \nparameters rather than the parameters I prefer to respond, I say: \n``Declaration of war is intended to be construed in the context of the \npowers of the Congress to declare war under article I, section 8. The \ncommittee intends that ordinary and prudent preparations for a war \nperceived by Congress to be imminent would be funded fully within the \nlimitations imposed by the amendment, although the Congress could \nestablish higher level of spending or deficits for these or any other \npurposes under section 1.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. I know the Senator from New Hampshire is reading the \nreport, but it does not really answer the question. The first provision \nsays that Congress may waive it for any fiscal year in which a \ndeclaration of war is in effect. I am addressing a situation in which a \ndeclaration of war is not in effect.\n  Mr. SMITH. I can read it----\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am addressing a situation in which we are not \nactually engaged in military conflict, but we want to take actions to \nforestall a military conflict. Can you waive it?\n  Mr. SMITH. Is that not ordinary and prudent preparations for war? \nYes, that is ordinary and prudent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. You can waive it?\n  Mr. SMITH. It did not say waive it. ``The committee intends that \nordinary and prudent preparations for a war perceived by Congress to be \nimminent would be funded fully * * *'' There is nothing to waive.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Fully funded; in other words, you can violate the \nrequirements of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH. Not at all. That is not what this says. The truth of the \nmatter is, there will not be any funds even to conduct war if we \ncontinue along the lines that the Senator from Maryland would like to \ngo, which is literally to bankrupt the United States of America. We \nwill not have any money to spend on defense.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What does the Senator make of this waiver provision? \nWhat is its intention to be in section 5?\n  Mr. SMITH. This is the time of the Senator from West Virginia. I am \nnot going to engage the Senator on the time of the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I see. I regret the Senator does not want to respond. \nIf the Senator from West Virginia will continue to yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I regret the Senator from New Hampshire does not want \nto address that question. Let me just point out to the Senate that when \nyou really get down to some of these hard questions, the proponents of \nthis amendment just slide off them and they say, ``Oh, well, we would \nget a waiver.''\n  The waiver that is required here is declared by joint resolution \nadopted by a majority of the whole number of each House and, as the \nvery able Senator from West Virginia has pointed out, this is contrary \nto what the Constitution now requires.\n  What this waiver means is that you would have to have 51 votes in the \nSenate and 218 votes in the House. I have heard the proponents stand on \nthe floor and say, ``Don't worry, no problem. If a situation arises, \nclearly the Members will vote for the waiver and we will be able to \naddress it, we will get these votes, there is no problem.''\n  I just want to recount one story, because this is very serious \nbusiness, I suggest to the Members.\n  On August 12, 1941, the House of Representatives was confronted with \nthe issue of extending the time of service of those members of the \narmed services who had been drafted the year before.\n  In the summer of 1940, the Congress had passed the Selective Training \nand Service Act, and, under it, people called up were to serve for 1 \nyear--the President could extend the period indefinitely if Congress \ndeclared that the national interest is in peril.\n  On July 21, 1941, with the prospect of war increasing, President \nRoosevelt acted. In a special message to Capitol Hill, he asked \nCongress to declare a national emergency that would allow the Army to \nextend the service of draftees. The President came to the Congress and \nasked them to make this extension. Everyone is telling us that ``if we \nhad a national emergency, surely the Congress would act.'' The measure \nregarding the draft for World War II passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 203 to 202. It passed the Senate by a vote \nof 45 to 30.\n  Now, just think of this. We are literally a few months away from the \noutbreak of World War II. The President has said to the Congress, \n``There is a national emergency. I ask you to extend the time of duty \nof those who had been drafted the previous year for a 12-month period. \nThe storm clouds are on the horizon for all to see. We need to take \naction.''\n  In many ways, it is comparable to envisioning a waiver situation for \nnational security under this amendment for which the proponents say, \n``Oh, if there is a real problem, we'll get the waiver and we'll \naddress our national security situation.''\n  At that time, the vote in the Senate was 45 to 30; in the House of \nRepresentatives, 203 to 202. Neither of those votes meets the \nrequirement of section 5 of this balanced budget amendment proposal.\n Even though in both instances a majority of those voting on this draft \nquestion voted to extend it, 45 to 30 in the Senate, 203 to 202 in the \nHouse, with Speaker Rayburn going into the well of the House in order \nto bring about that vote, neither of those votes is a majority of the \nwhole number of each House, which is what this amendment requires.\n\n  So I ask my friends, the proponents of this proposition, how have \nthey provided for the national security of the Nation? I am giving you \nan absolute, specific demonstration of an instance in which anyone \nlooking back upon it would say clearly there was an important national \nsecurity question that needed to be addressed and yet the vote to \naddress it would not carry the day under the requirements of section 5 \nof this balanced budget amendment. The section states ``So declared by \na joint resolution adopted by a majority of the whole number of each \nHouse,'' which means you have to have 218 votes in the House--it \ncarried in the House 203 to 202; it did not have 218 votes--and means \nyou would have had to have 49 votes in the Senate. It carried in the \nSenate 45 to 30, but it did not have the necessary 49 votes in the \nSenate. There were 48 states in the Union during World War II and 96 \nSenators; therefore, the whole number would be 49.\n  [[Page S2788]] Now, this is the absolute harm which supermajorities \ncan potentially do to the national security of our Nation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator allow me to respond to that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Sure.\n  Mr. SMITH. The point is, it is very clear in the language that I have \njust indicated on the amendment as well as article I of the amendment. \nThe Senator is correct that it does take a three-fifths vote. Now, the \npoint is----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield at that point? This requirement, \nas I understand it, does not take a three-fifths vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right, it does not.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This requirement requires the supermajority in the \nsense that it required that it be adopted by a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House.\n  You see, this is very important, and I am glad we are having this \ndiscussion because it is important to know exactly what this resolution \nprovides and how it would work in real-life situations. There is a \ngreat tendency to just brush it all aside, and in fact I think this \nexchange illustrates that because I am not now focusing on the three-\nfifths requirement. That is a different issue.\n  Mr. SMITH. It is not a different issue.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am focusing on the section 5 provision, and its \nsupermajority requirement of the majority of the whole number of each \nHouse.\n  Mr. SMITH. But the Senator is focusing on that and ignoring article \nI, which allows you to raise the debt if you need to raise the debt in \norder to deficit spend, in order to deal with the emergency that the \nSenator is talking about.\n  Mr. SARBANES. By a three-fifths vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is what the Senator chooses to ignore, because that \nanswers his question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. By a three-fifths vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That underscores my point even more. If the Senator's \nanswer to me is you can waive it on a three-fifths vote, then in \nneither of these instances in the Senate or the House for the extension \nof the draft did they come anywhere close to the three-fifths vote. \nThey did not have the three-fifths vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. It goes right back to the issue of priorities, which is \nwhy we are dealing with a balanced budget amendment to begin with, I \nsay to the Senator from Maryland. Priorities are, if you are at war or \nneed to go to war to defend the national interest of the United States \nof America, and you need a three-fifths vote to do it and you cannot \nget it, you will cut spending somewhere else; you will take out some \npork or some wasteful spending that we never can get out of this \nbudget, which is the reason we are in this mess.\n  You set priorities. What is more important, the national security of \nthe United States or funding the Education Department or funding the \nCommerce Department or HUD? You make decisions, just like everybody \nelse has to do in America.\n  That is the problem. The Senator has gone right to the heart of it. \nThat is exactly why we are here today, because of this mess, because of \nthe point the Senator makes. Nobody wants to set priorities anymore.\n  You set priorities. If I am a Senator and this happens, and the \nPresident of the United States, whoever he or she may be, needs money, \nneeds forces, needs to protect the national security of the United \nStates or the troops in the field, I am going to cut somewhere; you bet \nI am going to cut somewhere, and I am going to do it quickly if I \ncannot get the three-fifths.\n  I say to the Senator, I think we would get the three-fifths because \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives, speaking on behalf of the \nAmerican people, with our Armed Forces in jeopardy, are certainly not \ngoing to deny them the protection they need and the materials they need \nto protect themselves in the field or the national security interests \nof the United States.\n  It is a weak argument, and the Senator knows it. It is just a way to \nobfuscate this issue, to deny those who are out here saying we need \nthis amendment. We do need it, and that is exactly why we do need it, \nbecause nobody wants to set priorities. No priorities can be set here--\nonly in the household budgets, only in business, only in the cities of \nAmerica, only in the States but not in the Congress of the United \nStates. Oh, no; we have to spend more than we take in, year after year \nafter year after year, $18,500 per American. That is the share of the \nnational debt. It goes up, up, up, up.\n  The Senator talked about the guts to support the President's budget. \nThe President's budget did not resolve it. If it resolved it, why are \nwe looking at $200 billion more in annual deficits? How are you going \nto defend America when we get $20 trillion in debt? Where do you draw \nthe line? Where do you draw the line?\n  The Senators talked about taxes. We can raise the tax rate, the \nSenator from West Virginia said--36 percent, 50 percent, 70 percent, \n100 percent? That is what is going on in Washington, DC, right now. The \ntaxes are so high they cannot pay them anymore. They are asking the \nFederal Government to come in and take over the city.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me bring the Senator back to the very real-life \nproblem that I wish to discuss with him based on a very clear example \nin history, because what the Senator has just done is what is \nconsistently done here. If we try to focus, in a tough-minded way, on a \nparticular problem they say, ``Oh, well, don't worry about it; somehow \nor other it is going to be taken care of.''\n  Now, I want the Senator to come with me for just a moment or two and \nto look at some history, and I want to read from this article that \nappeared in the summer of 1991.\n\n       Fifty years ago last Monday, on August 12, 1941, House \n     Speaker Sam Rayburn saved the draft from legislative defeat \n     and kept the U.S. Army intact to fight a war that was only 4 \n     months away.\n\n  The reason I am citing this story is because we are constantly told \nthat if we have an emergency situation, we will get this waiver. The \nSenator from New Hampshire has just told me we are going to get a \nthree-fifths waiver. He left the section I was focusing on that \nrequired a majority of the whole number, namely you had to actually \nhave 218 votes in the House or actually have 51 votes in the Senate, \nand he has now gone to three-fifths of the whole number. So you have to \nhave 290 votes in the House and 60 votes in the Senate in order to \naddress the crisis. He says if we have a crisis, we obviously will \naddress it. I am going to point to a lesson in history in which I think \npeople would now agree we had a crisis that had to be addressed. We did \naddress it. But if we had been operating with these requirements, \neither one of them, we would not have addressed it because we would not \nhave gotten the vote that was necessary to do it.\n  Let me read on from the article.\n\n       The margin of victory was a single vote. And the battle \n     could have been lost as easily as won except for Rayburn's \n     personality and leadership and mastery of parliamentary \n     procedure. If Rayburn had failed, the Army stood to lose \n     about two-thirds of its strength and three-fourths of the \n     officer corps. At issue was whether to extend the 12-month \n     service obligation of more than 600,000 draftees already in \n     the Army, thousands of others being inducted every day, and \n     the active-duty term of several thousand National Guardsmen \n     and Reservists who had been called up for 1 year. Without an \n     extension, the obligations of both the draftees and the \n     Guardsmen and Reservists would begin expiring in the fall. \n     The United States had adopted its first peacetime draft \n     during the previous summer after weeks of heated and \n     acrimonious debates in both congressional Chambers.\n\n  The article then goes on to point out:\n\n       Although the legislation limited the draftees' terms of \n     service to 12 months, it provided that the President could \n     extend the period indefinitely if Congress declared that the \n     national interest is imperiled.\n       On July 21, 1941, with the prospect of war increasing, \n     Roosevelt acted. In a Special Message to Capitol Hill, he \n     asked Congress to declare a national emergency that would \n     allow the Army to extend the service of draftees, guardsmen \n     and reservists for whatever period the legislators deemed \n     appropriate.\n       Despite the measure's unpopularity and strong lobbying by \n     isolationist forces, the Senate approved a joint resolution \n     on August 7, declaring the existence of a national emergency \n     and authorizing the President to extend the service of most \n     Army personnel by 18 months.\n\n  The vote was 45 to 30, I say to my good friend from New Hampshire; 45 \nto 30. That vote would not have qualified \n[[Page S2789]] under the amendment that he is proposing. That vote was \ninadequate. You needed 49 now you would need 51, if you did it by the \nwhole number, or 60 if you are doing the three-fifths. I am now quoting \nthe article.\n\n       In the House it was a different story. The Republican \n     leadership viewed opposition to draft extension as a \n     political opportunity too good to ignore. Others had their \n     own reasons for opposing the measure.\n\n  It then discusses what Rayburn went through, and of course the final \nvote was 203 to 202. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, 203 votes is not enough under the provisions of the \nproposal that he is now seeking to place in the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  So, here we have a real situation. This is not hypothetical. This was \na critical issue. It was carried under the provisions of the Founding \nFathers, which the very distinguished Senator from West Virginia has \nbeen expounding. Under the provisions of the Founding Fathers, the \nCongress was able to make a decision. You had a majority in both Houses \nfor it, 45 to 30 in the Senate, 203 to 202 in the House of \nRepresentatives. They addressed the situation. Under this proposal, we \nwould not have been able to address that crisis.\n  Mr. SMITH. If I might just respond to the Senator, his point is well \ntaken. However we have a situation where I think we are mixing apples \nand oranges. The Senator is assuming--we did not have an amendment at \nthe time, we did not have a $5 trillion national debt in 1941. We did \nnot have a situation where the Members who were debating knew that they \nwould need a certain number of votes to get over the top to be able to \ndeclare war. It is an entirely different situation. You cannot compare \n1941 with 1995--you can, but I do not believe it is a fair comparison.\n  I think things were different then. The situation was different. The \ndebate was different. The issues were different. I think in this \nparticular case if the emergency was such, under the amendment--if the \nemergency were such that we needed to do something in the area of \nnational security, it could be done either by a three-fifths vote of \nboth parties to deficit spend to take care of it--which is one option. \nIf they do not want to do that, then they have other options. But I \nthink to say 1941 when Roosevelt declared war is the same as it is \ntoday is simply wrong.\n  The issue is, we can deficit spend. That is the first option. Or we \ncan cut spending somewhere else. And that is exactly what most \nresponsible people would do in the future, who are here on the floor of \nthe Senate or in the House, wherever the debate takes place--in both \nplaces. They would make the responsible decision, surely, to protect \nthe national security of the United States. They would cut something if \nthey did not agree to go the three-fifths route to deficit spend to do \nit. I think that is very well protected under the Constitution. It \nmakes complete sense. It is common sense. We are the representatives of \nthe American people. If we decide we cannot muster three-fifths votes \nthen I assume the American people do not feel it is a national security \nproblem for us.\n  If we still believe that they are wrong, we can then cut spending \nsomewhere else with a simple majority. I do not see what the Senator's \nproblem is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to my colleague we are just being \ngiven these kind of bland assurances. ``Surely this would happen. No \nquestion this would be done. It is common sense that we would \nrespond.'' Yet I am giving you a real, live, historical example. There \nwas nothing hypothetical about it, nothing conjectural about it. It \nhappened at a critical time in American history. We were faced in the \nCongress with a very fateful decision. We are talking literally months \nbefore Pearl Harbor. Literally months. And the Congress was faced with \nthis difficult decision.\n  The Congress reacted, I think, appropriately. But by very narrow \nmargins. And neither of the margins in the Senate nor the House are \nadequate to meet the requirements contained in your proposal, which \nonly dramatizes the point that the Senator from West Virginia has made \nso effectively here this morning about the danger of going against the \nFounding Fathers, against Madison and Hamilton, and writing in these \nsupermajority requirements.\n  The real danger to the Republic is that you will not be able to deal \nwith crisis situations when they emerge.\n  The Senator says, ``Oh, no, we will take care of those. Do not worry \nabout it. Do not worry about it. Surely we would respond.''\n  I am saying to the Senator: I am giving an example right out of \nhistory where we, under his standards, would not have taken care of it. \nFortunately the standard was the one laid down by the founders, the one \nthat the Senator from West Virginia propounded here. In other words, we \ndecide things by majority. We were able to address the situation. But \nwith your provisions here that situation could not have been addressed. \nIt is clear on its face.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a response, \nthere are a couple of points here. First of all, the Senator is \nassuming something he does not know to be the fact. In 1941 we did not \nhave a three-fifths situation. In 1941, I would assume that the \nAmerican people would have wanted us to support the President of the \nUnited States, which we did, to go to war when we were attacked.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that? Is the Senator telling \nme that on a measure that passed the House 203 to 202, that if at the \ntime there had been a three-fifths requirement of the entire membership \nof the House of Representatives--which would be 261 votes?\n  Mr. SMITH. I did not do the math. I will take the Senator's word for \nit.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is 261.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me tell the Senator, 175 votes could defeat it; two-\nfifths could defeat it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is 261. Are you telling me that a good number of the \n202 who voted against it then would have voted for it, so you would \nhave had 261 votes? Where are you going to come up with these? You \nbarely got 203 votes. It almost lost. It passed by one vote. And now \nyou are telling me, ``They did not have the three-fifths requirements \nthen. If they had the three-fifths requirement somehow, miraculously \nthey would have gotten the other votes in order to do it when they \nvoted against it at the time?'' They almost beat it. They almost beat \nit on a straight up or down vote: 203 to 202. And now you are telling \nme, ``Well, they did not have the three-fifths requirements. If they \nwould have had the three-fifths requirement, namely that he had to get \n261 votes then a big chunk of these 202 who voted against it then, to \nprevent it from happening, would have switched over and voted for it?'' \nIs that what the Senator is telling me? I cannot believe it.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator did not listen to me very carefully. That is \nnot exactly what I said. What I said is there are two options. One, \nthose people, if they had the three-fifths provision, I think, would \nhave looked at it a lot differently, and they may have gotten more \nvotes.\n  Let us assume the Senator's position and say that did not happen. If \nit did not happen and this amendment were, in 1941, part of the \nConstitution, we then would have gone and spent money by taking money \nfrom someplace else in the budget because we would have believed that \nthe national security interests of the United States should come first \nahead of subsidies to apples or whatever else.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How do you know they would have done that?\n  Mr. SMITH. Because it takes 51 percent to do it. That is why.\n  Mr. SARBANES. My dear friend.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is exactly why. It is the same numbers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from New Hampshire is my dear friend. But \nhow can the Senator stand here and say, ``We easily would have gone \nsomewhere else and found the money'' when at the time, on the very \nissue itself without that constraint, without that additional \ncomplication in terms of getting support for the measure, without the \nfurther complication of the dynamics of trying to achieve a majority \nvote, when at the time they only passed it by one vote, 203 to 202? \nThat was the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Speaker Rayburn walked the Halls of the Congress. I am \nnow quoting this article.\n       [[Page S2790]] The vote was set for Monday, August 11. But \n     Rayburn put it off for one day out of respect for a \n     Republican Member who had died over the weekend.\n\n  I must say those were the days when there was a degree of civility \nthat prevailed in the workings of the Congress.\n\n       With the President out of town meeting secretly in New \n     Foundland with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to \n     frame the Atlantic Charter, Rayburn spent the additional day \n     roaming the corridors of Capitol Hill trying to win over \n     recalcitrant Democrats and wavering Republicans. His lobbying \n     style was like the man himself, honest, direct and intensely \n     personal without a hint of intimidation. The debate went on \n     for 10 hours in the House. Finally at 8:05 p.m. the reading \n     clerk began calling the roll.\n\n  I reach back into history to try to bring you a real, live example.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield for \nsuch colloquy without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I apologize. I did not realize my distinguished friend \nfrom West Virginia had the floor.\n  Let me just say this. That is what was created 203 to 202. There were \ntimes when that could have happened. It was extraordinary. In the \nSenate, there were only 96 Senators sitting at that time. The vote was \n45 to 30. So there were 21 Senators that were missing. We could have \nhad a constitutional majority in this case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How could you have had it? Those votes could not \nqualify under your amendment. Is that correct? Neither of those votes \nqualifies under your amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. You could not with those two votes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Either in the Senate or the House.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator was talking about Senators walked. They walked \nthere. There were 30 that walked in the House. There were 21 in the \nSenate; 96 in the Senate; only 75 voted. So even under a minority vote, \npeople can walk, if they want to.\n  But the point is we have a constitutional majority in here for one \nreason, and it has been accepted by both Democrats and Republicans in \nthe House and the Senate; and that is so that we would have tax-\nlimiting effect. I think it is going to be a tax-limiting effect. That \nis the purpose of it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, you have it in section 5 to \ndo a waiver for a military conflict you require a whole number of each \nHouse.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The whole number.\n  Let me go back. There were only 48 States then. So there were 96 \nSenators.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The whole number would be 49 in that circumstance. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The vote in the Senate was 45 to 30. That does not \nqualify. Correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In the House, they had 218.\n  Mr. HATCH. 203 to 202.\n  Mr. SARBANES. 218.\n  Mr. HATCH. No. It was 203 to 202.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In any event, it will not qualify there either.\n  Mr. HATCH. It would have, had they not walked.\n  My point is the Senator is saying they might walk under this \nconstitutional majority. They walked then under a regular majority \nvote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. But in both cases, had they not walked, you could have had \na constitutional majority. I think these votes are going to be \nheightened votes, and nobody is going to miss them.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could say to my dear friend from Utah, the \nFounders specifically discussed this. They debated whether the quorum \nshould be more than a majority of the body and they rejected the notion \nthat it should be more than a majority. They said then that you would \nprevail on a measure by majority of those present and voting.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Assuming you had a quorum. You have escalated the \nnumber, and you have done it in such a way as to negatively effect very \ncritical decisions, as I have indicated by the history of World War II. \nA measure that was before the body that I would argue very strenuously \nwas needed to provide for the national security of our Nation would \nhave failed, not because a majority of those present and voting did not \nsupport it--they did support it--but because you have introduced \nsupermajority requirements. And these votes would not have met your \nsupermajority requirements.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield once more to me?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yes. I do.\n  Mr. HATCH. Keep in mind, I do not think that we can use votes in \n1941. There was not a constitutional amendment in effect then. Keep in \nmind, one of the other things our Founding Fathers did--they did it \nvery carefully--was to put article V into the Constitution which \nprovides for constitutional amendments, and for changes that are \nneeded. We are asserting that this change is needed because of the way \nCongress has been profligate over the last 60 years.\n  But let us say the last 26 years during which time we have--could I \nfinish? Let me finish this one thought. The point is that one of the \nmost important aspects of the balanced budget amendment is that these \ntwo votes, if they are taken every year, are going to be the votes \nnobody is going to be able to miss. If you vote on increasing taxes, \nthere are going to have to be 100 Senators here because it is going to \nbe a vote that everybody in the country is going to pay attention to. \nIf you vote on increasing the deficit, there had better be 100 Senators \nhere. There are not going to be any walks. Anybody who walks is not \ngoing to be there in the next Congress.\n  That is one thing this amendment will do.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let us assume that. Let us assume in 1941 in the House \nof Representatives that everyone who walked would have voted for the \nmeasure. It is a big assumption. Let us assume that. Everyone who did \nnot vote would have voted for it.\n  Mr. HATCH. You would have had a constitutional majority----\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, you would not have had the three-fifths----\n  Mr. HATCH. Not to increase spending.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Which the Senator from New Hampshire was making \nreference to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I said a constitutional majority for increasing taxes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The point I want to get across to my colleague is that \nthere is the assumption that issues of national security will not be a \nmatter of controversy. In other words, he is saying clearly, if there \nis a problem, we are going to get these supermajorities in order to do \nwhat needs to be done. I am demonstrating that we had an instance in \nwhich there was clearly a national security question and you are not \ncommanding the supermajority.\n  Mr. HATCH. The fact that you cannot command a supermajority is part \nof what is going to happen here. What we are saying is, look.\n  I think a better illustration, if the Senator wants me to substitute \none for him, would be the vote last year on the tax package which the \nPresident brought up here. It is an interesting constitutional question \nthat I know will intrigue my dear friend from West Virginia who has \nspent a lifetime studying the Constitution--for whom I have a lot of \nrespect--in that area, among many others. That is, that vote last year \ndid not have one Republican. We have been excoriated by Members of the \nother side of the floor as Republicans because we did not vote for that \ntax increase, or the deficit reduction part of it either. We did not \nbecause we did not want taxes to increase. And some stood up and said, \n``We stood up and did something about the deficit.'' Well, I suspect \nthat is true. We just did not happen to agree. But now that vote was a \n50-50 tie in the Senate.\n  I want the attention of my dear friend from West Virginia. It was a \n50-50 tie. Had this constitutional amendment been in effect, would that \nbill have become law today? Or would it have become law at that time? \nWe did not have a majority of the whole number of the U.S. Senate. It \ntook the Vice President to break the tie.\n  There are two ways of looking at that. One is that 50 of us could \nhave thwarted the tax increase. I think that would have been a terrific \nthing to do, \n[[Page S2791]] and that is what we tried to do. We lost because of the \nfact that under the Constitution the Vice President could vote. But the \nother point would be--\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish and I will be glad to. The other point--with \nthe delegation given to me from our colleague--is that, from your \nstandpoint, a simple majority was not allowed to win, and that this \nwould make it even more difficult because you would have to have 51 \nactual votes of the whole number here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is that your reading of section 4 of this balanced \nbudget amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not necessarily. I am raising--\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is your interpretation? What does it mean? Section \n4 says, ``No bill to increase revenue shall become law unless approved \nby a majority of the whole number of each House by a rollcall vote.'' \nTake the situation you just described. It is a 50-50 split. The Vice \nPresident is entitled to cast his vote. Would this negate the vote-\ncasting power of the Vice President?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. He could cast his vote, but since you did not have 51 \nvotes of the majority of the whole number, the tax bill would have gone \ndown to defeat.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is your understanding of the meaning of that?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is my interpretation. I thought I would give you a \ngood illustration.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wanted to have that on the record.\n  Mr. HATCH. We would not have had that highest tax increase in history \nhad this amendment been in effect.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. You are saying if this amendment were \npassed, the August vote would have been negated.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is my interpretation. It would have meant that we \nwould have had to have gotten that 51 votes to increase taxes, and we \nprobably would have been faced with having to reduce the deficit more.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what it also means is that in a situation \nsuch as the distinguished Senator from Maryland has raised--and he has \nfocused on a section which I am going to reach a little later, but he \nhas done it much better than I would have done it. What my Republican \nfriends are saying--and I hope I will have the attention of both of my \nfriends--what our friends here have just said is that in the event we \nare in a situation which jeopardizes the national security----\n  Mr. HATCH. No, that is not what I said.\n  Mr. BYRD. Wait. That is, in essence, what you are saying. You have \nnot let me finish what I am going to say. How do you know what I am \ngoing to say? Be a little patient.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will.\n  Mr. BYRD. What they are, in essence, saying is that you have to have \n51 votes in the Senate--no matter how many take a walk; you have to \nhave 51 Senators, not including the Vice President, who would be \nwilling to stand up and vote for a resolution which authorizes the \nCommander in Chief in a situation where there is a declaration of war \nor----\n  Mr. HATCH. No, no----\n  Mr. BYRD. Just let me finish. This is one Senator who is not going to \nbe befuddled or frustrated by interruptions. I will be very happy to \nyield to my friend when I have finished.\n  Let me start again. We will learn over a period of time that there \nare some Senators who will just not be rushed.\n  ``Congress may waive the provisions of this article for any fiscal \nyear in which a declaration of war is in effect.'' In the last 48 \nyears, this country has fought three wars and engaged in several \nmilitary conflicts that were of a lesser nature. Not one time was there \na declaration of war. Not one time.\n\n       The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and is so declared by a joint resolution \n     adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House which \n     becomes law.\n\n  Therein lies a tale--many tales, as a matter of fact. First, there \nhas to be a resolution passed. There has to be a joint resolution \npassed, even considering the fact that we might have a filibuster \nconducted on such a resolution because the opposition could be very \nstrong in the Senate on that occasion There could be a filibuster. The \nPresident could veto the resolution when it reaches him. How much time \ndo we have? My friend from New Hampshire--I believe, if I did not \nmisunderstand him--said in that kind of a situation, we would make \ncuts, we would make cuts from other programs. We would adjust \npriorities.\n  We do not have time to make cuts when the Nation is faced with a \nmilitary threat. We do not have time to search through various programs \nand come up with cuts. And besides, the domestic discretionary programs \nhave already been pared to the bone. When the Nation is put in \njeopardy, there must be a resolution passed. It must be enacted into \nlaw by the President's signature, and the Nation's security is in the \nbalance. We do not have time to make cuts. It takes time.\n  Secondly, in the event there is a 50-50 tie, under the Constitution \nas it is written, the Vice President could cast a vote breaking the \ntie. Under this section of the amendment, the Vice President, \nrepresenting the President and his administration, is not permitted to \ncast a vote to break a tie, while the Nation's security is in the \nbalance. No, it has to be a Senator. The amendment says you have to \nhave 51 Senators.\n  Mr. President, this section 5, plays Russian roulette with the \nnational security of this country. You do not have the time to look at \nsome programs providing research on apples, or mushrooms, or whatever \nit may be. You do not have time for that. And that is small chicken \nfeed, that is small; you are talking about pennies in comparison with \nthe billions of dollars that military threats to our security will \ncost. It puts the Nation's security into a gamble.\n  Mr. President, does the distinguished Senator wish me to yield to him \nagain?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would appreciate it. I appreciate what the Senator is \nsaying. This amendment is not going to allow business\n as usual. It is going to require a constitutional majority to increase \ntaxes, which is a tax-limiting approach. I suspect that that will be \nmore difficult to get than a three-fifths majority to increase the \ndebt. I really suspect that that is so.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia--as he always is--was \nvery accurate in stating that section 5 says that during a declared \nwar, Congress can waive this provision. That only takes a majority \nvote. However, if you get into a military conflict which causes an \nimminent and serious military threat, then it will take a \nconstitutional majority.\n  I cannot imagine any Congress that would not grant a constitutional \nmajority under those circumstances. But be that as it may, if it does \nnot, then that will be the right of the Congress.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The people who are against it do not even have to show \nup; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now the way the Constitution is written, if a matter is \nput to a vote, let us say four or five Members are missing, they may be \nill, they may be in the hospital, they may be sick, they may have gone \nto a family funeral, so they cannot be here. It is not unheard of. In \nfact, it has happened on occasion. You take a vote amongst those that \nare here. It passes 47 to 46, and that is that. Under your provision \nyou need 51 votes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Suppose you had a vote 50 to nothing, just to draw the \nmost extreme hypothetical, 50 are for, zero against. The rest are all \nabsent. That does not carry; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. You would wait until the next day when you had 51. You can \ncome up with hypotheticals in every situation, but that does not change \nreality. This body has increased the debt ceiling.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But the people that are against do not have to vote; \nright?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They are not required to be here to make a difference. \nBecause the standard is not between \n[[Page S2792]] those that are for and those that are against, you have \nto get so many affirmative votes; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. You could use the same logic. It does not---\n  Mr. SARBANES. Or it could be the three-fifths where you have ---\n  Mr. HATCH. You have to have 51 here to constitute a quorum, so it \nwould not have passed anyway. That could be under any hypothetical.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, no. You can have 51 here, which is a quorum, under \nthe constitutional amendment that presently obtains and 26 Senators \nwould be a majority.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If you had 51 present so you had a quorum and the vote \nwas say 48 to 3.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then you would not have the requisite number.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It would not pass; right?\n  Mr. HATCH. No.\n  Mr. SARBANES. You would have a quorum and you would not pass it.\n  The more you probe into this, the more of a Rube Goldberg contraption \nit is.\n  Actually what happens is, the more we debate this section, the more \nyou come to understand and a appreciate the perceptions and the wisdom \nof the drafters of the Constitution.\n  It is incredible that we are out here playing games with a document \nthat has withstood 206 years of scrutiny and was put together by a \ngroup of men whom Gladstone, the great British Prime Minister, regarded \nas the greatest assemblage of statesmen in the history of the world. \nThat was his comment about them in framing the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Yet, we are playing games with it all throughout here.\n  You have a three-fifths of the whole number requirement, you have a \nmajority of the whole number requirement, you have a waiver \nrequirement. You are negating the tie-breaking vote given to the Vice \nPresident of the United States, as I understand it, under another \nprovision of the Constitution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not really.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator told me on a vote of 50 to 50, in which the \nVice President sought to cast the tie-breaking vote, would not qualify \nunder your proposal.\n  Mr. HATCH. Only under that instance. In other instances it who \nqualify.\n  Let me make this point. The game that is being played is business as \nusual. We are running this country right into bankruptcy.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, that is not the case.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, I am going to reclaim my time. I am not going to \nlet the Senator----\n  Mr. HATCH. He yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from West Virginia yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me get it perfectly clear. I yielded to both Senators \nfor a colloquy, with the understanding that I would not lose my right \nto the floor, into which colloquy I presume I can intervene at any \npoint I wish.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  If I could finish my remarks, I would be happy to allow the Senator \nfrom Maryland to respond.\n  My problem is, you can find fault with almost anything. The reason we \nbrought this balanced budget amendment before us is because we have a \nrunaway train of Federal spending. We have a runaway train that is not \ntreating our taxpayers fairly. The answers always seem to be more \nspending and more taxing.\n  This amendment is an amendment that does not require a balanced \nbudget, but it does require us to at least make priority choices.\n  If we are going to spend, then we are going to have to stand up and \nvote to do so. You have to vote. We do not have to now. If we are going \nto tax, then you have to stand up and vote to tax. We do not have to do \nthat right now. We can do it through voice votes.\n  I just want to add this to it: If you are going to tax more, by gosh, \nI think you are going to find these two votes--a vote to increase \ntaxes, a vote to increase the deficit--from this point on, if this \nbalanced budget amendment passes both Houses and becomes ratified, you \nare going to find that those two votes are going to have 100 Senators \nevery time, because nobody could fail to vote on them. And if they do, \nthey are in jeopardy of losing their seat. It is going to highlight the \nimportance of these votes around here. We will not have any more of \nthese 51 votes or 26 to 25. We have not had any of those as long as I \nhave been here.\n  The point is that when the Senator mentioned that in his \nhypothetical, he said 50 votes. I am saying that would not have been \nacceptable; 51, if you have 26 votes, yes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could just engage in this colloquy further.\n  The game that is being played, I say to my friend, is very clear \ntoday because the other side has been very clear that they have drafted \nthis in a way that would have knocked out the deficit reduction package \nof August 1993.\n  Now, I understand that the Senator was not for that. I was for it. I \ndisagree with him. The Senator portrays it as a tax increase on all the \nAmerican people. The fact of the matter is, it was a tax cut on the top \n2 percent of the income, other than the gasoline tax. But the income \ntax rates affected the top 2 percent.\n  Now, I understand the Senators on the other side have a very soft \nspot for the top 2 percent, but it seemed to me reasonable to do this \nand to try to address some of our Nation's problems.\n  In any event, the situation could have been reversed. You could have \nbeen trying to push through a deficit reduction package that I opposed \nfor one reason or another.\n  The question is whether you are going to skew the Constitution in a \nway that a majority is not going to be able to make decisions. The \nFounding Fathers very carefully constructed this document and they are \nvery explicit, both Madison and Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, in \npointing out in the documents about a supermajority.\n  Let me just read what Madison said in Federalist 58. Because he is \nthe father of our Constitution and a man of great reason and fairness. \nHe would recognize the other arguments and try to deal with them \nrationally, which is what we are trying very hard to do here today. Let \nme just quote him.\n  This is Madison now, in the Federalist 58:\n\n       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum; and in particular cases, if not \n     in all, more than a majority of the quorum for a decision. \n     That some advantages might have resulted from such a \n     precaution cannot be denied. It might have been an additional \n     shield to some particular interests, and another obstacle \n     generally to hasty and partial measures. But these \n     considerations are outweighed by the inconveniences in the \n     opposite scale. In all cases where justice or the general \n     good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures \n     to be pursued, the fundamental principle of free Government \n     would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that \n     would rule: the power would be transferred to the minority.\n      Were the defensive privilege limited to particular cases, an \n     interested minority might take advantage of it to screen \n     themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal, \n     or, in particular emergencies, to extort unreasonable \n     indulgences.\n\n  Now, I agree with Gladstone's evaluation of the Founding Fathers. \nThis amendment is fraught with peril. The more we go into it and the \nmore we develop it and the more we measure it against historical \nexperience, the more I find wrong with the amendment.\n  The Senator asserted earlier that surely three-fifths would vote to \nraise the debt limit. I invite my colleague to go back through the \nvotes on raising debt limits in the past to spot the ones where three-\nfifths did not. It is not so obvious.\n  In many of these issues it is a struggle to get the simple majority \nto make the decision. These are controversial issues. They are \nrecognized as controversial. The August 1993 package was controversial. \nYou disagreed with it. I supported it. I think it has proven itself \nout. I think all the subsequent history supports a decision to have \npassed it.\n  Those decisions ought to be made by majority vote. That is what the \nFounding Fathers intended. That is what I think we should stick with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield.\n   [[Page S2793]] Mr. SMITH. The Senator has been very generous for all \nMembers here on his time for which this Senator is grateful.\n  I would like to pick up on something that Senator Hatch said, and say \nto the Senator from Maryland, the Senator has pointed out some points \nwhich are well taken regarding this debate and this amendment. I would \nalso say to the Senator that Winston Churchill once said, ``Democracy \nis not perfect, but it is the best thing going.''\n  The issue here is the Founding Fathers were not infallible. We are \nnot infallible. There are reasonable decisions that have to be made \nfrom time to time. The Dred Scott decision in 1857 when a Supreme Court \nsaid a slave was property and therefore could not sue in Federal court. \nThat came in under the Constitution. Is that right? No. But it \nhappened. So we are an infallible people.\n  So my point is, what Senator Hatch was alluding to, if we look at \nwhat is happening we are talking about a situation where a national \nemergency might emerge. The Senator is correct. He made some very good \npoints about what might happen if that national emergency were to come \nabout.\n  The other point is, if we are looking at where the debt is going and \nhow much of the debt is being consumed, how much of the budget is being \nconsumed by interest on the debt, and looking at where it is today, 16 \npercent roughly of that budget is interest on the debt and 16 percent \nis national defense.\n  I would say to the Senator, with all due respect, if we did not stop \nit, if we do not stop this runaway train of debt and deficit spending, \nwe are not going to have any money for national defense. We are not \ngoing to have any money for any emergency under any situation because, \nand the Senator knows, that the commission, which was a bipartisan \ncommission, on entitlements headed by Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat, and \nSenator Jack Danforth, Republican, said by the year 2013 at the latest, \nthis country will be spending 100 percent of its budget on interest on \nthe debt and entitlements. There is not going to be any money for \ndefense.\n  I would just say to the Senator if this is fallible, this amendment, \nthen tell me what the alternative is when we get to 2013 and we do not \nhave any money-- none, zero--to defend our national security or our \nnational interests.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will tell the Senator. First of all, \nit boggles the imagination that we are hearing this argument from \nsomeone who voted against the 1993 deficit reduction package. All of \nthe situation that the Senator is talking about would be far worse had \nthe Senator prevailed on that vote.\n  There are tough decisions to be made. Everyone recognizes that. \nBecause they are tough to make it is very difficult to get a majority \nfor them. What the Senator is doing is escalating the standard from a \nmajority to a supermajority. So the Senator is making it even tougher \nto make the tough decisions, not easier. The Senator is putting more \npower into the hands of the minority to frustrate or to thwart the \neffort.\n  Where I disagree with the Senator is, in his assumption, that all of \nthese waivers will be granted in a time of crisis. If we go back \nthrough our history, it does not support the Senator. Historically, \nwhen we come up against these situations they are often very divisive \nand very controversial and action in the end is taken by a bare \nmajority. I went through at great length earlier the example of the \nextension of the service requirement under the draft in 1940.\n  Clearly, that was important to the national security of the country. \nI am quoting from that article:\n\n       In an effort to depoliticize the issue as much as possible, \n     Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry Stimson designated Army \n     Chief of Staff George Marshall as the administration's point \n     man on the Hill. Marshall worked tirelessly but found \n     converts difficult to come by despite his tremendous prestige \n     on Capitol Hill. ``You put the case very well,'' one \n     Republican Congressman told him, ``but I will be damned if I \n     am going to go along with Mr. Roosevelt.''\n       The vote was set for Monday August 11, but Rayburn put it \n     off for one day out of respect for a Republican Member who \n     had died over the weekend. With the President out of town \n     meeting secretly in Newfoundland with British Prime Minister \n     Winston Churchill, to nail the Atlantic Charter, Rayburn \n     spent the additional day roaming the corridors of Capitol \n     Hill trying to win over recalcitrant Democrats and wavering \n     Republicans. His lobbying style was like the man himself, \n     honest, direct, and intensely personal without a hint of \n     intimidation.\n\n  Here is Rayburn himself, walking the corridors. Here is General \nMarshall, one of the really great statesmen of American history, a man \nfor whom I have enormous respect and admiration, working--as they say \nhere ``Worked tirelessly but found converts difficult to come by \ndespite his tremendous prestige on Capitol Hill.'' When the vote came, \nit was 203-202. That vote would not qualify under the provisions of \nyour balanced budget amendment proposition here.\n  We would not have been able to respond to this national crisis. The \nSenator earlier said to me if they had known they needed a three-fifths \nrequirement they would have gotten more votes. I said to the Senator, \nit defies belief that a sizable chunk of the 202 who voted against it \nwould switch over because they knew there was a three-fifths \nrequirement. They voted against it when there was a simple majority \nrequirement and the thing would have gone down, and it would have been \na disaster for the Nation had it happened.\n  All I am saying is that these tough decisions need to be made by \nmajority vote just as is provided for in the Constitution. The Founding \nFathers could foresee these things and that is why they provided it. \nThis is, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia said, playing \nRussian roulette with the national security of the United States.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if I could have a last response, I promise \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Founding Fathers also provided for an amendment process to the \nConstitution because they knew that it would need that flexibility, \nbecause it could not predict the future nor foresee the future. The \nSenator knows that. That is why we are here.\n  I also would respond to the Senator on the point of the budget \nagreement of 1993. This debate is, essentially, a nonpartisan debate on \nthe issue of whether or not we need an amendment, constitutional \namendment, to balance the Federal budget. But the Senator introduced a \npartisan matter on the issue of the budget agreement.\n  Just because this Senator and the remaining Republican Senators in \nthe Senate at the time did not agree with the Senator from Maryland \nthat the way to bring the deficit down was to increase taxes $250 \nbillion, but rather bring spending down $250 billion to move the budget \ndeficit down, that does not make me opposed to bringing the deficit or \nthe debt down.\n  The truth of the matter is, those on this side who voted against that \nwanted to cut spending, not raise taxes.\n  The second point is, which we have already gone into on the floor \nmany times before, not only during this debate, but the truth of the \nmatter is the correction that needed to be taken to reduce the debt was \nnot taken with that budget agreement, for the same reason it was not \ntaken with any of these other agreements that are on this chart from \n1921 all the way up to Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and the budget agreement \nof 1993. The truth of the matter is, Congress walks away from them.\n  The President of the United States, President Clinton, just submitted \na budget, the follow-on to this budget, which increases the national \ndebt by $1.6 trillion over the next 5 years. Since this agreement has \nbeen passed, we have increased the national debt another one-half \ntrillion dollars. So where is the progress?\n  This Senator fails to understand where the progress is being made. I \nhear about all these great agreements, we have had all these budget \nagreements, we are bringing the debt down, bringing the deficit down. \nWe are not bringing it down. It is going up, up, up, up, and the reason \nwhy is because we need this amendment because Congress will not do it \nwithout it. That is absolutely evident.\n  The Senator talks about a national emergency. I do not know whether \nhe has a commission out there somewhere that defines a national \nemergency or whether he has to read it in the newspaper that it is a \nnational emergency. If the Congress of the United States \n[[Page S2794]] does not think it is a national emergency or the \nPresident does not think it is, I do not know how you define a national \nemergency.\n  So I assume, by definition, if the Congress does not vote to say it \nis a national emergency and provide the funding to go to war, maybe \nthey do not think we should go to war. That is the prerogative of the \nU.S. Congress. That is the prerogative. That is exactly what the \nFounding Fathers meant that ``Congress shall have the power to declare \nwar.''\n  This argument that somehow we are going to defend the right of the \nUnited States to protect itself by voting against the balanced budget \namendment is the most nonsensical thing I heard since I have been here.\n  By the time this debate is over, we are going to add tens of \nbillions, hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt; $9,600 \nper second as we debate the debt goes up. Interest on the debt is now \ngoing to pass defense. What we spend on defense and interest is going \nthis way, just like that, and defense is going this way. And by the \nyear 2013, by most admissions of a bipartisan commission, we will be \nspending 100 percent on interest and 100 percent on entitlements.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH. That is what is going to threaten the national security of \nthe United States of America, not a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me to ask a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield for a short period of time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask that I may continue to yield with the \nunderstanding that I not lose the floor for the purpose of a colloquy \nto include now the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you very much. I was not planning to participate, \nbut something the Senator said makes me want to, and that is during the \ndiscussion with the Senator from Maryland on the vote on the deficit \nreduction package, which the Senator from New Hampshire says is, in \nfact, not working, every expert in the country says that the deficit \nwould have been $500 billion higher. But let us not even get into that \nbecause what I want to ask the Senator are two basic questions.\n  First of all, the Senator said at that time he did not like the \npackage that the President sent over, the deficit reduction package, \nbecause it contained some tax increases of which he did not approve. We \nalso know it contained a large tax cut for the working poor and far \nmany more people are affected in a positive way from that tax cut. But \nlet us put that aside.\n  The Senator said he would have preferred instead of raising taxes--\nand he puts it at $250 billion--he would have cut spending $250 \nbillion.\n  So my question is, did the Senator offer an amendment to cut $250 \nbillion and show us how he was going to cut $250 billion from the \ndeficit? I do not recall it.\n  Mr. SMITH. If the Senator will allow me to respond, you know the \nsituation as well as I do with regard to the debate and the politics, \nwhat was going on. The truth of the matter is, there were many \ndiscussions on our side, many attempts to redirect that in committee. \nThe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, who is in the chair, was \ninvolved in a number of efforts in the Budget Committee to reprioritize \nthat whole budget, and the Senator from California knows that.\n  The truth of the matter is, the position of the President and the \nmajority in the Senate at the time, and in the House, was that the best \nway to deal with the deficit was to raise taxes on the American people. \nMy point is, the best way to deal with the deficit would be to reduce \nspending and to continue that spending on a downward trend.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So the answer to my----\n  Mr. SMITH. My final point. My only point is we did not do what we \nneeded to do to correct it. Even with the tax increase you did not \ncorrect it. If you want to take the position, which I happen to \ndisagree with, that we can continue to raise taxes forever until we \nbalance the budget, you have a right to that position. But there is \nonly so much you can get.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My question to the Senator was, he said at the time he \nwould have preferred to cut spending $250 billion instead of raising \nthe taxes. The President's plan did raise taxes on the wealthy, and it \nalso cut taxes much more broadly on the working poor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It also cut spending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And it cut spending the other $250 billion. But the point \nI want to make, in conclusion, and then I will yield back the time to \nthe good Senator and thank him once again for his leadership on this: \nThe Senator himself said he was working on some plans. I am sure he is. \nI have never seen that plan.\n  I wrote to every single Republican who is in the leadership, heads \ncommittees when this debate started. I said, ``Show me your plan. You \nwant this balanced budget to go into effect. I want to know if it is \ngoing to hurt the people of California, the people I represent. I want \nto know what is going to happen if there is a disaster or a war.''\n  You have a three-fifths super- majority built into this, \nas the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Maryland have \nstated. They do not agree with it. I do not agree with it. I think it \nshows a mistrust for the people, that is what I think about \nsupermajorities. They show a mistrust for the people. They give too \nmuch power to the minority, and I do not think that is what America is \nall about.\n  But putting all that aside for this conversation, I have to stand up \nand say to my friend from West Virginia that when Senators on that side \ncriticize those of us on this side for voting for deficit reduction, \nwhich was the largest package in history and it is working, for them \nnot to show what their plan is and to hide behind this figleaf of a \nbalanced budget amendment, trying to tell the American people, because \nof that, they are going to be the ones to balance the budget, I find it \nvery problematical. And I rose today to add my voice.\n  They did not vote for the right to know. They did not vote to exclude \nSocial Security. I think this is a dangerous, dangerous balanced budget \namendment.\n  By the way, I wanted to vote for a balanced budget amendment. I \nwanted to vote for one over on the House side, I say to my friend from \nWest Virginia. He would not have agreed with me. I did, in fact, do \nthat because it was flexible, it took Social Security off the table, it \ndid not have a supermajority, and we tried to fix this amendment.\n  As the Senator from Maryland has stated so eloquently, the more you \nlook at this amendment--and that is why I appreciate the time we have \nhere in the Senate to do that--the worse it gets for the American \npeople and the people that I came here to fight for, the people of \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. SMITH. May I ask the Senator one question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator continue to yield?\n  Mr. SMITH. One final question. Under your definition of \n``exemption,'' if Social Security and other entitlements get to 100 \npercent of the budget, do you still support the exemption?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to----\n  Mr. SMITH. Answer yes or no.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will answer it. I agree with the Republicans who have \nsaid over and over again by vote, ``You're not going to touch Social \nSecurity.''\n  Mr. SMITH. But when you exempt it----\n  Mrs. BOXER. The answer is I am not for touching Social Security \neither, and because I believe that, I think it is a compact with the \npeople who paid into it.\n  Mr. SMITH. You are going to destroy it without the----\n  Mrs. BOXER. No.\n  Mr. SMITH. You certainly are.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, the Social Security System \nis paying its way.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Social Security System is not only paying its way, \nit is, in fact, running a surplus.\n  Mr. SMITH. And the Treasury is borrowing all the money to fund the \ndebt, and the Senator knows it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That has nothing to do with the Social Security System. \nIt is terribly important for the American \n[[Page S2795]] people to understand this because a game may well be \nplayed with the Social Security trust fund, as was just indicated, in \neffect, by my colleague from New Hampshire, if they do not understand.\n  The Social Security trust fund is more than paying for itself. People \nreceiving Social Security owe no apology on the deficit question, \nbecause the trust fund currently is not only paying its way, it is \nrunning surpluses, which in an accounting sense are used to offset the \nsize of the deficit.\n  Now, the other side would obviously want to use those, and many of us \nfeel that should not be done. In the 1980's, when the Social Security \ntrust fund ran into some difficulties, we took the measures of reducing \nbenefits and raising Social Security taxes in order to put the Social \nSecurity trust fund back into a healthy position.\n  That is exactly what we did. This is an effort to raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund. It is implicit in this balanced budget amendment, \nand to some extent was made explicit the other day with the tabling of \nthe Reid amendment, which sought to make it very clear that it could \nnot be tapped or drawn on. It needs to be understood the Social \nSecurity system is paying its way. We have other so-called entitlements \nthat are not, but the Social Security trust fund is more than paying \nits way. That needs to be understood, and this assault on the Social \nSecurity system needs to be repudiated.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend--and I thank him for continuing to \nyield--the reason I answered the question the way I did to my friend, \nthe good Senator from New Hampshire, is because the Republicans are \ntrying to have it both ways.\n  It is really extraordinary, and I am glad we have this chance, \nbecause on the one hand they have passed motion after motion stating \nthat they will never touch Social Security or the benefits and it is \noff the table and they are not going to look at it. On the other hand, \nthey vote against the Reid amendment, the Reid-Feinstein amendment, \nwhich would have clearly taken Social Security out of this balanced \nbudget requirement.\n  So they are talking two ways. And what was so interesting right here \nthis afternoon just a few minutes ago is the good Senator from New \nHampshire says to me, Senator, are you saying that even if Social \nSecurity and the other entitlements are 100 percent of the problem, \nthat you are not going to touch them?\n  Well, that is what they have been saying. They have been saying they \nare not going to touch them. But if you listen very carefully, it is a \nvery clear threat to Social Security, as clear as the nose on your \nface.\n  I say that this amendment is very dangerous. It is very dangerous to \nthe stability of this Nation because it is so inflexible, and my \nRepublican friends have voted almost unanimously--we came close on the \nJohnston amendment on the Court issue, but basically they have walked \ndown the aisle with this rigid supermajority requirement amendment that \nputs Social Security in jeopardy, it puts our States in jeopardy, and \nit puts our people in jeopardy.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his generosity in \nyielding to me.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. \nBoxer].\n  Mr. President, when all is said and done, our friends on the other \nside of the aisle have not answered the question put to them by Senator \nSarbanes. He brought up the language in Section 5 of the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget:\n\n       The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for \n     any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. \n     The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and is so declared by a joint \n     resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House, which becomes law.\n\n  Of course, then the proponents of the amendment, not wishing to focus \non section 5 and the questions asked by the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland related thereto, wish to talk about the seriousness of the \nbudget deficits and the seriousness of the debt, and so on.\n  We are all concerned about those deficits and the debt. There is no \ndisagreement as to the desired goal to reach a balanced budget and to \nreduce the deficits and ultimately to begin paying the principal on the \ndebt and hopefully reducing the interest that is paid on that debt.\n  The proponents do not want to focus on this section 5. I will ask the \nquestion: If the country ``is engaged in a military conflict,'' short \nof a war that has been declared, ``engaged in a military conflict that \ncauses an imminent and serious military threat to national security and \nis so declared by a joint resolution, adopted by a majority number of \nthe whole number of each House, which becomes law,'' does that language \nmean that once the joint resolution referred to in that section is \nadopted by a majority of the whole number of each House and becomes \nlaw, and in the event that the military conflict which causes an \nimminent and serious military threat to national security continues \nover a period of another year or 2 years or subsequent years, does this \nlanguage mean that Congress will have to waive the provisions of this \narticle by way of a joint resolution in each and every subsequent \nfiscal year in which that threat to the national security exists? Does \nthat mean we have to do it over and over again?\n  I am waiting on the Republican response team to respond. Does that \nmean that we have to go through this obstacle course every year, every \nsubsequent year after that first year, or that first occasion in which \nthe joint resolution is adopted by a majority of the whole number of \neach House? Do we have to do that over and over again?\n  Suppose the support for the Commander in Chief's position, suppose \nthe national support wavers?\n  Initially, people having been supportive, through their \nrepresentatives, of adopting the joint resolution are--suppose that \nthreat to the national security continues into a subsequent fiscal \nyear, and then again into another fiscal year? Does this language make \nit incumbent upon the Congress to continue, with each new fiscal year, \nto pass a joint resolution by a majority of the whole number of each \nHouse? What does this mean?\n  The Commander in Chief and the military forces which he may have \ncommitted as he did in Desert Storm, or as President Truman did in \nKorea--suppose that initial support of the people lessens? What does \nthe Commander in Chief do? He is left out there hanging. He has men on \ndistant battlefields. He has ships plying the waves of the several \nseas. He has planes transporting Marines and soldiers. He has an Air \nForce out there that is flying in various areas of the world. What does \nit mean? Do we have to pass another joint resolution in the next fiscal \nyear?\n  Suppose this emergent situation should arise in August, with the \nclose of the fiscal year imminent on September 30. There is not time to \npass a joint resolution and look for cuts in other areas of the budget, \nto which my friends on the other side of the aisle have alluded. What \nhappens? The fiscal year is closed on September 30 and the total \noutlays have exceeded the total receipts for that fiscal year. You have \nmen out there in the field facing danger. Their lives are on the line, \ntheir lives are in jeopardy, and the security of this country is in \njeopardy. What are we going to do? Are we going to be entertained by a \nwide-ranging debate in both Houses on a joint resolution every fiscal \nyear that that situation continues? And, in addition, we have to have a \nmajority of the whole number elected to each House for passage.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Senator, I am not as familiar as you are with the \nprocess, but it seems to me that now there has to be approval, there \nhas to be approval annually for the budget, there has to be approval \nfor the President's move in terms of military activities.\n  Mr. BYRD. There was not any approval in the case of his invasion of \nHaiti. The invasion actually started.\n  Mr. THOMAS. There was in Desert Storm, as you will recall.\n  Mr. BYRD. Wait just a second. The invasion of Haiti started. The \nPresident called it off--in midair, almost. I was not supportive of \nthat invasion.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Nor was I.\n  [[Page S2796]] I guess further I would say, I am not sure I am \nconfounded by the Congress each year approving this. I do not think \nthat is an unusual kind of thing. Do you not think the Congress \nrepresents the people----\n  Mr. BYRD. When the Senator is around here long enough he may find \nhimself confounded. If we get into a situation where the Nation's \nsecurity is in the balance, we may all feel confounded by the necessity \nof acting expeditiously, because we have the lives of men and women in \ndire peril. And then, under this amendment, we are going to require a \nmajority of the Senators who are chosen and sworn to pass a resolution \nin a situation like that--we are going to explain that away by talking \nabout the budget deficits?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have a little more confidence in the Members of this \nbody than to ignore an issue of that kind. It just seems to me that the \nevidence is that we need to do something different than we have been \ndoing. I constantly hear we cannot change things. But the record is, we \nhave to if we want different results.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, I am talking about section 5.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let us stay with it. Let us not talk about, at the moment--\nI will be glad to yield later to the Senator, if he wants to broaden \nthe discussion.\n  We are talking about section 5. As Napoleon said, there were men on \nhis council who were far more eloquent than he, but that he won every \nargument simply by saying 2 plus 2 equals 4. It is pretty simple.\n  So I want to say to my friend, as Napoleon might have, he would say \nlet us stick with the question. Let us stick with section 5. That is \nthe question that has been raised this afternoon, in the main, on this \nfloor.\n  So, is the Senator telling me that we should run the risk of adopting \na joint resolution each fiscal year in which our national security is \nin jeopardy? We should run the risk of adopting a joint resolution and \nthat he is willing to subject this country's security to the necessity \nof a supermajority vote--a mini-supermajority vote, a majority of those \nSenators chosen and sworn?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have, I guess--and I do not suggest I know the \nanswers--but I have a good deal of confidence. What does it say? It \nsays, ``* * * this article may be waived for any fiscal year in which \nthe United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an \nimminent and serious militarily threat * * *'' I have a hunch that most \nof us, a supermajority of us, would respond to that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is that the Senator's answer?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, that is the kind of answer that the \nproponents of this ill-advised constitutional amendment continue to \nmake. ``Well, I have confidence that the Congress would do thus and \nso.'' Or ``The intent of the proponents of this constitutional \namendment is thus and so--the intent.'' Or ``That would never happen.'' \nOr ``I am sure that the Senate and House will rise to meet the needs of \nproviding--by providing supermajorities.''\n  Senators do not know that. Senators do not know what the intent of a \nfuture Congress may be. Senators do not know with enough certitude to \ngive me confidence that Congress will act in a given situation that may \nbe years away, as it might act at this moment or in this year of Our \nLord 1995.\n  Mr. President, this is the typical response: ``I have confidence.'' \nThat is it. ``I have confidence. I am willing to trust our \ncolleagues.'' Well, I am willing to trust colleagues also. I am willing \nalso to trust the good judgment of a majority of the representatives of \nthe people, if the people are adequately informed. I am willing to \ntrust the opinions of the American people if they are properly \ninformed. But we cannot cavalierly push away this sobering question nor \nthe serious questions that arise with respect to this Constitutional \namendment simply by saying, ``Well, I am sure it won't happen,'' or ``I \nam willing to trust'' so and so and ``a future Congress'' and ``this is \nnot the intent.''\n  Read what the amendment says. That is what the court is going to go \nby. It is going to first look at the four corners of the document.\n  Section 1:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year.\n\n  Then in section 5:\n\n       The provisions of this article--\n\n  Meaning section 1.\n\n     may be waived for any fiscal year in which the United States \n     is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and \n     serious military threat to national security.\n\n  Who is going to determine what is an ``imminent and serious military \nthreat'' to the national security? Obviously, there are going to be \ndifferences of opinion.\n  Mr. THOMAS. That is what I am suggesting; that is, that is the role \nof Congress, and I think it is a legitimate role and one that is not \nunusual, one that I have perceived has been done for a number of years.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. But for a number of years it has not been \nrequired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. It should be required.\n  Mr. BYRD. For 206 years it has not been required that there be a \nmajority of the whole number in each House to pass a resolution.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Where does the President get the money, if the majority \nof the Congress does not agree?\n  Mr. BYRD. Where does he get the money?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me ask the Senator. Suppose the President needs a new \ntax. Suppose he needs to raise taxes to meet that serious military \nconflict, that serious military threat to the United States. Suppose he \nneeds to increase taxes. Then what? Would the Senator be willing to \nraise taxes?\n  Mr. THOMAS. The President does not raise taxes.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is not the question which I asked the Senator.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I think there is a system in which the President can \nmove. But the President then comes to the Congress for either a \ndeclaration or for the money, or he, as he is doing now, comes for a \nsupplemental budget. The Congress has to be involved to make this \ndecision.\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course. This Senator has never said the Congress should \nnot be involved. This Senator is saying simply that the Congress ought \nto continue to be involved under the present Constitution which has \nprovided very well for congressional actions to meet all emergencies \nthat have occurred throughout the 206-year history of this country.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand that.\n  Mr. BYRD. But now we are going to be in a very different situation if \nthis Constitution is going to be amended. And it will not be amended \nfor just a year or so; it will be changed from now until kingdom come, \nunless the American people and Congress repeal this amendment once it \nis in the Constitution. The Senator knows that. It is not easy once it \nis in there. It is not like a statute which can be repealed by the same \nCongress that enacted it in the first place.\n  I am asking the Senator. Suppose we get into a situation where this \nNation's security is in peril and more money is needed and the \nnecessity arises for an increase in taxes. Then what are my friends on \nthe other side going to do in that situation?\n  Mr. THOMAS. That is why this provision is there to waive.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. By what vote?\n  Mr. THOMAS. By a supermajority vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. That is just the question. Why subject this country's \nsecurity to the necessity of a supermajority vote when the Nation's \nvery life is in danger, the security of the American people are in \ndanger, the security of the troops in the field are in danger, and the \nsecurity of the planes in the air is in danger? Why subject a decision \nat that critical moment to a supermajority? The Framers, in their \nwisdom, did not do it. And we have fought a good many wars.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand. This is the basis of what we are talking \nabout. Of course, the Senator says leave it as it is. Others say we \nneed to change it. That is what it is, whether we change or whether we \ndo not. Many people think that there needs to be a change. Many people \nthink the performance is such that there needs to be a change. And I \nrespect greatly the Senator's wisdom and knowledge. But that is the \nissue. And the Senator does not want it \n[[Page S2797]] changed. I understand that. Others do. That is what it \nis all about.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is about more than that. That is why we need to take the \ntime to probe and to explore these provisions that are in this \namendment to balance the budget. We are all in agreement, I say to the \nSenator, with the goal of a balanced budget. We are all in agreement. I \nam in agreement that we need to reduce the deficits. And I agree that \nit is going to require some pain. I also am of the opinion that we do \nnot need to wait 7 years. We started in 1990. We took a great step \nbeyond that in 1993. We need to do more.\n  Why cannot we continue on that course of enacting multiyear budget \ndeficit reduction bills? Do you know why? Because of the pain, and part \nof that pain may just have to be an increase in taxes. I do not like to \nvote to increase taxes. I have been in political office 48 years, and I \nknow it is not easy to vote to increase taxes. It is always easy to cut \ntaxes. It was easy to cut taxes in 1981 when Mr. Reagan asked for a tax \ncut in one package involving 3 successive years of cuts, 5 percent the \nfirst year, 10 the next, and 10 the next. It does not take courage to \nvote to cut taxes.\n  But in a situation--I keep getting back to this section 5. What is \nthe Senator's answer? Is he willing to put this Nation's security in \nperil by requiring a supermajority consisting of a majority of the \nSenators and House Members elected? The Framers did not think that was \nwise. We had just come through the Revolutionary War. We had still \nahead of us the War of 1812. We had ahead of us the Mexican War of \n1848, the Civil War, the war with Spain in 1898, the First World War, \nthe Second World War, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. In addition \nto these, there were several military conflicts that were not wars,\n of that magnitude, by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n  There was never, until this amendment comes along, any thought of \nrequiring a mini-supermajority to pass a resolution in a moment of dire \nperil to deal with our Nations's security. We get nothing from the \nproponents when we direct the question at them, ``Would you be willing \nto raise the revenues to meet the needs in that moment of peril?'' \n``Would you be willing to raise taxes?''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, shortly. What we get is what the Senator from Maryland \ngot a while ago when he tried to pin Senators down on the other side of \nthe aisle with his questions concerning section 5. Section 5 has not \nbeen talked about much in the Senate. It needs to be talked about. What \nwe get are speciocities, irrelevancies, platitudes, well-wishes, and \nexpressions of good intent. We do not know what the ``intent'' of the \nSenators who sit at these desks will be 2 years form now, 3 years from \nnow. Perhaps they will be the same Senators. How can we say what their \nintent will be? We need to read the words of the amendment. They speak \nfor themselves when they say ``total outlays shall not exceed total \nreceipts in any fiscal year.'' That does not leave any wiggling room. \nThe proponents say, yes, it does, because you can waive that by a \nthree-fifths majority.\n  It is a dangerous amendment. Section 5--I would not want to risk the \nlives of my grandsons on that kind of language, requiring 51 Senators \nin this Chamber to pass such a resolution, denying the Vice President \nof the United States his vote to break a tie, if there should be a tie. \nThis amendment would deny the Vice President of his vote that is \naccorded him in the current Constitution----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. To vote to break a tie. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand that the Senator from Utah said that the Vice \nPresident would be denied, in his opinion, a vote to break a 50-50 tie. \nBut he also said it was an ``open question.'' I do not think we ought \nto have an open question in a constitutional amendment, because this is \na life and death matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. You have a constitutional crisis when you have this open \nquestion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It will, in fact, plunge this constitutional amendment \ninto the courts to interpret as to whether or not he Vice President can \nbreak a tie. It should not be left open. It should be resolved in this \namendment as to whether or not the Vice President's vote counts to \nbreak a 50-50 tie. I think it is irresponsible to write a \nconstitutional amendment knowing that that question is left open.\n  By the way, that is not some theoretical question. Last year's \ndeficit reduction bill, as it has been debated here this afternoon, was \na 51-50 vote, based on the Vice President's vote. So this is not some \ntheory that we are arguing here in a civics class. This is the reality \nof the U.S. Senate, and life and death matters can be resolved on \nwhether or not the Vice President's vote counts to break a tie.\n  It was the opinion of the Senator from Utah, as I understand it, \nstated earlier this afternoon, that the Vice President's vote would not \ncount in this provision. And yet, the chief sponsor of this language \nthat is in front of us, Representative Dan Schaefer of Colorado, says \nthe Vice President's vote would count. Yesterday, we had the same \nproblem. We had, on this side, the chief sponsor saying that there \nwould be no standing, do not worry about it. We had the chief sponsor \non the other side--this is the Schaefer-Stenholm substitute. \nRepresentative Schaefer has said that there would be standing for \nMembers of Congress to sue. I had a big board up, and my friend from \nPennsylvania who is managing the bill now saw where we had the prime \nsponsor of this language quoted in a very formal document, by the way. \nThese were not casual comments. These were questions and answers he \nsubmitted for the Record, in the House Congressional Record, where he \nmade statements which were exactly contrary to what the opinion of the \nSenator from Utah is--exactly contrary on critical issues on the role \nof the court.\n  Representative Schaefer said, in a formal answer, that a court could \nthrow out an appropriations bill or a tax bill, as being \nunconstitutional. But we were told by the Senator from Utah that it was \nhis opinion that a court could not involve itself in the budgetary \nprocess.\n  My question of my friend from West Virginia is this--and I want to \nread now into the Record the statement of Representative Schaefer on \nthe question of whether or not the Vice President's vote counts. It is \non page 758 of the Congressional Record of January 26. This is a formal \ninterpretation of section 4. And, again, this is a formal question and \nanswer presentation that was supplied for the Record by Representative \nSchaefer:\n\n       This language is not intended to preclude the Vice \n     President in his or her constitutional capacity as President \n     of the Senate from casting a tie-breaking vote that would \n     produce a 51-50 result.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Nothing in section 4 of the substitute takes away the Vice \n     President's right to vote under such circumstances.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not have the floor, but----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the courts are going to decide that. It does \nnot make any difference what my intent is or what the intent of the \nHouse Member was who was addressing himself to that question, or what \nhe intent of any other Senator is. It is the court, and it will be a \nconstitutional crisis. Once we constitutionalize this fiscal policy by \nwriting this amendment into the Constitution, it is an open invitation \nto the courts to come into this equation. There is nothing in this \namendment that prohibits or forbids the courts from intervening.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator from West Virginia is absolutely \ncorrect. But what is going to draw the court in even more is the fact \nthat two principal sponsors of this measure give absolutely contrary \nviews as to the meaning of this clause, as the Senator from Michigan \nhas pointed out. One of the chief House sponsors says that under \nsection 4 the Vice President would have the tie-breaking vote. The \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand the lead manager for this bill, very explicitly stated on the floor \nof the Senate not too long ago that you would have to produce 51 votes \nout of 100 in \n[[Page S2798]] this body in order for section 4 to apply. A 50-50 vote \nwith the Vice President supposedly casting a tie-breaking vote would \nnot work. In effect, you have negated the tie-breaking vote of the Vice \nPresident.\n  This is important in underscoring all of the pitfalls that are \ncontained in this provision. I am certain it will bring about what the \nSenator from West Virginia has just stated, and that is the involvement \nof the courts, because the legislative history on this is absolutely \ncontradictory on the part of its proponents.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. My point here is that \nthis is being left----\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may continue to yield the \nfloor, retaining my rights to the floor, for colloquies. I do not \nintend to hold the floor all afternoon. My feet are getting tired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I call attention to the fact that we have a fresh new \nMember here from the Republican response team. They are sending them in \nin relays.\n  Yes, I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator has eloquently pointed out the reasons why we \nshould not require majorities, and on that there is a difference of \nopinion. I happen to share the opinion of the Senator from West \nVirginia for the reasons that he has given that we should not require a \nsupermajority.\n  But the issue that I raise, the Senator from Maryland has raised, and \nthe Senator from Utah has raised relates to that question. It is, what \nis a supermajority and whether the Vice President's vote counts? And on \nthat one, I think 100 of us ought to agree.\n  Maybe there is a disagreement as to whether or not we should have a \nsupermajority--and there is a disagreement--but there should be no \ndisagreement, there ought to be absolute unanimity on a determination \nthat this constitutional amendment be clear on the question as to \nwhether or not the Vice President can break a tie and count towards the \n51 votes. We should not leave that ambiguous.\n  This is not a matter where there is a difference of opinion as to \nwhether or not a supermajority is appropriate in order to raise \nrevenues or not. This is a question of writing a constitutional \namendment, knowing that a question, a critical question, is left open. \nIt should not be left open.\n  Because if it is, this constitutional crisis, which the Senator from \nWest Virginia and the Senator from Maryland talked about, is something \nthat we are inviting. And we should not only not invite it, we should \nclose the door on any such constitutional crisis by making that clear.\n  That will not resolve the question that the Senator from West \nVirginia has raised as to whether or not it is desirable that there be \na requirement for a supermajority, and I happen to, again, share his \nview on that. But, again, we should clarify the question.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point, Mr. President, that the \nstatement of the prime sponsor of the joint resolution in front of us, \nRepresentative Schaefer, that appears on page H758 of the Congressional \nRecord of January 26 of this year, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This language is not intended to preclude the Vice \n     President, in his or her constitutional capacity as President \n     of the Senate, from casting a tie-breaking vote that would \n     produce a 51-50 result. This is consistent with Article I, \n     Section 3, Clause 4, which states: ``The Vice President of \n     the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall \n     have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.'' Nothing in \n     Section 4 of the substitute takes away the Vice President's \n     right to vote under such circumstances.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not have the floor, but I think it \nwould be very desirable for the Senator from Pennsylvania to respond, \nshould the Senator from West Virginia so yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, of course, I would not want to shut out from \nthis electrifying moment in this very illuminating debate a Member of \nthe ``Republican response team.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that my previous request include the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and any other Member of the response team.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair.\n  I was going to refer you to the 12th amendment that uses the same \nlanguage that is used in section 5 and section 2, which refers to the \nwhole number of the Senate. In one case, it says the whole number or \ntwo-thirds of the whole number of the Senators, the same language that \nwe use here only we say in each House.\n  If you have questions about the ability of the Vice President to cast \nvotes with respect to this, then I suspect you have questions as to \nwhether the Vice President can cast votes under the 12th amendment, \nbecause it is word for word what is put in this document.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I do not have a question about \nit.\n  The Senator from Utah, who is the principal sponsor on that side, \nsaid that the Vice President's vote would not count. Now that is coming \nfrom a pretty authoritative source here.\n  Senator Hatch said--and I was not on the floor, but I understand that \nhe said--two things about this question. Number one, it is an open \nquestion. That means what it says. It is an open question, presumably \nleft for the courts or left for somebody to decide. But then Senator \nHatch said--it was reported to me, and I was not on the floor; I \nbelieve the Senators from West Virginia and Maryland were here--Senator \nHatch apparently then said that, in his opinion, in his opinion, the \nVice President's vote would not count toward the 51 votes. And I think \nthat is what the Senator from West Virginia reflected in his statement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So it is not the Senator from Michigan who is raising the \nquestion--I think we ought to button down the issue--it is the \nprincipal sponsor of the amendment here in the Senate who has rendered \nthat opinion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield to me? Because the analogy--\n  Mr. BYRD. Before I yield, may I point out to the Member of the \nresponse team who just, I believe, indicated that the supermajority in \namendment No. 12 would be a parallel to the situation which we have \nbeen discussing--namely, as the Vice President's vote would be \ninvolved--I point out to the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, who \nperhaps has not read the 12th amendment lately, that that is what that \namendment is all about. There is no Vice President.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Right.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is no Vice President to cast a vote under the 12th \nAmendment. The reason for that amendment is to provide for the election \nof a Vice President by the U.S. Senate when the Vice President's seat \nis vacant.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, that was exactly the point I \nwas going to make.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania got up and said, ``Well, if you want to \nknow what this language means here of the majority of the whole number, \njust refer to amendment 12.''\n  Now, amendment 12 has to deal with picking the Vice President. There \nis not a Vice President. And it says----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Does that not make it obvious.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It says:\n\n       The Senate shall choose the Vice President; a quorum for \n     the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number \n     of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be \n     necessary to a choice.\n\n  But the choice is picking the Vice President. It does not answer the \nquestion that the Vice President can cast the tie-breaking vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, I think it makes that very \npoint. Obviously, the Vice President is not considered part of it \nbecause there is no Vice President. So the whole number must mean that \nit is the Members of the Senate, absent the Vice President. Otherwise, \nthis would make no sense. I mean, I think that is the reason I used it, \nbecause it is apparent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Once a Vice President has been chosen----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Vice President is a Member of the Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Once the Vice President has been chosen----\n  Mr. BYRD. He is not a Member of the Senate. The Vice President is \nnever a Member of the Senate.\n   [[Page S2799]] Mr. SANTORUM. I rest my case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We take a vote----\n  Mr. BYRD. That is not the case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Once the Vice President is chosen and we take a vote, a \n50-50 vote, can the Vice President break the tie?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under this amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If we compare it to the language in the amendment it \nparallels, my opinion would be no.\n  Mr. LEVIN. He cannot?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So you disagree with Congressman Schaefer?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then in that case, we have the prime sponsors in the \nSenate and we have the prime sponsor in the House, whose name is on top \nof this constitutional amendment--this is the Schaefer amendment--we \nhave the sponsors here and the sponsor there in total disagreement on \nan absolutely fundamental question as to whether or not the Vice \nPresident's vote can be counted to break a 50-50 tie. And that \ndetermines the outcome of the whole deficit reduction package last \nyear.\n  That should not be an open question. Whatever side of this issue you \nare on, whether or not you believe in supermajorities or you do not, we \nshould not leave an ambiguity that huge in the Constitution as to \nwhether or not the Vice President's vote counts. And I think it ought \nto be clarified. It ought to be clarified one way or the other, but it \nought to be clarified because, otherwise, it is an invitation for a \nconstitutional crisis.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been unable to get a question \nanswered here, and perhaps the Senator from Pennsylvania can answer it.\n  My question being: If the threat to our national security should \ncontinue into the next fiscal year, or the next calendar year after the \nyear in which the joint resolution referred to in this section is \nadopted by a minimajority of a majority of all the Members of the \nSenate and all the Members of the House chosen and sworn, if that \nthreat continues, and we are in a second fiscal year does such a joint \nresolution have to be passed again by both Houses?\n  If not, do both Houses have to waive the requirements of section 1, \nwhich requires a three-fifths majority? Does Congress have to continue \nto waive for each fiscal year during which we have the military threat? \nDoes that mean that every new fiscal year in which the threat \ncontinues, we have to have three-fifths to waive the requirements of \nsection 1? Or does it require that every fiscal year we pass another \njoint resolution requiring a majority of the total membership of both \nHouses as referred to in section 5? Or does it require that both \nsections be waived?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may propound a question \nto the Senator, even though I hold the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, section 5 reads: ``The Congress may \nwaive the provisions of this article for any fiscal year in which a \ndeclaration of war is in effect.'' So it would seem very obvious to me \nthe Congress has the availability to raise it for the fiscal year or \nany subsequent fiscal year in which the war is in effect.\n  That is pretty much what it says.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am glad we are going by what the amendment says for once.\n  Now, what do you think it says? What does the Senator think it says?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think that is what it says.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator, what does it mean? What is your \nunderstanding of the meaning? Would you have to have a waiver for each \nfiscal year?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am stupefied that the plain reading of this language \nis not apparent to the Senator from Maryland. I think it is very \nserious.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have to say to the Senator from Pennsylvania perhaps \nI am not as quick as he is to pick up the plain language. I thought the \nquestion was a good question. The question, as I understood it is, must \nyou have a waiver in each fiscal year since?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It says, ``The Congress may waive in any year.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. For any fiscal year in which the United States is \nengaged.\n  So, we may waive it for that fiscal year.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Or next fiscal year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The next fiscal year comes along. Then what?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It says we may waive for any fiscal year. It does not \nsay we have to waive for this fiscal year. We could pass--it says ``any \nfiscal year.'' It could be for next fiscal year, the one afterward, as \nlong as the declaration of war is in effect, we can raise for any \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So you think it means any and all?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As long as the declaration of war is continuing, I \nassume that is what the Congress can do.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What about the next sentence?\n  Mr. BYRD. There are two different situations there.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What about the next sentence? Same interpretation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Obviously, in one case we have declaration of war. That \nis, a declaration of war has a certain time limit, then the declaration \nof war ceases.\n  In this case----\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator say that again?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The declaration of war at some point ends.\n  Mr. BYRD. What causes it to end? What terminates a war?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. A signing of a treaty to end the war.\n  Mr. BYRD. What terminates the declaration of war?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator, since I was not around the last time \nwe declared war, I assume it would be some act of Congress to end the \ndeclaration.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But it was the Senator that asserted that the \ndeclaration of war would end. How does that happen?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just responded.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator was responding to a question. His response, I \ndo not understand.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As long as a declaration is in effect, however long \nthat may be, that Congress can, under this provision, waive this \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. How long was the declaration of war in World War II in \neffect?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am asking a question. I want to be informed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not know the answer.\n  Mr. BYRD. The ready response team should have all the answers.\n  How long was the declaration of war in World War I in effect? The war \nis over. Suppose declaration of war is still in effect. What happens in \na situation like this?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think it would be apparent that at some point the \nCongress would rescind the declaration of war and then this article \nwould no longer be operative.\n  Mr. BYRD. Congress did not rescind all previous declarations of war. \nWhy does the Senator not help me find the answer to that question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will do my best.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator address the second question? Let us \nmove beyond the declaration of war. What is your understanding of the \nsecond sentence? This is not a declaration of war in which the United \nStates is engaged in military conflict, so declared by a joint \nresolution. Would we have to get a joint resolution the following year?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My opinion on that is that the--according to the plain \nreading of the constitutional amendment--Congress would have to, each \nyear, go through the process of exempting itself from this provision \nbecause of that conflict.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How can the phrase ``for any fiscal year,'' which is \nidentically the same phrase in sentence 1 and sentence 2, be given \ndiametrically opposite definitions?\n  You just told me that the phrase ``for any fiscal year'' in sentence \n1, linked to a declaration of war, means that it can be waived for not \nonly the current fiscal year but fiscal years beyond that.\n  Now the Senator tells me in sentence 2, ``waive for any fiscal year'' \nmeans only the fiscal year in which you find yourself and not \nsubsequent fiscal years.\n  Now, how can the Senator give that phrase an entirely different \ninterpretation?\n   [[Page S2800]] Mr. SANTORUM. Let me give you the committee report \nwhich says: ``For any fiscal year, in effect, is intended in the first \nsentence of this section to require a separate waiver of the provisions \nof any amendment each year.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. For which sentence?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. For the first usage.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In section 5.\n  That is not what you told me a few minutes ago.\n  Is that right?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Which is correct then, your answer or the committee \nreport?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I refer to the committee report.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So, the answer you gave me earlier is not correct?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. According to the committee report, that is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, what is your view? Is your view the committee's \nreport or is your view the answer which you gave yourself just a couple \nminutes ago?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My view is that the committee report, having had the \ntime to study it longer than I, is probably the accurate view.\n  Mr. BYRD. Was there a minority view on this particular question in \nthat report?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Not that I am aware. I will have someone check.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me ask the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. By the way, I would further read that the meaning in \nthe second sentence, the second use, is also the same, that in every \nfiscal year the Congress would have to extend this waiver.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator that is certainly a consistent \nreading of the meaning ``for any fiscal year.'' At least it is being \nread the same way in the second sentence as it was read in the first \nsentence according to the committee report.\n  Now, that is not the answer the Senator was giving us because he was \ngiving a completely opposite view of the meaning ``any fiscal year'' in \nsentence 1 and in sentence 2. But it only underscores the problems with \nthis amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania came to manage the bill \nduring this time period. The Senator had--I assume now it has changed--\na perception of the meaning of this proposed amendment to the \nConstitution which I am now told he is withdrawing.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, that is why it is very \nimportant to have committee reports and implementing legislation that \nis called for in the article; that we have implementing legislation to \nclear up these kinds of doubts that may exist with respect to specific \nprovisions of the act.\n  So I suggest to the Senator that a lot of this debate is useful. In \nfact, it is illuminating. I find it to be such, not just on this point, \nbut on many others.\n  But what is important to note is the ability of this Senate to come \nback, as it will, and implement this act and further specify the \nmeanings of how this constitutional amendment will be implemented.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, do you think that \nthe implementing legislation could be used to clarify the discrepancy \nin view that was outlined here earlier on the floor as to whether a \nVice President has the power to break a tie? Could that be clarified by \nthe implementing legislation?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I guess I would defer to answer on that. I do not know \nwhether the implementing legislation would do that or not, to be \nhonest. I think that would be a matter of interpretation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me just carry the question a step further. Do you \nthink that implementing legislation can rewrite provisions of a \nconstitutional amendment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Obviously not, but they certainly can clarify points of \na constitutional amendment. Obviously, constitutional amendments, \nparticularly of this nature, are not meant to stand on their own. There \nhas to be some legislation that is going to allow this to be complied \nwith.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator allow me on that point?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Implementing legislation may be repealed in the very same \nsession--for that matter, in the very same month--in which the original \nlegislation was enacted. Does this mean then that we are going to trust \nto the hands of shifting opinions in the country and in this body the \ninterpretation of the amendment if we are going to do it by \nimplementing legislation?\n  Does this mean that we are going to put at risk the Nation's security \nby leaving this up to the implementing legislation, which can be \nchanged, as I say, by even the same Senators in a subsequent year? Are \nwe going to place the Nation's security at risk by falling back on the \nlanguage that talks about implementing legislation?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. He is making an extremely important point. Suppose one \nCongress comes along and passes implementing legislation saying that \nthe Vice President cannot cast a tie-breaking vote. Then a new Congress \ncomes in and they pass implementing legislation saying the Vice \nPresident can cast a tie-breaking vote.\n  I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I do not see how this \nparticular provision can bounce back and forth with the implementing \nlegislation. I just do not understand how that could happen. It is \nobvious that a court would have to come in to decide it if it is not \ndecided here, and we have directly conflicting views.\n  Let me just read you--I do not know whether the Senator is acquainted \nwith what Congressman Schaefer on the House side said about this.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, again, I am a little bit \nperplexed. I look at, for example, section 8 powers under article I \nthat are given to the Congress to borrow money, to regulate commerce. \nDoes it say how we regulate commerce or do we leave that to \nimplementing legislation? And if we do change that, does that mean we \nsomehow violate the Constitution, or is that somehow dangerous upon our \nsociety? The Constitution, as the Senator will tell you, is a contract \nof principles, not as to how to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that very point?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We continually change how to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is absolutely wrong. That is absolutely wrong. The \nConstitution is very specific in describing how, in terms of the \nprocess, decisions will be made. It is not specific about the substance \nof the decision to be made, but it is very specific about how we are to \ndo our business. The Framers were very careful about that. They spelled \nout what would be a quorum, then a majority of the quorum could pass \nthe legislation. It is all laid out.\n  I want to give you a real-life situation. A bill is before this body. \nIt is a controversial, closely fought bill. We take a vote on it. The \nvote is 50-50, and the Vice President is sitting in the chair.\n  Now, it is very clear under current procedure in that circumstance, \nthe Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote. It does not have to be \n50-50, it can be 48-48, whatever. And I have been in this body when \nthat has happened, not only on the 1993 deficit reduction bill, but on \nother measures as well. I have seen the Vice President in the chair \ncasting a tie-breaking vote.\n  What is the outcome in that situation?\n  Let me read to you what Congressman Schaefer says the outcome would \nbe. This is the Republican lead sponsor on the House side:\n\n       This language is not intended to preclude the Vice \n     President in his or her constitutional capacity as President \n     of the Senate from casting a tie-breaking vote that will \n     produce a 51-to-50 result. This is consistent with article I, \n     section 3, clause 4 which states: ``The Vice President of the \n     United States shall be President of the Senate but shall have \n     no vote unless they be equally divided.'' Nothing in section \n     4 of the substitute takes away the Vice President's right to \n     vote under such circumstances.\n\n  The Senator, I take it, has told us that he disagrees with that; is \nthat correct? That is not his view of the meaning of article 4.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is apparent from the committee report that refers \nto, as I did, the 12th amendment and refers to that being similar to \nwhat the 12th amendment would be. That would be my answer.\n  Mr. BYRD. In the 12th amendment there is no Vice President----\n  [[Page S2801]] Mr. SANTORUM. It is obvious as to what----\n  Mr. BYRD. To cast any kind of vote, whether it is a deciding vote or \nanything else. That is why we have the 12th amendment, to fill the \nvacancy in the Vice Presidency.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the reference in the committee report to which \nthe Senator is referring?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Page 15, about three-quarters of the way down, ``the \nwhole number of each House.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. That does not answer the question. That just makes a \nstatement.\n\n       The whole number of each House is intended to be consistent \n     with the phrase ``the whole number of Senators'' in the 12th \n     amendment to the Constitution * * *\n\n  But that does not answer my question, since the 12th amendment to the \nConstitution was a situation in which there was no Vice President. It \naddresses a situation in which you are choosing a Vice President, not \nthe situation after which the Vice President has been chosen. And once \nthe Vice President is chosen under article I, section 3, clause 4 of \nthe Constitution, he has a vote in an equally divided situation.\n  So what the Senator from Pennsylvania is doing is drawing an analogy \nfrom a situation that governs circumstances in which a Vice President \nhas not been picked and you are picking a Vice President. It does not \nthen answer the question of the vote-casting power of the Vice \nPresident once he has been chosen.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, I think the Senator from \nWest Virginia, in fact, helped me answer this question when, if you \nlook at, again, what the committee report says, ``The whole number of \neach House is intended to be consistent with the phrase `the whole \nnumber of Senators * * *'''\n  The Vice President is not a Senator. I quote the Senator from West \nVirginia, just a few minutes ago. So it would be obvious to any reader \nthat a whole number of Senators must be 51, assuming there are 100 \nSenators.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just make this observation to my friend.\n  You must be desperate about the 1993 legislation to be so driven that \nyou want to deny the Vice President of the United States his tie-\nbreaking power to cast a vote which has been in the Constitution from \nthe very beginning.\n  Now, I know Members on the other side are unhappy about that \nlegislation, but it seems to me it is carrying your differences over \nthe substance of a piece of legislation much too far when you start \ntinkering, really assaulting, the Constitution of the United States in \nthis fashion. We end up getting two completely differing \ninterpretations of the application of this provision as interpreted by \nthe lead House Republican sponsor of this measure and by the answers \nthat I am now receiving in the Chamber of the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nthe fact that I have the floor, I may propound a question to another \nSenator without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me ask the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, in \na situation in which in a given fiscal year the United States is \nengaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security, and that threat continues into \nthe next fiscal year, is it section 1 that would have to be waived in \nthe subsequent fiscal year or years? Would section 1 have to be waived \nin the subsequent fiscal year or years?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not too sure--if the Senator is asking for an \nanswer, I am not too sure I understand what the question is. Is he \nsuggesting that the second year would be treated differently than the \nfirst year of the conflict?\n  Mr. BYRD. Why would it not? It is a new fiscal year. And the \nconstitutional amendment on the balanced budget requires that the \noutlays not exceed receipts in any fiscal year. So we are into a new \nfiscal year. And yet the threat to the security of this country is \nstill in effect. What do we do? Do we have to waive section 1 again in \nthe new fiscal year?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. According to the committee report, a joint resolution \nof Congress would be required in order to have this provision be \neligible to be waived, this amendment to be waived.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is talking about two things there. The Senator \nis talking about the joint resolution in section 5 that would have to \nbe enacted into law which would require a majority of the whole number \nof Members in each House. But section 1 requires a vote, in order to be \nwaived, of three-fifths of the whole number of each House.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And section 5 provides an exception to section 1.\n  Mr. BYRD. To section 1.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In other words, section 1 binds us with the exception \nof, as outlined in section 5, when we have a declaration of war or----\n  Mr. BYRD. But my question is, if that military threat continues into \na second fiscal year----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We would be required then to pass a separate waiver of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Congress would have to pass a joint resolution in each and \nevery fiscal year that ensued following the fiscal year of the first \njoint resolution?\n  Suppose there is not a declaration of war in effect. The first \nsentence of section 5 addresses the situation in which there is a \ndeclaration of war. Now, I will read it:\n\n       Congress may waive the provisions of this article--\n\n  Meaning section 1----\n\n     for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in \n     effect.\n\n  Now, the country has fought three major wars and engaged in several \nmilitary conflicts during the past 48 years without declaring any war. \nSuppose there is not a declaration of war in effect. Then let us see \nwhat it says.\n\n       Provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and is so declared by joint resolution, \n     adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House, \n     which becomes law.\n\n  Now, I have two or three questions I wish to ask the Senator. I will \nask them singly or I will ask them en bloc.\n  One. Does this mean that in each subsequent fiscal year--let us \nimagine that a military threat develops in August, which is only 2 \nmonths preceding the close of the fiscal year. A threat is imminent. \nThe Commander in Chief asks for a resolution, and Congress, \nnotwithstanding the rules providing for unlimited debate in the United \nStates Senate, quickly passes such a joint resolution for that fiscal \nyear.\n  Then let us imagine that the threat continues over into the next \nfiscal year, January, February, March, April. Is another joint \nresolution required by the Congress?\n  Third question. Suppose that the response of the Congress to the \nPresident's request is favorable and the President launches his planes \nand ships, his troops, and vast expenditures of money are entailed. The \nfiscal year ends. The outlays exceed the receipts. The threat continues \nthroughout the next fiscal year. There is no declaration of war but \nexpenditures run into the billions of dollars--billions. What are we \ngoing to do?\n  This amendment says outlays shall not exceed receipts in any fiscal \nyear. What are we going to do about the fact that the deficits rose \ngreatly in the previous fiscal year, the one in which the threat first \nmade itself clear and the deficit of the second year amounted to \nbillions of dollars? What are we going to do? And suppose that passions \nwithin the Congress and in the country in the early-on support for the \nwar dwindled away and left the Commander in Chief out there with his \nmen in far-flung seas and lands, with their lives on the line. What do \nwe do? No war has been declared.\n  Do we require that in order to waive--in order to waive section 5 \nthere must be a majority of the Members elected in both bodies to \nwaive. And you do not have that majority. What are you going to do? You \nhave already run in excess, many--$10 billion, $15--who knows what? It \ncost billions, the Persian Gulf War, what do you do, Senator?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would answer the question----\n  Mr. BYRD. Are you going to raise taxes?\n   [[Page S2802]] Mr. SANTORUM. I would answer that question the same \nas I would with any war. The Congress has the responsibility of funding \nthe war and appropriating the dollars. The President cannot continue to \nexecute a war if the Congress does not provide the funds to do so by a \nmajority vote. So we already have, already, an existing requirement \nthat Members of Congress vote by a majority to fund the war.\n  So I guess I do not see the complication. If we are going to go ahead \nby a majority vote and fund the war through an appropriations process, \nand we have the support to do that, why would we not continue very \nconsistently, almost an afterthought, to go ahead and waive this \nprovision of the Constitution, recognizing the imminent threat to our \nnational security?\n  Mr. BYRD. Except that a majority is not a majority is not a majority, \nunder this new amendment to the old Constitution. A majority under the \ncurrent Constitution is not a majority under this constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  So the deficits have been increased, the debt has gone through the \nstratosphere, and we have people overseas with their lives on the line. \nWhat are we going to do?\n  You have an administration under the control of one party and the \nleadership of the Congress under the control of the other. You are \nputting our Nation's security in peril----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Senator, what you are suggesting----\n  Mr. BYRD. Requiring a mini-supermajority for such a critical time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is what the Senator is suggesting that this body or the \nother body would pass appropriations bills to fund the conflict, our \nparticipation in the conflict, and then not come back and waive the \nrequirement for a balanced budget to allow us to do that? Is that what \nthe Senator is suggesting?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not suggesting it. The Senator----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Same vote----\n  Mr. BYRD. The amendment the Senator is so avidly supporting requires \nthat in each fiscal year----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As we do with appropriations----\n  Mr. BYRD. Outlays shall not exceed receipts.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Except----\n  Mr. BYRD. Suppose that in order to make that work, we had to have a \ntax to fund this threat--to protect us against the threat to the \nsecurity of the Nation. I have heard Senators on that side of the aisle \nsay they will not vote for a tax, ever. What about the deficits that \nhave already been run up in the previous fiscal years, for which a \nmajority of the Members chosen and sworn have voted to waive? Does that \nmean we have to go back and put on a retroactive tax? How would the \nSenator feel about that?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. How I would feel about it is, as you know, every year \nwe have to appropriate money for the Defense Department. Particularly \nin time of war we would have to appropriate money through an \nappropriation process; we would have to go through both sides, it would \nhave to be passed by a majority vote. In addition, we have put an \nadditional hurdle--yes, of this section--which requires a simple \nmajority, not a three-fifths or constitutional majority, but a majority \nof the whole number of each House----\n  Mr. BYRD. That is not a simple majority.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. A majority of the whole number of each House.\n  Mr. BYRD. Which is not a simple majority.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Which would be slightly higher, possibly slightly \nhigher burden in the House, and potentially higher, depending on \ninterpretation, vote here in the Senate. But certainly consistent with \nthe passage of the appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Slightly higher, but it does not necessarily mean it would \nbe slightly easier.\n  Would the Senator recommend that in order to deal with the deficits \nthat had been built up as a result of the waiver of the article in \nprevious fiscal years--does he suggest there might have to be a \nretroactive tax?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There is nothing here in this constitutional amendment \nthat requires us to pay back deficits that have been incurred since the \nenactment of this constitutional amendment, that have occurred as a \nresult of a waiver of this amendment. So there is no requirement in the \nconstitutional amendment to require the payment of existing debt.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, there is not? There is not?\n  The other day, the Senator from Pennsylvania stated with reference to \ndealing with the deficit for a year that has ended, the Senator stated: \n``We could, as has been done here, retroactively tax.'' I do not \nbelieve the Senator would have made that statement without having given \nit long and serious thought. So the question that naturally occurred to \nme today, again, is would the Senator be willing, in that situation, to \nvote for a retroactive tax? We are talking about a fiscal year or \nfiscal years that have ended and the estimate for the deficits for that \nyear or those years have gone wrong by virtue of the sudden imminence \nof a serious military threat to our national security.\n  Is the Senator willing--he would not be willing, I do not believe, to \nvote for a package to reduce the deficits, such as the one we enacted \nin 1993. But in a situation like this, in which the Nation's security \nis imperiled, would he be willing to vote to increase taxes? I heard a \nRepublican Senator stand over there on the floor and say he would not \nvote to increase a tax, ever.\n  I do not believe the Senator from Pennsylvania's feet are in such \nconcrete. But I am just wondering, in the light of what he said about a \nretroactive tax the other day, whether or not he would suggest that, in \na situation like this? In order to go back and wipe out those deficits?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Would I in fact vote for a retroactive tax? If we \nneeded to tax in order to meet the needs of war, I think we would have \nbroad bipartisan support, as we would--as we do now, with \nappropriations bills.\n  Mr. BYRD. And he would vote for a retroactive tax?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not know what the need would be for a retroactive \ntax but if that is what would be required, I would certainly consider \nit, if our country was at war. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. How would the taxpayers of this country ever know how to \nfill out an income tax form, if we are going to go back and enact \nretroactive taxes? How are they going to know what the tax requirements \nare when they fill out their income tax forms and whether they may have \nto pay back taxes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That was our argument against the retroactive tax in \n1993.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the other day--I am talking about the Senator's \nstatement the other day, when he suggested there might be a retroactive \ntax.\n  SANTORUM. I said that is an option available to future Congress, if \nnecessary.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I am asking the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would not recommend that option.\n  Mr. BYRD. But you would be willing----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In a time of war, Senator, I would be willing to do \nthings that otherwise I would not be willing to do at other times.\n  Mr. BYRD. What I am concerned about is in a time of serious military \nthreat to this country, under this amendment a majority of the Senators \nand House Members elected and sworn would be required in order to waive \nthe requirements of this amendment, under such dire extremities, and \ncould not do so by a simple majority vote.\n  May I say, for the information of the Senate, I have an amendment \nwhich is at the desk.\n  I would be willing to agree to a vote on that amendment on the day \nthat the Senate returns following this weekend--be willing to agree to \na vote on or in relation to the amendment. I say ``in relation'' \nbecause the amendments around here to this constitutional amendment do \nnot get up-or-down votes. Motions to table are made. There have been \nseveral amendments offered and debated to this constitutional \namendment. There have been no up-or-down votes, and all of the \namendments succumbed to the motion to table. That certainly is within \nthe right of Senators to move to table.\n  I would be willing to offer my amendment, and it will be germane, if \ncloture is invoked. I would be willing to offer that amendment today, \nand agree to a time on it for debate and vote on or in \n[[Page S2803]] relation to it, which includes the tabling motion, to \ntake place on next Wednesday. I have not offered the amendment yet. So \nit cannot be tabled today. But I can offer it. So if the manager of the \nbill would like to respond, I will yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will my dear friend yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, the Senator from West Virginia is \nwilling to lay down his amendment as long as it is not tabled today, \nand willing to have the vote on it at a time certain when we get back \non Wednesday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can the Senator tell me what time the distinguished \nSenator would desire? Could we keep it short?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me modify my request. Let me offer this modification, \nor possible modification. I believe a unanimous-consent order was \nentered for the recognition of the Senator from West Virginia \nimmediately upon the disposition of the cloture vote today to call up \namendment No. 252, and that amendment would eliminate the three-fifths \nsupermajority contained in section 1.\n  I would like to have the privilege of calling up that amendment, \nlaying it down today, or calling up instead an amendment which is \nequally germane, in the event cloture is invoked, to deal with section \n5, which the Senators from Maryland and Michigan and I and other \nSenators have been discussing this afternoon--with the understanding \nthat there would be no tabling motion offered today, and that the vote \non or in relation to that amendment, whichever of the two it is, would \nnot occur until next Wednesday.\n  There is a cloture vote, I believe, that will occur, possibly even \ntwo of them, on that day. As I understand it, the majority leader laid \ndown two cloture motions last night--say 2 hours of debate, equally \ndivided. Of course, if cloture is invoked, we will operate under the \nrule.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator be willing, if our side takes only 15 \nminutes, to reduce that time to an hour? He would almost have the same \namount of time as 2 hours equally divided. It would be 15 minutes less. \nBut I would be 45 minutes less.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is most generous.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have tried. What I am trying to do with my dear \ncolleague is get moving on the amendment process, face whatever we have \nto face on this amendment, and try to bring this matter to a close \nsometime within the near future so that we can alleviate delays as much \nas possible. We are willing. As the Senator from West Virginia can see, \nwe have been willing to take very little time on our side and allow \nplenty of time on the opposite side of this issue as an accommodation \nto try to move things along.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, accommodations do not matter to this \nSenator----\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand that. It is just a request.\n  Mr. BYRD. --when it comes to amending the Constitution. There is \nprobably too much accommodation around here, in any event. But, \nnevertheless, it is characteristic of the distinguished Senator to want \nto accommodate.\n  What I was amused about was the offer to let the proponents of my \namendment have 1 hour of debate and the opponents have 15 minutes. That \nis an indication to me that there is not much serious thought being \ngiven to my amendment. It is going to suffer the same fate as have \nother amendments around here--that they have been debated a little bit, \nand a motion to table is then made. They are not accorded serious \ndebate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not directing this at the Senator. I am simply saying \nthat it says something about the debate on this constitutional \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, it does not, because the amendment the Senator is \ngoing to call up we are fully cognizant of. We spent a lot of time \nanalyzing it. We believe we can answer it in a reasonable period of \ntime. I feel we can answer it in 15 minutes. If we cannot, I would be \nhappy to--but I think we can.\n  On the second amendment, I do not know what amendment that would be. \nSo we might have to grant some more time on that. But our problem is \nnot so much that we do not want to give enough time on this. We have \nbeen giving hours and hours. We have given. It is now 14 days of Senate \nfloor time; long hours. I am not complaining. I am willing to be here \nas long as the distinguished Senator wants to debate any of these \nissues. But we have spent 14 days, which is 3 more than was spent on \nany balanced budget amendment in history.\n  Like I say, I am willing to spend more, but it is to accommodate my \ncolleagues who are on the other side of this issue. So it is not a \nmatter of giving a short shrift. We believe some of the amendments in \nthe past have not deserved a lot of consideration from a constitutional \nstandpoint. And we felt as though we had full debate, even with the \nlimited amount of time we have allocated to ourselves, and we felt as \nif we made the case enough. But so far, we have been successful in \ntabling motions.\n  One last thing. Every amendment that has been brought forth has been \na significant amendment, in my eyes.\n  I have wondered why some were brought forth, perhaps, but I still \nhope that they are substantively significant amendments. We cannot \nconstitutionally answer some of them in less time than it takes for \nothers. We are hopeful that on the amendment that we believe the \nSenator will call up before the end of today we can shorten the time. \nIf the Senator wants 2 hours equally divided, I am not sure that the \nmajority leader would not grant him that. But I am trying to \naccommodate the Senate and accommodate the opponents so they can bring \nup their amendments and yet still make sure that the record is made \nconstitutionally on these important issues.\n  I add that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia always brings \nup important, substantive issues that are important not only to himself \nbut to others as well, and they are certainly important to me. I admire \nand appreciate his desire to at all times uphold the Constitution and \nat all times do what is right, in his view, under the Constitution. \nThat is all we are trying to do here--to do what is right.\n  We have spent 14 days of full Senate floor time, and compared to \nother balanced budget amendment debates, we have had far less \namendments. So we have given adequate time to these amendments, and we \nhave spent far more time than on prior amendments. But we cannot be \ngoverned just by prior debates. I am happy to spend whatever time it \ntakes. I am sure the Senator understands the majority leader is asking \nme to try to move it along as fast as I can.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me say----\n  Mr. HATCH. I am trying to accommodate the Senator. I will have to ask \nthe majority leader. I felt like it was an attempt to accommodate by \ngiving the Senator most of the time, almost as much as he would get \nwith 2 hours equally divided, while we would try to make our \narguments--as feeble as they might be--in a shorter time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why could the Senator not--if the request was 2 hours \nequally divided and the Senator's suggestion is that the Senator from \nWest Virginia have 1 hour and he have 15 minutes, why would the Senator \nnot agree to the 2 hours and not use all his time if it was not \nnecessary in the debate? I mean, give the Senator from West Virginia \ntime to debate at the time, and you might discover on that occasion \nthat you might need more than 15 minutes. You can always yield back \nyour time.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is not a demand. This is a suggestion. If the Senator \nfrom West Virginia does not agree----\n  Mr. SARBANES. I was just seeing a way where you could get where you \nwant to go.\n  Mr. HATCH. Anything that will move the debate forward I am happy to \ntry to do. In any event, we will have to see what the majority leader \nwants to do next Wednesday. We have that cloture vote, and I am not \nsure when he is going to have that cloture vote; I am not aware. But we \nwill have to put in a quorum call and decide. I understand the \nSenator's request, that he would like to bring up one of two \namendments----\n  Mr. BYRD. At this point.\n   [[Page S2804]] Mr. HATCH. Could the Senator inform us what the other \namendment is? I believe you said it is No. 252.\n  Mr. BYRD. I said it pertained to section 5. That has been discussed \nall afternoon here.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thought you mentioned there might be two amendments and \nyou would make your choice between the two.\n  Mr. BYRD. I mentioned amendment No. 252 and an amendment No. 256. \nAmendment No. 256 deals with section 5. I believe I have 7 or 8 or 9 or \n10 amendments at the desk.\n  Mr. HATCH. You would choose whichever one you want, but there would \nbe no amendments to the amendment in order by either side?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, if cloture is invoked, I suppose if I were able to \nqualify, or if other Senators were able to qualify, they could have \nsecond-degree amendments at the desk.\n  Mr. HATCH. Unless we agree to a time agreement with those terms. That \nis what I am asking.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not quarreling with the hour that I am to be given. I \nhave had a good bit of time this afternoon. But I think it is \nindicative of the lack of interest on the part of the proponents in \nseriously trying to improve the constitutional amendment that is before \nthe Senate when they say, well, we will take 15 minutes, you can have \nyour hour. I know what is going to happen; the amendment is going to be \ntabled. That is certainly the right of the manager of the resolution, \nor the leader, or any other Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Surely, I do not believe the Senator is suggesting that I \nam not taking his amendment seriously or that I have not taken any \namendment seriously, is he? I have taken them all extremely seriously. \nThis is the Constitution we are working on and nobody takes it more \nseriously than the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, unless it \nis the Senator from Utah. I would not claim to take it more seriously \nthan the Senator, but I do not think anybody takes it more seriously \nthan either of us. I will try to do my best to answer.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, can I be included in that \nduo, to make it a trio of people who take the Constitution seriously?\n  Mr. HATCH. We just do not feel that people on the east coast--I am \nkidding. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let us make it a trio.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us make it 100 of us. We are all serious. The fact of \nthe matter is let us see what we can do to get Senator Dole to resolve \nthis.\n  Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2777-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROVIDING FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE TWO HOUSES--HOUSE CONCURRENT \n                             RESOLUTION 30\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

As I understood it, the Senator wanted it \nafter the cloture vote?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Would the Senator provide for the alternative of \namendment No. 256, either/or?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could the Senator give me a copy of amendment No. 256?\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask that the clerk state, for the edification of the \nSenate, amendment No. 256.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will report the \namendment for the information of the Senate.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment 256: On page 2, lines 24 and 25, strike ``adopted \n     by a majority of the whole number of each House.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator agree to bring up the amendment and have \nthe 2 hours, if there are two cloture votes, after the second cloture \nvote, if necessary?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I have no desire to interfere with cloture votes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then let us add either No. 252 or No. 256 to the request. \nThe Senator will have his choice on amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  May I say briefly that I want to yield to Senator Pell for 10 minutes \nand then I am going to yield the floor.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah--and he is a distinguished \nSenator--has talked about the 14 days that we have spent on this \nconstitutional amendment. Well, so what? The constitutional Framers \nspent 116 days--116 days in closed session at the Constitutional \nConvention--116 days. And now we have spent, the Senator said, 14 days. \nSo what? What is 14 days as between us Senators, 14 days to amend the \nConstitution in a way which can destroy the separation of powers and \nchecks and balances--14 days.\n  The other body spent all of 2 days on this constitutional amendment. \nI believe that is right, 2 days. What a joke! Two days in adopting this \nconstitutional amendment. Why, any town council in this country would \nspend 2 days in determining whether or not it should issue a permit to \nbuild a golf course.\n  Two days to amend the Constitution.\n  I will not say any more than that now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. He has an ambassador \n[[Page S2805]] waiting on him in his office. I understand he wishes 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PELL. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, would the distinguished \nSenator allow me just a few seconds to just make a closing comment on \nwhat the distinguished Senator just said?\n  Yes, they did spend over 100 days to arrive at the full Constitution, \nwithout the Bill of Rights. And we have spent 19 years working on this \namendment. This amendment is virtually the same as we brought up in \n1982, 1986, and last year. We have had weeks of debate on this \namendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. It has been developed in \nconsultation between Democrats and Republicans in the House and in the \nSenate. It has had a lot of deliberation, consideration, negotiation, \nand debate on the floor.\n  Admittedly, I am sure the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nwould agree that the constitutional convention did not debate this on \nthe floor of the Senate at the time, nor would it have taken that much \ntime had there been a debate on the floor of the Senate. But be that as \nit may, if it had, we are living today with an amendment that is one \namendment to the whole Constitution that, if adopted, would become the \n28th amendment to the Constitution.\n  We have spent 14 days on the floor. I am willing to spend more. I am \nnot complaining, and I do want to have a full and fair debate, but I \nalso believe that we are reaching a point where there is deliberate \ndelay here, not by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nnecessarily, but I believe reasonable people can conclude that there is \na desire to delay this amendment for whatever purpose that may be and \nthat is the right of Senators if they want to do it.\n  The majority leader has filed a cloture motion which we voted on \ntoday. We had 57 Senators who wanted to end this debate and make all \nmatters germane from this point on. Next Wednesday, we will vote on \ncloture again. And if there are 60 Senators who vote for cloture, then \nthat will bring a large part of this debate to a closure.\n  I think I would be remiss if I did not say, on behalf of the majority \nleader and others on our side who are working hard to move this \namendment, that we believe that is a reasonable period of time and we \nbelieve that every person here has had a chance to bring up their \namendments.\n  We tried to get to an amendment up last night. We were willing to \nwork later. We could not get one person to put up an amendment.\n  So we have reached a point where we can go along with more \namendments. But once cloture is invoked then only those that are \ngermane will be considered and then only for a limited period of time.\n  But I just want to make the record straight that this is not a \nrewriting of the whole Constitution, although it is important and it \nwill have a dramatic imprint and impact on how we spend and how we tax \nin America from that point on if this amendment is passed through both \nHouses of Congress by the requisite two-thirds vote and ratified by \nthree-quarters of the States. It is very important. Those who are for \nit are very concerned about it and those who are opposed are rightly \nvery concerned about it.\n  We have had a very healthy debate. We intend to continue as long as \nis necessary to bring this matter to closure. But I do not want anybody \nthinking that anybody has been cut off here or that anybody has been \nmistreated or that anybody has not been given their chance to bring up \namendments, because they have. We have tabled those amendments. We feel \nthat that is certainly within our right to do that. We have tried to \ntreat every amendment with the dignity and the prestige that it \ndeserves.\n  Finally, I would like to encourage my colleagues next Wednesday to \nvote for cloture. Because we all know where it stands. We all know the \narguments on both sides. This is not just 14 days. Since I have been \nhere, we are in our 19th year debating this matter, in the Judiciary \nCommittee now four times and stopped a number of other times in the \nJudiciary Committee before we could even get it to the floor.\n  So this is not an unusual situation. We actually have worked hard. \nEverybody here knows what is involved in this amendment. Everybody here \nknows the arguments against it. And everybody here knows that we voted \non some very substantial and very important amendments thus far, and \nthose who are in a bipartisan way thus far have been successful in \nmaintaining the integrity of the House-passed amendment; I might add \njust one more time, a House-passed amendment for the first time in the \nhistory of this country. And I have to say that is historic.\n  Now we have the opportunity of passing it through here and submitting \nit to the States. And those of us who support it hope that 38 States \nwill ratify it. We hope all 50 will, but at least 38, three-quarters. \nAnd if they do, then this will become the 28th amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  But I just wanted to make those points. I am sorry I delayed the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not want to leave the record standing \nas the distinguished Senator from Utah has left it. I believe he \nindicated he thought there was a deliberate effort to delay.\n  Mr. HATCH. I said not by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. I would not impute that to you and I hope that is not the \ncase.\n  But I do not think many reasonable people would conclude that we have \nnot given an extensive amount of time to this debate. And I think \npeople might conclude that now that we have gone through one cloture \nvote that there may be a desire of some here to delay this matter from \na filibuster standpoint. I hope that is not true. But that is the way \nit looks to me.\n  I admit that I am not nearly as experienced here as the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, but I have been here 19 years and I have \nobserved. I can remember the majority leader, Senator Mitchell, calling \nfilibusters filibusters in less than a day. And here we have had 14 \ndays, so it is 3 solid weeks of Senate debate on this, and extensive \namendments, although not as many as the 1982, where there were 31 \namendments. But we did that in 11 days. I think people could reasonably \nconclude that there is a filibuster going on.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I disagree with that statement.\n  The Senator from Utah was not here during the debate on the Civil \nRights Act, which lasted 103 days, covered a total of 103 days between \nthe date of the motion to proceed on March 9, 1964, and the date on \nwhich the final vote occurred on the civil rights bill on June 19.\n March 9, June 19th--103 days transpired. The Senate was on the bill \nitself 77 days and debated the bill 57 days in which there were \nincluded six Saturdays.\n\n  The Senator implies that there may be a deliberate effort here to \ndelay this measure. Nobody has engaged, that I know of, in \nobstructionist tactics. Imagine what one could do if he wanted to. \nThere have been no dilatory quorum calls. There have been no dilatory \nmotions to reconsider, and the asking for the yeas and nays on a motion \nto reconsider, and then put in a quorum call and send for the Sergeant \nat Arms and have the Sergeant at Arms arrest Members, as I had to do. \nNothing dilatory has been done.\n  Nobody has objected to any time limits on amendments. Not one \nobjection that I know about. I have had every amendment that has been \ncalled up here and time request that has been brought to me, brought to \nme because I am a Senator. I have not objected to any such request.\n  The majority leader has a right to offer cloture motions. I think he \nhas been fairly reasonable in this situation. He has not been pressing \nout here daily for action on this constitutional amendment.\n  I am not against Senator Hatch. I am not against Senator Dole. I am \njust against this amendment. Nobody has attempted to deliberately delay \nthis. Let me debunk that idea from any Senator's mind.\n  I want to see this come to an end. It is going to come to an end. I \nwill have no more to say unless the Senator wants to carry on this bit \nof subject matter further.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague offering that \nopportunity. All I have to say is that the rules today are considerably \ndifferent than they were during the civil rights \n[[Page S2806]] debates when they went 103 days. Cloture can be invoked. \nThere is no such thing as a postcloture filibuster today.\n  Mr. BYRD. There could be.\n  Mr. HATCH. But a lot different from the old days.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator know why it is different? Because I, as \nmajority leader, laid down certain points of order that were upheld by \nthe then Presiding Officer, and we established precedents that make it \nmuch more difficult to carry on a postcloture filibuster.\n  Mr. HATCH. How well aware I am, and I compliment the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for his knowledge of the rules.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for that compliment. I hope I have a \nlittle knowledge of a few things other than just the rules of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to confess that I think the distinguished Senator \nis a fine Senator, a great Senator.\n  I know that he knows the rules very well and I think he knows the \nConstitution quite well, although I do think earlier in the day he said \nthere were no amendments dealing with the economy.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no. I said no amendments dealing with fiscal policy.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe the contract laws, I believe the 16th amendment \ndo deal with fiscal policy.\n  Mr. BYRD. It does not attempt to write fiscal policy, fiscal theory, \nabout which Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said there is no place in the \nConstitution for fiscal theory.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with that, if you consider that fiscal policy.\n  Mr. BYRD. I consider this amendment which, by the way, I think \ncontains about 465 words.\n  Mr. HATCH. It does.\n  Mr. BYRD. The entire first 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights \ncontain only about 385 words. This amendment alone contains about 465 \nwords. The entire 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights contained only \naround 385.\n  What I am saying is this nefarious amendment that is proposed here \nhas only about 80 fewer words than do the 10 amendments to the Bill of \nRights. The 10 amendments contain, I think, about 465 words, and this \nmonstrosity contains about 385. So there are only about 80 words \ndifference.\n  My math may be off a little bit this afternoon. I have not had any \nlunch, and my feet are getting a little tired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Pell be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, and that he be followed by Senator Murray, \nnot to exceed 5 minutes.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his gracious manner and his characteristic \nfriendliness and conviviality. He is a fine Senator. I enjoy working \nwith him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2804-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2806-S2808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             MAJORITY RULE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the distinguished and learned Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] \nto amend the proposed constitutional amendment to allow a majority, \nrather than a supermajority to determine when a deficit can be \nincurred.\n  The concept of majority rule is so deeply embedded in our society and \nin almost every organized group proceeding--from fraternal and social \ngroups to corporations large and small and government at the village, \ncounty, city, and State level--that many Americans might be very \nsurprised to realize the extent to which the Congress of the United \nStates is sometimes ruled by a minority, and could become more so in \nthe future.\n  We have before us the balanced budget amendment which contains not \njust one but two supermajority requirements--one requiring a three-\nfifths vote of the entire membership of each House to permit outlays to \nexceed receipts and the other a three-fifths vote of the entire \nmembership of each House to increase the public debt limit.\n  And we may soon have before us a line-item veto proposal which would \nsubject congressional disapproval of a rescission to a two-thirds \nsupermajority veto override, as opposed to an alternative plan under \nwould a simple majority could block a rescission.\n  If approved, these supermajority requirements would join others \nalready in place: the Senate cloture rule, the new rule of the House of \nRepresentatives on votes of that body to raise income taxes, and the \nstatutory supermajority requirement for waiving points of order under \nthe Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, better \nknown as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.\n  Mr. President, these flirtations with supermajorities are leading us \nastray from the apparent intent of the wise men who wrote the \nConstitution two centuries ago. For them the principle of majority rule \nwas so self-evident that they apparently saw no need to state it \nexplicitly.\n  Since the Constitution provides for supermajorities only in specific \ninstances--such as overriding vetoes, Senate consent to treaties, \nSenate verdicts on impeachment, expulsion of Members, determination of \nPresidential disability and amending the Constitution itself--it seems \nclear that the Framers intended that all other business should be \ntransacted by a majority.\n  And since the Constitution gives the Vice President the power to \nbreak ties when the Senate is ``equally divided,'' Framers again \nevidenced a clear intent that business was to be transacted by a \nmajority. We carry forward that intent in the structural organization \nof Congress itself, whereby the party that controls 50 percent plus one \nseat assumes control.\n  The time may be coming when the only way to prevent further violence \nto the Framers intent will be to enshrine this most basic principle of \ngovernance--majority rule itself--as a constitutional provision.\n  Mr. President, I offer these reflections today from the vantage point \nof 34 years service in this body. As I stated here a few days ago, I \nhave cast 327 votes for cloture during those years, so I am no stranger \nto the impact and consequences of a supermajority requirement in the \nSenate.\n  I would point out, in that regard, that cloture by majority rule \nwould not cancel out rule XXII of the Senate--it would simply lower the \nmargin for invoking cloture to the threshold envisioned by the Founding \nFathers for the transaction of business. And we should make no mistake \nabout the fact that the rules of proceedings now have such sweeping \nsubstantive effect that they do in fact constitute an important element \nin the business of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, in the haste to fulfill the expectations and promises \nof this new Congress, many of which are of great merit, we must take \nspecial care to preserve basic principles of our democracy which may be \nbrushed aside in the rush to reform. The principle of majority rule is \nthe basic cornerstone of the edifice, whether it applies to rules of \nproceedings or the substance of legislation. It must be preserved and \nprotected from all assaults. Perhaps the time is coming when it too \nshould be enshrined in the Constitution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that three articles entitled ``The Three-\nFifths Rule: A Dangerous Game'' by David Broder, ``Super-Majority \nSimple-Mindedness'' by Lloyd N. Cutler, and ``On Madison's Grave'' by \nAnthony Lewis, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles are ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 1995]\n\n                           On Madison's Grave\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Boston.--``Miracle at Philadelphia,'' Catherine Drinker \n     Bowen called her book on the Constitutional Convention of \n     1787. And it was a political miracle. The delegates produced \n     a document that has ordered a huge country for 200 years, \n     balancing state and nation, government power and individual \n     rights.\n       The Constitution has been amended 27 times. Some of the \n     changes have been profound: the Bill of Rights, the end of \n     slavery. But none has altered the fundamental structure, the \n     republican systems designed by James Madison and the others. \n     Until now.\n       Now the House of Representatives has approved an amendment \n     that would make a revolutionary change in the Madisonian \n     system. It is call the Balanced Budget Amendment. A more \n     honest name would be the Minority Rule Amendment.\n       The amendment does not prohibit unbalanced budgets. It \n     requires, rather, that a decision to spend more in any fiscal \n     year than anticipated receipts be made by a vote of three-\n     fifths of the whole House and Senate. The same vote would be \n     required to increase the debt limit.\n       [[Page S2807]] The result would be to transfer to \n     minorities effective control over many, perhaps most, \n     significant legislative decisions. For the impact would not \n     be limited to the overall budget resolution. Most legislation \n     that comes before Congress bears a price tag. If a bill would \n     unbalance a budget, a three-fifths vote would be required to \n     fund it.\n       In short, a minority of just over 40 percent--175 of the \n     435 representatives, 41 of the 100 Senators--could block \n     action. It takes no great imagination to understand what is \n     likely to happen. Members of the blocking minority will have \n     enormous power to extract concessions for their votes: a \n     local pork project, a judgeship for a friend. * * *\n       Just think about the debt-ceiling provision. Even with the \n     best of intentions to stay in balance, the Government may \n     find itself in deficit at any moment because tax receipts are \n     lagging. Then it will have to do\n      some short-term borrowing or be unable to meet its \n     obligations. Instead of a routine vote for a temporary \n     increase in the debt ceiling, there will be a session of \n     painful bargaining for favors.\n       The amendment is also a full-employment measure for \n     lawyers. Suppose the figures that produce a balanced budget \n     are suspect, or suppose the demand for balance is ignored. \n     How would the amendment be enforced? Sponsors say it would be \n     up to the courts. So this proposal, labeled conservative, \n     would turn intensely political issues over to judges!\n       It is in fact a radical idea, one that would subvert \n     majority rule and turn the fiscal debates that are the \n     business of democratic legislatures into constitutional and \n     legal arguments. How did a conservative polity like ours ever \n     get near the point of taking such a step?\n       The answer is plain. The enormous Federal budget deficits \n     that began in the Reagan years have frightened us--all of us, \n     conservative and liberal. We do not want our children and \n     grandchildren to have to pay for our profligacy. We are not \n     strong-minded enough to resist deficit temptation, so we are \n     going to bind ourselves as Ulysses did to resist the lure of \n     the Sirens.\n       The binding would introduce dangerous economic rigidities \n     into our system. In times of recession government should run \n     a deficit, to stimulate the economy. But the amendment would \n     force spending cuts because of declining tax receipts, \n     digging us deeper into the recession.\n       The rigidities of the amendment would also inflict pain on \n     millions of Americans. The target year for balancing the \n     budget, 2002, could not be met without savage cuts in middle-\n     class entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.\n       ``It's a bad idea whose time has come,'' Senator Nancy L. \n     Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, said. ``It's like \n     Prohibition; we may have to do it to get it our of our \n     system.''\n       If someone as sensible as Nancy Kassebaum can succumb to \n     such counsels of despair, we have truly lost Madison's faith \n     in representative government. Madison knew that majorities \n     can go wrong; that is why he and his colleagues put so many \n     protections against tyranny in their Constitution. But they \n     also left government the flexibility to govern.\n       Their design, the miracle that has sustained us for 200 \n     years, is now at risk.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    Super-Majority Simple-Mindedness\n\n                          (By Lloyd N. Cutler)\n\n       The Republican majority has proposed amending House Rule \n     XXI to require the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     members present to pass a bill ``carrying a federal income \n     tax rate increase.'' If all 435 members show up, 261 votes \n     would be needed for passage. As Post columnist David Broder \n     and Rep. David Skaggs (D-Colo.) have already observed, such a \n     rule would be unconstitutional. Even if it were \n     constitutional, it would still be unworkable.\n       It would be unworkable because tax bills usually contain \n     multiple provisions reducing some rates of tax, increasing \n     other rates and adjusting the base numbers--e.g., wages, \n     profits and capital gains less various credits, exemptions \n     and deductions--to which these rates are applied. Almost \n     every two-year Congress enacts major tax revision laws to \n     close loopholes, correct inequities, adjust rates, hold down \n     the budget deficit and manage the economy for noninflationary \n     growth.\n       If the rules are changed to require a three-fifths \n     affirmative vote, it may not be practicable to pass any major \n     tax bill. Any such bill is bound to contain some provisions \n     that can be called tax rate increases. What about a tax bill \n     that reduces rates for incomes below, say, $200,000 and \n     raises rates for incomes above that figure? What about tax \n     bill provisions eliminating charitable or home mortgage \n     interest deductions, or reducing the allowed exemptions for \n     dependents or lengthening the required holding period for \n     long-term capital gains? Any one of these would have the same \n     effect on many taxpayers as an increase in income tax rates. \n     As a result, the proposed three-fifths requirement could well \n     apply to any major income tax revision bill that follows \n     adoption of the proposed rules change.\n       Let us suppose that a stubborn minority of 175 members will \n     be mustered to prevent a three-fifths majority and thus \n     defeat any bill including some income tax increases. Let us \n     also suppose that a simple majority (218 if all 435 are \n     present) will vote against an amendment that eliminates any \n     such increase. There is still a budget deficit to contend \n     with, and 218 members may think that a broad reduction in \n     income tax rates should be at least partially offset by some \n     tax increases. In that event, no major tax bill could be \n     passed at all, and the government would be unable to make \n     needed changes in national fiscal policy.\n       With the House floor debate on the proposal about to begin, \n     it may also be useful to spell out the main reasons why a \n     super-majority requirement for the vote on passage of a bill \n     is unconstitutional. In United States v. Ballin, decided a \n     century ago, the Supreme Court said that a simple majority \n     governs ``all parliamentary bodies,'' except when the basic \n     charter requires some form of super-majority, which our \n     Constitution does in five cases (plus two added by subsequent \n     amendments) and no others. The seven exceptions are: the \n     overriding of a presidential veto, the Senate's consent to a \n     treaty, the Senate's verdict on an impeachment, the expulsion \n     of a senator or congressman, an amendment of the \n     Constitution, the 14th Amendment vote on removing the \n     disqualification for office of participants in a rebellion \n     and the 25th Amendment vote on whether to allow a disabled \n     president to resume his office. All of these are special \n     cases, not involving the mere passage of a bill or resolution \n     for presentation to the president.\n       Except in these cases, the Framers were against allowing a \n     minority of either house to block legislative action. That is \n     the reason why Article I, Section 5, states that ``a Majority \n     of each [house] shall constitute a quorum to do Business.'' \n     As James Madison explained, the Framers rejected a proposal \n     that a super-majority be required for a quorum because: ``In \n     all cases where justice or the general good might require new \n     laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the \n     fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. \n     It would be no longer the majority that would rule: the power \n     would be transferred to the minority.'' (The Federalist \n     Papers, No. 58.)\n       The vote of the House on whether to\n        pass a bill is certainly the doing of ``Business.'' And \n     contrary to the Framers' intent, a super-majority \n     requirement would certainly give a minority the power to \n     rule over such business.\n       Another constitutional provision confirms this \n     understanding of the Framers. Article I, Section 3, states \n     that the vice president shall be the president of the Senate, \n     ``but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided.'' \n     The Framers must have intended that in the Senate at least, a \n     simple majority was sufficient to pass a bill. The Federalist \n     Papers strongly support this view. According to Hamilton, the \n     vice president was given the tie-breaking vote in the Senate \n     ``to secure at all times the possibility of a definitive \n     resolution of that body.'' (Federalist No. 68.) There is no \n     logical reason why the Framers would have thought differently \n     about the House. And a ``definitive resolution'' of the House \n     could not be ``secured'' under the proposed three-fifths \n     rule.\n       Proponents of a super-majority requirement will make two \n     points in rebuttal. One is to say that they are following a \n     precedent of Senate Rule XXII, which has long required super-\n     majority votes to close debate and proceed to a vote on a \n     bill or an amendment of a Senate rule. As I have argued on a \n     previous occasion, Rule XXII itself is constitutionally \n     suspect. But even if Rule XXII passed constitutional muster, \n     that would not save the proposed House rule. It applies to \n     the up-or-down vote on a bill, while Senate Rule XXII, as its \n     defenders take pains to point out, applies only to a \n     procedural motion to close debate on a bill. Here is arch-\n     defender George Will, writing on this page in April 1993:\n       ``The Constitution provides only that, other than in the \n     five cases, a simple majority vote shall decide the \n     disposition by each house of business that has consequences \n     beyond each house, such as passing legislation or confirming \n     executive or judicial nominees.''\n       Will Newt Gingrich flout George Will?\n       The proponents' second point will be that the Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings Act includes Senate and House rules changes that \n     require a super-majority to pass any bill that ``breaks'' a \n     budget law or resolution previously enacted. This provision \n     is also constitutionally suspect, but at least it lacks the \n     critical vice of making it impossible to enact any budget \n     resolution in the first place. This still requires only a \n     simple majority.\n       The biggest question of all is why a majority party with \n     230 of the 435 seats would want to adopt a super-majority \n     rule requiring 261 votes to pass a tax bill. Such a rule \n     could prevent the Republicans from passing a major tax bill \n     favored by a simple majority it could readily muster, even \n     though it might be unable to muster a super-majority of 261. \n     One is tempted to conclude that the present majority party \n     does not expect to keep its majority for very long.\n       The Republicans have also proposed an even more egregious \n     change in House Rule XXI, one that would prevent the House \n     from even considering any measure that would retroactively \n     increase tax rates, even if three-fifths of the members were \n     in favor. This would deprive the House, and therefore the \n     entire Congress, of its most fundamental express power under \n     the Constitution, the power to lay and collect revenues \n     including taxes on income. It would also have the effect of \n     overruling the numerous Supreme Court decisions upholding the \n     constitutionality of retroactive tax laws, subject only to a \n     due-process standard.\n       [[Page S2808]] Both of these proposed rules changes are so \n     manifestly unconstitutional that they should not be adopted. \n     If the Republicans use their majority to adopt them anyway, \n     the courts would have ample reason to set them aside.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Dec. 18, 1994]\n\n                The Three-Fifths Rule: A Dangerous Game\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Among many useful and well-designed reforms proposed by the \n     new Republican majority in the House, one suggested change \n     bespeaks neither confidence nor foresight. It is the proposal \n     that future income tax rate increases would require a three-\n     fifths vote for passage.\n       The purpose is plainly to make it harder for Congress to \n     boost taxes. Since revenue measures must originate in the \n     House of Representatives, the three-fifths, rule would hamper \n     future majorities in both the House and Senate from enacting \n     such measures.\n       Some question the constitutional propriety of such a rule. \n     Rep. David Skaggs (D-Colo.) has circulated a letter to his \n     colleagues arguing that ``the principle of majority rule has \n     governed this nation for over two centuries and is \n     fundamental to our democracy.'' Skaggs asserts that the \n     three-fifths rule is unconstitutional. Bruce Ackerman, a \n     professor of law and political science at Yale, has expressed \n     the same view in a New York Times op-ed article. Common Cause \n     and congressional scholar Norman Ornstein also have taken up \n     that side of the argument.\n       Others disagree, Rep. Jerry Solomon (R-N.Y.), who will be \n     the new chairman of the Rules Committee, argues that when the \n     Constitution says that ``each house [of Congress] may \n     determine the rules of its proceedings,'' the authority is \n     intentionally broad. Lawyers and experts inside congress and \n     out, to whom I put the question, say it would be difficult to \n     predict how the courts would regard such a rule--or even \n     whether they would accept jurisdiction if its \n     constitutionality were challenged.\n       The experts I consulted agree that there is no precedent \n     for Congress requiring a supermajority for final action on \n     any measure, except where specified by the Constitution. The \n     Constitution says it takes a two-thirds majority to override \n     a presidential veto, ratify a treaty, remove an official from \n     office, expel a representative or senator or propose an \n     amendment to the Constitution.\n       The other instances in which Congress itself has required \n     more than a majority for some action all involve procedural \n     matters. The House requires a two-thirds vote to suspend the \n     rules and pass a measure without delay; the Senate requires a \n     three-fifths vote to impose cloture or end debate. In the \n     last decade, budget resolutions have required a three-fifths \n     vote to override a point of order against any change that \n     would increase the deficit beyond the agreed-upon target for \n     the year. This is a procedural motion, but it clearly affects \n     the substance of economic policy decisions, and sponsors of \n     the new House rule claim it as a model for their proposal.\n       But abandoning the principle of majority rule on final \n     passage of a bill is not something the House should do \n     lightly--or rest on a questionable precedent. If the three-\n     fifths rule is intended as a safeguard against rash tax-\n     raising by this incoming Congress, it seems unnecessary. \n     Republicans will have a 25-seat majority in January and they \n     have promised tax cuts, not increases. The president has \n     joined them and so has the leader of House Democrats, Rep. \n     Richard Gephardt (Mo.). So where is the threat?\n       Fiddling with the rules always arouses suspicion. Two years \n     ago, when the majority Democrats changed the rules to allow \n     the delegates from the District of Columbia, American Samoa, \n     Guam and the Virgin Islands and the resident commissioner \n     from Puerto Rico (all Democrats) to vote on the House floor \n     on everything but final passage of bills, I said they were \n     tampering with the game. Such criticism forced the Democrats \n     to agree that there would be another vote--without the five \n     delegates--on any issue where their votes decided the \n     outcome. The federal courts upheld that version of their \n     rule, saying that the change the Democrats had made was \n     merely ``symbolic'' and essentially ``meaningless.''\n       That cannot be said of the proposed three-fifths rule. It \n     is consequential--and unprincipled. The Republicans \n     themselves juggled the wording to create loopholes for \n     shifting other tax rates by simple majority.\n       The precedent they will set is one they will come to \n     regret. If this Congress puts a rules roadblock around \n     changes in income rates, nothing will prevent future \n     Congresses with different majorities from erecting similar \n     barriers to protect labor laws, civil rights laws, \n     environmental laws--or whatever else the party in power wants \n     to put off-limits for political purposes.\n       There is something fundamentally disquieting and even \n     dishonorable about the majority of the moment rewriting the \n     rules to allow a minority to control the House's \n     decisionmaking. You can easily imagine future campaigns in \n     which politicians will promise that if they gain power, they \n     will abolish majority rule on this issue or that--a whole new \n     venue for pandering to constituencies that can be mobilized \n     around a single issue.\n       This is a dangerous game the Republicans are beginning. And \n     it raises questions about their values. Let them answer this \n     question: Why should it be harder for Congress to raise taxes \n     than declare war? Does this proud new Republican majority \n     wish to say on its first day in office: We value money more \n     than lives?\n\n  Mr. PELL.

I rise today to \nexpress my support for Dr. Foster, and to urge my colleagues to give \nhim a full and fair hearing.\n  Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Foster, and I am \nvery impressed.\n  Dr. Foster is a physician with vast experience who has dedicated his \nlife to maternal and child health. He is a man who speaks from the \nheart, a person who cares deeply about the health of families across \nthis Nation.\n  Dr. Foster is one of the country's leading experts on preventing teen \npregnancy and drug abuse, as well as reducing infant mortality. He is a \npublic health professional with vision.\n  I urge my colleagues to meet with Dr. Foster, to talk with him, to \nask him tough questions. I have. I believe they too will be very \nimpressed.\n  Dr. Foster has tested his ideas about public health interventions \nthat can greatly benefit this Nation. He wants to continue his career-\nlong focus on maternal and child health, on adolescents, and the on \nprevention of teen pregnancy. He wants to fight AIDS, and combat the \nepidemic of violence that has taken hold across our Nation.\n  I also want to stress the importance and relevance of Dr. Foster's \npractice area. For far too long, women's health concerns have been \nneglected by this Nation. I am heartened that our next Surgeon General \ncan be a physician who has dedicated his life to women's health--an \nobstetrician/gynecologist.\n  Women's health is critical to every family--every man, woman, and \nchild--in this Nation. As a woman, and a mother with a son and \ndaughter, I find the selection of Dr. Foster reassuring. I urge my \ncolleagues to stop and think about the importance of women's health to \nfamilies everywhere.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Labor Committee \nas they prepare hearings for Dr. foster. I believe when my colleagues \nand the American public get to know Dr. Foster, they will be as excited \nas I am to have him as our Nation's next Surgeon General. You, too, \nwill recognize his honesty, his passion, and his commitment to children \nand families.\n  I thank you and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2808-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2808-S2813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are now in our 14th day of debate. I was \nvery interested in the chart of the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, ``Statutes Don't Work.''\n  I hear people on the other side constantly saying we ought to just do \nit; we ought to just balance the budget; we ought to have the guts to \ndo it. Almost invariably they are the people who are the biggest \nspenders around here. Almost invariably.\n  It is the biggest joke on Earth, after 26 straight years of not \nbalancing the budget, to have these people tell us, we just have to do \nit ourselves. That is the biggest joke around here to everybody who \nknows anything about budgetary policy in the Federal Government.\n  Do not think the people are stupid out there. They know what is going \non. They know doggone well that if we do not have this balanced budget \namendment, we will never get fiscal control of this country, we will \nnever make priority choices among competing programs, and we will just \nkeep spending and taxing like never before.\n  [[Page S2809]] I have heard Senators on the other side of this issue, \nand some who even support us, beat their breast on how they voted for \nthat large tax increase last year, and that deficit spending thing they \ndid. Anytime you increase taxes, if you can hold on to spending at all, \nyou are going to bring down the budget deficit. The problem is that at \nbest, their approach starts up dramatically in 1996 and really \ndramatically at the turn of the century to a $400 billion annual \ndeficit.\n  These people are always saying we just have to do it. They are the \nsame people who say we could do it with the Budget and Accounting Act \nof 1921, the Revenue Act of 1964, the Revenue Act of 1968, Humphrey-\nHawkins in 1978, the Byrd amendment in 1978. I was here for most of \nthose. From 1978 on, I was certainly here, and I have to tell you, I \nvoted for that Byrd amendment and I was really thrilled. Here is the \nU.S. Senate, this august body of people who mean so much to this \ncountry, voting to say that in 1980, we are going to balance this \nbudget.\n  Back then, we probably could have if we had really gotten serious \nabout it. But it was almost the next bill that came up that a 51 \npercent majority vote changed that. The distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire really makes a great point here.\n  The debt limit increase, why, I was here for that, too. We promised, \n``Boy, we're going to balance the budget.''\n  The Bretton Woods agreement; again, Byrd II; recodification of title \n31; Byrd III; Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, I remember what a fight that was \nto get that through. My gosh, at last we are going to do something for \nthis country; we are going to get spending under control; we are going \nto help our country. It helped a little bit, darn little.\n  We had to go to Gramm-Rudman-Hollings II, II because the little it \ndid help was just too much for these people around here, just too much \nfor these budget balancers who say we simply ought to do it.\n  Let me tell you, I am tired of saying we simply ought to do it. I \nheard it from the White House. What do we get from the White House? A \nbudget for the next 5 years that will put us over $6 trillion; that the \nannual deficits for the next 12 years are $190 billion a year plus.\n  Now tell me they mean business. No way in this world. This game is \nup. Those who vote for this are people who are serious about doing \nsomething for our country, about getting spending and taxing policies \nunder control. I said spending and taxing. We are not just worried \nabout spending, we are worried about these people who think the last \nanswer to everything is to tax the American people more. And anybody \nwho thinks that last tax policy was just the upper 2 percent, they just \nhave not looked at what they have done. They even taxed Social \nSecurity.\n  People just do not realize because sometimes the big lie is told \naround here so much that people cannot figure out what is going on. \nThat is why baseball is the No. 1 issue in this country right now. I \nhappen to know. I happen to be in the middle of that one, too. But I \nhave to tell you, as important as baseball is, it is not a fly, a flea \non the backside of an elephant compared to what this problem is.\n  When we went to Gramm-Rudman-Hollings II, that did not work, either. \nIt was a simple statute that we just amended and amended.\n  We have done some things here. There are some heroes here to me on \nboth sides of the floor who are trying to do their best. I do not mean \nto find any fault with any individual Senator. We all have our \nproblems. But, by gosh, the point I am making is, we are not going to \ndo it unless we have a fiscal mechanism in the Constitution that \nrequires us to at least make priority choices among competing programs \nbefore we spend this country into bankruptcy. That is what this \namendment will do. This chart is a beautiful illustration of why \nstatutes do not work.\n They may work for a short period of time, but sooner or later we are \ngoing to spend us just blind again.\n\n  In fact, there are those who worry even if we put the balanced budget \ninto the Constitution, there will be some in this body and certainly \nsome in the other who will try to find every excuse they can to get \naround it.\n  That is fine. But they are going to have a rough time because a lot \nof us are going to be here to make sure that there are no ways of \ngetting around it; that we have to face the problems of this country. \nAnd right now I have to say we are not facing them. As much as people \nfeel they are, we are not. We are with $200 billion deficits ad \ninfinitum, well into the next century, and we are selling our kids into \nbankruptcy. It just makes me sick.\n  Elaine and I have six children and 15 grandchildren--the 15th is on \nits way, but I count that child as if it has been born. It is only a \nmonth or so away--15 grandchildren. The fact of the matter is every one \nof those kids is going to be saddled with irresponsible debt because we \nkeep fiddling while Rome is burning. Our balanced budget tracker poster \nsure shows that. We are now up to $15 billion in increased debt just in \nthe 18 days we have been on this amendment--18 days.\n  We have runaway spending in this country. We have a destructive \nwelfare system that is tearing the fabric of our country apart, our \nfamilies apart, that encourages immorality and promiscuity and children \nborn out of wedlock to the point where today in this country in some \ncities there are more children born out of wedlock than there are in. \nAs a matter of fact, in some cities in this country there are more kids \naborted than there are kids that are born. And you wonder why we are \nlosing our moral fiber? You wonder why this country has problems?\n  We have a Tax Code that does not work. Everybody knows it. We all \nfeel picked on. Most people in this country hate the IRS. Those are \nloyal, dedicated public servants just trying to enforce what is a \nridiculous set of incomprehensible, massive laws. We can make it \nsimpler. We could put a lot of the tax lawyers out of business and a \nlot of the tax accountants out of business and get more revenues in the \nprocess because people would feel more like paying them because they \nwould be treated fairly.\n  However, we will not do it because we do not have a fiscal mechanism \nin the Constitution that requires us to do it, or at least point us in \nthe right direction.\n  This Washington bureaucracy has grown every year. I get a kick out of \nsome saying how much they are going to cut it back. It just goes on and \non at tremendous cost, to the point where welfare in this country, by \nthe time we get our tax dollars set aside for welfare to the people who \nneed them, you have 28 percent of the dollar left, 28 cents on a dollar \nbecause it is eaten up right here in the bureaucracy because we will \nnot do anything about it. We have these people standing around saying \nwe will do it; we have the guts to do it. And invariably they are the \nvery same people who are against this amendment. They do not want to do \nit.\n  Oh, I should not be so harsh. There are some who really do want to do \nit, but they just do not have the capacity to do it, and I think we all \nknow who they are. We have to get Washington put together. We have to \nrestore the American dream and give our kids a chance. We have to give \nour grandchildren a chance.\n  If there is any big, bloated, amorphous mass I would like to put on a \ndiet, it would be this Federal budget, and I think we would all be \nbetter off. We would have more money with which we would be able to do \nmore things. We could expand businesses, have more jobs, actually have \nmore revenues if we just got incentives restored again.\n  I said early in the debate that the Federal Government could really \nstand being anorexic for a while. It would probably do this country \ngood. We could cut the fat, cut the waste, get rid of a lot of things \nthat really do not work, and reform and improve those things that do.\n  Now, if people do not think I know what I am talking about, when I \nbecame chairman of the Labor Committee back in 1981, the youngest \ncommittee chairman in the history of a major committee, my ranking \nmember was none other than Ted Kennedy, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, with six other very liberal Senators. So there were \nseven liberals on the Democrat side. We had seven conservatives on my \nside, plus two liberal Republicans whose hearts, in many ways, were \nwith the liberal Democrats on the committee.\n  [[Page S2810]] But we were challenged to cut back on the most liberal \ncommittee in the Senate's jurisdiction, the most liberal committee in \nthe Senate. We were challenged to cut back on spending. We went to \nwork. We block granted in part six of the seven block grants. We worked \nto refine and reform the thousands of programs that they had in that \ncommittee. We cut that committee's multibillions of dollars of \nbudgetary jurisdiction by 25 percent in real terms over the 6 years I \nwas chairman, with all of those liberals on the committee. And I have \nto give Senator Kennedy and others a lot of credit for helping us to do \nit. They were willing to work with us. They knew we had the majority \nand they were fair. But we cut that jurisdiction 25 percent in real \nterms over those 6 years. And if every other committee in the Congress \nhad done that, we would have had a $150 billion surplus by the end of \nthose 6 years.\n  So I know what I am talking about. It can be done. And do you know \nwhat else? Even though we cut the jurisdiction 25 percent in real \nterms, because we went to work and reformed the system, reformed those \nthousands of programs, we actually got more money to more people in \nbetter ways than ever before. You cannot tell me we could not do with a \ngood haircut of the Federal Government today in all of these programs.\n  Almost all of them are well intentioned, almost all of them are well \nmeaning. The fact of the matter is that we are unwilling to do what \nneeds to be done, and the reason we are is not because we are awful \npeople or we are not good people or that it is just Democrats or just \nRepublicans. It is both of us. Frankly, it is because we do not have a \nfiscal mechanism that encourages us to do it.\n  Now, this balanced budget amendment is that fiscal mechanism. It is \nnot perfect. I have said it is not. There is nothing that is perfect in \nthe eyes of all 535 Members of Congress. There is no way you can do \nthat. But it is as perfect as we can get--worked on for a decade or \nmore, about 14 years, by Democrats and Republicans. I know; I have been \nright in the middle of those negotiations every step of the way. And \nnobody in particular should be able to take complete credit for it or \nblame for it.\n  Mr. President, I have to tell you something. It is the hope of \nmillions out there in America, a high percentage of people who may be \nwith the balanced budget amendment and we can get this mess under \ncontrol.\n  I just hope with everything I have that we can get those 15 Democrats \nthat we need to vote with us--15 out of 47. That is all we need. Go \nahead, 32 of you vote against it, but 15 of you we need to pass this \nbalanced budget amendment. That is all; 52 out of 53 Republicans are \ngoing to vote for this. That is really something. I think we will get \nthose 15, and we may even get more. I am going to do everything in my \npower to see that we do so that we have to face the music, so that we \nhave to face reality, so that we have to understand more than ever \nbefore it is time to quit selling the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren down the drain. I want them to have at least close to the \nopportunities that our generation had when we were coming up and not \nborn in poverty. I just want them to have the same chance.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from New Mexico is here. I did not \nmean to take so much time. I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BENNETT). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday about my concerns \nregarding the context in which we find ourselves debating the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget this year. I would like \nto take a few minutes of the Senate's time to elaborate on those \nconcerns and to announce how I will vote when this matter comes to a \nvote, finally, next week.\n  Mr. President, during the time I have served here in the Senate, from \nJanuary 1983 until the present, one of the great shortcomings in our \nnational policy has been our failure to pursue sound fiscal policy. \nDuring the 1980's and continuing now into the 1990's the Federal \nGovernment, each year, has operated substantially in deficit.\n  During the last 12 years there have been several serious efforts to \ndeal with that problem and I have supported each of those. The deficit \nreduction efforts in 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1993 have all had my \nsupport. Those were deficit reduction efforts under President Reagan \nand President Bush, and now under President Clinton.\n  If another serious deficit reduction effort occurs, as I hope it will \nduring this term of my service in the Senate, I expect to support that \nas well. I share the goal of most Americans to reach a balanced budget \nat the earliest possible date.\n  But the question we have to answer is: Will the passage of this \namendment in the context it is presented today advance our prospects \nfor achieving sound and fair fiscal policy, or retard those prospects?\n  As I stated yesterday, the amendment comes to us in a very \npoliticized environment where many of its proponents clearly see the \namendment as a way to advance their political agenda of less taxation \nfor certain taxpayers.\n  In the much discussed Contract With America the Republican leadership \nin the House of Representatives promised to pass the balanced budget \namendment with a three-fifths supermajority requirement for any tax \nincrease. That supermajority requirement was not in fact included in \nthe amendment sent to the Senate by the House in the form of House \nJoint Resolution 1. However, those who put the Contract With America \ntogether have not abandoned their commitment.\n  There are troubling indications that the effort still goes forward \nnot only to reach a balanced budget, which we all support, but to reach \nit in a particular way, and to reach it in a way that shields certain \nAmericans from sharing equitably in that pain.\n  I discussed at length yesterday the House rule adopted before the \nbalanced budget amendment was sent to the Senate--which requires three-\nfifths supermajority vote to raise income tax rates and income tax \nrates alone.\n  Under the House rule other taxes can still be raised by a simple \nmajority--taxes that impact many of the people I represent most \nheavily--the working families of my State.\n  The gas tax, for example, the social security tax, various excise \ntaxes. In order for a bill to become law it must pass in both houses.\n  This House rule gives the minority in the House a veto over efforts \nby either house to use the income tax our most progressive tax to raise \nrevenues for deficit reduction.\n  This rule undermines genuine efforts at deficit reduction. The \npurpose of this rule is clearly to protect individuals and corporations \nin the upper tax brackets and to regain any increases in revenue to \noccur by increases in regressive taxes that affect middle income \nfamilies most directly.\n  I proposed yesterday to amend the proposed constitutional amendment \nto correct this problem--but unfortunately my amendment was defeated.\n  So with that defeat, we are faced with a proposed constitutional \namendment being presented while the House has in place a rule which \nmakes it clear that middle-income families will likely see their taxes \nraised to balance the budget--but unlike that wealthy individuals and \ncorporations will share in that sacrifice to the same extent.\n  A second troubling indication that the balanced budget amendment is \nseen by its proponents as a device to pursue a political agenda to \nadvantage certain groups in our society--is the commitment of the \nRepublican leadership in the House to bring the proposed constitutional \nprovillion four three-fifths supermajority requirement for tax \nincreases to the House floor for a vote prior to April 15 of next year.\n  And in fact yesterday there was a colloquy here on the Senate floor \nwhere the Senator from Utah agreed to proceed here in the Senate with \nhearings on a constitutional amendment imposing that same supermajority \nrequirement for tax increases.\n  So the context in which we are considering this amendment has changed \nfrom what it was in previous Congresses. We now are not just talking \nabout how to balance the budget, we are now talking about writing into \nthe constitution, provisions which will determine whose ox will be \ngored as we proceed to balance the budget. In this context and with \nthese ground rules in \n[[Page S2811]] place the people whose ox will be gored are the working \npeople--those who pay the most gas taxes, the social security taxes, \nand those who pay excise taxes.\n  What are the consequences that would flow from the balanced budget \namendment in this new environment with this new change in the House \nrules.\n  I believe we can predict 3 consequences from proceeding with the \namendment given percent ground- works.\n  First, with a three-fifths super- majority requirement in \nplace to raise income taxes it will be much more difficult for us to \nreach the goal of a balanced budget by 2002. As I stated yesterday, \nalmost all the experts who have looked at the issue seriously agree \nthat a balanced budget will only be reached as other deficit reduction \nefforts have been achieved, with a combination of spending cuts and \nrevenue increases. And with this provision in place those revenue \nincreases will come from regressive taxes, rather than from the only \nprogressive tax we have, the income tax.\n  Second, if we do take steps to reach a balanced budget, with that \nsupermajority for income tax increases in place, most of the burden of \ndeficit reduction will fall on working families who can least afford to \ncarry that additional burden.\n  And the third consequence is that States like my home State of New \nMexico with relatively low per capita income will be those most badly \nhurt.\n  At this very time our State legislature in Santa Fe is struggling \nwith the question of a gasoline tax. A balanced budget amendment \nadopted, with the House Rule in effect protecting incomes taxes from \nchange, almost certainly insures that we in Washington will be adding \nsubstantially to the gas tax as one of the only available sources of \nrevenue. The same can be said of Social Security taxes and other \nregressive taxes.\n  Mr. President, if I represented a wealthy State with many high income \ntaxpayers, I could see an argument for why I should vote for the \namendment--in spite of the House rule. But my State is not wealthy and \nwe have very few taxpayers who will be treated fairly under this new \nset of ground rules.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President when the final vote is called on the balanced budget \namendment next week I will vote ``no.''\n  I will do so because I believe we should leave the question of how to \nachieve sound fiscal policy to a vote of a majority here in Congress at \nany particular time. We should not try, by rule or other provision, to \ndetermine how future Congresses choose to reduce the deficit: We should \nnot dictate whether they cut spending or raise taxes. We should not try \nto predetermine for future Congresses which group of taxpayers will pay \nthe taxes and which group will suffer the spending cuts.\n  The Framers of the Constitution were wise to limit the use of the \nsupermajority requirement in the Constitution. They chose to leave the \nConstitution neutral as to how we accomplish sound fiscal policy at any \nparticular time in our history. We are well advised to defer to their \ngood judgment on that subject, to cease our efforts to solve this \nproblem by changing the Constitution, and, instead, to solve it as all \nprevious generations have, by demonstrating the political courage to \nmake unpopular decisions about spending cuts and taxes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Dorgan addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his quorum call \nrequest?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I withhold.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senate is near the \ncompletion of its business today. I will not take a great length of \ntime, I was intending to offer today an amendment but I was intending \nto offer an amendment today and now obviously I intend to offer an \namendment when we reconvene, whenever that might be, on this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I spoke the other day on the floor of my concern about the process by \nwhich we are selecting a new Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I made it clear when I spoke that it is not my intent to \ntarnish the image of the person who apparently has been advanced as the \none to be selected. I do not know the person. I do not have a judgment \nabout the person's qualifications because I have not met with that \nperson. But I certainly have a judgment about the way this process has \nworked and I am concerned about it, and sufficiently concerned that I \nwant the Congress to be able to evaluate this appointment in a more \nconsidered way.\n  This is not just the usual appointment. It is not just a run-of-the-\nmill appointment. The head of the Congressional Budget Office, in \neffect, becomes the referee on a wide range of budget questions and on \na wide range of scoring issues. As all of us know, how a proposal is \nscored can have an enormous impact on whether or not that proposal \nmeets with favor or disfavor in the U.S. Senate. For example, one might \nsay, ``I have a certain budget proposal that recommends certain \nthings.'' And CBO says, ``Well, we would score that in a dynamic way, \nor a static way.'' You would reach very different results perhaps. So \nyou develop scoring rules, and how you select the people to perform \nthese duties is very, very important.\n  I can remember in 1981, the first year I served in the Congress, in \nwhich we had some very dynamic scoring by the Office of Management and \nBudget. David Stockman, a fresh, new face, was selected to head the \nOffice of Management and Budget. They came up with a strategy that \nsaid, ``Well, if we do the following things, we will produce enormous \nnew revenue, and we will balance the budget by 1984.'' He subsequently \nwrote a book after he left the Government that said none of that was \nrealistic and it was a horrible mistake. I have sometimes used quotes \nfrom his book because he gave an interesting insight into what the \nmindset was when they were using these dynamic scoring approaches to \ncome up with these results. It seemed wildly unrealistic at the time \nanyway. But, nonetheless, dynamic scoring was used to justify a new \nfiscal policy.\n  The point is we have been through periods where people have developed \nnew scoring approaches, new devices, that have been unrealistic and \nhave caused this country great problems and left us with significant \ndebt and deficits. Especially given this constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget and the vigorous battles that will occur, I am sure, \nover budget resolutions that come before the Senate, our referee, the \nCongressional Budget Office, must be led by someone who commands \nuniversal respect, someone whose methods do not lead to questions about \njudgment.\n  Again, I do not know the circumstances of the person who has \napparently been tapped to be the new Director of the CBO. So I do not \nknow whether that person meets this test. But I do know this: We have \nhad people who have led the Congressional Budget Office--Alice Rivlin, \nRudy Penner, Bob Reischauer--all of whom, Members of the Senate would \nalmost universally say, are people at the top of their field whose \nimpartiality allows them to call them as they see them. These previous \nDirectors have, I think, received nearly universal respect and support.\n  The selection of these three Directors was generally a process in \nwhich the two parties together make a judgment. In fact, I am told--I \nwill not recite the chapter and verse on this, I will do that later--\nthat previously the minority had difficulty with several candidates, \nand really, said, ``Well, this is not acceptable to us.'' And that just \nmeant that candidate did not go forward. That was the way it was \nbecause there was a need to develop a consensus on a candidate.\n  I am told that this process on this candidate resulted in an \nannouncement in the House of Representatives, of who the appointee \nwould be, prior to the ranking minority member in the House Budget \nCommittee ever meeting the person. That is not a process, it seems to \nme, that is consultative. That is not a process in which both sides \nhave come together to jointly figure out who has the stature and the \nability and the authority to do this job.\n  So I am concerned about the process. I do not think this is the right \nprocess. I really think with the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, there ought to be a resolution of approval by both the House \nand the Senate. I know \n[[Page S2812]] that is not the current circumstance. But I intend to \noffer an amendment that would require that. I hope very much that at \nthis juncture the majority would not appoint a Director at this point \nuntil I have had an opportunity to offer the resolution. I probably \nwill offer it and discuss it on this amendment, although it would be \nbetter to offer it to the very next bill that comes to the floor of the \nSenate after the balanced budget amendment.\n  But I, as others, am concerned and want to speak on it. I want to \nmake a case about the process. My case is not a case that says this \nperson is the wrong person. I do not know. But I know that whoever \nheads CBO is going to have an impact on my legislative life and an \nimpact on the legislative life of everyone in this body and in the \nHouse. And I would like very much for the selection of the new head of \nthe CBO to be a selection that represents a consensus between the \nmajority and the minority; a consensus on two points:\n  First, that this person is someone of great quality, who is at the \ntop of the field and has the credentials to command respect;\n  And, second, that this person is someone who will provide an \nimpartial analysis of the type that we have been used to.\n  I must admit that I, like probably the Senator in the chair, have \nfrom time to time had to hold my brow as I received something from CBO. \nI have said, ``Lord, I do not agree with that. That is not the answer I \nwas looking for.'' But I respect Mr. Reischauer. I respect Mr. Penner. \nI respect Alice Rivlin. I do not know the current candidate. And I am \nnot making judgments here. But I am making judgments about the process. \nThis process is wrong. It is a flawed process when we have \ncircumstances where the appointment is announced prior to the minority \nranking member even being able to discuss particulars with the \ncandidate.\n  I am not going to talk about the process on the Senate side. But I do \nknow that the minority on the Senate side of the Budget Committee sent \na letter saying we think we should look further for other candidates. \nSo they obviously were making some kind of a judgment. I think that we \nought not proceed until we have responded to this as a body. I hope \nvery much that prior to my offering the amendment when we return, that \nthe majority will not proceed to make this appointment.\n  Again, let me emphasize for the third time as I take the floor that I \ndo not intend to make a judgment about this candidate at this point. I \nmay at some point. But I do not know enough to make a judgment. I know \nwhat I have read in the papers. I have been in politics long enough to \nunderstand that that is not enough. I want to understand the facts. I \nwant to understand the circumstances and the quality of this candidate. \nBut I also want to understand that when we finish this process the \nselection of this very important person will be a selection by \nconsensus among the majority and minority of the House and the Senate. \nI do not think that is the case today.\n  So, I had intended to offer this amendment today and because other \namendments took most of the day, this will be put over until next week, \nor whenever we return--I guess the first legislative day when we \nreturn. But I wanted to take the floor at this moment to alert my \ncolleagues that I intend to do this, and to urge the majority not to \nproceed until we have had a chance to express ourselves on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Senate's indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to talk as we end this \nthird week of debate on the balanced budget amendment about the \nimportance of this vote and what it really means to America.\n  I have listened for the last 3 weeks to the debate, and I want to say \nthat I think we are in a filibuster. I think there can be no doubt of \nit. Our leader has been patient. Senator Dole wanted everyone to have \nan opportunity to have his or her say to talk about the issue, because \nit is a major issue. It is probably the most important vote I will ever \nmake in my career.\n  I think the leader has given ample time for every person to talk \nabout views, to differ on views, and to put in amendments. I think \nSenator Hatch and Senator Craig, who are the distinguished managers of \nthis joint resolution, have been very patient. But this is a \nfilibuster, and there is a fundamental difference about whether we \nshould move forward with the mandate that we have to change the things \nwe have been doing in Washington, or whether we are in fact doing what \nwe have been doing year after year after year in this Congress--that \nis, spending beyond our means. That is what has been happening.\n  We are at the end of the third week of debate. All of us who support \nthe balanced budget amendment thought we would be finished, thought we \nwould leave town for a 3-day recess knowing that we had done the most \nimportant thing we could do for the future of our children and \ngrandchildren. But we are not there yet. We are not there because there \nis a fundamental difference and because many who disagree with the \nbalanced budget amendment have decided to delay it through filibuster.\n  I support the right of everyone to delay. That is part of the Senate \nrules. But I think it is time to call it what it is. I think it is time \nthat people realize this is a delaying tactic, that we are no longer \ninto substantive differences--and reasonable people can differ--we are \ninto trying to delay what clearly the majority of this body wants to \ndo, and that is to say that we are going to amend this Constitution and \nsay to future generations: You are not going to have to pay our bills.\n  Every baby that is born into this country has an $18,000 debt to pay. \nThat is what we have racked up with our over $4 trillion of debt. Some \npeople say, ``Let us do it by statutes. We can pass laws, we can act \nresponsibly.'' And, of course, we point out that over the last 30-plus \nyears we, in fact, have not been able to do that. So if you put the \npractical experience in the mix, it is clear that we are not going to \ndo it by statute.\n  But let us talk about what is the role of the Constitution of our \ncountry. The Constitution of our country should not be something that \nwe can do by statute. It should be the framework of our Government. It \nshould be what we think the parameters of our Government should be, not \nfor the 104th Congress, but for all the Congresses in the future--\nsomething that is so well settled in our policies that it should not be \nsubject to change. That is what we are debating, whether we will amend \nour Constitution with a fundamental policy decision that should not be \nchanged by future generations.\n  Mr. President, that is what a balanced budget amendment is, and it \ndoes meet the test. It should be a fundamental policy of this country \nthat we will not spend money we do not have, unless we are in a crisis, \nin a war, and that is the exception--the one exception--that all of us \nwould agree to. Other than that, we are not going to spend money we do \nnot have for programs that we would like, for programs that are good \nprograms, but programs we do not have the money to pay for.\n  It comes down to the fundamentals that every State, every city, every \nbusiness, and every household in America understands, and that is: I \nwould like to take my family to dinner tonight, but maybe I do not have \nthe money to do it and I have to make that decision based on whether I \nhave the discretionary money to do it. I would like to send my child to \ncollege. Do I have the funds to do it? I would like to have many things \nthat, perhaps, I cannot afford and therefore I do not acquire. That is \na fundamental decision that every American makes every day. The only \nAmerican institution that really does not is the United States \nGovernment. That is a fundamental policy that we must put in place that \nshould not change with the wind or the times--that is, that my \npriorities are more important than the priorities of future Congresses.\n  I think it is very important, as we leave today for this recess, that \nthe people of America understand that this is a filibuster. The people \nwho are doing it have the perfect right to do it, but they are delaying \nthis vote; they are delaying what I think the people of America want, \nwhat they have said repeatedly they want, and that is for us \n[[Page S2813]] to start the very tough process of balancing our budget \nover the next 7 years, so that by the year 2002, if we start right now, \nwe will be able to then begin the adventure of being able to pay back \nthe $4 trillion debt, so that we will not be in that continuing deficit \nposition.\n  In fact, I think that if we do not act on this in the next week when \nwe get back, it is not that it will pass in time and we will not pass \nit ever again. I disagree with people that say this is our only chance. \nI think if we do not pass it this time, we will have a bigger mandate \nin 1996 and we will pass it. The difference will be, Mr. President, \nthat we will have two more years of accumulating debt, and we have seen \nthe charts for the last week showing every day that we have been \ndebating and talking and talking in the Senate debating society, the \ndebt has gone up because we have not begun to turn that ship on a \ndifferent course.\n  So if we do not do it this year, we will do it 2 years from now, 3 \nyears from now, because we will have the mandate. But we will have \nmissed 2 years of opportunity to begin this process of responsibility \nfor our future generations. That is what we will miss if we fail to do \nso.\n  So as we leave these hallowed halls, I hope all of us will think \ncarefully about the monumental decision that we will make next week to \nstop this filibuster, to stop the delays, to stop the nuance \ndifferences and say that we are going to take this first step of \namending the greatest Constitution that has ever been written in any \nsociety in all of civilization; that we are going to amend it with a \nfundamental policy decision of responsible spending, to protect our \nfuture generations from our decisions, which may not be theirs.\n  So it is a great opportunity for us, and I hope all of us will go \nhome and come back next week ready to make the decision that is ours to \nmake, to change the course of this country and begin the process of \nresponsible governing.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded, and I be allowed to speak out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, and my colleagues, I would think that if \nany government is presented with evidence that their country is under a \nnational security threat that they would institute immediately a full-\nscale investigation to determine what the threat is and what action is \nneeded to prevent that threat from becoming an all-out emergency, or a \nconflict that we could not ultimately solve. That is the purpose of \ngovernment. Ultimately to protect the security of the citizens of our \ncountry.\n  Therefore, when I read a release that I received today from the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce which clearly states that they have made a \nfinding that growing U.S. reliance on oil imports threatens the \nnational security of the United States by making it vulnerable to \ninterruptions in foreign oil supplies, I would immediately gather all \nof my advisers around me and say, ``All right, what are we going to do \nabout this?''\n  I am deeply disturbed that as I read the release and talk to people \nwho know about this problem and find that, essentially, nothing is \nbeing done. I think we as a nation are making a terrible mistake.\n  Let me try and point out what I think the problem is in a very clear \nfashion. If we in this Nation were suddenly told that we are now \nimporting 50 percent of all of the food that we consume in this \ncountry, and much of it from nations that are very undependable as far \nas being allies of the United States, I would predict that the next day \nthere would be lines of people surrounding the White House and \nsurrounding this Capitol saying, ``My goodness, this is a terrible \nthreat that we are now having to import half of the food that we \nconsume from countries that are not dependable as allies of the United \nStates.''\n  Yet this is exactly what is happening when it comes to energy \nsecurity. I will tell Members how this came about, Mr. President. That \nis, that the Department of Commerce, under existing rules and \nregulations, were responding to a petition that was filed by the \nIndependent Petroleum Association of America that was filed on March \n11, 1994, alleging that ``Increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil \nthreatened the national security of the United States.''\n  They pointed out in their request that imports of crude oil products \nwere estimated through 1994 to average 8.8 million barrels of foreign \noil coming into the United States every day. This represents a 200,000-\nbarrel-a-day increase compared to 8.6 million barrels a day in 1993.\n  The estimated import ratio has now, for the first time ever, broken \nthe ``peril point level'' of 50 percent of foreign imports coming into \nthis country.\n  There is no dispute about that fact. The IPAA presented information. \nNo one objected to that. The Commerce Department finds, after looking \nat all this information, clearly that U.S. reliance on oil imports now \nthreatens national security by making us vulnerable to interruptions in \nforeign oil supplies.\n  The Commerce Department recommended, however, that the President not \nuse his authority that he has under section 232 of the Trade Expansion \nAct of 1962 to adjust these foreign oil imports through the imposition \nof tariffs, because the economic costs of such a move outweigh the \npotential benefits and because current administration energy policies \nwill limit the growth of imports.\n  Mr. President, I disagree with that, and I disagree with it strongly. \nI think current administration energy policies in this administration, \nin the last administration and in the administration before that, in \nRepublican administrations and in Democratic administrations, have \nclearly allowed us to get to the point where today we are importing \nhalf of the oil that we use in this country.\n  I guess it has been an easy thing for administrations to do because \nwe have been getting cheap oil, but does anybody remember what happened \nin the early 1970's when we had lines of Americans sitting in their \ncars waiting to buy the precious gas that was left at the stations to \nrun their cars and run this country? Because at that time, the Middle \nEastern oil suppliers turned the faucets off just a little bit and \nliterally brought this country to our knees, because at that time, we \nwere importing about 30 percent of the oil we use.\n  Today, we are importing 50 percent, and just turning that faucet a \nlittle bit in 1995 will bring this country to our knees in a much more \nserious fashion than we were brought to our knees in 1973.\n  Unfortunately, it seems that all the administrations since then did \nnot learn the lesson, and the lesson is very simple: That we should \nnever be dependent on something that is important to our national \nsecurity; we should never be dependent on other nations to supply it, \nparticularly nations that are not necessarily our friends nor our \nallies, that we cannot trust to be reliable when we have a need for a \nproduct that they have, whether it be food, as I mentioned earlier, or \nwhether it be energy to run our plants, our factories, to heat our \nhomes, to cool our homes in the summer, to run our cars, to run our \ntrucks, to keep up with the commerce demands of a great Nation.\n  Yet today, for all of those needs, we are now dependent on foreign \nnations for over half of those energy needs. And the thing that bothers \nme the most is that after recognizing that there is a national security \nthreat--and these are not my words, these are the words of the Commerce \nDepartment when they made the findings--that the situation today \npresents a national security threat to the United States but we are not \ngoing to do anything in terms of setting a tariff to try and reduce the \namount of imports coming in in order to encourage greater domestic \nexploration and production right here in this country.\n  I think that that is something that is not acceptable, because there \nare some things that we can do. I do not suggest that maybe oil import \ntariffs are the only answer. I have advocated them for \n[[Page S2814]] a number of years. But there are a lot of other things \nthat they could have said we are going to recommend that needs to be \ndone, other than just saying we are going to rely on current policy. \nBecause, folks, it is clear that current policy has us in the \npredicament we are in. Current policy has allowed us to have imports \nincrease up to the point where they now constitute 50 percent of all \nthe energy we have in this country.\n  Imports increased this year from last year by 200,000 barrels a day \nmore than the year before. That is under current policy. And to say \nthat we are going to continue to stay with current policy, there is no \ntrend line to suggest that is going to solve the problem. The trend \nline is that imports will continue to increase under current policy.\n  So I suggest to my friends in this administration that they take the \nCommerce Department's findings that there is a national security threat \nto make some recommendations on new things that should be done in order \nto prevent a national catastrophe from falling on this country.\n  I suggest that there are a number of things that I would have hoped \nthat the administration would have been able to say we are recommending \ninstead of maintaining the status quo.\n  First, they could have recommended that the administration will \nactively support what the industry calls geological and geophysical \nexpensing, which simply says that oil and gas operators in this country \nwould be able to expense the cost of exploring and producing a well, \nwhether that well is a dry well, a dry hole, which they can do now, or \nwhether it is a producing well. That would encourage a substantial \nincrease in domestic production in this country to reduce that 50 \npercent number to what would be a more acceptable number.\n  I look over the recommendations and that is not there.\n  They could have, second, suggested that we move toward and support \nOPRA 90 reform. OPRA is the Oil Pollution Act that this Congress passed \nin 1990, but the way it is being implemented is not the way this \nCongress intended it to be implemented, and legislation is necessary to \nclarify what we meant. Here is the simple problem:\n  Congress never intended when we passed that Oil Pollution Control Act \nthat onshore facilities would have to carry insurance of $150 million \nper well. We were talking about major offshore activity that had the \npotential to pollute if a catastrophic event occurred. We never \nintended that any facility onshore that may be very, very small, with \nonly very limited potential to cause any pollution, would also have to \nhave $150 million of liability insurance. But that is how our folks in \nthe bureaucracy have interpreted it.\n  An amendment, a legislative fix for this problem would allow \nindependent operators who produce oil onshore to do it in a fashion \nthat they could afford. We are going to run independents out of \nbusiness if we do not do something legislatively to fix this problem. \nThat would have been the second thing that could have been recommended \nand should have been recommended.\n  The third is to have recommended some type of broad-based royalty \nreform to encourage exploration and production in difficult areas where \nit is more expensive to find oil, where many times a day it costs more \nto explore than it would pay them if they found a producing well, \nbecause the price of oil per barrel, partly because of cheap foreign \nimports, is less than it costs to find that oil. Broad-based royalty \nrelief would have made a major impact on helping to increase domestic \nproduction. But there is no recommendation for that type of activity.\n  The fourth is to do something about the Alaska export ban on oil that \nis produced in Alaska. When Congress passed that law saying that oil \nthat is found in Alaska could never be exported outside the United \nStates, it probably made sense at that time. But it does not make sense \ntoday.\n  If oil from Alaska can be sold in other areas at a higher price, it \nwould give companies greater amounts of money to explore for and find \nadditional fields domestically in North America--in Alaska, in the gulf \ncoast area--which would increase the domestic production and thereby \nlower that 50 percent import figure that we have.\n  Mr. President, not one of those proposals, not one of those \ninitiatives is found in the Commerce Department's finding and \nrecommendation as to what should be done.\n  I will just close by saying that it is insufficient, in my opinion, \nfor a department of our Government to make a finding that there is a \nnational security threat to this Nation, which they have made, and then \nto say we are not going to recommend anything new to address that \nthreat. That is an abdication of responsibility. It is unacceptable. \nThis Member, and I know other Members, will take their finding and \noffer constructive suggestions to, in fact, address what is now clearly \nestablished as a national security threat to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be very brief so that colleagues \nwill know that we can end the day, especially the desk staff will know \nthat they can get home to their loved ones.\n  I did want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that yesterday \nin the Budget Committee, when Secretary Christopher was there, \ninadvertently a Republican staff document was attached to part of his \ntestimony and was handed out. I might say that it is a very interesting \ndocument. The document that has been prepared by the majority on the \nBudget Committee shows function 150, International Affairs. It is \nheadlined, ``Fiscal Year 1996 Balanced Budget Resolution.'' Down in the \ncorner it says, ``For Internal Purposes Only.'' But it was handed out \ninadvertently.\n  What I think is interesting about this document is it suggests that \nthe majority has a plan to move towards a balanced budget, and I \ncommend them for that. I hope they do have a plan. But I would say to \nmy colleagues that if they have a plan, then we should revisit the \nquestion of the right to know provision that we sought to add to the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  We sought to add a provision that called on the Republican majority \nto produce their plan on how they intended to balance the budget so \nthat the States could be advised of that before they had to vote to \nratify it, and so that our colleagues who are about to vote on a \nbalanced budget amendment could know what was the outline of the plan.\n  The Republican majority resisted that right-to-know effort by saying \nthey could not say what a long-term plan was because there were so many \nthings, it would be hard to determine and hard to project and hard to \nforecast. And yet we find in this document, which was released \ninadvertently, that at least with respect to one function of the budget \nthey do have a detailed plan, very specific as to what they have in \nmind; terminating a set of programs, reducing other programs in order \nto reduce the 150 function, which, of course, is the international \naffairs function.\n  This suggests at the very least that other functions for other areas \nhave a plan, something that is in the works, something that is \navailable, that could provide some guidance as to where the majority is \ngoing with respect to a plan to balance the budget over the next 7 \nyears.\n  I would just say to my colleagues that if in fact there are plans for \nother functional areas, as there clearly is for the international \naffairs section, we ought to have a chance to see it. We ought to have \na chance before we vote on a balanced budget amendment. The American \npeople ought to have a chance to see what the plan is.\n  What does the Republican majority have in mind for how they intend to \nbalance this budget? I think that would certainly influence some votes \nin this debate.\n  Let me just say that I am one Member who is undecided on the question \nof how I will vote on a balanced budget \n[[Page S2815]] amendment. I am not being coy. I am seriously undecided \nat this point. I want to see what is the final provision on which we \nwill vote.\n  Let me just add that I am absolutely convinced we must balance the \nbudget in the next 7 years. It is absolutely imperative that we do so. \nWhether we have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution or not, \nthis Senator believes we have to balance the budget because we have a \nwindow of opportunity here before the baby boomers retire, at which \ntime Government spending will skyrocket. And that will put enormous \npressure on the economy of this country.\n  So we have a chance here in the next 7 years to get our fiscal house \nin order. That must be done. But I have reservations about the elements \nof this constitutional amendment in terms of the provision that would \nprovide for looting the Social Security trust fund in order to balance \nthe operating budget, the involvement of courts. The last thing I wish \nto see happening is the Supreme Court of the United States writing the \nbudget of the United States. No judge was ever elected to do that.\n  I am also concerned about the lack of a capital budget. The vast \nmajority of States that have a balanced budget requirement provide for \na capital budget. You can pay for big investments over a period of \ntime. That is what State governments do. That is what we do in our own \npersonal lives. I know very few people who buy a house for cash. Most \npeople take out a mortgage.\n  So those are, I think, legitimate concerns. But beyond that, I think \nwe also have the question of how we do it. How do we balance the \nbudget? And if our Republican colleagues, in fact, have a plan, one \nthat they have not released and not revealed--and I think the fact that \nthey clearly have one with respect to one function of the budget \nsuggests they probably have it for other functions of the budget--that \nis something that could form the basis for an important discussion and \ndebate about how we accomplish a balanced budget.\n  Let me just conclude by saying I would very much like to see us \nstructure a means to require both sides to put down a plan to balance \nthis budget simultaneously.\n  What is going on is we have a bit of Alphonse and Gaston, the chicken \nand the egg; nobody wants to go first. And I am working on legislation \nnow that would require us, if the balanced budget amendment fails, to \nhave the budget committees of both Houses and the President put down a \nplan to balance the budget over the next 7 years and to lay it down by \nMay 1--have both sides be required to come to the table and lay down \ntheir plans to balance the budget. It is clear to me now the Republican \nmajority is working on such a plan. Perhaps they have one completed, at \nleast in preliminary outline. I think it would be very important for \nthat to be shared with our colleagues and with the rest of the country \nas we consider this very important matter of a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WILLIAM FULBRIGHT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was sworn in as a Member of this body on \nJanuary 7, as I recall, 1959, the 1,579th Member to have been elected \nor appointed to the Senate since its beginning on March 4, 1789. As of \ntoday, 1,826 men and women have borne the title of United States \nSenator. When I came to the Senate, some of the other Members were \nClinton P. Anderson of New Mexico, Styles Bridges of New Hampshire, \nPaul Douglas of Illinois, Allen Ellender of Louisiana, Hubert Humphrey \nof Minnesota, Lyndon Johnson of Texas, Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, \nRichard Russell of Georgia, Lister Hill of Alabama, George Aiken of \nVermont, Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois, Carl Hayden of Arizona, \nWayne Morse of Oregon, Harry Flood Byrd, Sr. of Virginia, Spessard \nHolland of Florida, Henry Jackson of Washington, John F. Kennedy of \nMassachusetts, William Langer of North Dakota, Robert Kerr of Oklahoma, \nand others, including J. William Fulbright of Arkansas.\n  All of these men have now passed from this earthly stage and gone on \nto their eternal reward. The last of these whom I have mentioned, Bill \nFulbright, died last week.\n  J. William Fulbright was born in Sumner, MO, on April 9, 1905, and \nmoved with his parents to Fayetteville, AR, the following year. He \nattended the public schools in Arkansas and graduated from the \nUniversity of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 1925; as a Rhodes Scholar \nfrom Oxford University, England, in 1928, and from the Law Department \nof George Washington University, here in Washington, DC, in 1934. He \nwas admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1934, and served as an \nattorney in the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, in \n1934-1935. He was an instructor in law at the George Washington \nUniversity in 1935, and he was a lecturer in law at the University of \nArkansas during the years 1936-1939. He served as President of the \nUniversity of Arkansas from 1939 to 1941. He was engaged in the \nnewspaper business, in the lumber business, in banking, and in farming, \nand was elected as a Democrat to the 78th Congress, where he served \nfrom January 3, 1943, to January 3, 1945. He was not a candidate for \nrenomination to the House, but was elected to the United States Senate \nin 1944, and re-elected in 1950, 1956, 1962, and in 1968, where he \nserved until his resignation on December 31, 1974. He was an \nunsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1974. He served on the \nCommittee on Banking and Currency in the Senate and on the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Bill Fulbright was an outstanding Senator. He served with many other \noutstanding Senators, some of whom I have named as having ended their \nsojourn in this early life, and there were other extraordinary men such \nas John Pastore of Rhode Island, Mike Mansfield of Montana, and Russell \nLong of Louisiana, all of whom are still among the living. But I have \ntaken the floor today to say that one by one, the old landmarks of our \npolitical life have passed away. One by one, the links which connect \nthe glorious past with the present have been sundered.\n\n     ``Passing away!\n     'Tis told by the leaf which chill autumn breeze,\n     Tears ruthlessly its hold from wind-shaken trees;\n     'Tis told by the dewdrop which sparkles at morn,\n     And when the noon cometh\n     'Tis gone, ever gone.''\n\n  It was my pleasure to serve with Senator Fulbright. I always held him \nin the highest esteem. He was a gentleman with great courage and \nunwavering patriotism, a wise and courageous statesman, affable in his \ntemperament, and regarded as one of the outstanding lawyers in the \nSenate and one of the best informed upon questions regarding \ninternational affairs. He was both morally and intellectually honest, \nsimple in his habits, and devoid of all hypocrisy and deceit. He never \nresorted to the tricks of a demagog to gain favor and, although he was \na partisan Democrat, he divested himself of partisanship when it came \nto serving the best interests of his country. Peace to his ashes!\n\n     The potentates on whom men gaze\n     When once their rule has reached its goal,\n     Die into darkness with their days.\n     But monarchs of the mind and soul,\n     With light unfailing, and unspent,\n     Illumine flame's firmament.\n\n  Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and other great Grecian and Roman \nphilosophers, by pure reason and logic arrived at the conclusion that \nthere is a creating, directing, and controlling divine power, and to a \nbelief in the immortality of the human soul. Throughout the ages, all \nraces and all peoples have instinctively so believed. It is the basis \nof all religions, be they heathen, Mohammedan, Hebrew, or Christian. It \nis believed by savage tribes and by semi-civilized and civilized \nnations, by those who believe in many gods and by those who believe in \none God. Agnostics and atheists are, and always have been, few in \nnumber. Does the spirit of man live after it has separated from the \nflesh? This is an age-old question. We are told in the Bible that when \nGod created man from the dust of the ground, ``He breathed into his \nnostrils \n[[Page S2816]] the breath of life, and man became a living soul.''\n  When the serpent tempted Eve, and induced her to eat of the forbidden \nfruit of the tree of knowledge, he said to her, ``ye shall not surely \ndie.''\n  Job asked the question, ``If a man die, shall he live again?'' Job \nlater answered the question by saying, ``Oh, that my words were written \nand engraved with an iron pen upon a ledge of rock forever, for I know \nthat my redeemer liveth and someday He shall stand upon the Earth; and \nthough after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I \nsee God; whom I shall see for myself and\n mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins''--meaning my \nheart, my kidneys, my bodily organs--``be consumed within me.''\n\n  Scientists cannot create matter or life. They can mould and develop \nboth, but they cannot call them into being. They are compelled to admit \nthe truth uttered by the English poet Samuel Roberts, when he said:\n\n     ``That very power that molds a tear\n     And bids it trickle from its source,\n     That power maintains the earth a sphere\n     And guides the planets in their course.''\n\n  That power is one of the laws--one of the immutable laws, the eternal \nlaws--of God, put into force at the creation of the universe. From the \nbeginning of recorded time to the present day, most scientists have \nbelieved in a divine creator. I have often asked physicians, ``Doctor, \nwith your knowledge of the marvelous intricacies of the human body and \nmind, do you believe that there is a God?'' Not one physician has ever \nanswered, ``No.'' Each has answered, readily and without hesitation, \n``Yes.'' Some may have doubted some of the tenets of the theology of \northodoxy, but they do not deny the existence of a creator. Science is \nthe handmaiden of true religion, and confirms our belief in the Creator \nand in immortality.\n\n     ``Whoever plants a seed beneath the sod\n     And waits to see it break away the clod\n     Believes in God.''\n\n  Mr. President, as Longfellow said, ``It is not all of life to live, \nnor all of death to die.'' Rather, as Longfellow says:\n\n     ``There is no death! What seems so is transition;\n     This life of mortal breath\n     Is but a suburb of the life Elysian,\n     Whose portal we call death.''\n\n  Mr. President, life is only a narrow isthmus between the boundless \noceans of two eternities. All of us who travel that narrow isthmus \ntoday, must one day board our little frail barque and hoist its white \nsails for the journey on that vast unknown sea where we shall sail \nalone into the boundless ocean of eternity, there to meet our Creator \nface to face in a land where the rose never withers and the rainbow \nnever fades. To that bourne, from which no traveller ever returns, J. \nWilliam Fulbright has now gone to be reunited with others who once trod \nthese marble halls, and whose voices once rang in this Chamber--voices \nin this earthly life that have now been forever stilled.

Madam President, I just have been advised of the \nrelease by the White House of the Department of Commerce's findings \nconcerning the question of our increased dependence on imported oil. \nToday in that report, our President reported to the Congress that, \nindeed, our growing dependence on imported oil is a threat to our \nnational security. However, it is rather disturbing to note that the \nPresident failed to propose any new action, direct or indirect, to \nalleviate this threat. It is the opinion of this Senator from Alaska \nthat such action is unprecedented and wholly unacceptable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the press release be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Feb. 16, 1995]\n\n                       Statement by the President\n\n       I am today concurring with the Department of Commerce's \n     finding that the nation's growing reliance on imports of \n     crude oil and refined petroleum products threaten the \n     nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to \n     oil supply interruptions. I also concur with the Department's \n     recommendation that the Administration continue its present \n     efforts to improve U.S. energy security, rather than to adopt \n     a specific import adjustment mechanism.\n       This action responds to a petition under Section 232 of the \n     Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which was filed by the \n     Independent Petroleum Association of America and others on \n     March 11, 1994. The Act gives the President the authority to \n     adjust imports if they are determined to pose a threat to \n     national security. The petitioners sought such action, \n     claiming that U.S. dependence on oil imports had grown since \n     the Commerce Department last studied the issue in response to \n     a similar, 1988 petition.\n       In conducting its study, the Department led an interagency \n     working group that included the Departments of Energy, \n     Interior, Defense, Labor, State, and Treasury, the Office of \n     Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, and \n     the U.S. Trade Representative. The Commerce Department also \n     held public hearings and invited public comment. Following \n     White House receipt of the Commerce Department's report, the \n     National Economic Council coordinated additional interagency \n     review.\n       As in the case of its earlier study, the Commerce \n     Department found that the potential costs to the national \n     security of an oil import adjustment, such as an import \n     tariff, outweigh the potential benefits. Instead, the \n     Department recommended that the Administration continue its \n     current policies, which are aimed at increasing the nation's \n     energy security through a series of energy supply enhancement \n     and conservation and efficiency measures designed to limit \n     the nation's dependence on imports. Those measures include:\n       Increased investment in energy efficiency.\n       Increased investment in alternative fuels.\n       Increased government investment in technology, to lower \n     costs and improve production of gas and oil and other energy \n     sources.\n       Expanded utilization of natural gas.\n       Increased government investment in renewable energy \n     sources.\n       Increased government regulatory efficiency.\n       Increased emphasis on free trade and U.S. exports.\n       Maintenance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n       Coordination of emergency cooperation measures.\n       Finally, led by the Department of Energy and the National \n     Economic Council, the Administration will continue its \n     efforts to develop additional cost-effective policies to \n     enhance domestic energy production and to revitalize the U.S. \n     petroleum industry.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, if we look at the specifics of the \nrecommendation, as indicated in the press release, the specific \nhighlights include increased investment in energy efficiency, certainly \na worthy and laudable goal; increased investment in alternative fuels, \nlikewise; increased Government investment in technology to lower costs \nand improve production \n[[Page S2817]] of gas and oil and other energy resources; expanded \nutilization of natural gas; increased Government investment in \nrenewable energy sources; increased Government regulatory efficiency; \nincreased emphasis on free trade and U.S. exports; maintenance of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve which, obviously, is there for emergencies; \nand coordination for emergency cooperation measures.\n  Notable by its absence is any mention of efforts to stimulate \ndomestic drilling and production in the United States. I find that \nextraordinary. I wonder just who is advising the President. I cannot \nbelieve that the President himself does not support domestic \nexploration, development, the creation of jobs. One of the bases of \nAmerica's industrial might has been our ability to produce energy \nsources, specifically oil and gas. But there is no mention of \nexploration for oil. There is no mention of stimulating exploration in \nthe Gulf of Mexico where a good portion of our current resources are \ncoming from.\n  As we go deeper out in the gulf and invest in new technology, it \nrequires greater engineering, greater risk, but, obviously, the \nindustry is willing to make those commitments and that investment. This \nis what we call deep-water drilling. It requires substantial capital \nand substantial incentives.\n  Furthermore, we have frontier areas where onshore there are no \npipelines, no infrastructure, and to encourage the industry to go in \nthose areas and explore, again, may require some concessions, some type \nof moratorium relative to the application of taxation.\n  None of these are mentioned, and I find that rather curious. We have \nthe overthrust belt; no mention of opening up areas for oil and gas \nexploration.\n  It is rather curious, and I guess it is appropriate, that I be a \nlittle sensitive on this because my State of Alaska has been supplying \nthis country with about 24 percent of the total crude oil that is \nproduced in the United States for the last 16 to 17 years. That area \nwhere most of that oil comes from is called Prudhoe Bay. It is a huge \ninvestment by three major international companies--Exxon, BP and ARCO. \nThey operate the fields. They produce about 1.6 million barrels of oil \nper day. That is down from approximately 2 million barrels a few years \nago. The field is declining. But the significance is, as it declines we \nare increasing our imports.\n  Where do our oil imports come from? Why, it comes from the Mideast. \nIt comes to our shores in foreign flag ships, manned by foreign crews. \nMany of the corporations that operate those ships are relatively alike \nin their corporate structure. Some suggest they are even shell \ncorporations.\n  It is interesting to look at our trade deficit, Madam President, of \nabout $167 billion. A good portion of that is Japan, a portion of it is \nChina, but almost half is the price of imported oil. So we are \nexporting our dollars, exporting our jobs and becoming more and more \ndependent on other parts of the world.\n  I find this trend relatively unnerving; that we should have to depend \nto such an extent on imported petroleum products and then recognize \nthat it is called to our attention by this special study done by the \nDepartment of Commerce that we have been waiting for an extended period \nof time to identify that, indeed, our national security interests are \nat stake.\n  I look at my State of Alaska with the potential to supply more oil as \nPrudhoe Bay declines, and it is rather ironic, Madam President, that on \nthis floor today was a bill to take the most promising area in North \nAmerica, namely ANWR, and put it in a permanent wilderness.\n  We have always had a difficult time trying to keep Alaska in \nperspective relative to its size and the type of development and the \ncontrol that our State as well as the Federal agencies have in \ndeveloping the resources from the North Slope and the Arctic. And as we \nreflect on that, the technology that developed Prudhoe Bay is now 20 to \n25 years old, but some new technology came along about 10 years ago and \nresulted in the development of a field called Endicott. Endicott was an \nexpansion of Prudhoe Bay in one sense, but the technology was entirely \nnew. It came on as a production facility, the tenth largest producing \nfield in the United States at about 107,000 barrels a day. Today it is \nthe seventh largest at about 120,000 barrels a day. But that \ntechnology, Madam President, resulted in a footprint of 56 acres. That \nis a pretty small area. That is the size of the footprint. But the \ncontribution to our energy security, our jobs, was significant.\n  The last area that has been identified by geologists as potentially \ncarrying the capability of a major discovery is ANWR, but what are the \nparameters of ANWR?\n  First of all, there are about 19 million acres in the area. Over 17 \nmillion acres are basically set aside in wilderness in perpetuity. That \nis a pretty good-sized chunk of real estate. We are looking at an area \nthe size of Oregon and Washington put together. Industry tells us that \nif they can find the oil necessary to develop the field--and they have \nto find a lot of oil because you do not develop small fields in the \nArctic--the footprint would be about 12,500 acres. To put that in \nperspective, that is about the size of the Dulles International Airport \ncomplex in Virginia, assuming the rest of Virginia were a wilderness.\n  The arguments against opening ANWR are the same arguments that \nprevailed nearly 20 years ago when we talked about opening Prudhoe Bay: \nWhat is going to happen to the caribou? What is going to happen to the \nmoose? What is going to happen to the wildlife?\n  Well, we have had some 17 or 18 years to observe the process. The \ncaribou herds in Prudhoe Bay were 4,000 to 5,000; now they are 17,000 \nto 18,000. The growth of those herds is as a consequence of the \nrealization that those areas are absolutely off limits to subsistence \nhunting of any kind. The Eskimo people in the region do not hunt in \nthose areas, and caribou is a very adaptable animal. If chased down by \na snow machine or hunter, obviously it runs away. The common sight of \nmodest activity associated with exploration and development has \nabsolutely no effect. A person can go up there today and observe this \nprocess.\n  So as we reflect on what some of the alternatives are, I wonder if we \nare really not selling America short. As I said before, they are the \nsame arguments of 17 years ago we are hearing today, that somehow this \nis the Serengeti of the Arctic--12,500 acres out of 19 million acres is \nwhat we are talking about--somehow the native people of the area will \nbe affected. But I can tell you, Madam President, the native people of \nthe area have been given an opportunity that they never had before, and \nmany of them have chosen the opportunity to have gainful employment, \nhave a tax base, have first-class schools. Schools in Barrow, AK, are \nthe finest schools in the United States bar none. In areas where we \nhave intense climates, we have indoor play areas. As a consequence of \nthe contribution of oil and the fact that the native people have been \nable to tax the oil, have been able to tax the pipeline, they have been \nable to have an alternative to a subsistence lifestyle which jobs offer \nbut never would have been prevalent in the area.\n  I think we are shortchanging America's ingenuity to suggest we cannot \nopen it safely. There is absolutely no scientific evidence to suggest \nthat we cannot open it safely. The technology is advanced. The \nfootprint is smaller. The environmental concerns, the restoration, are \nall set in place by the State and the Federal Government. So the risk \nis diminished dramatically. So why the hesitation?\n  Well, to some degree, Madam President, it is associated with a cause, \nand that cause is that Alaska is far away. ANWR has been identified by \nmany of the national environmental groups as an issue where they can \nchallenge; people cannot go up there and see for themselves. It \ngenerates revenue. It generates a cause. And as a consequence, they \nwould suggest to you that this area cannot be opened up safely. They do \nnot address the opportunities for employment, the opportunities for new \nengineering technology and expertise but, rather, that Americans cannot \nmeet a challenge. I find this very, very distressing, but it is \nsomething that perhaps Alaskans and others who come from energy States \nhave become uncomfortably accustomed to.\n  Now, where do we go from here, Madam President? Well, I happen to be \nchairman of the Energy and Natural \n[[Page S2818]] Resources Committee, and we are going to hold a number \nof hearings on this matter as we look at our growing dependence on \nimported oil and the effect that it has on our national security and \nlook to alternatives.\n  But, Madam President, we are not going to look to the alternatives \nsuggested by the White House, which are nothing but words.\n  I can remember coming into this body in 1981 when we were running in \nthe high 30's, low 40's percentile dependence on imported oil. There \nwas concern then. There was an expression if it ever got to the area \nwhere it would be approaching 50 percent we would have to do something \ndrastic, we would have to stimulate our industry somehow with \nincentives. But we went on and on and became more dependent and now 51 \npercent of our total consumption is imported oil. And now we are told \nthat our national security is at stake.\n  Out of these hearings I hope we get the experts--not the wordsmiths \nfrom the White House who are simply selling America short, relative to \nits capability to produce additional discoveries of oil and gas within \nthe United States. It is truly distressing to read this report. We knew \nit was coming. We suspected what it said. And each time we made an \ninquiry we were advised that the report was still under review because \nthe administration chose, for obvious reasons, to put it off as long as \nthey could. I find it rather coincidental that it comes in at a time \nwhen we are almost out for the Presidents' Day extended weekend.\n  But I think it is time for this body and the other House to reflect \non the reality associated with a segment of America's traditional \nindustrial might that the administration proposes to remove from the \npassing scene and become more dependent on imports and export more \ndollars and more jobs offshore.\n  This is not unique to the oil industry. To some extent it follows \nwith the administration's attitude towards domestic mining. But I will \nsave that analysis for another day.\n  I am pleased the Independent Petroleum Association of America has \npursued this matter. I think their President, Mr. Dennis Bode, has made \na very commendable and meaningful contribution to bring this report \nbefore us. I hope the Energy Coalition, that is made up of both Members \nof the House and Senate, will reflect upon this report in the very near \nfuture. I know they will.\n  It is interesting to look at the attitude of other nations as they \nobserve our increasing dependence on imports. My many friends in Japan \ncannot understand. They simply say how unfortunate it is that Japan has \nno natural resources and must import its entire resources, whether \nenergy or mineral. They only have the human work ethic and the \nefficiencies associated with Japanese industry that have been perfected \nover an extended period of time, since the Second World War. We helped \nthem basically during the reconstruction period. They simply cannot \nunderstand our mentality and lack of our commitment to use our \nresources wisely, for the benefit of our people and our economy.\n  In summary, Madam President, I am disappointed. It is ironic that we \nshould be confronted on the same day with a bill to close the most \npromising area in North America from exploration and put it into an \nadditional permanent wilderness--and I might add, Madam President, we \nhave 56 million acres of wilderness in our State. There are some who \nwould like to put the whole State in a wilderness. There are others who \nwould like to buy the State back from the United States and go it \nalone. But that is probably another story, for another day as well. To \nsuggest this is the time to put it in wilderness when we get a report \nthat says our national security interest is at stake is, indeed, \nironic.\n  I know Senator Stevens will be joining me in commenting on the \nsignificance of this report and the lack of responsible--and I stress \nresponsible--analysis of the alternatives that we have available to us, \nalternatives that are practical, and certainly in the national security \ninterest.\n  I think that is enough for tonight, Madam President. I wish you a \ngood holiday and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, in a move that defies principle and logic, \nthe Clinton administration has proposed lifting the sanctions on Serbia \nand Montenegro, while it maintains an illegal and unjust arms embargo \non Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the Washington Post editorial page put it \ntoday, ``the United States and its partners in dealing with the old \nYugoslavia have got it upside down.''\n  For 7 months, the Bosnian Serbs have said ``no'' to the contact group \npeace plan. Despite their promises last summer of tough measures, the \ncontact group countries have pursued a concessions only approach. And \nso, instead of putting on more pressure on Serbia and its allies in \nBosnia and Croatia, the contact group is now ready to offer an enormous \nconcession to Serbia by agreeing to remove the only real leverage we \nstill have, that is, sanctions. Sanctions provide leverage not only on \nthe situation in Bosnia, and in Croatia, but in Kosova--where Albanians \nare the latest victims of ethnic cleansing.\n  Sure, the administration says that Serbian President Milosevic will \nhave to make promises in return. We have seen what his promises are \nworth. Last August Milosevic promised to cut off the Bosnian Serbs, but \nwhat really happened is that support was reduced, not ended. Yes, the \nadministration has managed to see that conditions are attached to this \nlifting of sanctions, noting that the Europeans and Russians would make \nsuch a deal even sweeter for Milosevic. But the bottom line is that \nthis is an ill-conceived policy and any tinkering by the administration \non the margins does not change that fact.\n  The message this action sends is that the contact group countries are \nincapable of pressuring anyone but the victims of this brutal \naggression. That message is a green light to the Bosnian Serbs and to \nthe Krajina Serbs. There are warnings of a wider war, but now we see \nhow the contact group hopes to avoid such a scenario, namely by \nwithholding the Bosnians' right to self-defense. Anyone outside the \ncontact group can see clearly that this is a formula for wider war, not \na formula for preventing wider war. As the Washington Post concluded, \n``seeking a phony peace, the United States and its partners may be \nstoking a greater war.''\n  Madam President, this is a policy of desperation. This is a policy \nthat highlights the lack of American leadership. This is a policy that \nputs the United States on the side of rewarding aggression and against \nthe forces of freedom and democracy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nWashington Post editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 16, 1995]\n\n                              Phony Peace\n\n       The United States and its partners in dealing with the old \n     Yugoslavia have got it upside down. What they should be doing \n     is putting more pressure on Serbia and the Serb rebels it \n     supports in Bosnia and Croatia. What they actually are doing \n     is putting on less pressure by prematurely opening up the \n     possibility of ending the already partly suspended, porous \n     sanctions on Serbia that are in place.\n       This new sweetener concocted by the five-nation Contact \n     Group takes as its stated purpose to draw the Serbian regime \n     of Slobodan Milosevic into formal acceptance of international \n     peace plans for Bosnia and Croatia. But it was always \n     implicit anyway that if Mr. Milosevic decided to rein in his \n     wild ambitions for a Greater Serbia, the sanctions on him \n     would fade away. Now to make it explicit--while he still \n     cheats on his pledges, before he has shown a commitment to \n     restraint--is to invite him to bargain the Contact Group \n     down; to extract a large concession for a minimal policy \n     change.\n       It is easy enough to grasp why the Contact Group finds \n     itself in the weird position of proposing to suspend not the \n     military embargo on the chief victim, Bosnia, but the \n     economic sanctions on the chief offender, Serbia. It's \n     because none of the group's five members (United States, \n     Russia, France, Britain, Germany) has a taste for employing \n     [[Page S2819]] the force it would take to stiffen their \n     lowest-common-denominator collective diplomacy. To prevent \n     their diplomacy from becoming altogether laughable, they \n     should at the least be stiffening it with tougher sanctions \n     on Serbia. But this they decline to do.\n       A tragic irony is building. The danger now perceived by the \n     Contact Group is that the war will spread. But the burden of \n     constraining it is being put largely on the Muslims and, to a \n     lesser extent, the Croats. They can fairly wonder whether \n     they are not being asked to swallow huge Serb incursions on \n     their territory, viability and sovereignty for the \n     geopolitical convenience of states far from the battlefield \n     and substantially unaffected by its flows. Feeling abandoned \n     even as their fundamental interests are threatened, Muslims \n     and Croats may yet be confirmed in a judgment that they can \n     satisfy their legitimate political goals only by military \n     means. Seeking a phony peace, the United States and its \n     partners may be stoking a greater war.\n\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2816-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, 50 years ago tomorrow, the legendary 10th \nMountain Division successfully assaulted Riva Ridge in northern Italy's \nAppennine Mountains. Tomorrow, 12 of my World War II comrades from the \n10th Mountain Division will stage a 50th anniversary climb of Riva \nRidge to reenact the division's historic capture of this heavily \nfortified German stronghold.\n  Using ropes, pitons, and other mountaineering equipment to scale the \ncliffs, and wearing replicas of our World War II white camouflage \nsuits, this team of ski troop veterans will follow the same route used \nby 10th Mountain Division units in seizing the strategic 4,500-foot \npeak a half century earlier.\n  This assault group of World War II combat veterans--all of whom are \nnow in their early seventies--will be joined in the commemorative \noperation by mountain soldier veterans of the German gebirgstruppe and \nthe Italian Alpini. This peaceful ascent of Riva Ridge reflects the \nfounding purposes of the International Federation of Mountain Soldiers, \nan eight-nation organization which represents more than 500,000 \nmountain soldier veterans, many of whom fought on opposing sides during \nWorld War II. Tomorrow's climb is actually a coming together of wartime \nfoes on a rugged mountain summit in Italy.\n  In addition, these climbers will be joined by today's soldiers. \nDuring recent years, we veterans of the wartime 10th Mountain Division \nhave established close bonds of friendship with our young counterparts \nof today's 10th Mountain Division\n --light. Following their recent return from Haiti, 10 young soldiers \nof the 10th Mountain--light--from Fort Drum, NY, will be participating \nin the reenactment climb. Joining these active duty soldiers will be \ntwo climbing experts from the 172d Mountain Battalion, Vermont National \nGuard.\n\n  The reenactment teams are headquartered in the small \nmountain village of Lizzano, which was the scene of intense fighting \nduring my division's breakthrough from the Apennines northward into the \nPo River Valley and the Dolomite Mountains. During the 10th Mountain \nDivision's decisive combat operations in northern Italy, nearly 1,000 \nof my fellow soldiers lost their lives to enemy action, another 4,000 \nwere wounded.\n  As our Nation observes the 50th anniversary of the end of World War \nII during 1995, I am tremendously proud to know that a handful of my \nfellow 10th Mountain Division veterans have undertaken such a \nmeaningful way of commemorating one of their victories in the final \nmonths of the war. I salute them for their endeavor, and I am sure that \nall other Members of the Congress will do the same.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Donald \n``Cootie'' Masters, the newspaper publisher in my hometown, who \nrecently passed away. D.J. Masters was not only a publisher of a weekly \nnewspaper, he was also a State legislator. He was a fine man, and an \ninspiration to me.\n  I think that the role of the weekly editor in America has been \noverlooked. The importance of the women and men who run our smalltown \nnewspapers is seldom recognized.\n  Our weekly newspapers have almost been forgotten in this \ntelecommunications age, when we have satellite TV, when we have all the \nvarious modern technologies. But our weekly newspapers are still there \nat the heart of their communities.\n  I received the Humboldt Journal even when I was in the Army in \nVietnam. My mother bought me a subscription and sent it. I received the \nHumboldt Journal when I was away at the University of South Dakota and \nlater when I was a student at Oxford University in England, and then at \nHarvard Law School. I still get the Humboldt Journal at home.\n  You cannot get the weekly hometown paper out of the boy, I suppose \nyou could say.\n  D.J. Masters was a true South Dakotan. He took great pride in his \nwork, his family, his community, and his faith. He was an example and \ninspiration to many.\n  I do not know if many people really understand the positive impact on \nthe lives of South Dakotans that the editors of our weekly papers have.\n  As the editor of my hometown newspaper, the Humboldt Journal,\n   Cootie Masters was part of the lives of thousands of South Dakotans.\n\n  Born on July 7, 1906, Cootie began his rich and fulfilling life in \nthe town of Humboldt, SD. This small town upbringing and his strong \nfamily ties instilled in him a deep respect for traditional values. He \ngraduated from Humboldt High School in 1924 and went on to attend the \nUniversity of South Dakota. I would like to note that in 1924 it was \nquite an accomplishment for a young student from a small town to attend \ncollege. This was only the beginning of Cootie's many achievements.\n  In addition to his studies at USD, Cootie participated in basketball \nand was a fraternity brother in Delta Tau Delta. He demonstrated at a \nyoung age the importance in life of social involvement and balance \nbetween intellectual and physical pursuits.\n  After Cootie graduated from college, he became involved in his family \nbusiness. His father owned and operated the Humboldt Journal and passed \non his business knowledge to Cootie. Cootie's father died suddenly in \n1936, leaving Cootie as the sole owner and editor of the Journal. \nAnyone you may know in a family business will tell you that \nsuccessfully passing on a family business to the next generation is \nmuch more difficult than most people realize. Cootie not only succeeded \nin taking over the Journal in 1936, but also was successful in \noperating it until well after his official retirement. That is no small \nfeat.\n  Cootie's life involved much more than his newspaper work. He \ncontributed to the whole State of South Dakota by serving in the State \nhouse as a representative from Minnehaha County from 1936 to 1941.\n  Cootie balanced his successful business and political careers with \ndevotion to his family and friends. On June 12, 1933, he began his \nfamily by marrying Mildred Newton. Cootie and Mildred had three sons: \nNeal, Tom, and Bob. Today, the Masters family includes 7 grandchildren \nand 11 great-grandchildren. I know that Cootie considered his family to \nbe the most precious blessing in his life.\n  Aside from his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, what \nmay have kept Cootie young for so long was his robust enjoyment of \nlife. After college, he continued to participate in baseball and \nbasketball. He also \n[[Page S2820]] loved the outdoors. An avid sportsman, Cootie enjoyed \nfishing and hunting. He certainly picked the right State for enjoying \nthe great outdoors.\n  What is most impressive about Cootie is that with all of his public \nactivities, he is still described as a man with not one enemy.\n  Cootie was a true friend to me, to our community, and to our State. I \nwill always remember him fondly.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to the Masters family on the loss of \ntheir beloved Cootie.\n  Mr. President, I pay tribute not only to him but to the weekly \nnewspapers of South Dakota and to the South Dakota State House of \nRepresentatives from which he served during his career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2819-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, S. 377 is a technical corrections bill in \nits truest form. S. 377 would amend section 9112(a)(1)(A) of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. S. 377 would amend \nsection 9112(a)(1)(A), otherwise referred to as the Indian Education \nAct, by striking the word ``and'' and inserting the word ``or.'' This \ntechnical change would correct an oversight that occurred during the \nconference of the bill.\n  Last Congress, the Committee on Indian Affairs received testimony \nfrom both Indian educators and tribal organizations on proposals for \nthe reauthorization of the Indian Education Act. These proposals were \nintegrated into the Improving America's School Act of 1994. Among these \nproposals was a program providing formula grants to schools enrolling \nIndian children.\n  During the House and Senate conference regarding this particular \nsection of the act, discussions ensued on whether a minimum of 10 or 20 \nIndian children would be required in order to be eligible for these \nprograms. The House bill would have required that a school have at \nleast 20 Indian children or that the Indian children make up at least \n25 percent of the student body of the school. The Senate bill would \nhave required that a school have a minimum of 10 Indian children or \nthat Indian children make up 25 percent of the student body of the \nschool. The House and Senate Conferees agreed upon the Senate version \nwhich required a minimum of 10 Indian students or that Indian students \nmake up 25 percent of the school's enrollment.\n  The congressional intent behind section 9112 clearly supports the \nenactment of this technical amendment. The House and Senate debate on \nthis section only contemplated the number of Indian children that would \nbe required for funding pursuant to this section. The conferees did not \ndebate over the conjunction ``or.'' The side-by-side analysis used by \nboth the Senate and House conferees supports this point. However, an \napparent error occurred in the redrafting process of the conference \napproved bill. The drafters inadvertently substituted the word ``and'' \nfor ``or.'' As a result, the law currently states that ``in order for a \nschool to be eligible for an Indian Education Act \n[[Page S2821]] formula grant, it must have 10 eligible students and \nhave 25 percent of its student population eligible for the program.'' \namong these proposals.\n  This minor oversight will have major ramifications in the education \nof American Indian and Alaska Native children. The current language \nunnecessarily restricts a schools eligibility for grant funding by \nrequiring schools to meet both criteria. Consequently, the existing \nlanguage will result in the disqualification of many schools that serve \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native children. The Department of Education \nis in the process of promulgating regulations which do not accurately \nreflect the true intent of the Congress. Therefore, it is imperative \nthat this amendment be promptly enacted to clarify and fulfill the true \nintent of the act, to improve schools for all Americans, including \nIndians and Alaska Natives.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2820-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2821-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2821-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On November 16, 1990, in light of the dangers of the proliferation of \nchemical and biological weapons, President Bush issued Executive Order \nNo. 12735, and declared a national emergency under the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). Under section \n202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the \nnational emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its \ndeclaration unless the President publishes in the Federal Register and \ntransmits to the Congress a notice of its continuation.\n  On November 14, 1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12938, which \nrevoked and superseded Executive Order No. 12735. As I described in the \nreport transmitting Executive Order No. 12938, the new Executive order \nconsolidates the functions of Executive Order No. 12735, which declared \na national emergency with respect to the proliferation of chemical and \nbiological weapons, and Executive Order No. 12930, which declared a \nnational emergency with respect to nuclear, biological, and chemical \nweapons, and their means of delivery. The new Executive order continued \nin effect any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other forms of \nadministrative action taken under the authority of Executive Order No. \n12735. This is the final report with respect to Executive Order No. \n12735.\n  This report is made pursuant to section 204 of the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act regarding activities taken and money spent pursuant to \nthe emergency declaration. Additional information on chemical and \nbiological weapons proliferation is contained in the annual report to \nthe Congress provided pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons \nControl and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991.\n  The three export control regulations issued under the Enhanced \nProliferation Control Initiative are fully in force and continue to be \nused to control the export of items with potential use in chemical or \nbiological weapons (CBW) or unmanned delivery systems for weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  During the final 6 months of Executive Order No. 12735, the United \nStates continued to address actively in its international diplomatic \nefforts the problem of the proliferation and use of CBW.\n  At the termination of Executive Order No. 12735, 158 nations had \nsigned the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and 16 had ratified it. On \nNovember 23, 1993, I submitted the CWC to the Senate for its advice and \nconsent to ratification. The United States continues to press for \nprompt ratification of the Convention to enable its entry into force as \nsoon as possible. We also continue to urge those countries that have \nnot signed the Convention to do so. The United States has remained \nactively engaged in the work of the CWC Preparatory Commission \nheadquartered in The Hague, to elaborate the technical and \nadministrative procedures for implementing the Convention.\n  The United States was an active participant in the Special Conference \nof States Parties, held September 19-30, 1994, to review the consensus \nfinal report of the Ad Hoc Group of experts mandated by the Third \nBiological Weapons Convention (BWC) Review conference. The Special \nConference produced a mandate to establish an Ad Hoc Group whose \nobjective is to develop a legally binding instrument to strengthen the \neffectiveness and improve the implementation of the BWC. The United \nStates strongly supports the development of a legally binding protocol \nto strengthen the Convention.\n  The United States maintained its active participation in the \nAustralia Group (AG), which welcomed the Czech Republic, Poland, and \nSlovakia as the 26th, 27th, and 28th AG members, respectively. The \nGroup reaffirmed members' collective belief that full adherence to the \nCWC and the BWC provides the only means to achieve a permanent global \nban on CBW, and that all states adhering to these conventions have an \nobligation to ensure that their national activities support these \ngoals.\n  The AG also reiterated its conviction that harmonized AG export \nlicensing measures are consistent with and indeed actively support, the \nrequirement under Article I of the CWC that States Parties never \nassist, in any way, the manufacture of chemical weapons. These measures \nalso are consistent with the undertaking in Article XI of the CWC to \nfacilitate the fullest possible exchange of chemical materials and \nrelated information for purposes not prohibited by the Convention, as \nthey focus solely on preventing assistance to activities banned under \nthe CWC. Similarly, such efforts also support existing nonproliferation \nobligations under the BWC.\n  The United States Government determined that one foreign individual \nand two foreign commercial entities--respectively, Nahum Manbar, and \nMana International Investments and Europol Holding Ltd.--had engaged in \nchemical weapons proliferation activities that required the imposition \nof trade sanctions against them, effective on July 16, 1994. A separate \ndetermination was made and sanctions imposed against Alberto di Salle, \nan Italian national, effective on August 19, 1994. Additional \ninformation on these determinations will be contained in a classified \nreport to the Congress, provided pursuant to the Chemical and \nBiological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991.\n  Pursuant to section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, I report \nthat there were no expenses directly attributable to the exercise of \nauthorities conferred by the declaration of the national emergency in \nExecutive Order No. 12735 during the period from November 16, 1990, \nthrough November 14, 1994.\n                                                  William J.

Specifically, this order \nprovided necessary authority under the Enhanced Proliferation Control \nInitiative (EPCI), as provided in the Export Administration \nRegulations, set forth in Title 15, Chapter VII, Subchapter C, of the \nCode of Federal Regulations, Parts 768 to 799 inclusive, to continue to \nregulate the activities of United States persons in order to prevent \ntheir participation in activities that could contribute to the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means.\n  I issued Executive Order No. 12930 pursuant to the authority vested \nin me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of \nAmerica, including the IEEPA, the National Emergencies Act (NEA) (50 \nU.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States \nCode. At that time, I also submitted a report to the Congress pursuant \nto section 204(b) of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)).\n  Executive Order No. 12930 was revoked by Executive Order No. 12938 of \nNovember 14, 1994. Executive Order No. 12938 consolidates a number of \nauthorities and eliminated certain redundant authorities. All \nauthorities contained in Executive Order No. 12930 were transferred to \nExecutive Order No. 12938.\n  Section 204 of the IEEPA requires follow-up reports, with respect to \nactions or changes, to be submitted every 6 months. Additionally, \nsection 401(c) of the NEA requires that the President: (1) within 90 \ndays the end of each 6-month period following a declaration of a \nnational emergency, report to the Congress on the total expenditures \ndirectly attributable to that declaration; or (2) within 90 days after \nthe termination of an emergency, transmit a final report to the \nCongress on all expenditures. This report, covering the period from \nSeptember 29, 1994, to November 14, 1994, is submitted in compliance \nwith these requirements.\n  Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12930, the Department of \nCommerce has continued to administer and enforce the provisions \ncontained in the Export Administration Regulations concerning \nactivities by United States persons that may contribute to the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. In addition, \nthe Department of Commerce has conducted ongoing outreach to educate \nconcerned communities regarding these restrictions. Regulated \nactivities may include financing, servicing, contracting, or other \nfacilitation of missile or weapons projects, and need not be linked to \nexports or reexports of U.S.-origin items. No applications for licenses \nto engage in such activities were received during the period covered by \nthis report.\n  No expenses directly attributable to the exercise of powers or \nauthorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in \nExecutive Order No. 12930 were incurred by the Federal Government in \nthe period from September 29, 1994, to November 14, 1994.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend various acts to establish offices of women's \nhealth within certain agencies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 the women's health offices act of 1995\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto focus attention on the special health needs of women by establishing \noffices of Women's Health within the Office of the Assistant Secretary \nfor Health, the Centers for Disease Control, the Agency for Health Care \nPolicy and Research, the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nand the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The directors of these offices of women's health will assess the \ncurrent level of activity regarding women's health within their \nrespective agencies, established short-range and long-range goals and \nobjectives for women's health, identify projects in women's health that \nshould be conducted or supported, consult with health professionals, \nnongovernmental organizations, consumer organizations, and other \nappropriate groups on their agency's women's health policies, and \ncoordinate agency activities on women's health.\n  Congress has already taken a first step in recognizing that women's \nunique health needs should be addressed separately. In the 103d \nCongress, the 1993 NIH revitalization bill established an Office of \nWoman's Health within the National Institutes of Health. We must build \nupon that progress in the 104th Congress.\n  For too long, women have been systematically excluded from medical \nresearch studies, received less aggressive treatment for heart disease \nand other serious ailments, and lacked access to important preventive \nservices. By statutorily establishing offices of Women's Health in \nFederal agencies which research and disseminate information about \nhealth, we ensure that women's needs and concerns will be given the \nconsideration they deserve.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Pell, \n        and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 428. A bill to improve the management of land and water for fish \nand wildlife purposes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n              the fish and wildlife management act of 1995\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I read recently that ``the best thing \nwe have learned from nearly 500 years of contact with the American \nwilderness is restraint,'' the need to stay our hand and preserve our \nprecious environment \n[[Page S2824]] and future resources rather than destroy them for \nmomentary gain.\n  With this in mind, I offer legislation today that designates the \ncoastal plain of Alaska as wilderness area. At the moment this area is \na national wildlife refuge, one of our beautiful and last frontiers. By \nchanging its designation, Mr. President, we can protect it forever.\n  And I can't stress how important this is.\n  The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our \nearth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete \nspectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a \nvital part of our national consciousness. It is a place we can cherish \nand visit for our soul's good. It offers us a sense of well-being and \npromises that not all dreams have been dreamt.\n  The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness \nand recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and \nglaciers, gentle foothills, and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich \nwith caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, \nmoose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, \nblack brant, and more. In all, about 165 species use the coastal plain. \nIt is an area of intense wildlife activity. Animals give birth, nurse \nand feed their young,\n and set about the critical business of fueling up for winters of \nunspeakable severity.\n\n  The fact is, Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is \ngood that man can come only as a visitor. These are the pristine lands \nthat belong to all of us. And perhaps most importantly, these are the \nlands that belong to our future.\n  Considering the many reasons why this bill is so important, I came \nacross the words of the great western writer, Wallace Stegner. \nReferring to the land we are trying to protect with this legislation, \nhe wrote that it is ``the most splendid part of the American habitat; \nit is also the most fragile.'' And we cannot enter ``it carrying habits \nthat [are] inappropriate and expectations that [are] surely \nexcessive.''\n  The expectations for oil exploration in this pristine region are \nexcessive. There is only a one-in-five chance of finding any \neconomically recoverable oil in the refuge. And if oil is found, the \ndaily production of 400,000 barrels per day is less than .7 percent of \nworld production--far too small to meet American's energy needs for \nmore than a few months.\n  In other words, Mr. President, there is much more to lose than might \never be gained by tearing this frontier apart. Already, some 90 percent \nof Alaska's entire North Slope is open to oil and gas leasing and \ndevelopment. Let's keep this area as the jewel amid the stones.\n  What this bill offers--and what we need--is a brand of pragmatic \nenvironmentalism, an environmental stewardship that protects our \nimportant wilderness areas and precious resources, while carefully and \njudiciously weighing the short-term desires or our country against its \nlong-term needs.\n  together, we need to embrace environmental policies that are workable \nand pragmatic, policies based on the desire to make the world a better \nplace for us and for future generations. I believe a strong economy, \nliberty, and progress are possible only when we have a healthy planet--\nonly when resources are managed through wise stewardship--only when an \nenvironmental ethic thrives among nations and only when people have \nfrontiers that are untrammeled and able to host their fondest \ndreams.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRYAN (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 429. A bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to allow \ncommercial nuclear utilities that have contracts with the Secretary of \nEnergy under section 302 of that act to receive credits to offset the \ncost of storing spent fuel that the Secretary is unable to accept for \nstorage on and after January 31, 1998; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n         the independent spent nuclear fuel storage act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce again legislation \nI have introduced in each of the past two Congresses, the Independent \nSpent Nuclear Fuel Storage Act.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, since 1987, contrary to Nevada \nState law, and against the wishes of the vast majority of Nevadans, \nNevada has been the sole site considered for the ultimate disposal of \nthe United States' high-level nuclear waste.\n  Today, in spite of the expenditure of billions of dollars, the Yucca \nMountain site is no closer to accepting waste from our Nation's nuclear \nreactors than it was 13 years ago, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1982 was enacted.\n  I strongly oppose the purely political decision made by Congress in \n1987 to identify Yucca Mountain as the sole site to be characterized \nfor a permanent repository. Now that the permanent repository program \nis an obvious failure, with the Department of Energy saying there is no \nhope of opening any type of storage facility before 2010, the nuclear \npower industry and its allies have conceived a new strategy.\n  Contrary to all objective scientific judgment, and general common \nsense, the nuclear industry's new effort is to instruct the DOE to \nbuild an interim storage facility at the Yucca Mountain site. As \noffensive as the 1987 act, commonly referred to in Nevada as the \n``screw Nevada bill,'' was, the new effort of the nuclear power \nindustry is even more of an outrage to Nevadans.\n  The nuclear power industry's newest proposal is nothing less than a \ndirect assault on the health and safety of Nevadans. Frustrated by its \ninability to overcome the insurmountable safety concerns raised in \nrelation to a permanent repository, the industry is now seeking to \ncircumvent the objections of credible, objective scientists to a \npermanent repository at Yucca Mountain.\n  I am convinced, like many others, that any centralized interim \nstorage facility will become the de facto permanent repository.\n  Funding for an interim storage program will necessarily come at the \nexpense of the permanent repository program. The expression ``out of \nsight, out of mind'' could not be truer. Once the waste is removed from \nthe reactor sites, the nuclear industry's commitment to finding a \npermanent solution to the waste problem will vanish. And since it is \nthe nuclear power industry's obsession with moving this waste off the \nreactor sites that drives the Federal Civilian Nuclear Waste Program, \nthe Federal commitment to permanent storage will vanish as well.\n  The nuclear power industry as much as concedes this--every version of \ntheir interim storage legislation I am aware of provides for licensing \nthe interim site for 100 years, subject to renewal.\n  The permanent repository program is a failure. The nuclear power \nindustry and its advocates, including the Department of Energy, have \ncreated a program which was bound to fail. Careless science, poor \nmanagement, unreasonable deadlines and timetables, and the ill-fated \ndecision to pursue only one site for characterization, thus leaving the \nprogram with no options or alternatives, have all contributed to the \nfailure of the program.\n  The industry's suggestion to build an interim storage facility in \nNevada is simply one more in a long series of irresponsible and ill-\nfounded proposals by the nuclear power industry to solve their high \nlevel waste problem at the expense of the health and safety of all \nNevadans.\n  I will concede that the nuclear power industry has a waste problem. I \nstrongly object, however, to the industry's solution, which is simply \nto send their problem, their waste to Nevada.\n  The question arises, do we need a centralized interim storage site? \nIf we are truly talking about interim storage, the answer is obviously \nno.\n  A few nuclear utilities, looking at the future uncertainty of the \nFederal nuclear waste program, have done the responsible thing and \nbuilt interim dry cask storage at the reactor site. In dry cask \nstorage, spent fuel assemblies are removed from the reactor pools and \nstored in various systems of canisters, casks, and concrete shells.\n  I recently visited one of these dry cask storage facilities, at \nCalvert Cliffs in Maryland, and, I must say, I was impressed by the \nsimplicity and efficiency of the spent fuel management operation. It is \na responsible action taken by the industry, and I commend their example \nto others. The Calvert \n[[Page S2825]] Cliffs dry cask storage program provides a reasonable \nsolution to the interim storage problem, the spent fuel is stored on \nsite, where security and safety precautions already exist, until a safe \nplan for the long-term disposition of the waste can be finalized.\n  A centralized interim storage facility is simply not needed, or \ndesirable. The original Nuclear Waste Policy Act recognized this fact, \nand placed restrictions on the DOE's authority to accept responsibility \nfor interim storage. The nuclear power industry, faced with the reality \nof the failure to build a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, is \nnow engaged in yet another exercise of political muscle with one \npurpose: to make Nevada the final destination for their toxic and \nhighly dangerous waste.\n  Even if we concede, which we do not, that there is a need for a \ncentralized interim storage facility, there is no defensible reason to \nsite the facility in Nevada. A simple look at a map easily shows that \nNevada is one of the least central sites to store nuclear waste. The \ngreat majority of the reactor sites producing high-level waste are east \nof the Mississippi--93 reactors out of the U.S. total of 118.\n  Shipping thousands of tons of high level waste to Nevada will create \ndramatic threats to the safety of communities throughout the United \nStates. An analysis of one proposal supported by the nuclear power \nindustry reveals that interim storage in Nevada will require 15,000 \nshipments by rail and truck through 43 States to begin as early as 1998 \nand continue for 30 years.\n  Interim storage in Nevada is not the answer to the nuclear power \nindustry's waste problem. The responsible answer to the waste problem, \nif the nuclear utilities choose to continue to run their reactors, is \non-site, dry cask storage.\n  Unfortunately, most nuclear utilities appear to be unwilling\n   to develop dry cask storage facilities for a variety of reasons, \nboth political and financial.\n\n  There is not much we can do about the local political opposition \nfaced by utilities. The utilities, and communities, that benefited from \nthe operation of the powerplant should bear responsibility for their \nown waste. High-level waste storage is not popular, and there are \npolitical costs to the utilities for living up to their \nresponsibilities.\n  Asking Nevada to solve the political problems in the communities they \nserve places the nuclear utilities on completely indefensible ground. \nThe outright hypocrisy of the nuclear power industry's advocates, and \ntheir shameless attempts to exert political influence to solve complex \nscientific and environmental problems, has created an atmosphere of \ncomplete distrust and antagonism for the industry in Nevada.\n  There are also financial barriers to on-site, dry cask storage. \nRatepayers have been making contributions to the nuclear waste trust \nfund with the exception that the Federal Government will dispose of \ntheir nuclear waste. I am somewhat sympathetic to the ratepayers' \nconcerns. The Federal disposal program is a failure.\n  The civilian nuclear waste program has been so poorly managed, and so \nmisguided, that Congress has had good reason not to release the full \nbalance of the trust fund to the program. The ratepayers deserve some \nfinancial relief while the Federal Government attempts to meet its \nobligations, and while the utilities invest the needed capital to store \ntheir own waste.\n  The legislation I am introducing today recognizes the nuclear power \nindustry's need for interim storage, as well as the financial impact on \nratepayers caused by delays in the repository program. The legislation \nprovides credits against utilities' payments to the nuclear waste trust \nfund for costs incurred for on-site, dry cask storage.\n  The legislation provides an equitable solution to a difficult \nproblem. It recognizes the financial contributions of the utilities' \nratepayers to the trust fund, and recognizes the reality that a \npermanent repository will not be available to meet the needs of the \nnuclear power industry.\n  Mr. President, together with their advocates in Congress and the \nDepartment of Energy, the nuclear power industry has spared no expense \nor effort in moving its waste to Nevada. I have attempted to fight the \nindustry at every turn.\n  I hope that Congress will not take the failure of the permanent \nrepository program as a signal to bow to the nuclear power industry \nonce again, and accelerate plans to store nuclear waste in Nevada, but \ninstead to take this opportunity to find an equitable solution to a \ndifficult problem which does not threaten the health and safety of \nfuture generations of Nevadans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I am introducing \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 430. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nrequire States to adopt and enforce certain guardianship laws providing \nprotection and rights to wards and individuals subject to guardianship \nproceedings as a condition of eligibility for receiving funds under the \nMedicaid Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the guardianship rights and responsibilities act\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nGuardianship Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995, which establishes \na bill of rights for adults who, because of physical or mental \nincapacity, become wards of the courts.\n  Wards are individuals whose legal rights, decisionmaking authority \nand possessions have been transferred to the control of a guardian or \nconservator based on a judgment that the person is no longer capable of \nhandling these affairs. This legal system severely limits an \nindividual's personal autonomy and has considered problems and \nwidespread abuses. Horror stories abound about guardians who force \nunnecessary nursing home care, embezzle assets, or otherwise abuse \ntheir wards.\n  The Guardianship Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 would \nrequire States to adopt and enforce laws to provide basic protection \nand rights to wards as a condition of receiving Federal Medicaid funds. \nIt would assure due process protections such as counsel, the right to \nbe present at their proceedings and to appeal decisions. Also required \nwould be: clear and convincing evidence to determine the need for a \nguardianship; adequate court monitoring; and standards, training and \noversight for guardians.\n  This legislation will help to protect the most vulnerable elderly and \ndisabled from exploitation, and will help to assure them the highest \npossible autonomy. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 431. A bill to amend the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to prepare \nfishery management plans and amendments to fishery management plans \nunder negotiated rulemaking procedures, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  S. 432. A bill to amend the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act to require the Secretary of Commerce to prepare \nconservation and management measures for the northeast multispecies--\ngroundfish--fishery under negotiated rulemaking procedures, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n            negotiated rulemaking for fisheries legislation\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as many stories in the national \nmedia have reported, the New England groundfish industry is now facing \nthe most difficult challenges in its long history. Scientists report \nthat once plentiful stocks of cod, haddock, flounder, and other fish \nspecies have reached historic lows. In response to these stock \nassessments, the New England Fishery Management Council has approved \nsevere restrictions on fishing that will probably force many fishermen \nout of business. These restrictions include a 5-year program to cut \nfishing efforts in half, mandatory use of large-mesh nets, a moratorium \non new entrants into the fishery, and the emergency closure of large \nareas on the George's Bank fishing grounds off Massachusetts.\n  Most fishermen in Maine recognize that the groundfish stocks are low \nand that effective conservation measures are needed to help rebuild the \nfishery. But too many fishermen also believe that the specific program \napproved by the council will not succeed at restoring groundfish \npopulations, and will place unnecessary economic burdens on \n[[Page S2826]] working fishermen. In their view, the council, despite \npublic hearings, dismissed too many of their recommendations despite \nthe fact that they and others before them have been fishing the waters \noff New England for three centuries. In short, they have no support for \nor confidence in the council-developed management program under which \nthey must operate.\n  The success of any regulatory program depends in large part on the \nconfidence of the regulated community that the action takes their views \ninto account, will achieve its ends, and is sensible and necessary. I \nam introducing legislation today that aims to restore the confidence of \nNew England fishermen in the\n credibility of the Federal fisheries management process by giving them \nand other citizens with an interest in fisheries the ability to \nparticipate directly in that process.\n\n  My bills bring the concept of negotiated rulemaking or regulatory \nnegotiation to fisheries management. The concept was established in \nFederal law by the negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990. Under negotiated \nrulemaking, representatives of all stakeholder groups involved in a \ndispute negotiate directly on the regulatory solution with the aid of a \nprofessional facilitator. It provides a collaborative, consensus-based \ndispute resolution tool that agencies can use to develop potentially \ncontroversial regulations. If the negotiating group can reach \nconsensus, then the agency can propose the agreement as a new \nregulation or rule. Negotiated rulemaking has been used--sometimes \nsuccessfully, sometimes unsuccessful--by other Federal agencies, and it \nis time that this tool be made available in the fisheries management \nprocess.\n  The first bill that I have introduced today gives the Secretary of \nCommerce explicit authority to use negotiated rulemaking to develop \nfishery management plans or plan amendments. Under the Magnuson Act, \nthe Secretary can only submit management plans or plan amendments under \nlimited circumstances which preclude his flexibility in using this \nimportant tool effectively. Also, negotiated rulemaking is specifically \nused to develop rules, but fishery management plans are not technically \nrules. My bill removes these potential obstacles and clears the way for \nthe Secretary to use this dispute resolution tool on controversial \nissues.\n  The second bill directs the Secretary to use negotiated rulemaking in \nthe specific case of the New England groundfish fishery. Alternative \ndispute resolution is used more and more commonly in lieu of the \ntraditional adversarial regulatory process, and I believe that it \nshould be tried in the case of the New England groundfish issue.\n  These bills do not directly affect any existing fisheries management \nprograms, or impose new management measures. They only offer an \nalternative route for devising plans that will restore fish stocks off \nthe coast of New England and other parts of the country. They could \nlead to new management measures that not only do a better job of \nrebuilding fish stocks, but do so in a manner that minimizes the \neconomic impact on fishermen and coastal communities, and in a manner \nthat gains the confidence and support of most fishermen. Surely, given \nthe extremely high stakes in an area like New England these days, we \nmust explore every opportunity, every possibility, for achieving such \ncritically important results.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 433. A bill to regulate handgun ammunition, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the ammunition safety act of 1995\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, no gun works without a bullet. Yet \nfor no good reason, Congress in the early 1980's repealed laws that \nregulate ammunition. And while a background check is required to stop \nfelons from purchasing guns, no such background check is required to \nstop them from buying ammunition for the guns they may already have.\n  In the meantime, bullets are getting meaner and more deadly. Law \nenforcement officers know all too well of the danger they face each and \nevery time a gun is pointed at them.\n  Advances in technology only promise to make matters worse. When a \nlarge percentage of gun-related deaths involve handguns, and a large \npercentage of gun related deaths is accidental, it is insane for the \npublic to fear the creation of new, more destructive bullets.\n  The fact is 157 police officers and State troopers were killed in \nthis country last year. Five lost their lives in my home State of \nMassachusetts.\n  And more than 200 people die from the accidental use of handguns \nevery year. In 1992 alone, 233 accidental deaths occurred because of \nhandguns. This included 6 babies, 36 kids under the age of 14, and 8 \nsenior citizens, 2 of whom were over the age of 80.\n  In light of these sad and disturbing facts, there is no good reason \nto have ever more dangerous bullets on the market. And there is every \ngood reason to keep off our streets and out of our homes bullets that \nsupply handguns with the destructive power of assault weapons.\n  That is why the Ammunition Safety Act of 1995 does two things: it \nreestablishes reasonable regulations for the sale of handgun \nammunition, and it outlaws all exceedingly destructive handgun \nammunition--whether or not such ammo has been invented yet--by \nexpanding and updating the ban on armor-piercing handgun ammunition.\n  This bill would provide a weapon for law enforcement to crack down on \ncrime and would make ordinary people safer from handgun violence and \naccidental shootings. The bill accomplishes these goals in three steps.\n  First, the bill reinstates and strengthens ammunition control \nlanguage that Congress repealed during the Reagan era. It would require \ndealers of handgun ammunition to be licensed by the Federal Government. \nIt would restrict interstate sale and transportation of handgun \nammunition to licensed dealers. And it would double the maximum \npenalties for sale to and for possession of handgun ammunition by \nfelons and persons under age 21.\n  Second, the bill would apply Brady bill provisions to handgun \nammunition. To\n prevent the sale of handgun ammunition to felons, once the nationwide, \ninstantaneous background check the Brady bill created is in place, \nevery purchaser of ammunition will have to pass a background check \nbefore ammunition could be sold to him or her. These regulations would \nbe a vital tool to law enforcement in investigating crime, and would \nprovide equity to a system that currently monitors and restricts the \nflow of guns, but--inexplicably--not of ammunition.\n\n  Third, the bill expands the definition of illegal armor-piercing \nhandgun ammunition to include any new conceivable kind of armor-\npiercing bullet. The bill establishes a new method to accomplish this \ngoal.\n  To date, no law has been able to effectively ban all armor-piercing \nbullets. You can't ban what you can't define because vague laws are \nconstitutionally void--and definitions to date have failed to cover all \narmor-piercing bullets. All that existing law does is ban bullets based \non the materials of which they are made--consequently, bullets made of \nhard metals are illegal--in the hope that this definition will blanket \nmost armor-piercing bullets. But the existing composition-based \ndefinition fails to prevent the sale of certain bullets that pierce \narmor--like large lead bullets that aren't intended for handguns but \ncan be used in them--or the invention of new armor-piercing bullets--\nfor example, a plastic bullet hard enough to pierce armor.\n  This bill calls on the Treasury Department to define armor-piercing \nbullets not by what they are but by what they are not. Fulfilling this \nnew responsibility would entail four steps.\n  First, within 1 year, the Treasury Department is charged with \ndetermining a standard test to ascertain the destructive capacity of \nany and all bullets. This will probably result in something along the \nlines of a rating system equal to the width times the depth of the hole \na projectile bores in a block of gelatin when it is shot with no extra \npowder from a standard Colt .45 at a distance of 10 feet.\n  Second, utilizing this destructive rating test, the Treasury \nDepartment would then determine a rating threshold which would be the \nrating of the least destructive bullet to pierce today's standard body \narmor.\n  Third, all manufacturers of bullets for sale in the United States \nwould be \n[[Page S2827]] required to cover the costs incurred by the Treasury \nDepartment in testing and determining the destructive rating of every \nexisting bullet available on the market.\n  Fourth, this bill would make it illegal to manufacture, sell, import, \nuse, or possess any bullet--existing or newly invented--that has a \ndestructive rating equal to or higher than the armor-piercing \nthreshold. This would be in addition to the existing composition-based \ndefinition.\n  This bill contains reasonable exemptions. Those bullets exclusively \nmanufactured for law enforcement would be exempt; so would be those \nbullets designed for sporting purposes that Congress specifically \nexempts by law; and those bullets that are proven by their manufacturer \nat its expense to have a destructive rating below the armor-piercing \nthreshold.\n  By setting the legal standard at the armor-piercing threshold, all \narmor-piercing bullets would be illegal. And there is an additional \nadvantage to setting a legal threshold in this fashion: The threshold \nwould ban more than armor-piercing bullets. It would ban any new, sick, \nperverse bullet that has yet to be invented that explodes on impact, \nthat turns to shrapnel, that does things today's technology cannot yet \nfathom, or that by any other means is exceptionally destructive.\n  Setting a legal standard this way draws a hard and fast line between \nthose bullets currently on the market and future bullets that do more \ndamage than we can imagine today. This bills says that America is \nsatisfied that the bullets of today are dangerous enough, and America \nwill tolerate no greater likelihood of accidental death as a result of \nnew bullets.\n  This bill recognizes the fact that regulating only weapons is naive. \nAmong other reasons, guns last centuries, but ammunition has a shelf-\nlife of not much more than 20 years. Felons who want to kill will \nalways be able to find guns, but have to come out of the woodwork to \npurchase ammunition. When they do, this bill will be there to stop \nthem.\n  Of course, felons can make bullets at home, but it isn't easy, it \nisn't cheap, and it isn't safe. Mr. President, I recognize that there \nis a limit to what the Government can do to stop gun violence and \naccidental death. But today, the Government is shirking its \nresponsibility. This bill is a vital first step toward ensuring that \nthe Government does what is necessary to save lives.\n  The law enforcement community and the public will never again have to \nreact to advertisements like the one for the infamous Rhino bullet. \nThis add states:\n\n       The Rhino inflicts a wound of 8 inches in diameter. Each of \n     these fragments becomes lethal shrapnel and is hurled into \n     vital organs, lungs, circulatory system components, the heart \n     and other tissues. The wound channel is catastrophic. * * * \n     Death is nearly instantaneous.\n\n  If this bill is enacted, opportunistic manufacturers like the man who \ncreated the Rhino will have nothing to gain from advertising the \ndramatic innovations of their bullets. If an advertisement claims that \na new bullet is unusually destructive, the public will know that the \nadvertisement is either an outright lie or that the product is illegal. \nEither way, the public will know in advance that no such bullet will \never hit the street, and the public will have no cause for hysteria.\n  When this bill becomes law, no new bullets that are more dangerous \nthan those of today will make it to market. When this bill becomes law, \nthose bullets that are on the market won't end up in the wrong hands.\n  This bill is a solid step toward returning sanity and safety to our \nNation's streets and household. The Government has no greater \nresponsibility than to work toward this goal.\n  I welcome the support of colleagues who share my concerns, as many \ndo. I urge them to join me in sponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 433\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe deductibility of business meal expenses for individuals who are \nsubject to Federal limitation on hours of service; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            the business meal deduction fairness act of 1995\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in 1993, the 103d Congress took a \ncrucial and difficult stand on the deficit. In August of that year we \npassed the omnibus budget reconciliation bill. I am proud to stand here \ntoday and say that that legislation has helped to produce falling \ndeficits and sustained economic growth.\n  As my colleagues know, I am one of this body's strongest advocates \nfor deficit reduction. I attribute much of my deep commitment to this \ngoal to my days in business. As a businessman, I learned that you must \nbalance your books and live within your means. I also learned that you \nmust treat people fairly, and admit when you make a mistake. I have \ncome to the floor today to once again acknowledge that a mistake was \nmade in the 1993 reconciliation bill; a mistake which must be \ncorrected.\n  During consideration of the reconciliation bill, I opposed tax \nincreases on working middle- and lower-income Americans. However, in \nfighting to eliminate increases in broad taxes on middle- and lower-\nincome Americans, Congress overlooked a provision which places a hidden \ntax on those hardworking Americans who work in the transportation \nsector. It is for this reason that I rise today to reintroduce the \nbusiness meal deduction fairness bill.\n  Included in the 1993 reconciliation bill was a provision which \nlowered the deductible portion of business meals and entertainment \nexpenses from 80 to 50 percent. On the surface, this seems only a tax \non those rich enough to spend their lunchtimes in luxury restaurants \nand their nighttimes on luxury yachts. But contrary to popular belief, \nthe business meal deduction is not only used by lobbyists and fat cats \nfor three-martini lunches. Due to regulations limiting travel hours, \nmany transportation workers must eat out. That means the reduced \nbusiness meal deduction is a tax on workers who have no control over \nthe length of their trips, the amount of time they must rest during a \ndelivery, or, in many cases, the places they can stop to eat.\n  Let me provide you with a brief example to illustrate my point. The \naverage truck driver earns approximately $30,000 a year. The reduced \ndeduction will cost that driver between $750 and $1,000 per year. This \nis just one of many examples I could give to demonstrate the burden \nthis change has placed on hard-working, middle-income Americans. The \nlegislation I am introducing today, will lift this burden and restore \nsome common sense to the tax code.\n  Mr. President, the business meal deduction fairness bill repeals the \nhidden tax created last year by restoring the business meal deduction \nto 80 percent for those individuals covered by the Department of \nTransportation hours-of-service limit. This legislation is simple, \nstraightforward, and most importantly, fair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues of a similar bill \nwe worked on to correct another mistake which hurt tens of thousands of \nhard-working, middle-income Americans. As my colleagues remember, the \n1990 deficit reduction bill imposed a surtax on specific luxury items. \nAt the time, it was argued that the surtax would only affect the \nwealthiest segment of society. However, after it went into effect, it \nbecame clear that, instead of paying the tax, the wealthy decided not \nto buy the new boat or the diamond ring. As a result, the middle- and \nlower-income Americans producing and selling those luxury items ended \nup bearing the burden of the tax through lost wages and jobs.\n  Once it was apparent that the luxury tax was not achieving its \nintended goal, I began working with a number of my colleagues to repeal \nit. Fortunately, we were successful in getting a repeal in the 1993 \nreconciliation bill. Unfortunately, far too many people were hurt by \nthis mistake because we did not correct it quickly enough. We cannot \nlet that happen again. Therefore I am requesting the support and \nassistance of my colleagues to ensure that the business meal deduction \nfairness bill becomes law. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of my legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 434\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the elimination of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                       legislation to abolish hud\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that will abolish the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  Mr. President, HUD was created in 1965. When it was created, the \npurpose of this Department was to revitalize our urban areas and \nprovide more housing for America.\n  Mr. President, in short, HUD has been a collosal failure. Since 1965, \nHUD has spent hundreds of billions of dollars--that adjusted to \ninflation--probably exceeds a trillion dollars. Yet today, despite this \nmassive spending, our Nation's urban areas are more decayed and more \ndangerous today than ever. Homelessness, hardly a problem 30 years ago, \nis now a major concern.\n  Public housing has been a disaster and home ownership is down.\n  Solving these problems was supposed to be HUD's mission. In each, it \nhas failed miserably.\n  Imagine if we applied a performance standard like this to other \nFederal agencies. Suppose that when we created NASA with the purpose of \nputting a man on the Moon, that 30 years later, they still had not done \nit. We might consider abolishing them. That is exactly what we should \ndo with HUD because they failed to accomplish their mission.\n  Suppose that instead of creating HUD, we had given a trillion dollars \nto an entrepreneur like Bill Gates. Do you think our inner cities would \nbe any worse off, or do you think that they would be more livable \nplaces today? I think the answer is clear.\n  Take Fannie Mae for example. Fannie Mae plans to spend $1 trillion on \naffordable housing before the end of the decade. The plan will finance \nhomes for 10 million people. This would provide a home to one in three \nrenters in America. This plan, however, unlike HUD, won't cost American \ntaxpayers one cent, and yet it will provide homes for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I have no faith that HUD can be reinvented. Thirty \nyears of failure is too much. Since the November 8 election, HUD \nSecretary Henry Cisneros has put on a masterful public relations plan \nto save his Department. I for one am not fooled. If he really believed \nin what he was doing, he would have done it 2 years ago.\n  Most importantly, what are the savings from the Cisneros plan? There \nare none. The only clearly identified savings will amount to one-half \nof 1 percent over 5 years. Mr. President, let me repeat that, the total \nsavings in the Cisneros plan amount to only one-half of 1 percent over \n5 years.\n  [[Page S2829]] Of course, there are promises of more savings, but \nthey are just that--promises.\n  Actually, if you look at the projected outlays by HUD in the fiscal \nyear 1996 budget for the years 1995-99, spending is $3 billion more \nthan was projected in last year's budget. Yes, that's right, spending \nwill actually increase despite the reorganization.\n  Furthermore, my favorite line from the President's budget is on page \n190. It is a chart about HUD's program consolidation. It says:\n  ``Net impact, HUD consolidations''--spending of $29.4 billion in 1995 \nto $30.3 billion in 1996.\n  Yes, that's right. Spending will actually go up by $1 billion because \nof HUD's consolidations--not down.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported on February 15, 1995, that HUD's \nprojected savings may have been oversold, and that down at HUD they \nknew this before they submitted their plan to Congress.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing a bill to abolish HUD. The bill \nwill abolish HUD, effective January 1, 1998. The bill will direct the \nSecretary to make one housing block grant available to States and \nlocalities; transform all rental assistance into vouchers; and make FHA \na Government-controlled corporation with income targeting and risk \nsharing.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Daschle):\n  S. 436. A bill to improve the economic conditions and supply of \nhousing in native American communities by creating the Native American \nFinancial Services Organization, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n          native american financial services organization act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nentitled the Native American Financial Services Organization Act. I am \npleased to add my distinguished colleagues, the chairman and vice-\nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senators McCain and Inouye, \nand Senator Daschle, as cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, there is a continued need for assistance to improve \nthe housing conditions that exist in many Indian reservation \ncommunities, Alaska Native villages, and native Hawaiian communities. \nStatistics from the Bureau of Indian Affairs estimated in 1993 that as \nmany as 90,000 native American families were in need of improved \nhousing and nearly 50,000 families need new homes.\n  Further, a study completed by the Commission on American Indian, \nAlaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing, found that housing \nshortages and deplorable living conditions are at crisis proportions in \nmany native American communities. In its study the commission \ndocumented several obstacles that stand between Indian people and \naffordable, adequate, and available housing.\n  The Commission found there is currently little, if any, conventional \nlending available to native people seeking to purchase a home.\n  In addition, many Indian housing authorities lack the expertise to \nmanage, coordinate, and maintain viable programs.\n  And importantly, tribal governments have had to rely primarily on \nFederal Government grant and loan programs to finance housing and \neconomic development projects.\n  As a result of the study, the Commission recommended the creation of \nan entity that could serve as an intermediary financing institution \nwith the authority to package mortgage loans, provide technical \nassistance, and serve as a clearinghouse of information for alternative \nfinancing programs.\n  Mr. President, the Native American Financial Services Organization \nAct is the culmination of extensive deliberations between officials \nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of \nTreasury, the USDA, members of my staff, and staff of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs. The purpose of this legislation is to \ncreate a financial infrastructure for commercial financing \nopportunities by and for Indian people. The primary mechanism that will \nbridge Indian tribes with the commercial lending markets will be the \ncreation of a Native American Financial Services Organization.\n  The Native American Financial Services Organization would establish a \nlimited Government-chartered corporation. A Federal grant would \ncapitalize the federally chartered organization, which would cease to \nexist upon a designated date. At that point the charter would become a \nprivate corporation.\n  More specifically, the legislation is designed to:\n  First, establish and organize native American community lending \ninstitutions, that will be called Native American Financial \nInstitutions. These lending institutions could be any type of financial \ninstitution, including community banks, credit unions and saving banks, \nthat together, could provide a wide range of financial services;\n  Second, develop and provide financial expertise and technical \nassistance to the Native American Financial Institutions, including \nmethods of underwriting, securing, and selling mortgage and small \ncommercial and consumer loans; and\n  Third, develop and provide specialized technical assistance on how to \novercome barriers to primary mortgage lending on native American lands, \nincluding issues related to trust lands, discrimination, and \ninapplicability of standard underwriting criteria.\n  Importantly, this legislation will work in conjunction with the \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions [CDFI] fund established in \nthe Reigle Community Development Banking and Regulatory Improvement \nAct, signed into law by the President last year. Under a cooperative \nagreement with the CDFI fund, this legislation will provide technical \nassistance and other services to Native American Financial \nInstitutions.\n  This week, Secretary Cisneros testified before the Committee on \nIndian Affairs. In his remarks, he stated that this legislation will \n``neither conflict nor duplicate the functions of CDFI or any other \nGovernment-sponsored enterprise, but is intended to supplement the \nefforts of existing organizations.''\n  In short, the Native American Financial Services Organization would \nhelp provide financial independence to the native American community \nand would begin to address the housing deficiencies by working to \nattract private capital into the Indian housing market.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks by making \nreference to a letter I recently received from the chairperson of the \nUte Mountain Ute Tribe, that I believe illustrates the great necessity \nfor this legislation. The letter states that the shortage of housing in \nthe community is so severe that among the approximately 1,500 tribal \nmembers, 400 are without a permanent home and that a waiting list for \nnew housing approaches 300 people.\n  It is for this reason, that I believe the Native American Financial \nServices Organization is much needed. Statistics such as this merit the \nneed for an innovative financing mechanism the Native American \nFinancial Services Organization can provide.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in the Record immediately following the full text of my \nstatement and that the statements of Senators McCain and Inouye, who \nare both original cosponsors, appear in the Record immediately \nfollowing the bill.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to include letters from the Ute Mountain \nUte Tribe, the Native American Indian Housing Council, and HUD's \nSecretary Henry Cisneros to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Your efforts to remedy the current housing situation \n     for Native Americans is greatly appreciated.\n       After a brief review of the draft NAFSO, I have some \n     initial observations. First, with respect to governance of \n     NAFSO, it will be important to ensure that financial services \n     experts are either on the Board of Directors or in a position \n     to directly advise them. The issue here is that such experts \n     will be required for a successful NAFSO and to assist in the \n     establishment of NAFIs. Experts are necessary for the fiscal \n     management of NAFSO itself.\n       Second, along these same lines, there probably should be \n     some federal oversight, but not necessarily regulatory \n     control, consistent with the United States's trust \n     responsibility, to make sure NAFSO and NAFIs are properly \n     established and operated. This oversight would be in addition \n     to that required by the draft if NAFSO is authorized to \n     purchase and sell Native American mortgages. Please advise if \n     NAFIs would be subject to banking and lending laws as other \n     such institutions are. Third, a more detailed explanation of \n     what the ``tribal contribution'' will amount to in NAFSO's \n     future would be beneficial. Many tribes with limited \n     financial resources will have concerns about this facet of \n     the legislation and some indication of what such \n     contributions will entail may help to alleviate apprehension \n     about them. Nevertheless, some tribes may oppose any tribal \n     contributions at all. One would hope that the NAFSO could \n     operate on its own resources if it is indeed successful.\n       To sum up, my primary concern involves ensuring that NAFSO \n     will be successful, particularly considering it will be up to \n     the Tribes in large part to do so. Some expert or federal \n     representation on the Board of Directors would be helpful in \n     this regard.\n       Coupled with this consideration is the importance of \n     oversight for operations of NAFIs. This seems appropriate \n     since the draft implies these institutions will be very \n     similar to banks, institutions which are already highly \n     regulated.\n       As you may be aware, the Department of Veteran's Affairs \n     entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Tribe on \n     November 15, \n     [[Page S2835]] 1993 to assist us in obtaining home loans for \n     veteran tribal members. To date, no loans have been processed \n     under this Cooperative Agreement. At the same time, I have \n     some concern about HUD's involvement in this program based on \n     their inability to resolve this problem on its own. \n     Nevertheless, surely HUD has learned much from its mistakes \n     and should add to the process. Whether that agency should be \n     a majority voice in the decision-making or policy formulating \n     process is something that should be examined.\n       The shortage of suitable housing on this Reservation is \n     severe. We currently have close to 400 individuals without a \n     permanent home and near 300 which have placed themselves on \n     the waiting list for housing. Out of the 1500 or so tribal \n     members which reside here, this means over 25% of our people \n     are without a permanent home. We also have information which \n     indicates that upwards of 200 families are forced to share \n     their homes with other families to provide the most basic of \n     human needs, shelter. As you can understand, this desperate \n     situation seriously affects tribal member's sense of self-\n     worth and self-esteem.\n       Although this Tribe operates a Casino as well as other \n     successful enterprises, we must utilize those funds for \n     operation of the Tribal budget and economic development to \n     keep our people working and reduce unemployment. It is for \n     this reason that your draft NAFSO/NAFI legislation is \n     urgently needed. Again, I cannot stress enough how much your \n     efforts in this regard are appreciated. The Tribe \n     acknowledges this efforts and will endeavor to help where we \n     can.\n       Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment. Please \n     contact my office if you require anything further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Judy Knight Frank,\n     Chairperson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          National American Indian\n\n\n                                              Housing Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAIHC's Board of Directors \n     and membership, I am writing to thank you for supporting \n     legislation that is very important to the Native American \n     community. In particular, your support for the Native \n     American Financial Services Organization (NAFSO) is greatly \n     appreciated as NAIHC believes this legislation will bring \n     much needed relief to solving the housing problems for Native \n     Americans.\n       The housing needs in Indian Country remain acute and we \n     recognize that we must move beyond housing assistance from \n     the federal government. NAFSO will help us do so. We believe \n     that allowing the creation of Native American Financial \n     Institutions (NAFIs) will also stimulate local economies and \n     encourage privately financed housing.\n       Your recognization that NAFSO will have a positive affect \n     on Indian Country is appreciated and valued. Please feel free \n     to contact me if I can be of further support regarding this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ruth A. Jaure,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 1994.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am pleased to transmit to you the \n     ``Native American Financial Services Organization Act of \n     1994.'' For the past several months, the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development has been working with the \n     Departments of the Treasury, the Interior, Agriculture and \n     Veterans' Affairs, in consultation with the Native American \n     Community to develop this bill.\n       Based upon the findings and recommendations of the \n     Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native and Native \n     Hawaiian Housing, established by Public Law 101-235, HUD \n     believes that housing shortages and deplorable living \n     conditions have reached crisis proportions in Native American \n     communities throughout the United States.\n       Historically, financing for most Native American housing \n     and economic development has been provided through government \n     programs. These federal programs, however, do not fully meet \n     the needs of Native American communities. Furthermore, there \n     are few financial institutions that provide financial \n     services to these communities.\n       To begin to address this crisis, the Department is \n     proposing this legislation to improve the conditions and \n     supply of housing in Native American communities by creating \n     the Native American Financial Services Organization. This \n     legislation would establish a limited government-chartered \n     corporation to be known as the Native American Financial \n     Services Organization (NAFSO). A Federal grant would \n     capitalize the federally-chartered, for-profit NAFSO through \n     a cooperative agreement. Under the agreement, NAFSO could \n     assist Native Americans in creating local financial \n     institutions to address their capital needs. The Federal \n     NAFSO charter would cease to exist upon a designated date, by \n     which time it would be merged into a private corporation. The \n     legislation also provides for an ``asset cap'' that is \n     designed to limit the size of the NAFSO to $20 million. It is \n     anticipated that the NAFSO will be privatized in order to \n     grow beyond this limit. It also is anticipated that tribal \n     contributions would assist the NAFSO in becoming self-\n     sufficient over time.\n       The governance of the NAFSO would be vested in a Board of \n     Directors that would be representative of the Native American \n     community. Shares would be equitably distributed among \n     federally-recognized tribes; the Board could elect to \n     distribute additional shares on an investment basis.\n       It is the purpose of this Act--\n       (1) to help serve the mortgage, economic development, and \n     other lending needs of Native Americans by assisting in the \n     establishment and organization of Native American community \n     lending institutions that would be called Native American \n     Financial Institutions (NAFIs); NAFIs would be any type of \n     financial institution, including community banks, credit \n     unions and savings banks, and therefore could provide a wide \n     range of financial services;\n       (2) to develop and provide financial expertise and \n     technical assistance to NAFIs, including assistance on how to \n     overcome barriers to lending on Native American lands, and \n     the past and present impact of discrimination;\n       (3) to promote access to mortgage and economic development \n     credit throughout Native American communities by increasing \n     the liquidity of financing for housing and improving the \n     distribution of investment capital available for such \n     financing, primarily through NAFIs;\n       (4) to direct sources of public and private capital into \n     housing and economic development for Native American \n     individuals and families, primarily through NAFIs; and,\n       (5) to provide ongoing assistance to the secondary market \n     for residential mortgages and economic development loans for \n     Native American individuals and families, NAFIs, and other \n     borrowers by increasing the liquidity of such mortgage \n     investments and improving the distribution of investment \n     capital available for such residential mortgage financing.\n       At the outset, it is contemplated that the NAFSO itself \n     will not purchase and sell Native American mortgages \n     originated by the NAFIs, but rather will work with the \n     existing secondary market for residential mortgages to \n     increase the liquidity for such investment. However, if it is \n     later determined that the secondary market is not meeting \n     reasonable mortgage purchase goals established by this \n     department, the NAFSO will be authorized to purchase and sell \n     such mortgages.\n       The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development would be \n     authorized to provide up to $10 million, subject to \n     appropriations, for the funding of a cooperative agreement \n     for technical assistance and other services to be provided by \n     the NAFSO to NAFIs. In addition, there would be authorized, \n     without fiscal year limitation, $20 million to provide \n     financial assistance through the NAFSO to NAFIs. Funding \n     would be made available from the Community Development \n     Financial Institution (CDFI) fund. NAFIs are not eligible for \n     additional funding under the CDFI fund if the NAFI elects to \n     receive funding under this Act.\n       This legislation further provides that the Office of \n     Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight would regulate matters \n     pertaining to the financial safety and soundness of the NAFSO \n     in the event that the NAFSO is authorized to purchase and \n     sell Native American mortgages and the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development would have general regulatory \n     authority.\n       The ``Native American Financial Services Act of 1994'' \n     would provide financial independence to the Native American \n     community that has never been enjoyed before. It provides the \n     structure to marry private financial resources with Federal \n     and tribal resources in a way that benefits all parties. The \n     creation of the NAFSO would have the ripple effect of opening \n     avenues to economic development and housing that have not \n     been available heretofore.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that it has \n     no objection to the transmittal of this legislation to \n     Congress.\n       I request that the bill be referred to the appropriate \n     committee and urge its early consideration. I am sending a \n     similar letter to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, Thomas S. Foley.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Henry G. Cisneros,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE, Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a \nmeasure being introduced by my esteemed colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. This measure, the Native American \nFinancial Services Organization Act of 1995, is being introduced at the \nrequest of the administration. It is the end-product of a multiagency \nFederal working group whose goal was to craft a legislative proposal \nwhich would encourage, promote, and foster the delivery of housing and \neconomic development financing to native American families and \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult for many of us here to comprehend the \nsheer magnitude of the housing needs of this Nation's native \ncommunities. In 1993, the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the U.S. \nDepartment of Interior estimated that 88,689 native American families \nwere in need of housing assistance. But anyone \n[[Page S2836]] familiar with Indian country would agree that these \nfigures reflect a gross underestimation. I am pleased to note that in \nthe next few months, the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nwill be releasing the results of an assessment of Indian housing needs \nand programs. This survey is one of the most ambitious and \ncomprehensive ever undertaken, and it is my hope that we in the \nCongress will finally be provided with a more accurate picture of the \nhousing needs and conditions of native American families.\n  The Native American Financial Services Organization Act has its \ngenesis in the finding and recommendations of the National Commission \non American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian housing. The \nCommission, established pursuant to Public Law 101-235, documented that \nnative American Families and communities were overwhelmingly and \nconsistently access to conventional financing mechanisms, often due to \nthe unique legal status of Indian trust lands. The Commission \nrecommended the creation of a Native American Finance Authority to \ndirect sources of capital to native Americans, native American \nfamilies, and other eligible mortgagors in order that they might meet \ntheir housing and related infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. President, this administration heeded the Commission's call for \naction. The Department of Housing and Urban Development spearheaded a \nmulti-departmental effort, which included representatives for the \nDepartment of the Treasury, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the \nOffice of Management and Budget. The working group began with the \nCommission's legislative proposal, and ended with the measure which I \nam honored to be co-sponsoring today. This administration deserves to \nbe commended for recognizing the distressed housing conditions under \nwhich many of our native American families live and for taking \ndeliberate and meaningful steps to change and improve these \ncircumstances.\n  In many, many respects, the measure being introduced today addresses \nthe concerns of the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska \nNative, and Native Hawaiian Housing and embodies the spirit of the \nCommission's recommendations. But Mr. President, I wish to point out \none very fundamental difference between this measure, and the \nCommission's legislative proposal. The omission--one which I have just \ncause to be concerned about--is a glaring one, for while the original \nproposal included native Hawaiians, the bill before us today does not.\n  Mr. President, the Commission's final report documented that native \nHawaiians are among the neediest in the State of Hawaii--they have the \nworst housing conditions and the highest percentage of homelessness, \nrepresenting over 30 percent of the State's homeless population. Under \nany circumstances, the figures would be deplorable, but the truth is \nthat this situation can only worsen. I surely do not need to point out \nthat Hawaii is one of the most expensive States in which to build, \nrent, or purchase a home, and that, according to a recent survey \nconducted by the National Association of Home Builders, Honolulu ranked \n179th out of 185 places in home affordability.\n  Mr. President, I stand here, not only as a co-sponsor, in support of \nthis measure, but as the senior Senator from the State of Hawaii and \none who has long sought to address the housing needs of the native \nHawaiian people. I must express for the record my disappointment that \nthis bill departs from the recommendation of the very Commission which \nwas the genesis for the concept of a financial service organization--\nnamely that native Hawaiians should be included in this measure. I \nassure you that I will seek to honor the Commission's recommendations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join as an original \ncosponsor of a bill to establish a Native American Financial Services \nOrganization [NAFSO] that will provide financial incentives to increase \nhomeownership opportunities in Indian and Alaska Native communities.\n  Indian housing problems have reached crisis proportions with \nseriously deteriorating conditions and severe overcrowding. The latest \nU.S. Census report indicates that 18 percent of Indian reservation \nhomes are overcrowded, while the comparable data for the Nation as a \nwhole is 2. The shortage of housing is made even more acute by the \ndeplorable condition of existing housing in native American \ncommunities. Many Indian homes lack running water, indoor bathrooms, \nsufficient heat, or weatherization.\n  To date, most of the housing construction done on reservations has \nbeen financed directly by the U.S. Government. But Indian housing needs \nhave far out-stripped the capacity of Federal housing construction \nefforts. Everyone who has looked at the problem agrees that one main \nreason for the Indian housing disaster is an absence of private capital \nparticipation in financing housing in Indian and Alaska Native \ncommunities.\n  The bill I am cosponsoring today would begin to change the Federal \nrole in Indian housing in ways that strengthen and empower local tribal \ngovernments in their efforts to increase housing opportunities in their \ncommunities. The bill would do this by federally chartering a limited, \nfor-profit corporation to be known as the Native American Financial \nServices Organization [NAFSO]. NAFSO would assist Indians and Alaska \nNatives to create local financial institutions that will attract \ncapital investment in housing in Indian communities. It would also work \nwithin the existing secondary market to increase the liquidity of \nmortgages placed on housing located on land held in trust for Indians \nby the United States. If sufficient levels of private lending are not \nachieved, at a later date NAFSO could enter the secondary market itself \nto purchase and sell portages.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill contains a sunset-type \nprovision under which the Federal charter would cease and NAFSO would \nbe merged into a private corporation to permit further growth and \nattract private contributions, including those of tribes with funds to \ninvest in Indian and native American housing.\n  I look forward to a hearing on this bill because it will provide an \nopportunity for the Committee on Indian Affairs to evaluate this \nproposal to ensure that it is properly designed to accomplish its \ngoals. While a commission on Indian and native American housing \nrecommended the concepts underlying this bill, and while many tribal \ngovernments already are on record in support of the bill as introduced, \nI will ask tribes and tribal organizations to scrutinize the bill and \nprovide the committee with recommendations to improve it and sharpen \nits focus on the serious problems plaguing Indian housing.\n  I commend HUD Secretary Cisneros for his increased support for Indian \nhousing efforts, one of which is reflected in the Department's \ndevelopment of this NAFSO proposal, and I look forward to working with \nthe administration to enact this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 437. A bill to establish a Northern Border States-Canada Trade \nCouncil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nestablishment of a northern border states council on united states and \n                             canadian trade\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would establish the Northern Border States Council on United \nStates-Canada Trade. The purpose of this Council is to oversee cross-\nborder trade with our Nation's largest trading partner--an action that \nI believe is long overdue. The Council will serve as an early warning \nsystem to alert State and Federal trade officials to problems in cross-\nborder traffic and trade. And the Council will help the United States \nmore efficiently manage the administration of its trade policy with \nCanada by applying the wealth of insight, knowledge and expertise that \nresides in our northern border States on this critical policy issue.\n  Yes, we already have the Department of Commerce and a U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. But the fact is that these both are federal entities, \nresponsible for our larger, national U.S. trade interest. Too often, \nthey do not look after the interests of the 12 Northern States that \nshare a border with Canada. The Northern Border States Council will \nprovide State trade officials a mechanism to share information about \ncross-border traffic and trade. The Council will then advise the \nCongress, the President, the United States Trade \n[[Page S2837]] Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and other \nFederal and State trade officials on United States-Canada trade \npolicies, practices, and relations.\n  Canada is America's largest trading partner. Trade with Canada \naccounts for approximately one-fifth of total United States exports and \nCanada is the top purchaser of U.S. exports. Canada is also the largest \nsupplier of United States imports. Canada needs to maintain close trade \nties with the United States to assure its survival. The Canadian \neconomy is heavily oriented on exports, and most--roughly 75 percent--\nof that trade is directly with the United States.\n  Over the last decade, Canada and the United States have signed two \nmajor trade agreements--the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement \nin 1989, and the North American Free-Trade Agreement in 1993. \nNotwithstanding these trade accords, numerous disagreements have caused \ntrade negotiators to shuttle back and forth between Washington and \nOttawa. Most of the more well-known trade disputes with Canada have \ndealt with agricultural commodities such as durum wheat, peanut butter, \ndairy products, and poultry products, and these disputes have impacted \nmore than just the 12 northern border States.\n  But each and every day an enormous quantity of trade and traffic \ncrosses the United States-Canada border. There are literally thousands \nof businesses, large and small, that rely on this cross-border traffic \nand trade for their livelihood. Any disruption in that flow of traffic \nand trade, whether intentional or not, would have traumatic economic \nconsequences on hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in \nthe 12 northern border States.\n  The people best qualified to monitor that cross-border traffic and \ntrade live in the States along our northern border--States that share \nthat border with Canada. This is why it is important that the members \nof this Council be from those States.\n  My own State of Maine has had a long-running dispute with Canada over \nthat Nation's unfair policies in support of its potato industry. \nSpecifically, Canada protects its domestic potato growers from United \nStates competition through a system of nontariff trade barriers, such \nas setting container size limitations and a prohibition on bulk imports \nfrom the United States. This bulk import prohibition effectively blocks \nUnited States potato imports into Canada. At the same time, Canada \nartificially enhances the competitiveness of its product through \ndomestic subsidies for potato growers.\n  Another trade dispute with Canada, specifically with the province of \nNew Brunswick, served as the inspiration for this legislation. In July \n1993, Canadian Federal Customs Officials began stopping Canadians \nreturning from Maine and collecting from them the 11-percent New \nBrunswick provincial sales tax [PST] on goods purchased in Maine. \nCanadian Customs Officers had already been collecting the Canadian \nFederal sales tax all across the United States-Canada border. The \ncollection of the New Brunswick PST was specifically targeted against \ngoods purchased in Maine--not on goods purchased in any of the other \nprovinces bordering New Brunswick. The premier of New Brunswick even \nadmitted that his province had no intention of trying to collect the \nPST along any of its provincial borders. Only along the border with \nMaine.\n  After months of imploring the United States Trade Representative to \ndo something about the imposition of the unfair tax, Ambassador Kantor \nagreed that the New Brunswick PST was a violation of NAFTA, and that \nthe United States would include the PST in the NAFTA dispute settlement \nprocess. It has languished in that process for almost a year because \nCanada and Mexico have been stubbornly refusing to finalize the details \nof the NAFTA dispute resolution process.\n  Throughout the early months of the PST dispute, we in the State of \nMaine had enormous difficulty convincing our Federal trade officials \nthat the PST was in fact an international trade dispute that\n warranted their attention action. We had no way of knowing if the PST \nwas a national problem, or a localized one. If a body like the Northern \nState Trade Council had been in existence when the collection of the \nPST began, if would have immediately started investigating the issue to \ndetermine its causes and make recommendations on how to deal with it.\n\n  In short, the Northern Border States Council will serve as the eyes \nand ears for our States that share a border with Canada, and are \nvulnerable to fluctuations in cross-border trade and traffic. The \nCouncil will be a tool for Federal and State officials to use in \nmonitoring their cross-border trade. It will help ensure that national \ntrade policy regarding America's largest trading partner will be \ndeveloped and implemented with an eye toward the unique burdens and \nopportunities present to the northern border States.\n  The Northern Border States Council will be an advisory body, not a \nregulatory one. Its fundamental purpose will be to determine the nature \nand course of cross-border trade issues or disputes, and to recommend \nhow to resolve them.\n  The duties and responsibilities of the Council will include, but are \nnot limited to, providing advice and policy recommendations on such \nmatters as taxation and the regulation of cross-border wholesale and \nretail trade in goods and services; taxation, regulation and \nsubsidization of food, agricultural, energy, and forest-products \ncommodities; and the potential for Federal, State, and Canadian \nprovincial laws and regulations--including customs and immigrations \nregulations--to act as nontariff barriers to trade.\n  As an advisory body, the Council will review and comment on all \nFederal and/or State reports, studies, and practices concerning United \nStates-Canada trade, with particular emphasis on all reports from the \ndispute settlement panel established under the North American Free \nTrade Agreement. These Council reviews will be conducted upon the \nrequest of the U.S Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, any \nMember of Congress from a Council State, and the Governor of a Council \nState.\n  If the Council determines that the origin of a cross-border trade \ndispute resides with Canada, the Council must determine, to the best of \nits ability, if the source of the dispute is the Canadian Federal \nGovernment or a Canadian provincial government.\n  My goal is not to create another Federal trade bureaucracy. The \nCouncil will be made up of individuals nominated by the Governors and \napproved by the Secretary of Commerce. Each Northern border State will \nhave two members on the Council. The Council members will be unpaid, \nand serve a 2-year term.\n  The Northern Border States Council on United States-Canada Trade will \nnot solve all of our trade problems with Canada. But it will ensure \nthat the voices and views of our northern border States are heard in \nWashington by our Federal trade officials. For too long their voices \nwere ignored, and the northern border States have had to suffer severe \neconomic consequences at times because of it. This legislation will \nrestore our northern border States to their rightful position as full \npartners in administering and managing corss-border trade and traffic \nwith America's largest trading partner.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 438. A bill to reform criminal laws, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S ANTI-CRIME LAWS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto address the serious problem of crime in America, while offering \nstronger protection to the victims of crime. My legislation will \npropose mandatory minimum sentences for criminals who use a firearm \nwhile committing violent State crimes; require truth-in-sentencing \nprovisions so that criminals complete at least 85 percent of their \nsentences; eliminate prison luxuries that coddle prisoners, and require \ncourts to order restitution for the victims of crimes.\n  Many of these proposals--which are designed to strengthen the crime \npackage passed by Congress last year--are not new. Some have already \nwon passage in the Senate as part of the Senate-passed crime bill. But \nthey are important proposals--and it is important for our citizens and \nespecially for our \n[[Page S2838]] children--that we include these plans to get tough on \ncrime.\n  When 23 million households will suffer from crimes this year, it is \nno wonder that crime is the number one concern of most Americans, \nwhether in a relatively safe State like Maine, or here in the District \nof Columbia. As Americans scan the front page of the newspapers every \nmorning, word of crimes right in our own neighborhoods catches our eye, \nputs us on guard--and keeps the American people on edge. We have been \nraised in a humane and advanced nation--and our citizens place a \npremium on safety, security. For too many Americans, the home is no \nlonger a castle. Too many Americans must lock up their homes like a \nfortress, and walk through our streets with fear because of the scourge \nof violent crime.\n  Indeed, Americans no longer feel safe in their own neighborhoods. In \nthe 35 years since 1960, the population of the United States has \nincreased by 44 percent. Over that same time, violent crime in America \nhas increased by more than 500 percent. Our Nation has lost its edge in \nlaw enforcement and in humane social efforts that meet the root causes \nof crime. Indeed, according to a recent study published in Business \nWeek, crime bears an enormous cost: The total direct and indirect cost \nof crime in America is a staggering $425 billion.\n  Sadly, crime does not discriminate across regional or social \nboundaries. Crime reaches to us all--and exacts a devastating personal \ntoll on its victims and their families and loved ones. Few among us \nhave escaped the devastating impact of crime. Every day, 14 Americans \nare murdered, 48 are raped, and 578 are robbed. In our lifetimes, one-\nthird of all Americans will be robbed. Three-fourths will be assaulted.\n  In the course of the average day in America, there is a murder every \n21 minutes. Rape is committed once every 5 minutes. Robberies occur \nevery 46 seconds. Burglaries occur every 10 seconds. Imagine: A boy \nborn in 1978 stands a greater chance of being murdered in the United \nStates than one of our brave soldiers in World War II stood of dying in \ncombat.\n  Last year, Congress passed the President's crime bill--a package that \ntook steps to punish violent criminals and keep them off the streets, \nand to address the root problems of crime. Unfortunately, however, the \nPresident's bill stopped short of proposals that I believe will give \nour Nation's anticrime laws teeth.\n  My legislation includes tough provisions to provide mandatory minimum \nsentences for violent State crimes, or State drug trafficking crimes \ninvolving the use or possession of a firearm. Clearly, we must crack \ndown on the violent offenders who have been proven responsible for the \nvast majority of crimes.\n  Studies by the criminologist Marvin Wolfgang show that just 7 percent \nof each age group was responsible for two-thirds of all violent crime, \nincluding three-fourths of all rapes and robberies--and virtually every \nmurder. According to Mr. Wolfgang's study--conducted in Philadelphia \nover a 13-year period--this 7 percent of the population had five or \nmore arrests by the age of 18. For every arrest, each individual had \ngotten away with another dozen crimes.\n  Indeed, it is estimated that last year, more than 1,100 convicted \nmurderers did not go to prison; more than 6,900 convicted rapists did \nnot go to prison; more than 37,000 individuals convicted of aggravated \nassault did not go to prison.\n  My proposal will impose tough mandatory minimum sentences on violent \ncriminals. For\n first-time offenders, we will direct the courts to impose sentences of \n10 years for those who possess a firearm; 20 years if they discharge \nthat firearm with the intent to harm another person; and 30 years for \npossession of a machine gun or other weapon equipped with a firearm \nsilencer or muffler.\n\n  Too often, however, even a tough first sentence is not enough to stop \nthe endless cycle of crime. More than 40 percent of murderers released \nfrom State prisons are re-arrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor \nwithin 3 years--more than 20 percent for another violent crime. Of the \n50,000 violent criminals who are put on probation this year, more than \n9,000 will not learn their lesson. They will be re-arrested in the same \nState within 3 years for another violent crime. An astonishing 10 \npercent of America's jail population--39,000 people in 1989--committed \ntheir current crime while out on parole.\n  So for second-time offenders, we will make our mandatory minimum \nsentences tougher; 20 years for possession of a firearm, 30 years for \ndischarge of a firearm with the intent to injure another person, and \nlife in prison for possession of a machine gun.\n  And for a third offense? Three strikes and they're out--for life \nimprisonment for any violent offender.\n  My provisions for mandatory minimum sentences will prohibit States \nfrom offering probation or suspended sentences, and we will direct the \ncourts that sentences cannot run concurrently. This legislation also \nprovides for Good Samaritans or for citizens who act in self-defense: \nthe provision will not apply to those acting in defense of person or \nproperty during the course of a crime committed by another person.\n  Criminals have also learned, over times, that the odds in sentencing \nare in their favor. For every 100 violent crimes reported, only 4 \ncriminals go to prison. The risk of punishment for a serious criminal \noffense has declined by two-thirds since 1950, while the annual number \nof serious crimes is seven times greater than it was then. This fact is \nnot lost on criminals, who know that if they scoff at the criminal \njustice system--and hire a good lawyer--they can go free in little, if \nany time. Even when criminals are convicted and sent to prison after \nappeals, they know that the average violent offender--who in 1990 \nreceived a sentence of 7.8 years--will serve just over 3 years in jail.\n  To make sure that convicted criminals serve their time, my \nlegislation will enact truth-in-sentencing provisions. In order to be \neligible for prison funding under the 1994 crime bill, this legislation \nwill require that States change their laws to require violent offenders \nto serve a minimum of 85 percent of their required sentence.\n  Prison is not meant to be a pleasant experience: it is meant, \ninstead, to serve as both a deterrent to crime and to rehabilitate \ncriminals so that they can again become productive members of society. \nToo often, however, our criminal justice system has coddled prisoners \nwith luxury items that even hard-working Americans can not afford. \nIndeed, our Federal prison system has earned the nickname ``Club Fed'' \nbecause of its luxury. I believe our Federal prison system must instead \naddress the root causes of crime as it rehabilitates prisoners. We \nshould eliminate the luxuries in our prisons from expansive weight \nlifting equipment to X-rated movies, cable television, computer, even \nminiature golf.\n  Instead, we should require every able-bodied prisoner to work, and \nbegin to return to society part of what the prisoner has taken. My \nlegislation will give the Attorney General 120 days to implement and \nenforce regulations mandating prison work for able-bodied inmates in \nFederal penal and correctional institutions.\n  In addition to these provisions that get tough on criminals and make \nour tough sentences stick, my legislation includes provisions to \nrequire increased fairness--and awareness--of the victims of crimes. \nFor the 5 million people each year who are victims of violent crimes--\nsuch as rape, murder, robbery or assault--these provisions will provide \nincreased security and peace of mind. While criminals can pursue one \nlegal remedy after another, victims of crimes quickly exhaust their \noptions and are frequently forced to quietly bear the brunt of the \ncrime, alone, and without restitution.\n  Victim restitution presently can be ordered by courts, at the \ndiscretion of the court. My legislation will require courts to order \nrestitution, and extends to the victims of crimes the same sort of \nsafeguards that we extended to women in the Violence Against Women Act, \nwhich I cosponsored in the House.\n  This legislation will state that victims should be reimbursed for all \nnecessary expenses related to the investigation and prosecution of \ncrime, whether child care, transportation or \n[[Page S2839]] other expenses. No longer will the economic cost of \nprosecution serve as a deterrent that could keep victims from \nvigorously pursuing justice.\n  This legislation also will require reimbursement to the victim for \nmedical services resulting from physical, psychiatric or psychological \ncare, physical and occupational therapy costs due to rehabilitation, \nand all other losses suffered by the victim because of the crime. I \nbelieve that these provisions provide basic fairness for the victims of \ncrime, and begin to balance our criminal justice system again by \nkeeping in mind the needs of crime victims.\n  Mr. President, the people of Maine and America have a right to be \npersonally secure, free from the fear of violent crime. My legislation \ncombines positive steps that punish criminals and keep them off the \nstreets, and to meet the often-overlooked needs of the victims of \ncrime. This is legislation that is overdue, and will improve our \nnation's crime-fighting efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Coats, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 439. A bill to direct the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget to establish commissions to review regulations issued by certain \nFederal departments and agencies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    regulatory reform commission act\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is well known that Federal \nregulations stifle economic growth. The cost of complying with Federal \nregulations alone is estimated to be between $300 and $500 billion per \nyear--$4,000 to $6,000 for every working man and woman in America. The \nprivate sector spends 6.6 billion hours year complying with Federal \npaperwork requirements. The number of pages in the Federal Register \nlast year was 45 percent higher than the number in 1986--without the \nClinton health care bill going anywhere.\n  These excessive and misguided mandates impose enormous economic costs \nthat limit economic growth and job creation. Small and medium-sized \nbusinesses--which are the businesses in my State of Wyoming--are \ndisproportionately hurt by overregulation because they have fewer \nresources to allocate for compliance.\n  Mr. President, the 1994 elections were about change. The American \npeople want less government in their lives. They don't want OSHA \ninspectors breathing down their necks, they don't want to pay for \nunnecessary EPA mandated facilities and they don't want Washington \nbureaucrats telling them how to live their lives.\n  That is why I am introducing the Regulatory Reform Commissions Act. \nThis measure is designed to look back, review, and reduce existing \nregulations. My legislation would establish three bipartisan Regulatory \nReview Commissions, one for each selected Federal department or agency. \nInitially, I have selected the Departments of Interior, Labor, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency [EPA]. Over a 2-year period, the \ncommissions will examine all regulations within the selected Federal \ndepartment or agency and determine if the regulations are justified and \nreport all appropriate changes to Congress, the department, and the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]. The commissions \nwill examine the department's or agency's rules based on the following \ncriteria: Whether the regulations are within the scope of authority of \nthe statutes under which the regulations were issued; whether the \nregulations are consistent with the original intent of Congress; \nwhether the regulations are based on cost/benefit analysis; and whether \nthe regulations are subject to judicial review.\n  There have been several different proposals, which I support, to \nprevent new onerous regulations. This legislation is a perfect fit with \nthose efforts, because it reviews the rules already on the books.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the effort against \noverregulation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Moynihan, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Reid, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Pell):\n  S. 440. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \nthe designation of the National Highway System, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          the national highway system designation act of 1995\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nChairman Chafee, Senator Baucus, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Bond, and \nothers.\n  We are here today to provide assurances to the States, to commercial \nactivities dependent on a viable transportation system, and to the \nmotoring public that the Congress will enact the National Highway \nSystem legislation this year.\n  The legislation I am introducing to designate the National Highway \nSystem is sponsored by 14 of my colleagues.\n  The National Highway System is the cornerstone of the 1991 ISTEA \nstatute which preserves a Federal role in a core surface transportation \nnetwork.\n  As we come to the completion of the Eisenhower Interstate System, the \nNHS is the next generation of Federal focus to meet transportation \nchallenges into the 21st century.\n  This system of 159,000 miles--although only a small fraction of \nhighways in this country--consists of the 44,000-mile Interstate System \nand other primary routes.\n  Today, we affirm that Federal responsibility by ensuring a \nconsistency of road engineering and safety among the States to provide \nfor the free flow of commerce and to efficiently move people.\n  Ideally, Congress has only to approve the map which is the product of \na joint effort between the Department of Transportation and our States. \nBut, pragmatically, we all know that this legislation will be the 18-\nwheeler that will carry other issues.\n  We must not, however, be detoured from our mission.\n  Without passage of this bill, we know that our States will be \ncrippled by the sanction of a loss of $6 billion until Congress does \nits job.\n  The NHS also will allow States to benefit from the flexibility and \nintermodalism which is the hallmark of ISTEA.\n  For the first time, States will focus their investments on connecting \nour rail, air, commercial water ports, and highways so that performance \nof the entire system can be maximized.\n  The NHS also provides an opportunity for States to target their \nfuture investments on these routes which carry high volumes of commuter \ntraffic and commercial truck traffic.\n  Improving the safety of the motoring public must remain a Federal \npriority.\n  Routes on the NHS must be among the first to benefit from the \napplication of new and emerging technologies to improve safety and \nreduce congestion.\n  In Virginia, the twin problems of congestion and safety in major \nurban/suburban areas have been the focus of our transportation policies \nfor some time.\n  We only need to look at Sunday's Washington Post to remind us of the \ndangers of driving on the Capital Beltway.\n  Again this morning, our commuters and commerce suffered extensive \ndelays on the Capital Beltway when a tractor-trailer accident at the \nCabin John Bridge closed a large segment of the beltway for hours.\n  As a result of this gridlock, commuters cannot get to work and \ninterstate commerce is delayed. That translates into reduced \nproductivity and wasted resources for all Americans.\n  The legislation we are introducing today also includes modest \nprovisions to provide uniformity and flexibility to States as they \ncontinue to implement ISTEA.\n  As States enter the fourth year of ISTEA and we have sufficient \ninformation and experience to support these modifications.\n  As we move this legislation forward, my focus will be to reduce \nmandates on our States, without jeopardizing the safety of the \ntraveling public, and to increase flexibility for States to allocate \nfunds to meet their own needs.\n  [[Page S2840]] Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  National Highway System Designation Act of 1995--Section by Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1: Short Title.\n       Sec. 2:\n       Section 2 approves the most recent National Highway System \n     submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Transportation. The \n     section also specifies the procedure for future changes and \n     modifications to the NHS after Congress has adopted the \n     initial system. At the request of a State, the Secretary may \n     add a new route segment to the NHS or delete an existing \n     route segment and any connection to the route segment, as \n     long as the segment or connection is within the jurisdiction \n     of the requesting State and the total mileage of the NHS \n     (including any route segment or connection proposed to be \n     added) does not exceed 165,000 miles.\n       If a State requests a modification to the NHS as adopted by \n     Congress, the State must establish that each change in a \n     route segment or connection has been identified by the State \n     in cooperation with local officials. This cooperative process \n     between the State and local officials will be carried out \n     under the existing transportation planning activities for \n     metropolitan areas and the statewide planning processes \n     established under ISTEA.\n       Congress will not approve or disapprove any subsequent \n     modifications made to the NHS. The cooperative planning \n     process between State and local officials, along with the \n     approval of the Secretary, is the appropriate forum for \n     considering modifications to the NHS following enactment of \n     this legislation.\n       Sec. 3:\n       Section 3 amends section 103(i) of title 23 to permit \n     States to use National Highway System and Congestion \n     Mitigation and Air Quality funds for operational expenses of \n     Intelligent Vehicle Highways System (IVHS) projects for an \n     unlimited period of time rather than the two years currently \n     stipulated.\n       Sec. 4:\n       Section 4 amends section 104 of title 23 to permit a State \n     to transfer 60 percent of its bridge apportionments to its \n     National Highway System or Surface Transportation Program \n     categories.\n       Sec. 5:\n       Section 5 amends section 129(a)(5) of title 23 to provide \n     that the Federal share for participation in toll highways, \n     bridges, and tunnels shall be a percentage as determined by \n     the State but not to exceed 80 percent. Depending on the \n     facility, the federal share currently ranges from 50 to 80 \n     percent.\n       Sec. 6:\n       Section 6 amends 217(f) of title 23 to permit states to \n     apply the federal lands sliding scale match to bicycle and \n     pedestrian projects.\n       Sec. 7:\n       Section 7 amends section 323 of title 23 to allow private \n     funds, materials and services to be donated to an activity \n     eligible under title 23 and permits a state to apply 100 \n     percent of such donated funds, materials or services to the \n     State's matching share under title 23.\n       Sec. 8:\n       Section 8 states that notwithstanding any requirements of \n     the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, no state is required to \n     erect signs which establish speed limits, distance or other \n     measurements using the metric system. If a state chooses to \n     use its federal-aid highway funds for such a purpose, it may \n     do so.\n       Sec. 9:\n       Section 9 requires states to receive U.S. Department of \n     Transportation approval for Intelligent Vehicle Highway \n     System (IVHS) projects within two years of receiving funds \n     for this purpose. If after two years the Secretary has not \n     approved a plan, the DOT may redirect unobligated funds to \n     another IVHS project. Prior to such redirection, the \n     Secretary shall notify the intended recipient that they are \n     in danger of losing their funds.\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Warner \nin introducing legislation today that will approve the designation of \nthe National Highway System.\n  As my colleagues will remember, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee fashioned what I believe is a landmark surface transportation \nbill now known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \nof 1991 or ISTEA. The purpose of this surface transportation law is to \nprovide mobility for all our citizens, to enable our country to be \ncompetitive internationally, to promote economic development, and to \nprovide transportation facilities that are sensitive to the environment \nand the communities they pass through.\n  The National Highway System, established by the surface \ntransportation law, is an important part of our country's National \nTransportation System.\n  The National Highway System, which includes the Interstate System \nrepresents 4 percent of the highway system but carries 40 percent of \nthe Nation's highway travel. Even more importantly, it connects \nintermodal and strategic facilities including our ports, airports, \ntrain stations, and military bases.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation worked with the States and \nlocal governments to develop the National Highway System. In December \nof 1993 the Department transmitted the proposed System to Congress. \nCongress must approve the National Highway System by September 30 of \nthis year, or States will not receive over $6 billion in highway funds.\n  The NHS legislation we are introducing today maintains the important \nprinciples that ISTEA established for the National Highway System.\n  First, it maintains the flexibility of the NHS so that the System can \nchange as our transportation needs change. The legislation enables \nStates, in consultation with local officials, and the Secretary of \nTransportation to add to and delete routes from the System.\n  Second, the amount of funding a State receives for the NHS program is \nnot tied to the number of miles it has on the NHS System. There is no \nincentive to pad the System with a lot of miles in hopes of receiving \nmore of the Federal money.\n  And third, the NHS funds retain their flexibility. States continue to \nhave the ability to transfer NHS funds to other categories to target \ntheir highest priority needs.\n  In addition to the approval of the National Highway System, the \nlegislation we are introducing today includes several other provisions \nthat are in keeping with the principles of ISTEA to provide flexibility \nwherever possible.\n  Stability is very important in the Federal-aid highway program. \nStates need the assurance of long-term funding to efficiently manage \ntheir transportation programs. As the NHS legislation makes its way \nthrough Congress this year, there may be a temptation to reopen the \nsurface transportation law and debate items that are controversial. To \ndisrupt this program and make significant changes in midstream will \ndamage the transportation program. If we are to meet the September 30 \ndeadline for approval of the National Highway System, contentious \nissues must be postponed until ISTEA is reauthorized in 1997.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing the National \nHighway System bill and will work with them for its early \napproval.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 441. A bill to reauthorize appropriations for certain programs \nunder the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n     the indian child protection and family violence protection act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nreauthorize Public Law 101-630, the Indian Child Protection and Family \nViolence Prevention Act. This bill will provide a 2-year \nreauthorization of appropriations pursuant to sections 409, 410, and \n411 of the act. These sections are critical to Indian tribal \ngovernments in preventing and treating incidents of child abuse and \nfamily violence at the local level. Specifically, section 409 requires \nthe Indian Health Service [IHS] and the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] \nto cooperatively establish an Indian Child Abuse Treatment Grant \nProgram, section 410 requires the BIA to establish Indian child \nresource and family services centers to provide technical assistance, \ntraining, and to develop policies and procedures on child abuse for \nIndian tribes, and section 411 requires the BIA to establish an Indian \nChild Protection and Family Violence Prevention Program.\n  Mr. President, the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence \nPrevention Act was enacted into law on November 28, 1990 to address \nconcerns raised by the findings of the Senate Select Committee on \nIndian Affairs and the Special Committee on Investigations. What these \ncommittees found through public hearings was that Indian country was \nliterally a safe haven for child abuse perpetrators to prey upon Indian \nchildren. I'm sure that many of my colleagues in the Congress \n[[Page S2841]] will recall the notorious cases of multiple child sexual \nabuse that rose within the Hopi, Navajo, and Cherokee Indian \nreservations. These crimes were perpetrated over the course of many \nyears, and in some cases, the crimes were perpetrated upon generations \nof families. The Federal investigation and prosecution of these crimes \nprovided insight into the purposeful plan of the perpetrators in \ncommitting their crimes in Indian communities. Child abuse perpetrators \nwere aware that the conditions of detecting, reporting, investigating, \nand preventing crimes upon children were in such a sorry state that \nthere crimes would rarely be detected. As a result, hundreds of Indian \nchildren, their families, and communities needlessly suffered.\n  Both the Special Committee on Investigations and the Committee on \nIndian Affairs held numerous hours of testimony in which both tribal \nand Federal witnesses testified about the serious deficiencies in the \nFederal Governments efforts to assist tribal governments in preventing \nand treating child abuse and family violence. The hearings disclosed \nthat the BIA's failure to implement effective background checks on \npotential employees having contact with children resulted in negligent \nhiring practices, and child abuse reporting procedures deterred \nemployees from reporting suspected child abuse. Tribal witnesses \ntestified that law enforcement and social services lacked coordinated \napproaches to address child victimization. As a result, victims were \noften further\n traumatized by repeated interviews by physicians, social workers, \ninvestigators, and prosecutors. The hearings also revealed that due to \nscare resources, tribal social workers and mental health professional \nexperienced case loads exceeding national standards. It also became \nvery clear that both the IHS and the BIA lacked the professional \nexperience necessary to treat incidents of child sexual abuse.\n\n  The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act was \nintended to give the Federal Government an opportunity to meet it's \nresponsibility to Indian children and families by establishing policies \nand programs which would prevent the tragedies of child abuse and \nfamily violence. To accomplish the goals of the act, appropriations \nwere authorized per fiscal year from 1990 through 1995 to establish \nprevention and treatment programs within the BIA and IHS. The act also \nauthorize the BIA and IHS to assist tribes in establishing on-\nreservation child abuse prevention and treatment programs. The act also \ncreated mandatory Federal child abuse reporting and prescribed a \nprocess by which child abuse allegations would be handled to prevent \nfurther trauma to a victim.\n  Mr. President, the implementation of this act has had positive \nresults in Indian country. Indian tribal governments have initiated \nlocal public education programs on the prevention and detection of \nchild abuse and domestic violence. However, these local efforts have \nbeen so successful that reports of child abuse and domestic violence \nincidents have increased substantially. Therefore, the need for funding \nfor treatment of these victims has also substantially increased. Last \nCongress, the Committee on Indian Affairs received testimony from \ntribal governments which documented these needs, and which called for \nmore vigorous implementation of the act by the Federal agencies.\n  Finally, I believe that the possible benefits of the act have not \nbeen fully realized. Neither the BIA nor the IHS have successfully \nrequested or received appropriations to fully implement the programs \nthat are so critical to the protection of vulnerable Indian children \nand families. As a result, Indian tribal governments that are in \ndesperate need of these services have had to rely on special \nappropriations and congressional earmarks to fund their efforts. Those \ntribes that are unable to obtain earmarks must struggle to provide \nchild abuse and family violence prevention and treatment services using \nexisting resources and piecemeal grants.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that extending the authorization of \nappropriations for the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence \nprevention act will enable the Federal agencies and Indian tribal \ngovernments the opportunity to continue and enhance the work that has \nbegun on behalf of Indian children and families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 441\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF PROGRAMS.\n\n       Sections 409(e), 410(h), and 411(i) of the Indian Child \n     Protection and Family Violence prevention Act (25 U.S.C. \n     3208(e), 3209(h), and 3210(i), respectively) are each amended \n     by striking ``and 1995'' and inserting ``1995, 1996, and \n     1997''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Dole):\n  S. 442. A bill to improve and strengthen the child support collection \nsystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE CHILD SUPPORT RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, on behalf \nof myself and Senator Dole, the Child Support Responsibility Act of \n1995.\n  This bill improves upon existing child support enforcement mechanisms \nand establishes new enforcement systems where none currently are in \nplace. Furthermore, it recognizes that the issue of child support \nenforcement goes far beyond parochial interests or state lines, that as \na national problem for our children and their families, child support \nenforcement merits a national solution.\n  When two people, whether married or not, have a baby, they incur an \nobligation to provide for and care for their child. When parents live \napart, the parent not living with, and providing day-to-day care for, \nthe parent is expected to provide financial assistance for the child.\n  Consider the facts: millions of American single parents and children \ncontinue to suffer from the consequences of a parent who financially \nand emotionally abandons them. For mothers who have obtained a child \nsupport order--and more than 40 percent have not--only half of those \nactually receive what is owed--the other half receives partial payments \nor nothing. Never-married single parents have a particularly difficult \ntime obtaining child support--1990 census data indicates that of all \nnever-married custodial mothers, 75 percent did not have child support \norders and more than 50 percent had household incomes below the poverty \nline. These statistics add up to significant economic and emotional \nburdens for single parents and their dependent children.\n  The Child Support Enforcement Program was first created in 1975 and \nsignificantly modified in 1984 and 1988. The program's purpose is to \nstrengthen existing State and local efforts to locate noncustodial \nparents, to establish paternity for them, to obtain child support \norders and collect child support payments. My proposed legislation, a \ncompanion to the House bill introduced by Congresswomen Johnson and \nRoukema, would assist the Child Support Enforcement Program with each \nof these goals.\n  To strengthen efforts to locate parents, it expands the Federal \nparent locator system and provides for State-to-State access of the \nnetwork. To increase paternity establishment, the bill simplifies \npaternity procedures, facilitates voluntary acknowledgment, and \nencourages outreach. To facilitate the setting of effective child \nsupport orders, it calls for the establishment of a National Child \nSupport Guidelines Commission to develop a national child support \nguideline for consideration by Congress, and provides for a simplified \nprocess for review and adjustment of child support orders. And to \nfacilitate child support enforcement and collection, the bill expands \nthe penalties for child support delinquency to include the denial of \nprofessional, recreational, and driver's license to deadbeat parents, \nthe imposition of liens on real property, and the automatic reporting \nof delinquency to credit unions. It also grants families who are owed \nchild support the right of first access to an IRS refund credited to a \ndeadbeat dad and permits the denial of a passport for individuals who \nare more than $5,000 or 24 months in arrears.\n  [[Page S2842]] Other provisions include developing a national \nregistry of child support orders, developing centralized State \nregistries, and requiring States to adopt the Uniform Interstate Family \nSupport Act, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on \nUniform State Laws in August 1992.\n  Through the enactment of this child support legislation I would like \nto begin to ease, and eventually lift, the economic and emotional \nburdens caused by delinquent child support payments. Noncustodial \nparents must begin to accept and bear responsibility for their \nchildren, who will reap the support they so justly deserve and \ndesperately need.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 444. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to \nprovide for the purchase of common stock of Cook Inlet region, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           the alaska native claims act amendment act of 1995\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nto amend the Alaska Native Claims Act of 1971 at the request of Cook \nInlet Region, Inc. [CIRI] to allow CIRI to purchase stock from their \nshareholders and retire the stock.\n  Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] in \n1971 to address claims to lands in Alaska by the Eskimo, Indian, and \nAleut Native people. Lands and other benefits transferred to Alaska \nNatives under the act were conveyed to corporations formed under this \nact. CIRI is one of the corporations formed under ANCSA and has \napproximately 6,262 Alaska Natives enrolled, each of whom were issued \n100 shares of stock in CIRI, as required under ANCSA.\n  ANCSA stock, unlike most corporate stock, cannot be sold, \ntransferred, or pledged by the owners of the shares. Rather, transfers \ncan only happen through inheritance, or in limited case, by court \ndecree.\n  To date, no Native corporation has sought to lift the restriction. \nFor the most part, this is because Native shareholders continue to \nvalue Native ownership of the corporations and Native control of the \nlands and other assets held by them. These shareholders, whose numbers \nconsistently register at the 70- 80-percent level, see economic \nbenefits in the continuation of Native ownership, and also value the \nimportant cultural goals, values, and activities of their ANCSA \ncorporation. However, a minority of shareholders favor assessing some \nor all of the value of their CIRI stock through the sale of that stock. \nThese shareholders include, but are not limited to, elderly \nshareholders who have real current need yet doubt that sale of stock \nwill be available to them in their lifetime; holder of small, \nfractional shares received through one or more cycles of inheritance; \nnon-Natives who have acquired stock through inheritance but without \nattendant voting privileges; and shareholders who have few ties to the \ncorporation or to Alaska, 25 percent of CIRI shareholders live outside \nof Alaska.\n  Under current law, these two legitimate but conflicting concerns \ncannot be addressed, because lifting restrictions on the sale of stock \nin an all or nothing proposition. In order to allow the minority of \nshareholders to exercise their desire to sell some or all of their \nstock, the majority of shareholders would have to sacrifice their \nimportant desire to maintain Native control and ownership of CIRI.\n  CIRI believes this conflict will eventually leave the interests of \nthe majority of its shareholders vulnerable to political instability. \nIn addition, CIRI recognizes that responding to the desire of those \nshareholders who wish to sell CIRI stock is a legitimate corporate \nresponsibility. CIRI believes there is a way to address the needs and \ndesires of both groups of shareholders, those who wish to sell stock \nand those who desire to maintain their Native ownership. The method \nembodied in this legislation is one that other companies routinely use, \nbuying back of its own stock. The acquired stock would then be retired.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed this bill at length with CIRI and I \nam convinced this is the best solution. This bill is identical to one \nthat passed the House, and was approved by the Senate Energy Committee \nlast session, and I look forward to its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Faircloth, and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 445. A bill to expand credit availability by lifting the growth \ncap on limited service financial institutions, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             THE LIMITED-PURPOSE BANK GROWTH CAP RELIEF ACT\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am today introducing the \nLimited-Purpose Bank Growth Cap Relief Act with Senators Mack, Bennett, \nFaircloth, and Bryan as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, this bill would lift the 7-percent cap on the annual \nasset growth of limited-purpose banks. This growth cap, which was \nimposed temporary under the 1987 Competitive Equality Banking Act \n[CEBA], imposes an arbitrary and unnecessary regulatory burden. The \nremoval of this cap would enhance the ability of limited-purpose banks \nto serve their customers, increase the availability of credit, and \nallow such banks to maintain assets on their balance sheets.\n  By way of background, the ownership of limited-purpose banks by \ncertain non-banking holding companies was protected by a grandfather \nprovision in CEBA. A grandfathered non-bank holding company was \npermitted to maintain its ownership of limited-purpose bank if the \nbank, first, did not both accept demand deposits and engage in \ncommercial lending; second, limited its cross-marketing of financial \nservices with affiliates; third, did not participate in activities in \nwhich the bank did not already engage prior to the passage of CEBA; \nfourth, did not provide daylight overdrafts to affiliates; and fifth, \nlimited its annual asset growth to 7 percent. Except for these \nrestrictions, limited-purpose banks were subjected to the same capital \nrequirements, regulatory supervision, community reinvestment \nobligations, consumer protection laws and banking laws as full-service \nbanks.\n  Mr. President, Congress intended these CEBA restrictions on limited-\npurpose banks to be only a temporary measure coexistent with the \nmoratorium on the ability of the bank regulators to permit banks to \nengage in additional securities, insurance and real estate activities. \nThe legislative history is clear that these restrictions would be \nreconsidered as part of comprehensive banking legislation. The overall \npurpose of CEBA was merely to preserve the opportunity for Congress--\nnot the regulators or the courts--to define more precisely regulatory \nsupervision over financial service institutions and competition among \nfinancial service providers.\n  Mr. President, Congress has not enacted comprehensive banking \nlegislation, although I am hopeful this important national policy \nobjective can be accomplished in this Congress with the enactment of S. \n337, the Depository Institution Affiliation Act of 1995, which I \nintroduced on February 2. Despite the significant changes in the laws \nand regulation governing the financial services industry over the past \n8 years that have enhanced the diversification opportunities of banks, \nsecurities firms, insurance companies and other financial providers, \nthe temporary and arbitrary restrictions CEBA imposed on limited \npurpose banks remain in place. The number of limited-purpose banks has \nsharply dropped from nearly 160 to only 23. And the remaining \ninstitutions are forced to labor under severe restrictions that cannot \nbe justified from a regulatory, public policy, or competitive \nstandpoint.\n  Mr. President, limited service banks have been frozen in time. \nCongress has enacted numerous laws to render full-service banks more \ncompetitive, efficient and financially strong. The growth cap is no \nlonger necessary from a regulatory perspective. In 1989 and 1991, \nCongress enacted legislation to increase the ability of regulators to \nensure that all banks are run in a safe and sound manner, including the \nauthority to freeze bank asset growth if capital levels decline \nsignificantly. And the restriction is not necessary from a competitive \nstandpoint. The \n[[Page S2843]] 103d Congress enacted interstate banking legislation. \nFinally, bank regulators and the courts continue to approve a growing \nlist of securities, insurance, and other financial services activities \nfor banks.\n  Mr. President, only a small category of specialized and limited \npurpose banks remain subject to onerous limitations on their growth, \nactivities, products, and customer relationships. This situation is \nboth unfair and unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, the Limited-Purpose Bank Growth Cap Relief Act would \nlift the 7-percent asset growth cap for limited-purpose \nbanks. It would not remove any of the other CEBA restrictions and it \nwould not allow the chartering of additional limited-purpose banks from \na statutory requirements that has outlived its usefulness.\n  Mr. President, the repeal of the growth cap is entirely consistent \nwith the objectives of the Depository Institutions Affiliation Act, \nwhich I introduced several weeks ago. Both bills seek to enhance the \nglobal competitiveness of the U.S. financial services industry and to \nready the regulation of that industry for the next century.\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich repeals a restriction on the ability of limited-purpose banks to \nincrease their assets by more than 7 percent per year. I believe that a \nremoval of this restriction will promote increased credit availability, \nand will enhance the safety and soundness of the 22 institutions that \nare subject to the growth limitation.\n  This asset growth limitation was adopted in 1987, in legislation \nwhich stated that the restriction was being imposed temporarily. It \nremains in place nearly 8 years later, although the objectives it was \nintended to accomplish have been achieved by subsequent legislation, \nregulatory act on and judicial decisions. For example, supporters of \nthis limitation said that it would help offset full-service banks' \ninability to establish interstate branches, an issue that has now been \naddressed.\n  Today, the growth restriction is not needed to protect the banks, \ntheir customers, or competitors. To the contrary, the growth cap harms \nthese banks, by imposing enormous and unnecessary compliance costs and \nby forcing them to dispose of assets despite adverse marketplace \nconditions and negative safety and soundness implications. It hurts \ntheir depositors and borrowers--and other consumers--by reducing \nlimited-purpose banks' ability to offer competitive banking services. \nAnd it provides no legitimate benefit to full service banks, whose \nability to compete will not be impaired if a small number of limited-\npurpose banks are permitted to grow assets on their balance sheets \nrather than outside of the banks.\n  The legislation I am introducing addresses only one of the \nrestrictions on limited-purpose banks: The 7-percent asset growth cap. \nThese banks will continue to be subject to the same requirements as \nother banks, including the provision enacted in 1991 requiring the \nasset growth of any undercapitalized institution to be curtailed. And \nthey will remain subject to additional restrictions unique to limited-\npurpose institutions, such as a limitation on engaging in new banking \nactivities, and a restrictions on cross marketing with affiliates. The \nneed to retain these restrictions is an issue that should be addressed \nin the near future, as we consider broader legislation addressing bank \nownership, affiliations and permissible powers. But the asset growth \nrestriction is a regulatory burden unrelated to these issues, and needs \nto be addressed now.\n  In the last Congress, a number of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle supported the removal of the 7-percent growth cap. I am \nespecially pleased that the distinguished chairman of the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and others are joining me today as \noriginal cosponsors of their bill. I look forward to prompt action on \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Levin, Mr. D'Amato, \n        Mr. Akaka, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Heflin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moynihan, \n        Mr. Robb, and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 446. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the public opening of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nMemorial in Washington, DC; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n          the franklin delano roosevelt commemorative coin act\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt Commemorative Coin Act. I am joined by Senator \nHatfield, Cochair of the FDR Memorial Commission, Senators Levin and \nD'Amato, FDR Memorial Commissioners, and Senators Akaka, Cochran, Dodd, \nGrassley, Hatch, Heflin, Hollings, Kennedy, Mikulski, Moynihan, Robb, \nand Simon.\n  The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Commemorative Coin Act authorizes the \nSecretary of the Treasury to mint 500,000 half dollar silver coins \nbearing the likeness of our great leader, President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, in the year 1997, to celebrate the public opening of the \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, DC.\n  A surcharge of $3 will be applied to each coin. Proceeds from the \nsale of the coin will be used to finance the construction of the \nmemorial. In 1992, the Congress mandated the FDR Memorial Commission to \nraise $10 million in private funds to supplement the Federal \nappropriations for the memorial.\n  The American people are deeply indebted to Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nfor his leadership in America's struggle for peace, well-being, and the \nassurance of human dignity. Personally, I will never forget the pride I \nfelt in looking to President Roosevelt as my Commander in Chief as he \nled us in the worldwide struggle for freedom during World War II.\n  All Americans enjoy more secure lives and a higher standard of living \nbecause of this great President. The Civilian Conservation Corps helped \nrestore America's forests and land; the National Rural Electric \nCooperative gave farmers a decent life; the Federal Highway Program \ndeveloped a national system upon which the automobile and the trucking \nindustries depend; the Works Progress Administration built schools and \nhospitals throughout the country and every American who receives Social \nSecurity owes a debt of gratitude to President Roosevelt.\n  The commemorative coin will do more than honor one of our greatest \nAmericans; it will also help ensure that an extraordinary era of our \nNation's history will live on as a legacy for future generations. I \nwant to assure my colleagues that this bill will not place any burden \non the American taxpayer. The profits generated by the sale of this \ncoin will cover all costs incurred by the Department of the Treasury.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation which will \nhonor one of America's greatest Presidents by establishing a \nmagnificent and historic national memorial in our Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide tax incentives to encourage production of \noil and gas within the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n         the domestic oil and gas production tax incentives act\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that is \ndesigned to help the domestic oil and gas industry not only in my own \nState of Oklahoma, but also the multitude of energy producing States \nthroughout the United States. We are all very much aware that a healthy \nand competitive oil and gas industry is critically important to the \nU.S. economy. The petroleum industry alone is burdened with the highest \ntax rates in corporate America. Changes fostered by this bill only \nlevel the playing field with businesses throughout the United States \nthat are trying to attract capital.\n  Through tax incentives for new and existing marginal wells, small \nproducers in Oklahoma, as well as throughout the United States, will be \nthe primary benefactors of my legislation. Independents find more than \nhalf of all new oil and natural gas reserves, and they drill almost 85 \npercent of all domestic wells--both exploratory and development--\nonshore and offshore.\n  The U.S. oil and gas industry is one of the Nation's major economic \nassets and has long been recognized as a world leader in size, scope, \nand technology. As such a vital national industry, we cannot afford to \ncontinue down the road we have become accustomed to for so long. We \nneed to focus our energies inward and try to help the industry \nrestimulate its growth. As a nation we must face up to the threat posed \nby mounting U.S. dependency on foreign energy imports from such regions \nas the Middle East.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Pryor and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 448. A bill to amend sections 118 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to provide for certain exceptions from rules for determining \ncontributions in aid of construction, and for other purposes, to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n          the contributions on aid of construction legislation\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am here to reintroduce \nrevenue neutral legislation to reinstate the exclusion from gross \nincome of contributions in aid of construction--known as CIAC--to a \nwater or wastewater utility. Joining me as cosponsors are Senators \nPryor and Reid. Senator Reid has taken the lead on this issue for a \nnumber of years.\n  This legislation has passed as an amendment in the Senate on two \noccasions. It is my hope that this year we will finally be successful \nin passing this legislation and having the President sign it into law.\n  Utilities are capital-incentive industries. Historically, they have \nreceived the capital for the construction of a utility extension \ndirectly from new customers, either through the developer or small \nmunicipality. The customer contributes this property, or a cash \nequivalent, to the utility. In this manner, existing customers will \nnot \n[[Page S2845]] face rate increases every time the utility gains new \ncustomers.\n  Prior to enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, CIAC were not \nincluded in the gross income of an investor-owned utility and therefore \nwere not subject to Federal income tax. In addition, utilities could \nnot take tax depreciation or investment tax credits on CIAC. The 1986 \nact repealed section 118(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and thus \nsubjected CIAC to tax as gross income. As we all remember, the 1986 act \nhad two basic premises as its core. One, the tax base would be \nbroadened and rates would be lowered. Two, cuts in individual rates \nwould be offset by increases in the corporate tax burden. Clearly the \nauthors of the 1986 act intended to ensure that the burden of corporate \ntaxes was spread to all industries including utilities.\n  The removal of the exclusion from gross income of CIAC was intended \nas a tax on utilities. In practice, the CIAC tax is not a tax on \nutilities, but a tax on utility customers, primarily on developers and \nhome buyers. State utility regulatory bodies, referred to as PUC's, \ngenerally require utilities to pass tax costs onto their customers. \nThis is done in one of two ways. The most common approach is to require \nthe new customer to pay the cost of the tax. But this is not a simple \ndollar-for-dollar charge. In order for utility to be made whole, it \nmust pay on the CIAC, plus a tax on the tax. The phenomenon is known as \ngross-up. Depending on the State, a gross-up can add as much as 70 \npercent to the customer's cost of the contributions. In other words, a \ncontribution of water mains valued at $100,000 would cost a customer \n$170,000.\n  Alternatively, the PUC's may allow the utility to recover the tax \ncost from existing customers or over a period of time from the new \nratepayers. Not only does this defeat the purpose of a contribution, it \nalso means a rate increase. And with many water utilities seeking rate \nincreases of as much as 25 percent in order to pay for Safe Drinking \nWater Act requirements, additional rate increases can lead to calls for \ncondemnation.\n  Whichever method is chosen, utilities do not pay the tax, they pass \nit on. Passing the tax on has detrimental effects, not only on the \nutility's ability to bring in new business, but on the environment, and \nmost significantly, on the price of new housing.\n  Any developer faced with a large gross-up will have to evaluate its \neffect on the bottom line. Depending on conditions in the local housing \nmarket, a developer will ultimately pass the cost of the CIAC and the \ngross-up on to the new home buyer. The National Association of Home \nBuilders has estimated that the CIAC tax can increase the cost of new \nhousing by as much as $2,000 a unit. This additional cost is enough to \nend the dream of home ownership for a young couple.\n  The CIAC tax also has some important environmental effects. New \ncustomers can avoid paying the CIAC tax by building their own \nindependent water systems. This leads to a proliferation of systems \nthat may not have the financial, technical, or managerial ability to \ncomply with the rigorous requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nSuch systems are referred to as nonviable. According to the EPA, in \nfiscal year 1990, more than 90 percent of the violations of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act were made by systems serving less than 3,300 \nindividuals. By encouraging the proliferation of nonviable systems, the \nCIAC tax frustrates the environmental policy goal of consolidating \nthese systems into already existing, professionally managed systems.\n  Mr. President, section 118(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, exempting \nCIAC from the gross income, should be restored. It is a tax on capital, \nnot income. It is not a tax on utilities, it is a tax on their \ncustomers. The CIAC tax increases the price of new homes, leads to the \ndevelopment of environmentally unsound water and sewage facilities, and \nreduces the tax base for all levels of government.\n  Most important in my opinion, elimination of the CIAC tax will help \nhome buyers, not by fueling real estate speculation, but by removing \nanother barrier to the purchase of a new home. Anyone who has bought a \nhouse recently knows you don't just pay the price of the house. You pay \nclosing costs, title costs, title insurance fees, attorney's fees, and \npoints. And when you buy a house hooked up to privately owned \nutilities, you also pay the CIAC tax--as much as $2,000 per unit.\n  This legislation was most recently estimated to cost $106 million \nover 5 years. I have included a revenue offset in the bill as \nintroduced that raises $140 million over the same period, thus netting \n$34 million for the Federal Government. The offset extends depreciation \non new water utility plant from 20 to 25 years and switches from 150 \npercent declining balance to straight-line depreciation. This offset \nwas suggested by the investor-owned water industry and is indivisible \nfrom the substance of the legislation which is the restoration of the \nexclusion of CIAC from gross income. The industry suggested it only for \nthe purpose of repealing the CIAC tax, and that is its only intended \nuse.\n  Mr. President, repeal of the tax on CIAC for water and wastewater \nutilities will have a noticeable effect on both housing prices and \nenvironmental policy. It is supported by the National Association of \nWater Companies, the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners, and the National Association of Home Builders.

A bill to establish the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in \nthe State of Illinois, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n                     ILLINOIS LAND CONSERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a most \nunique piece of legislation--the Illinois Land Conservation Act. This \nbill is the result of a broad-based, bipartisan consensus involving \nFederal, State, county and municipal concerns. It is a model for the \nland reuse challenges faced by so many communities throughout the \ncountry who are impacted by military base closures. I believe this to \nbe one of the most significant conservation and economic development \nefforts ever attempted.\n  The closing of the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant in northeastern \nIllinois has provided a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to recapture and \npreserve the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of the Prairie \nState.\n  The Illinois Land Conservation Act will create the Midewin National \nTallgrass Prairie. The term ``Midewin'' commemorates the grant medicine \nsociety of the Potawatoni Indian Tribe--the original inhabitants of \nthis area of Illinois. This prairie will comprise 19,000 acres of land, \nwhich is home to 16 State endangered and threatened species, all within \nan easy drive of metropolitan Chicago.\n  A 910-acre tract adjacent to the Midewin Prairie will become our \ncounty's largest national veterans' cemetery. Under the auspices of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, this long-awaited site will provide a \ndignified place of rest for the many veterans in this region who \nsacrificed so much for our country.\n  The remaining acreage will be developed as an industrial park and a \ncounty landfill by the local communities.\n  Mr. President, the impact of the Joliet Arsenal closing has been \nprofound on the entire region--particularly the small communities. The \nmunicipalities surrounding the arsenal have sustained the military \npresence here for the last 50 years, with several generations of \nfamilies involve in the important work of defending our freedom. The \nIllinois Land Conservation Act is our opportunity to provide a true \npeace dividend to those who have supported this vital facility over the \nyears.\n  I hope all my colleagues will support this innovative effort that \nrecaptures an important part of our past, and addresses our needs for \nthe future.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, in \nintroducing the Illinois Land Conservation Act of 1995.\n  This bill transfers land from the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant \nto the Forest Service in order to establish a national grasslands. This \nbill also turns over land to the Veterans Administration for a new \nnational veterans cemetery, and converts a number of former munitions \nproduction areas at the arsenal to local purposes.\n  Illinois is known as the Prairie State. This name commemorates a \nyounger Illinois, a region of rolling prairies, seas of butterflies, \ngrazing wildlife, and pioneers seeking out new lands to settle. At one \ntime, more than 43,000 square miles of prairie existed in Illinois.\n  Over the course of 175 years, however, development has crept over \nthese open lands. Farms, highways, and cities have been built to such \nan extent that today, only .01 percent of original prairie is left. \nLittle evidence remains of, in the words of Charles Chamberlain, the \nauthor of the Illinois State song, this ``wilderness of prairies.''\n  That is one reason why the bill we are introducing today is \nimportant, Mr. President--so important that it has attracted support \nfrom a broad, bipartisan array of Illinois groups, from industrialists \nto environmentalists, and from researchers to hunters.\n  The Illinois Land Conservation Act is more than just a bill to create \na national veterans cemetery, although it will address critical needs \nlong awaited by Chicago veterans. It is more than just a bill to create \na conservation area, although it will establish the largest in northern \nIllinois.\n  The Illinois Land Conservation Act, once enacted, gives Illinois a \nrare opportunity to preserve one of the last remaining areas of natural \nprairie. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to set aside such a large, \nundeveloped tract of property for environmental and recreational \npurposes. In a sense, this bill helps to protect a slice of ecological \nhistory, and in doing so, creates a legacy for future generations of \nIllinoisans to study and enjoy.\n  In April 1993, the U.S. Army, after announcing its intentions to \nclose the Joliet Arsenal, approached former Illinois Congressman George \nSangmeister to develop a concept plan for reutilization of the \nproperty. Congressman Sangmeister formed a commission of 24 local and \nFederal representatives, who, after several years of detailed planning, \ncountless meetings, and extensive negotiations, carefully formulated \nand unanimously adopted a land reuse plan. The Illinois Land \nConservation Act is the culmination of the commission's work.\n  At the heart of this bill is the creation of a 19,000-acre national \ngrasslands, to be known as the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie.\n  Located approximately 60 miles southwest of the Chicago metropolitan \narea, the grasslands will be a recreational treasure for city \nresidents, accessible to millions for outdoor activities such as \ncamping, horseback riding, hunting, hiking, and environmental \neducation.\n  The grasslands designation also will help to protect and improve upon \nwhat already is considered an ecological wonderland. Hundreds of types \nof plants and animals are found here, including plants indigenous to \nthe area for more than 10,000 years, and many threatened and endangered \nspecies. Many future projects are under consideration for the \ngrasslands, such as the restoration of wetlands and the reintroduction \nof bison.\n  [[Page S2847]] Another cornerstone of this bill is the establishment \nof a 1,000-acre national veterans cemetery. Identified as the leading \nlocation by the Veterans Administration, this cemetery, proposed for \nthe center of the arsenal property, will be a landscape rich in \nstreams, marshes, and hardwood forests--a magnificent and tranquil \nsetting for veterans. When complete, the cemetery will honor over \n92,000 Chicago veterans through the year 2030.\n  Mr. President, the Illinois Land Conservation Act is based upon a \nplan that has been carefully crafted by key representatives of the \nlocal community who have worked closely with Federal agencies and the \nState of Illinois. It deserves to move forward quickly.\n  This bill is an excellent opportunity to establish a monument to the \nfertile soils which cultivated the agricultural and commercial \nprosperity Illinois enjoys today.\n  It's an excellent opportunity to create the first and the largest \ntallgrass prairie ecosystem east of the Mississippi River.\n  And, most importantly, this bill is the last opportunity of our \nlifetimes to preserve a largely untouched, expansive tract of \necologically unique land in the State of Illinois. In the words of the \nChicago Tribune, this is our chance to ``save Joliet Arsenal land for \nthe ages.'' I agree, and urge the quick approval of this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Dole):\n  S. 451. A bill to encourage production of oil and gas within the \nUnited States by providing tax incentives and easing regulatory \nburdens, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the domestic oil and gas production and preservation act\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing The \nDomestic Oil and Gas Production and Preservation Act along with \nSenators Inhofe and Dole. A companion bill is also being introduced in \nthe House by Congressman Lucas and the rest of the Oklahoma delegation. \nWe are introducing this bill today in an effort to help revive our \ndomestic oil and gas industry which plays such a vital role in our \nnational security. If our domestic industry is to survive domestically, \nthen Congress needs to act now to provide incentives and regulatory \nreforms to encourage production in America.\n  Since the early 1980's oil and gas extraction employment has been cut \nin half. Employment in the oil and gas industry has declined by 500,000 \nsince 1984. Imports of crude oil products have increased by 200,000 \nbarrels a day over the last year and the import dependency ratio now \nexceeds 50 percent. In December 1994, crude oil production dropped to 5 \nmillion barrels per day in the lower 48 States which is the lowest \nlevel since 1946. We must take action now to save domestic production \nnot only for the sake of the oil and gas industry but for the sake of \nthe national security of this Nation.\n  I understand that today the administration released an investigative \nreport conducted under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \non the threat to national security from the rising tide of oil imports. \nI have not yet seen this report but previous Commerce Department \nreports have found that oil imports threaten the national security and \nthey were conducted when our foreign oil dependence was much lower. The \nquestion now is not whether oil imports threaten national security; \neveryone agrees that is the case. The question now is what are we going \nto do about it.\n  To date, the Clinton administration has done nothing to encourage \ndomestic production. In fact, in 1993, crude oil reserves continued to \ndecline by 788 million barrels. Natural gas reserves fell by 2,600 Bcf \nto 162,415 Bcf. I have been asking the Secretary of Energy for 3 years \nnow, what she intends to do to help preserve the domestic oil and gas \nindustry. In the President's 1996 budget there is nothing to aid this \nindustry. That is why I am introducing this bill today.\n  The Domestic Oil and Gas Production and Preservation Act is intended \nto do just what its name implies--encourage oil and gas production and \npreserve and revitalize the domestic oil and gas industry. This bill \nwould accomplish these goals in several ways. In title 1, we provide \nfor tax incentives. One of the cornerstone pieces of this legislation \nis a tax credit to preserve marginal production and to encourage new \ndrilling. This provision would make it more economical to keep a \nmarginal well producing during times of low prices and would provide \nincentives to producers not to shut in their marginal wells due to \neconomics resulting in a permanent loss of the remaining unproduced \nreserves.\n  This legislation also includes a tax credit for production from new \nwells that have been drilled after June 1, 1995. This provision is \nmeant to encourage domestic exploration which has fallen dramatically \nin recent years. During the early 1980's the average rig count was \naround 2,929. In 1994 the rig count averaged 775. This is less than \none-third the average during the boom years of the 1980's. If domestic \nproduction does not increase, our reliance on imported oil will only \ncontinue to grow.\n  In addition to the tax credit, this bill provides for several \ndepletion reforms. There are provisions to repeal the net income \nlimitation for computing percentage depletion, exclude marginal \nproduction from the current 1,000 barrels per day limitation, repeal \nthe property allocation rule for computing depletion, and freeze the \npercentage depletion rate at current marginal levels.\n  Until 1976, percentage depletion was designed to operate as risk-\nweighted depreciation for mineral properties. Since then, the multiple \nlimitations on the availability of percentage depletion as an effective \ncapital cost recovery provision has diminished our proven reserves. The \ntime has come to revise U.S. energy depletion policy. The circumstances \nthat prevail in today's crude oil market are precisely the opposite of \nthose that led to change to the depletion deduction in 1976. The world \ncrude oil market is now glutted with overproduction from Kuwait and \nunsold Iraqi supplies are threatening another oil market crash. When \nprices decline, many wells are lost forever and many other wells cannot \nbe drilled.\n  Percentage depletion should be reformed so that more U.S. production \nqualifies. Ensuring an adequate depletion allowance can reverse the \nfalling U.S. energy\n resource base. These reforms will encourage new technology \ninvestments, provide economic stimulus to a major U.S. industry and \ncreate new, high-quality jobs.\n\n  In addition to the tax credit and the percentage depletion reforms, \nthis legislation provides that geological and geophysical expenditures \nshall be treated as deductible expenses, it expands the existing \nenhanced oil recovery tax credit and makes it AMT creditable, it \nprovides an election for optional 5-year write-off of intangible \ndrilling costs, and it increases the amount of intangible drilling \ncosts that can be expended without being treated as a preference item \nfor AMT purposes. All these provisions will help encourage continued \nproduction from marginal wells, thus saving a valuable national \nresource from being lost.\n  Title II of this legislation calls for several regulatory reforms. It \nhas provisions that address the enormous and unnecessary financial \nresponsibility provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 [OPA '90]. \nThis bill clarifies that the definition of ``navigable waters'' under \nOPA '90 only applies to true ``offshore facilities,'' not facilities \nonshore. It also changes the amount of financial responsibility \nrequired under OPA '90 from $150 to $35 million with discretion given \nto the Secretary to establish a higher amount (but not higher than $150 \nmillion) taking into account factors relevant to risks posed by a \nfacility.\n  This legislation also addresses two oil and gas royalty issues. \nFirst, it establishes a 6-year statute of limitations on actions \ncommenced by the United States for recovery of royalties due under an \noil and gas lease on Federal lands unless a lessee has made a false or \nfraudulent statement with the intent to evade the payment of royalties \ndue. This provision is intended to give some finality to the royalty \ncollection process and require the government to be prompt and timely \nin their pursuit of any underpayment of royalties. Second, it provides \nthe Secretary discretion to lower royalties on oil and gas leases on \nFederal lands. This is intended to be used to help marginal wells, when \nprices are low, from being shut in as uneconomical.\n  [[Page S2848]] In addition to the aforementioned regulatory reforms, \nthis bill addresses two critical areas of reform, private property \nrights and risk assessment. Private property rights are protected by \nthe fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Unfortunately, the \nFederal bureaucracy has increasingly used environmental laws to trample \non these rights. Two of the worst offenders are the Endangered Species \nAct and the wetlands permitting program established by section 404 of \nthe Clean Water Act. This legislation incorporates the provisions of a \nseparate bill that I have introduced for the last 3 years entitled the \nProperty Owners Bill of Rights. The provisions of this bill require a \nlandowner's written consent before Federal agents could enter private \nproperty, guarantee a landowner's access to information gathered about \ntheir property, guarantee a landowner's right to dispute that \ninformation's accuracy, guarantee a landowner's right to appeal \ndecisions made under endangered species or wetlands law, and guarantee \nthat a landowner be compensated if federal actions under the Endangered \nSpecies Act or wetlands permitting program devalue their property by 33 \npercent or more.\n  The risk assessment provisions of this bill requires Federal agencies \nto use sound scientific data when risk criteria and benefits are \ndetermined. It also requires the agencies to make public the scientific \nbasis for each risk criteria and full disclosure of all assumptions and \nuncertainties. It also provides for a petition process to require an \nagency to review an existing regulation to ensure that benefits exceed \nthe costs.\n  Finally, title III of this bill abolishes the existing prohibitions \nagainst the export of domestic crude oil production. This provision \nwould also help encourage production in the lower 48 States.\n  Together, the provisions of this bill provide much needed incentives \nand regulatory relief to an industry that is vital to our national \nsecurity. The sooner the administration and Congress acknowledge the \ncritical importance of the domestic oil and gas industry and stop \nburdening this industry with high taxes and regulatory obstacles, the \nsooner we can take the necessary actions to preserve and revitalize \nthis important sector of our economy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Daschle) (by request):\n  S. 452.

I \nam also sending you an explanation of the revenue proposals of this \nlegislation.\n  This bill is the next step in my Administration's continuing effort \nto raise living standards for working families and help restore the \nAmerican Dream for all our people.\n  For 2 years, we have worked hard to strengthen our economy. We worked \nwith the last Congress to enact legislation that will reduce the annual \ndeficits of 1994-98 by more than $600 billion; we created nearly 6 \nmillion new jobs; we cut taxes for 15 million low-income families and \ngave tax relief to small businesses; we opened export markets through \nglobal and regional trade agreements; we invested in human and physical \ncapital to increase productivity; and we reduced the Federal Government \nby more than 100,000 positions.\n  With that strong foundation in place, I am now proposing a Middle \nClass Bill of Rights. Despite our progress, too many Americans are \nstill working harder for less. The Middle Class Bill of Rights will \nenable working Americans to raise their families and get the education \nand training they need to meet the demands of a new global economy. It \nwill let middle-income families share in our economic prosperity today \nand help them build our economic prosperity tomorrow.\n  The ``Middle-Class Bill of Rights Tax Relief Act of 1995'' includes \nthree of the four elements of my Middle Class Bill of Rights. First, it \noffers middle-income families a $500 tax credit for each child under \n13. Second, it includes a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year to help \nmiddle-income Americans pay for postsecondary education expenses and \ntraining expenses. Third, it lets more middle-income Americans make \ntax-deductible contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts\n and withdraw from them, penalty-free, for the costs of education and \ntraining, health care, first-time home-buying, long periods of \nunemployment, or the care of an ill parent.\n\n  The fourth element of my Middle Class Bill of Rights--not included in \nthis legislation--is the GI Bill for America's Workers, which \nconsolidates 70 Federal training programs and creates a more effective \nsystem for learning new skills and finding better jobs for adults and \nyouth. Legislation for this proposal is being developed in cooperation \nwith the Congress.\n  If enacted, the Middle Class Bill of Rights will help keep the \nAmerican Dream alive for everyone willing to take responsibility for \nthemselves, their families, and their futures. And it will not burden \nour children with more debt. In my fiscal 1996 budget, we have found \nenough savings not only to pay for this tax bill, but also to provide \nanother $81 billion in deficit reduction between 1996 and 2000.\n  This legislation will restore fairness to our tax system, let middle-\nincome families in our economic prosperity, encourage Americans to \nprepare for the future, and help ensure that the United States moves \ninto the 21st Century still the strongest nation in the world. I urge \nthe Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this legislation.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, February 13, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n General Explanation of the Middle-Class Bill of Rights Tax Relief Act \n                                of 1995\n\n\n                   tax credit for dependent children\n\n                              Current law\n\n       A tax exemption, in the form of a deduction, is allowed for \n     each taxpayer and for each dependent of a taxpayer. A \n     dependent includes a child of the taxpayer who is supported \n     by the taxpayer and is under age 19 at the close of the \n     calendar year or is a student under age 24. The deduction \n     amount is $2,500 for tax year 1995. This amount is indexed \n     annually for inflation.\n       In addition to an exemption for each child, three other tax \n     benefits may accrue to taxpayers with dependent or otherwise \n     qualifying children: the credit for child and dependent care \n     expenses, the exclusion for employer-provided child and \n     dependent care benefits, and the earned income tax credit \n     (EITC).\n       The EITC is a refundable tax credit based on the earnings \n     of the taxpayer. The EITC is restricted to lower-income \n     taxpayers and is phased out when earnings exceed specified \n     levels. Although the EITC is available for taxpayers without \n     dependents or otherwise qualifying children, the credit rate \n     and income range of the credit are far greater when the \n     taxpayer has one or more qualifying children. In addition, \n     the rate and income range are higher for taxpayers with two \n     or more qualifying children than for taxpayers with only one \n     qualifying child.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       Tax relief for middle-class families has been and continues \n     to be an important goal of this Administration. In 1993, the \n     Administration faced a projection of ever-increasing \n     deficits. Bringing the deficit under control and providing \n     tax relief for the working poor through an expansion of the \n     EITC were the first priorities. Having achieved more \n     favorable than projected results from the deficit reduction \n     program introduced in 1993, the Administration can now turn \n     to providing tax relief to middle-income families.\n       Tax relief to taxpayers with children is needed to adjust \n     the relative tax burdens of smaller and larger families to \n     reflect more accurately their relative abilities to pay \n     taxes. Available resources should be targeted to those in \n     greatest need and at greatest risk.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       A nonrefundable tax credit, which would be applied after \n     the EITC, would be allowed for each dependent child under age \n     13. It would be phased in, at $300 per child for tax years \n     1996, 1997, and 1998, and $500 per child for 1999 and \n     thereafter. The credit would not reduce any alternative \n     minimum tax liability. The credit would be phased out for \n     taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $60,000 and \n     $75,000. Beginning in the year 2000, both the amount of the \n     credit and the phase-out range would be indexed for the \n     effects of inflation.\n       Taxpayers claiming the dependent child credit would be \n     required to provide valid social security numbers for \n     themselves, their spouses, and their children who qualify for \n     the credit. The procedures that would apply for determining \n     the validity of social security numbers under the EITC, \n     discussed below, would apply for purposes of the dependent \n     child credit.\n\n                                                REVENUE ESTIMATE                                                \n                                            [In billions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         Fiscal years--                         \n                                                       -------------------------------------------------  Total \n                                                         1995    1996    1997    1998    1999     2000          \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax credit for dependent children.....................       0    -3.5    -6.8    -6.6    -8.3    -10.1    -35.4\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                education and job training tax deduction\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Taxpayers generally may not deduct the expenses of higher \n     education and training. There are, however, special \n     circumstances in which deductions for educational expenses \n     are allowed, or in which the payment of educational expenses \n     by others is excluded from income.\n       Educational expenses may be deductible, but only if the \n     taxpayer itemizes, and only \n     [[Page S2853]] to the extent that the expenses, along with \n     other miscellaneous itemized deductions, exceed two percent \n     of adjusted gross income (AGI). A deduction for educational \n     purposes is allowed only if the education maintains or \n     improves a skill required in the individual's employment or \n     other trade or business, or is required by the individual's \n     employer, or by law or regulation for the individual to \n     retain his or her current job.\n       The interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds is excluded \n     from a taxpayer's gross income to the extent the interest is \n     used to pay qualified educational expenses. To be qualified, \n     the savings bonds must be purchased after December 31, 1989, \n     by a person who has attained the age of 25. Qualified \n     educational expenses consist of tuition and fees for \n     enrollment of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the \n     taxpayer's dependent at a public or non-profit institution of \n     higher education, including two-year colleges and vocational \n     schools.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       Deductions for educational expenses combine needed tax \n     relief with preparation for new economic imperatives. The \n     expenses of higher education place a significant burden on \n     many middle-class families. Grants and subsidized loans are \n     available to students from low- and moderate-income families; \n     high-income families can afford the costs of higher \n     education.\n       Well-educated workers are essential to an economy \n     experiencing technological change and facing global \n     competition. The Administration believes that reducing the \n     after-tax cost of education for individuals and families \n     encourages investment in education and training while \n     lowering tax burdens for middle-income taxpayers.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       A taxpayer would be allowed to deduct qualified educational \n     expenses paid during the taxable year for the education or \n     training of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the \n     taxpayer's dependent. The deduction would be allowed in \n     determining AGI. Therefore, taxpayers could claim the \n     deduction\n      even if they do not itemize and even if they do not meet the \n     two-percent AGI floor on itemized deductions.\n       Qualified educational expenses would be defined as tuition \n     and fees charged by educational institutions that are \n     directly related to an eligible student's course of study \n     (e.g., registration fees, laboratory fees, and extra charges \n     for particular courses). Charges and expenses associated with \n     meals, lodging, student activities, athletics, health care, \n     transportation, books and similar personal, living or family \n     expenses would not be included. The expenses of education \n     involving sports, games, or hobbies would not be qualified \n     educational expenses unless the education is required as part \n     of a degree program or related to the student's current \n     profession.\n       Qualified educational expenses would be deductible in the \n     year the expenses are paid, subject to the requirement that \n     the education commences or continues during that year or \n     during the first three months of the next year. Qualified \n     educational expenses paid with the proceeds of a loan \n     generally will be deductible (rather than repayment of the \n     loan itself). Normal tax benefit rules would apply to refunds \n     (and reimbursements through insurance) of previously deducted \n     tuition and fees.\n       In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the maximum deduction would be \n     $5,000. In 1999 and thereafter, this maximum would increase \n     to $10,000. The deduction would be phased out ratably for \n     taxpayers with modified AGI between $70,000 and $90,000 \n     ($100,000 and $120,000 for joint returns). Modified AGI would \n     include taxable Social Security benefits and amounts \n     otherwise excluded with respect to income earned abroad (or \n     income from Puerto Rico or U.S. possessions). Beginning in \n     2000, the income phase-out range would be indexed for \n     inflation.\n       Any amount taken into account as a qualified educational \n     expense would be reduced by educational assistance that is \n     not required to be included in the gross income of either the \n     student or the taxpayer claiming the deduction. Thus, \n     qualified educational expenses would be reduced by \n     scholarship or fellowship grants excludable from gross income \n     under section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code (even if the \n     grants are used to pay expenses other than qualified \n     educational expenses) and any educational assistance received \n     as veterans' benefits. However, no reduction would be \n     required for a gift, bequest, devise or inheritance within \n     the meaning of section 102(a).\n       An eligible student would be one who is enrolled or \n     accepted for enrollment in a degree, certificate, or other \n     program (including a program of study abroad approved for \n     credit by the institution at which such student is enrolled) \n     leading to a recognized educational credential at an eligible \n     institution. The student must pursue a course of study on at \n     least a half-time basis (or be taking a course to improve or \n     acquire job skills), cannot be enrolled in an elementary or \n     secondary school, and cannot be a nonresident alien. \n     Educational institutions would determine what constitutes a \n     half-time basis for individual programs.\n       ``Eligible institution'' is defined by reference to section \n     481 of the Higher Education Act. Such institutions must have \n     entered into an agreement with the Department of Education to \n     participate in the student loan program. This definition \n     includes certain proprietary institutions.\n       This proposal would not affect deductions claimed under any \n     other section of the Code, except that any amount deducted \n     under another section of the Code could not also be deducted \n     under this provision. An eligible student would not be \n     eligible to claim a deduction under this provision if that \n     student could be claimed as a dependent of another taxpayer.\n\n                            REVENUE ESTIMATE                            \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Fiscal years--                    \n                --------------------------------------------------------\n                  1995    1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    Total \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEducation and                                                           \n job training                                                           \n tax deduction.       0    -0.7    -4.7    -5.0    -5.8    -7.6    -23.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                EXPANDED INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under current law, an individual may make deductible \n     contributions to an individual retirement account or \n     individual retirement annuity (IRA) up to the lesser of \n     $2,000 or compensation (wages and self-employment income). If \n     the individual (or the individual's spouse) is an active \n     participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the \n     $2,000 limit on deductible contributions is phased out for \n     couples filing a joint return with adjusted gross income \n     (AGI) between $40,000 and $50,000, and for single taxpayers \n     with AGI between $25,000 and $35,000. To the extent that an \n     individual is not eligible for deductible IRA contributions, \n     he or she may make nondeductible IRA contributions (up to the \n     contributions limit).\n       The earnings on IRA account balances are not included in \n     income until they are withdrawn. Withdrawals from an IRA \n     (other than withdrawals of nondeductible contributions) are \n     includable in income, and must begin by age 70\\1/2\\. Amounts \n     withdrawn before age 59\\1/2\\ are generally subject to an \n     additional 10 percent penalty tax. The penalty tax does not \n     apply to distributions upon the death or disability of the \n     taxpayer or withdrawals in the form of substantially equal \n     periodic payments over the life (or life expectancy) of the \n     IRA owner or over the joint lives (or life expectancies) of \n     the IRA owner and his or her beneficiary.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       The Nation's savings rate has declined dramatically since \n     the 1970's. The Administration believes that increasing the \n     savings rate is essential if the United States is to sustain \n     a sufficient level of private investment into the next \n     century. Without adequate investment, the continued healthy \n     growth of the economy is at risk. The Administration is also \n     concerned that many households are not saving enough to \n     provide for long-term needs such as retirement and education.\n       The Administration believes that individuals should be \n     encouraged to save, and that tax policies can provide a \n     significant incentive. Under current law, however, savings \n     incentives in the form of deductible IRAs are not available \n     to all middle-income taxpayers. Furthermore, the present-law \n     income thresholds for deductible IRAs and the maximum \n     contribution amount are not indexed for inflation, so that \n     fewer Americans are eligible to make a deductible IRA \n     contribution each year, and the amount of the maximum \n     contribution is declining in real terms over time. The \n     Administration also believes that providing taxpayers with \n     the option of making IRA contributions that are nondeductible \n     but can be withdrawn tax free will provide an alternative \n     savings vehicle that some middle-income taxpayers may find \n     more suitable for their savings needs.\n       Individuals save for many purposes besides retirement. \n     Broadening the tax incentives for non-retirement saving can \n     be an important element in any proposal to increase the \n     Nation's savings rate. Expanding the flexibility of IRAs to \n     meet a wider variety of savings needs, such as first-time \n     home purchases, higher education expenditures, unemployment \n     and catastrophic medical and nursing home expenses, should \n     prove to be more attractive to many taxpayers than accounts \n     limited to retirement savings.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       Expand Deductible IRAs: Under the proposal the income \n     thresholds and phase-out ranges for deductible IRAs would be \n     doubled; therefore, eligibility would be phased out for \n     couples filing joint returns with AGI between $80,000 and \n     $100,000 and for single individuals with AGI between $50,000 \n     and $70,000. The income thresholds and the present-law annual \n     contribution limit of $2,000 would be indexed for inflation. \n     As under current law, \n     [[Page S2854]] any individual who is not an active \n     participant in an employer-sponsored plan and whose spouse is \n     also not an active participant would be eligible for \n     deductible IRAs regardless of income.\n       Under the proposal, the IRA contribution limit would be \n     coordinated with the current law limits on elective deferrals \n     under qualified cash or deferred arrangements (sec. 401(k) \n     plans), tax-sheltered annuities (sec. 403(b) annuities), and \n     similar plans. The proposal also would provide that the \n     present-law rule permitting penalty-free IRA withdrawals \n     after an individual reaches age 59\\1/2\\ does not apply in the \n     case of amounts attributable to contributions made during the \n     previous five years. This provision does not apply to amounts \n     rolled over from tax-qualified plans or tax-sheltered \n     annuities.\n       These provisions would be effective January 1, 1996.\n       Special IRAs: Each individual eligible for a traditional \n     deductible IRA would have the option of contributing an \n     amount up to the contribution limit to either a deductible \n     IRA or to a new ``Special IRA.'' Contributions to a Special \n     IRA would not be deductible, but if the contributions \n     remained in the account for at least five years, \n     distributions of the contributions and earnings thereon would \n     be tax-free. Withdrawals of earnings from Special IRAs during \n     the five-year period after contribution would be subject to \n     ordinary income tax. In addition, such withdrawals would be \n     subject to the 10-percent penalty tax on early withdrawals \n     unless used for one of the four purposes described below.\n       The proposal would permit individuals whose AGI for a \n     taxable year did not exceed the upper end of the new income\n      eligibility limits to convert balances in deductible IRAs \n     into Special IRAs without being subject to the 10-percent \n     tax on early withdrawals. The amount transferred from the \n     deductible IRA to the Special IRA generally would be \n     includable in the individual's income in the year of the \n     transfer. However, if a transfer was made before January \n     1, 1997, the transferred amount included in the \n     individual's income would be spread evenly over four \n     taxable years.\n       The Special IRA provisions would be effective January 1, \n     1996.\n       Penalty-Free Distributions. Amounts could be withdrawn \n     penalty-free from deductible IRAs and Special IRAs within the \n     five-year period after contribution, if the taxpayer used the \n     amounts to pay post-secondary education costs, to buy or \n     build a first home, to cover living costs if unemployed, or \n     to pay catastrophic medical expenses (including certain \n     nursing home costs).\n       a. Education expenses:\n       Penalty-free withdrawals would be allowed to the extent the \n     amount withdrawn is used to pay qualified higher education \n     expenses of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, the \n     taxpayer's dependent, or the taxpayer's child or grandchild \n     (even if not a dependent). In general, a withdrawal for \n     qualified higher education expenses would be subject to the \n     same requirements as the deduction for qualified educational \n     expenses (e.g., the expenses are tuition and fees that are \n     charged by educational institutions and are directly related \n     to an eligible student's course of study).\n       b. First-time home purchasers:\n       Penalty-free withdrawals would be allowed to the extent the \n     amount withdrawn is used to pay qualified acquisition, \n     construction, or reconstruction costs with respect to a \n     principal residence of a first-time home buyer who is the \n     taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the taxpayer's child or \n     grandchild. A first-time home buyer would be any individual \n     (and if married, the individual's spouse) who (1) did not own \n     an interest in a principal residence during the three years \n     prior to the purchase of a home and (2) was not in an \n     extended period for rolling over gain from the sale of a \n     principal residence.\n       c. Unemployment:\n       Penalty-free withdrawals could be made by an individual \n     after the individual is separated from employment if (1) the \n     individual has received unemployment compensation for 12 \n     consecutive weeks and (2) the withdrawal is made in the \n     taxable\n      year in which the unemployment compensation is received for \n     the succeeding taxable year.\n       d. Medical care expenses and nursing home costs:\n       The proposal would extend to IRAs the present-law exception \n     to the early withdrawal tax for distributions from tax-\n     qualified plans and tax-sheltered annuities for certain \n     medical care expenses (deductible medical expenses that are \n     subject to a floor of 7.5 percent of AGI) and expand the \n     exception for IRAs to allow withdrawal for medical care \n     expenses of the taxpayer's child, grandchild, parent or \n     grandparent, whether or not such person otherwise qualifies \n     as the taxpayer's dependent.\n       In addition, for purposes of the exemption from the 10 \n     percent tax on early withdrawals for distributions from IRAs, \n     the definition of medical care would include expenses for \n     qualified long-term care services for incapacitated \n     individuals. Qualified long-term care services generally \n     would be services that are required by an incapacitated \n     individual, where the primary purpose of the services is to \n     provide needed assistance with any activity of daily living \n     or protection from threats to health and safety due to severe \n     cognitive impairment. An incapacitated individual generally \n     would be a person who is certified by a licensed professional \n     within the preceding 12-month period as being unable to \n     perform without substantial assistance at least two \n     activities of daily living, or as having severe cognitive \n     impairment.\n       These provisions would be effective January 1, 1996.\n\n                            REVENUE ESTIMATE                            \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Fiscal years--                    \n                 -------------------------------------------------------\n                   1995    1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExpanded                                                                \n individual                                                             \n retirement                                                             \n accounts.......       0     0.4    -0.3    -0.8    -1.0    -2.0    -3.8\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from New York, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nin introducing the President's Middle-Class Bill of Rights, a modest \npackage of measures that will make it easier for middle-income \nAmericans to raise their children, educate themselves and/or their \nchildren, and save for retirement.\n  These proposals are in stark contrast to the tax cut proposals \nadvanced by Republicans. The tax cuts in the Republican Contract With \nAmerica would cost four times as much as the President's tax cuts over \nthe next 10 years, with the overwhelming majority of the benefit going \nto those making more than $100,000.\n  According to a recent report prepared by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, while the Republican tax cuts would cost $200 billion over \nthe first 5 years, that cost would balloon to $704 billion over 10 \nyears. The President's Middle-Class Bill of Rights would cost less than \na quarter of that amount--$171 billion--over a 10-year period.\n  In other words, Republicans are proposing tax cuts that will benefit \nthe middle class, while at the same time asking those same middle-\nincome Americans to pay for tax cuts for high-income taxpayers that are \nthree times as large. That doesn't sound like a fair deal to me.\n  While there are some similarities between the President's tax cuts \nand those contained in the Contract With America, the principal \ndifference is that the contract includes tax cuts for high-income \npeople and large corporations. And, as far as their impact on the \nbudget and middle-income taxpayers is concerned, it is an exceedingly \nlarge difference.\n  Another way the President's tax cuts can be distinguished from \nRepublican proposals is that the President would provide middle-income \ntax relief specifically for higher education and job training. \nEducation and job training expenses are among the largest costs faced \nby middle-income families. Yet, education and job training are critical \ntools needed by middle-class Americans to build more quality of life \nfor themselves and their children.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Finance Committee already has \nheld hearings on the President's proposal, and I look forward to \nreviewing the committee's report on the testimony presented at those \nhearings.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Daschle) (by request):\n  S. 453.

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nFinance, I am today joining with the Democratic leader in introducing a \nbill, at the request of the administration, containing the statutory \nprovisions that implement the tax compliance proposals in the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 budget submission.\n  By making statutory language available early in the legislative \nprocess, the administration has aided the process of Senate \nconsideration of these provisions. This legislation also will serve to \nanswer many of the questions that the public may have with respect to \nthe President's tax proposals.\n  I want to thank the administration for providing this level of detail \nin so timely a fashion, and I look forward to working with them on \nthese proposals in the coming months.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  [[Page S2855]] There being no objection, the material was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Democratic Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I am pleased to transmit the \n     enclosed Tax Compliance Act of 1995 for your immediate \n     consideration. The provisions contained in this bill, which \n     were described in the budget submitted by the President to \n     Congress February 6, 1995, include a number of compliance and \n     related measures. Several proposals are aimed at curbing \n     offshore tax abuses. One proposal would close a tax loophole \n     that allows wealthy Americans to renounce their citizenship \n     and avoid paying tax on appreciated assets. Another would \n     tighten tax rules governing foreign trusts set up by U.S. \n     taxpayers and foreigners. In addition, the earned income tax \n     credit would be denied to undocumented workers and \n     individuals whose interest and dividend income exceeds \n     $2,500. Finally, the bill would authorize the designation of \n     two additional urban empowerment zones.\n       An identical bill has been sent to Representative Gibbons \n     of the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Democratic \n     Leader Daschle, and House Democratic Leader Gephardt. I urge \n     Congress to give the attached bill prompt and favorable \n     consideration.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this proposal to the \n     Congress, and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert e. Rubin,\n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         General Explanation of the Tax Compliance Act of 1995\n\n\n             earned income tax credit compliance proposals\n\n                              Current law\n\n       to be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a \n     taxpayer must reside in the United States for over six \n     months. Nonresident aliens are not entitled to the EITC \n     beginning in 1995. Other non-U.S. citizens are eligible for \n     the EITC if, among other things, they meet a six-month \n     residency requirement and do not file an income tax return as \n     a non-resident alien.\n       To claim the higher EITC amounts available to taxpayers \n     with qualifying children, those taxpayers are required to \n     provide taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) for each \n     qualifying child. Unless otherwise proscribed by regulation, \n     social security numbers serve as TINs. Some taxpayers are \n     unable to obtain social security numbers. Under section \n     205(c) of the Social Security Act, social security numbers \n     are generally issued only to individuals who are citizens or \n     who are authorized to work in the U.S. Undocumented workers \n     may not be able to obtain social security numbers.\n       The IRS must follow deficiency procedures when \n     investigating questionable EITC \n     [[Page S2860]] claims. First, contact letters are sent to the \n     taxpayer. If the necessary information is not provided by the \n     taxpayer, a statutory notice of deficiency is sent by \n     certified mail, notifying the taxpayer that the adjustment \n     will be assessed unless the taxpayer files a petition in Tax \n     Court within 90 days. If a petition is not filed within that \n     time and there is no other response to the statutory notice, \n     the assessment is made and the EITC is denied.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       The Administration believes that the EITC should not be \n     available to individuals who are not authorized to work in \n     the United States. During the past year, the Administration \n     and Congress have taken steps to improve the administration \n     of the EITC. Further steps are desirable to ensure that only \n     the intended beneficiaries receive the EITC.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       Only individuals who are authorized to work in the United \n     States would be eligible for the EITC. Taxpayers claiming the \n     EITC would be required to provide a valid social security \n     number for themselves, their spouses, and qualifying \n     children. Social security numbers would have to be valid for \n     employment purposes in the United States. Thus, eligible \n     individuals would include U.S. citizens and lawful permanent \n     residents. Taxpayers residing in the United States illegally \n     would not be eligible for the credit.\n       In addition, the IRS would be authorized to use the math-\n     error procedures, which are simpler than deficiency \n     procedures, to resolve questions about the validity of a \n     social security number. Under this approach, the failure to \n     provide a correct social security number would be treated as \n     a math error. Taxpayers would have 60 days in which they \n     could either provide a correct social security number or \n     request that the IRS follow the current-law deficiency \n     procedures. If a taxpayer failed to respond within this \n     period, he or she would be required to refile with correct \n     social security numbers in order to obtain the EITC.\n       These provisions would be effective for tax years beginning \n     after December 31, 1995.\n\n                                                REVENUE ESTIMATE                                                \n                                           [In billions of dollars]\\1\\                                          \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        Fiscal year--                           \n                                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1995      1996      1997      1998      1999      2000      Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEITC compliance proposals.................         0         0       0.4       0.5       0.5       0.5       1.9\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\Includes reduction in outlays.                                                                               \n\n        INTEREST AND DIVIDEND TEST FOR EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT\n\n                              Current law\n\n       To be eligible to receive the Earned Income Tax Credit \n     (EITC), an individual must have earned income. To target the \n     EITC to low-income workers, the amount of the credit to which \n     a taxpayer is entitled decreases when the taxpayer's earned \n     income (or, if greater, adjusted gross income (AGI)) exceeds \n     certain thresholds. The earned income and AGI thresholds are \n     indexed for inflation and are also adjusted to take into \n     account qualifying children. In 1995, a taxpayer with two or \n     more qualifying children will not be eligible for the EITC if \n     his or her income exceeds $26,673. The income cut-offs \n     decline to $24,396 for a taxpayer with one qualifying child \n     and $9,230 for a taxpayer with no qualifying children.\n\n                           Reason for change\n\n       Under current law a taxpayer may have relatively low earned \n     income, and therefore may be eligible for the EITC, even \n     though he or she has significant interest and dividend \n     income. The EITC should be targeted to families with the \n     greatest need. Most EITC recipients do not have significant \n     resources and must rely on earnings to meet their day-to-day \n     living expenses, but taxpayers with high levels of interest \n     and dividend income can draw upon the resources that produce \n     this income to meet family needs.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       Beginning in 1996, a taxpayer would not be entitled to the \n     EITC if his or her aggregate interest and dividend income \n     during a taxable year exceeds $2,500. This threshold would be \n     indexed for inflation thereafter.\n\n                                                REVENUE ESTIMATE                                                \n                                           [In billions of dollars]\\1\\                                          \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        Fiscal year--                           \n                                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1995      1996      1997      1998      1999      2000      Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInterest and dividend test for earned                                                                           \n income tax credit........................         0         *       0.3       0.3       0.4       0.4       1.4\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\Includes reduction in outlays.                                                                               \n*Revenue gain of less than $50 million.                                                                         \n\n       tax responsibilities of americans who renounce citizenship\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under current law, worldwide gains realized by U.S. \n     citizens and resident aliens are subject to U.S. tax. \n     Existing rules recognize that the United States has a tax \n     interest in preventing tax avoidance through renunciation of \n     citizenship. These rules continue to tax former U.S. citizens \n     on U.S. source income for ten years following renunciation of \n     citizenship if one of the principal purposes of the \n     renunciation was to avoid U.S. income tax. A similar rule \n     applies to aliens who cease to be residents.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       Wealthy U.S. citizens and long-term residents sometimes \n     abandon their U.S. citizenship or status as residents. \n     Existing rules to prevent tax avoidance through expatriation \n     have proven largely ineffective because departing taxpayers \n     have found ways to restructure their activities to avoid \n     those rules, and compliance with the rules is difficult to \n     monitor. Consequently, existing measures need to be enhanced \n     to ensure that gains generally accruing during the time a \n     taxpayer was a citizen or long-term permanent resident will \n     be subject to U.S. tax at the time the taxpayer abandons \n     citizenship or residency.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       Existing rules would be expanded to provide that if a U.S. \n     person expatriates on or after February 6, 1995, the person \n     would be treated as having sold his or her assets at fair \n     market value immediately prior to expatriation and gain or \n     loss from such sale would be recognized and would be subject \n     to U.S. income tax. A U.S. citizen would be considered to \n     expatriate if the citizens renounces or abandons U.S. \n     citizenship. A resident alien individual would be taxed under \n     this proposal if the alien has been subject to U.S. tax as a \n     lawful permanent resident of the United States in at least \n     ten of the prior fifteen taxable years and then ceases to be \n     subject to U.S. tax as a resident.\n       For this purpose, a taxpayer would be treated as owning \n     those assets that would be included in the taxpayer's gross \n     estate (determined as if the taxpayer's estate had been \n     created on the date of expatriation) as well as, in certain \n     cases, the taxpayer's interest in assets held in certain \n     trusts (defined below in Section II of the foreign trust \n     discussion). Exceptions to the tax on expatriation would be \n     made for most U.S. real property interests (because they \n     remain subject to U.S. taxing jurisdiction) and interests in \n     qualified retirement plans. An expatriating individual also \n     would be entitled to exclude $600,000 of gain as determined \n     under the proposal.\n       The IRS may allow a taxpayer to defer payment of the tax on \n     expatriation with respect to interests in closely-held \n     businesses. In those cases, the taxpayer would be required to \n     provide collateral satisfactory to the IRS. Payment of tax \n     could not be deferred for more than five years, and an \n     interest charge would be imposed on the deferred tax.\n       Solely for purposes of determining gain or loss subject to \n     the tax on expatriation, a resident alien individual would be \n     permitted to elect to determine basis using the fair market \n     value (instead of historical cost) of assets owned on the \n     date when U.S. residence first began. If made, this election \n     would apply to all of a taxpayer's property.\n       This proposal would replace existing income tax rules with \n     respect to expatriations on or after February 6, 1995. \n     Existing rules that apply to taxes other than income taxes \n     would continue to apply.\n\n                            REVENUE ESTIMATE                            \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       Fiscal year--                    \n                 -------------------------------------------------------\n                   1995    1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTax                                                                     \n responsibilitie                                                        \n s of Americans                                                         \n who renounce                                                           \n citizenship....     0.1     0.2     0.3     0.4     0.5     0.7     2.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n             revise taxation of income from foreign trusts\n\n       U.S. tax rules applicable to foreign trusts have not been \n     revised for nearly two decades. New rules are needed to \n     accommodate \n     [[Page S2861]] changes in the use and incidence of foreign \n     trusts and to limit the avoidance and evasion of U.S. taxes. \n     The Administration proposals would reform the taxation of \n     foreign trusts in five respects.\n\n              I. Information reporting and foreign trusts\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under current law, most foreign trusts established by U.S. \n     persons are grantor trusts, the income of which is taxed to \n     the grantor. U.S. persons who create or transfer property to \n     foreign trusts are required to report transactions with the \n     foreign trust to the IRS.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       The existing information reporting statute predates the \n     significant expansion of the foreign grantor trust rules in \n     1976. In general, penalties for noncompliance with reporting \n     requirements are minimal. U.S. grantors of foreign trusts \n     often do not report the income earned by foreign trusts and \n     often do not comply with required information reporting. \n     These foreign trusts are frequently established in tax haven \n     jurisdictions with stringent secrecy rules. Consequently, the \n     IRS's attempts to verify income earned by foreign trusts are \n     often unsuccessful. Existing penalties have not proven \n     adequate to encourage some U.S. taxpayers to comply with \n     existing rules.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       Notice of Transfer: Section 6048 would require U.S. persons \n     transferring property to foreign trusts to notify the IRS. \n     This notice would identify the trustee of the foreign trust, \n     indicate the property transferred to the trust, and identify \n     the trust beneficiaries.\n       If a transferor did not file the required notice, a penalty \n     would be imposed equal to 35 percent of the gross value of \n     the property transferred, valued as of the date of transfer. \n     This penalty would not be less than $10,000, and could be \n     further increased for continuing noncompliance.\n       Trustee Statements: Section 6048 would require trustees of \n     any foreign trust with a U.S. grantor or a U.S. beneficiary \n     to file two types of statements: a ``Section 6048 Statement'' \n     and an annual information return. In the Section 6048 \n     Statement, the trustee would be required to:\n       (1) appoint a U.S. agent (whether or not a trustee) who has \n     the ability to provide any information that reasonably should \n     be available to the trust in response to requests by the IRS; \n     and\n       (2) agree to file an annual information return for the \n     foreign trust.\n\n     The annual information return would be required to include a \n     full accounting of trust activities, including separate \n     schedules (K-1s) for income attributable to U.S. grantors or \n     U.S. beneficiaries, as appropriate. The foreign trust would \n     not be considered to have an office or permanent \n     establishment in the United States merely because of the \n     section 6048 activities of its U.S. agent.\n       There would be two consequences if the trustee of the \n     foreign trust did not file a Section 6048 Statement or the \n     required annual information return. First, the U.S. settlor \n     of a foreign trust would be subject to a $10,000 penalty for \n     each failure to file a Section 6048 Statement or annual \n     information return. This penalty would be increased for \n     continuing noncompliance. Second, the IRS would be authorized \n     to determine, in its discretion, the tax consequences of any \n     trust transactions or operations to a U.S. grantor or U.S. \n     beneficiary. Thus, for example, the IRS could impose a gift \n     tax on property transferred to the foreign trust. In \n     appropriate circumstances, the IRS could also impute taxable \n     income to the U.S. settlor based on the value of assets \n     transferred to or held in the foreign trust. A distribution \n     to a U.S. beneficiary could be deemed to come from income \n     accumulated in the year the trust was organized (or an alien \n     beneficiary's first year of U.S. residence, if later). \n     Although the trustee would have an incentive to file the \n     trustee statements to avoid adverse U.S. tax consequences to \n     U.S. grantors and U.S. beneficiaries, there would be no \n     penalties directly imposed on a trustee for the failure to \n     file those statements.\n       The Secretary would be authorized to waive any information \n     reporting requirements when there was no significant U.S. tax \n     interest in obtaining the information. Penalties would not be \n     imposed if the taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and not \n     willful neglect.\n       These proposals generally would be effective for trust \n     taxable years beginning after the date of enactment.\n\n                  II. Outbound foreign grantor trusts\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under section 679, a foreign trust established by a U.S. \n     person for the benefit of U.S. persons generally is a \n     ``grantor trust'', and the grantor is treated as owner of \n     property transferred to the trust. There are, however, some \n     transfers that are not covered by this general rule. First, \n     transfers by reason of death are not subject to section 679. \n     Second, sales of property to a foreign trust at fair market \n     value are not subject to section 679. Third, if a foreign \n     person transfers property to a foreign trust for the benefit \n     of a U.S. person and\n      then becomes a resident of the United States, section 679 \n     does not apply to the transfer. Finally, current rules do \n     not clearly address the tax consequences for a domestic \n     trust that becomes a foreign trust.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       Tax planning to avoid or defer recognition of income from \n     foreign trusts often utilizes the exceptions to section 679. \n     For example, a foreign trust may be established by will upon \n     the death of a U.S. person for the benefit of U.S. persons. \n     Because the trust is not a grantor trust, the income of the \n     trust is not subject to U.S. tax until distributed to a U.S. \n     person, even though the trust was created by a U.S. person \n     for the benefit of a U.S. person.\n       U.S. persons also sometimes attempt to avoid section 679 by \n     selling property to a foreign trust in exchange for a note \n     from the trust. Often, the U.S. transferor does not intend to \n     collect on the note. In such a case, the purported seller of \n     the assets should be treated as owning the assets transferred \n     to the trust. (If there is no bona fide debt, these \n     transactions are subject to challenge under current law, \n     because the exchange would not be at fair market value.)\n       Prior to becoming residents of the United States, foreign \n     persons often put their assets into irrevocable trusts in tax \n     haven jurisdictions for the benefit of U.S. persons. As a \n     result, the trust income escapes U.S. tax until distribution.\n       Further, as tax haven jurisdictions enact legislation to \n     enable U.S. trusts to move to those jurisdictions, trust \n     migrations are becoming more common. Taxpayers should not be \n     able to achieve tax results through migration of a domestic \n     trust that they could not achieve directly by creating a \n     foreign trust.\n       Finally, the inadequacy of the existing attribution rules \n     as they apply to discretionary beneficiaries encourages \n     taxpayers to avoid the appropriate tax consequences of their \n     transactions by disguising true economic ownership of assets \n     through the use of foreign discretionary trusts.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       The Administration proposes several changes to section 679, \n     described below.\n       Transfers at Death: Property transferred to a foreign trust \n     at the death of a trust grantor (including property in a \n     foreign grantor trust at the grantor's death) would be \n     treated as having been transferred to the trust by the \n     beneficiaries in accordance with their respective interests \n     in the trust (described below) in a transaction in which no \n     gain or loss would be recognized. U.S. beneficiaries \n     therefore would become grantors for purposes of section 679. \n     These proposals would be effective for assets transferred to \n     foreign trusts after the date of enactment.\n       Sales to Foreign Trusts: The sale of property to a foreign \n     trust by a U.S. person would be considered a transfer to a \n     grantor trust under section 679 unless the trust pays the \n     grantor full fair market value for the property without \n     regard to any debt obligation received by the transferor \n     issued by the trust, the grantor, a beneficiary, or a person \n     related to the grantor or beneficiary or guaranteed by any \n     such person. Exceptions would be provided for legitimate \n     commercial transactions, such as credit extended by unrelated \n     persons. A transferor would not be treated as receiving fair \n     market value for property transferred in a deemed sale \n     (pursuant to an election under section 1057 or otherwise). \n     These proposals would be effective for assets transferred to \n     foreign trusts on or after February 6, 1995.\n       Pre-immigration Trusts: If a foreign person transfers \n     property to a foreign trust and becomes a U.S. person within \n     five years of the transfer, the trust would be considered a \n     grantor trust under section 679 with respect to such \n     transferred assets if the trust has U.S. beneficiaries after \n     the grantor becomes a U.S. person. This proposal would be \n     effective for assets transferred to foreign trusts on or \n     after February 6, 1995.\n       Outbound Trust Migrations: For purposes of section 679, if \n     a domestic trust becomes a foreign trust, the trust assets \n     would be deemed to have been transferred to the trust by the \n     beneficiaries in accordance with their respective interests \n     in the trust (defined below) in a transaction in which no \n     gain or loss is recognized. Thus, any U.S. beneficiaries \n     would be considered to be grantors of their respective \n     interests in the foreign trust for purposes of section 679. \n     However, if the IRS determines that the domestic trust was \n     established pursuant to a plan to retransfer assets to a \n     foreign trust, the IRS would be permitted to treat the U.S. \n     settlor of the domestic trust as grantor of the foreign trust \n     for purposes of section 679. The proposal would be effective \n     for assets transferred to foreign trusts on or after February \n     6, 1995.\n       Determination of Respective Interests: For purposes of \n     presenting abusive transactions designed to avoid section 679 \n     and the tax on expatriation, a beneficiary's respective \n     interest in a trust would be based on all relevant facts and \n     circumstances, including the terms of the trust instrument. \n     Other relevant factors may include letters of wishes or \n     similar documents, patterns of historical trust \n     distributions, and the existence of and functions performed \n     by a trust protector or any similar advisor. If the \n     respective interests of beneficiaries in a discretionary \n     trust cannot otherwise be determined, those beneficiaries \n     with the closest degree of family affiliation to the settlor \n     could be presumed to have equal proportionate interests in \n     the trust.\n       The proposed would apply the attribution rules of \n     discretionary beneficiaries only to the abusive situations \n     under section 679 described above and to the tax on \n     expatriation of U.S. citizens and residents, but would not \n     directly apply the attribution rules for other purposes \n     (e.g., to determine if a discretionary beneficiary is a U.S. \n     shareholder of a \n     [[Page S2862]] controlled foreign corporation that is owned \n     by the trust). The determination of respective interests for \n     purposes of the tax on expatriation by U.S. citizens and \n     residents would be effective for expatriations occurring on \n     or after February 6, 1995.\n                  III. Inbound foreign grantor trusts\n\n                              Current law\n\n       The United States disregards certain ``grantor'' trusts for \n     income tax purposes. This treatment is designed to prevent \n     abuses arising from attempts to shift income to beneficiaries \n     who are likely to be paying taxes at lower rates than the \n     grantor of the trust. Consequently, under existing anti-abuse \n     rules, the grantor of such a trust is taxed as if he owned \n     the trust assets directly. Trusts generally are considered \n     grantor trusts if (1 the grantor has a reversionary interest \n     in trust income or corpus, (2) the grantor or a nonadverse \n     party holds certain powers over the beneficial enjoyment of \n     trust income or corpus, (3) certain administrative powers are \n     exercisable for the grantor's benefit (e.g., the grantor can \n     reacquire trust assets by substituting assets of equivalent \n     value), (4) the grantor or a nonadverse party has the power \n     to revest trust assets in the grantor, or (5) trust income \n     may be paid or accumulated for the benefit of the grantor or \n     the grantor's spouse in the discretion of the grantor or a \n     nonadverse party. A person other than the grantor is treated \n     as owning trust assets if that person has the power to \n     withdraw trust income or corpus.\n       The IRS has issued a revenue ruling in which a foreign \n     person funded a foreign grantor trust for U.S. beneficiaries. \n     The ruling holds that since the foreign person is treated as \n     the owner of the grantor trust, a U.S. beneficiary is not \n     taxable on trust distributions.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       Existing law inappropriately permits foreign taxpayers to \n     affirmatively use the domestic anti-abuse rules concerning \n     grantor trusts. Although current law treats a foreign grantor \n     as the owner of the trust assets, the foreign grantor \n     generally is not subject to U.S. tax on income of the trust. \n     These rules therefore permit U.S. beneficiaries, who enjoy \n     the benefits of residing in the United States, to avoid U.S. \n     tax on trust income. U.S. beneficiaries should be \n     appropriately taxed in the United States.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       Under the proposal, a person would be treated as owning \n     trust assets under the grantor trust rules only if that \n     person is a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident, or domestic \n     corporation. The IRS may prescribe rules for applying the \n     grantor trust rules to settlors that are partnerships, \n     trusts, and estates to the extent that the beneficial \n     interests in such entities are owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. \n     residents, or domestic corporations. A U.S. person receiving \n     distributions of trust income as result of this provision \n     would be allowed to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign \n     taxes paid on trust income by the trust or the foreign \n     grantor.\n       Several related provisions are proposed to enforce these \n     rules. First, enhanced authority would be granted to the IRS \n     to prevent the use of nominees to evade these rules. For this \n     purpose, a bona fide settlor of a trust with power to \n     withdraw income or corpus from the trust would normally not \n     be considered a nominee. Second, new rules would\n      harmonize the treatment of purported gifts by corporations \n     and partnerships with the new foreign grantor trust rules. \n     Third, U.S. persons would be required to report the \n     receipt of what they claim to be large gifts from foreign \n     persons in order to allow the IRS to verify that such \n     purported gifts are not, in fact, disguised income to the \n     U.S. recipients.\n       If a trust that is a grantor trust under current law \n     becomes a nongrantor trust pursuant to this rule, the trust \n     would be treated as if it were resettled on the date the \n     trust becomes a nongrantor trust. Neither the grantor nor the \n     trust would recognize gain or loss. If a resettled domestic \n     trust that has a foreign grantor became a foreign trust \n     before December 31, 1995, the section 1491 excise tax on \n     outbound transfers of assets would not be applied to the \n     transfer by the domestic trust to the new foreign trust. \n     Otherwise, this proposal would be effective on the date of \n     enactment of this provision. These rules would not apply to \n     normal security arrangements involving a trustee (including \n     the use of indenture trustees and similar arrangements).\n\n                     IV. Foreign nongrantor trusts\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Accumulation distributions: U.S. beneficiaries of foreign \n     trusts are subject to a nondeductible interest charge on \n     distributions of accumulated income earned by the trust in \n     earlier taxable years. The charge is based on the length of \n     time the tax was deferred by deferring distributions of \n     accumulated income. Under existing law, the interest charge \n     is equal to six percent simple interest per year multiplied \n     by the tax imposed on the distribution. If adequate records \n     are not available to determine the portion of a distribution \n     that is accumulated income, the distribution is deemed to be \n     an accumulation distribution from the year the trust was \n     organized.\n       Constructive Distributions: The tax consequences of the use \n     of trust assets by beneficiaries is ambiguous under current \n     law. Taxpayers may assert that a beneficiary's use of assets \n     owned by a trust does not constitute a distribution to the \n     beneficiary.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       Accumulation distributions: Interest paid by U.S. \n     beneficiaries of foreign trusts should reflect market rates \n     of interest.\n       Constructive distributions: If a corporation makes \n     corporate assets available for a shareholder's personal use \n     (e.g., a corporate apartment made available rent-free to a \n     shareholder), the fair market value of the use of that \n     property is treated as a constructive distribution. Further, \n     if a controlled foreign corporation makes a loan to a U.S. \n     person, the loan is treated as a deemed distribution by the \n     foreign corporation to its U.S. shareholders. The use of \n     foreign trust assets by trust beneficiaries should give rise \n     to tax consequences that are similar to those associated with \n     the use of corporate shareholders.\n                                Proposal\n\n       Accumulation distributions: For periods of accumulation \n     after December 31, 1995, the rate of interest charged on \n     accumulation distributions would correspond to the interest \n     rate taxpayers pay on underpayment of tax. If a trust does \n     not provide information required under section 6048, the \n     distribution would be deemed to be from income accumulated in \n     the year the trust was organized (or an alien beneficiary's \n     first year of U.S. residence, if later). If a taxpayer is not \n     able to demonstrate when the trust was created, the IRS may \n     use any approximation based on available evidence.\n       Taxpayers have used a variety of methods (e.g., tiered \n     trusts, divisions of trusts, mergers of trusts, and similar \n     transactions with corporations) to convert a distribution of \n     accumulated income into a distribution of current income or \n     corpus. The proposal would authorize the IRS to \n     recharacterize such transactions, effective for transactions \n     or arrangements entered into after the date of enactment. \n     Transactions that may be entered into to avoid the interest \n     charge on accumulation distributions (e.g., excessive \n     ``compensation'' paid to trust beneficiaries who are \n     directors of corporations owned by the foreign trust) may be \n     subject to recharacterization.\n       The proposal also clarifies existing law by providing that \n     if an alien beneficiary of a foreign trust becomes a U.S. \n     resident and thereafter receives an accumulation \n     distribution, no interest would be charged for periods of \n     accumulation that predate U.S. residency.\n       Constructive distributions: If a beneficiary uses assets of \n     a foreign trust, the value of that use would be a \n     constructive distribution to the beneficiary. Thus, if a \n     foreign trust made a residence available for use by a \n     beneficiary (or a related person), the difference between the \n     fair rental value of the residence and any rent actually paid \n     would be treated as a constructive distribution to that \n     beneficiary. If a foreign trust purported to loan cash (or \n     cash equivalents) to a U.S. beneficiary, the loan would be \n     treated as a constructive distribution by the foreign trust \n     to the U.S. beneficiary. These provisions would not apply if \n     constructive distributions did not exceed $2,500 during a \n     taxable year. The provisions would be effective for taxable \n     years of a trust that begin after the date of enactment.\n\n                         V. Residence of trusts\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under current law, a ``foreign estate or trust'' is an \n     estate or trust the ``income of which, from sources without \n     the United States which is not effectively connected with the \n     conduct of a trade or business within the United States, is \n     not includable in gross income under subtitle A'' of the \n     Internal Revenue Code. This definition does not provide \n     criteria for determining when an estate or trust is foreign.\n       Court cases and rulings indicate that the residence of an \n     estate or trust depends on various factors, such as the \n     location of the assets, the country under whose laws the \n     estate or\n      trust is created, the residence of the fiduciary, the \n     nationality of the decedent or settlor, the nationality of \n     the beneficiaries, and the location of the administration \n     of the trust or estate. See e.g., B.W. Jones Trust v. \n     Comm'r, 46 B.T.A. 531 (1942), aff'd, 132 F.2d 914 (4th \n     Cir. 1943).\n\n                           Reasons for change\n\n       Present rules provide insufficient guidance for determining \n     the residence of estates and trusts. Because the tax \n     treatment of an estate, trust, settlor, or beneficiary may \n     depend on whether the estate or trust is foreign or domestic, \n     it is important to have an objective definition of the \n     residence of an estate or trust. Reducing the number of \n     factors used in determining the residence of estates or \n     trusts for tax purposes would increase the flexibility of \n     settlors and trust administrators to decide where to locate \n     and in what assets to invest. For example, if the location of \n     the administration of the trust were no longer a relevant \n     criterion, settlors of foreign trusts would be able to choose \n     whether to administer the trusts in the United States or \n     abroad based on non-tax considerations.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       An estate or trust would be considered a domestic estate or \n     trust if two factors were present: (1) a court within the \n     United States is able to exercise primary supervision over \n     the administration of the estate or trust; and (2) a U.S. \n     fiduciary (alone or in concert \n     [[Page S2863]] with other U.S. fiduciaries) has the authority \n     to control all major decisions of the estate or trust. A \n     foreign estate or trust would be any estate or trust that is \n     not domestic.\n       The first factor would be fulfilled only if a U.S. court \n     had authority over the entire estate or trust, and not if it \n     merely had jurisdiction over certain assets or a particular \n     beneficiary. Normally, the first factor would be satisfied if \n     the trust instrument is governed by the laws of a U.S. state. \n     One way to satisfy this factor is to register the estate or \n     trust in a state pursuant to a state law which is \n     substantially similar to Article VII of the Uniform Probate \n     Code as published by the American Law Institute. The second \n     factor would normally be satisfied if a majority of the \n     fiduciaries are U.S. persons and a foreign fiduciary \n     (including a ``protector'' or similar trust advisor) may not \n     veto important decisions of the U.S. fiduciaries. In applying \n     this factor, the IRS would allow an estate or trust a \n     reasonable period of time to adjust for inadvertent changes \n     in fiduciaries (e.g., a U.S. trustee dies or abruptly resigns \n     where a trust has two U.S. fiduciaries and one foreign \n     fiduciary).\n       The new rules defining domestic estates and trusts would be \n     effective for taxable years of an estate or trust that begin \n     after December 31, 1996. The delayed effective date is \n     intended to allow estates and trusts a period of time to \n     modify their governing instruments or to change fiduciaries. \n     Moreover, taxpayers would be allowed to elect to apply these \n     rules to taxable years of an estate or trust beginning after \n     the date of enactment.\n\n                                                REVENUE ESTIMATE                                                \n                                            [In billions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        Fiscal year--                           \n                                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1995      1996      1997      1998      1999      2000      Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRevise taxation of income from foreign                                                                          \n trusts (sections I-V)....................       0.1       0.3       0.5       0.5       0.5       0.6       2.4\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                increase in number of empowerment zones\n\n                              Current law\n\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93) \n     authorized a federal demonstration project in which nine \n     empowerment zones and 95 enterprise communities would be \n     designated in a competitive application process. Of the nine \n     empowerment zones, six were to be located in urban areas and \n     three were to be located in rural areas. State and local \n     governments jointly nominated distressed areas and proposed \n     strategic plans to stimulate economic and social \n     revitalization. By the June 30, 1994 application deadline, \n     over 500 communities had submitted applications.\n       On December 21, 1994, the Secretaries of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development and the Department of \n     Agriculture designated the empowerment zones and enterprise \n     communities authorized by Congress in OBRA '93.\n       Among other benefits, businesses located in empowerment \n     zones are eligible for three federal tax incentives: an \n     employment and training credit; an additional $20,000 per \n     year of section 179 expensing; and a new category of tax-\n     exempt private activity bonds. Businesses located in \n     enterprise communities are eligible for the new category of \n     tax-exempt bonds. OBRA '93 also provided that federal grants \n     would be made to designated areas.\n\n                           Reasons for change\n       Because of the vast number of distressed urban areas and \n     the need to revitalize these areas, the Administration \n     believes that the number of authorized empowerment zones \n     should be expanded, subject to budgetary constraints. \n     Extending the tax incentives to economically distressed areas \n     will help stimulate revitalization of these areas.\n\n                                Proposal\n\n       The proposal would authorize the designation of two \n     additional urban empowerment zones and would be effective on \n     the date of enactment. No additional federal grants would be \n     authorized. The sole effect of the proposal would be to \n     extend the empowerment zone tax incentives to two additional \n     areas.\n\n                            REVENUE ESTIMATE                            \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       Fiscal Year--                    \n                 -------------------------------------------------------\n                   1995    1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncrease in                                                             \n number of                                                              \n empowernment                                                           \n zones..........    -0.1    -0.1    -0.1    -0.1    -0.1    -0.1    -0.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. \n        Kassebaum):\n  S. 454. A bill to reform the health care liability system and improve \nhealth care quality through the establishment of quality assurance \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n   the health care liability reform and quality assurance act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nHealth Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 1995. Last \nyear, Congress spent many days and weeks considering a dramatic \noverhaul of the finest health care system in the world. But the vast \nmajority of Americans concluded we didn't need to reinvent our medical \nsystem. So, Congress, with good reason, laid aside health care and \nvowed to come back this year and make some needed incremental changes \nto the health care system.\n  Health care liability is one issue on which there was bipartisan \nconsensus about the need to make some significant change. This bill \nwhich I am introducing today with the co-sponsorship and assistance of \nSenators Lieberman and Kassebaum represents this bipartisan effort.\n  The purpose of our bill is to promote patient safety, compensate \nthose who suffer injuries fully and fairly, without enriching lawyers \nand bureaucrats, make health care more accessible, gain some cost \ncontainment in health care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship \nand encourage medical innovation. Our present system, unfortunately, \ndoes none of the above.\n  First of all, patients don't get compensated. The Rand Corp. has \nreported that only 43 cents of every dollar spent in the liability \nsystem goes to the injured party. That means lawyers, experts, and \ncourt fees eat up 57 percent of all dollars spent in the liability \nsystem.\n  Second, the prohibitive cost of liability insurance means some \ndoctors won't provide care to those in our society who need it most. \nHalf a million rural women can't get an obstetrician to deliver their \nbabies. Because of high malpractice premiums, African-American doctors \nare avoiding the practice of medicine in high-risk areas--generally \nurban areas, making it more difficult for minority communities to get \nnecessary care.\n  Third, companies that invent new products are discouraged under the \ncurrent system from putting them on the market. Medical device \nmanufacturers are finding it more difficult to get raw materials to \nproduce life saving devices because of the risk of lawsuits.\n  Fourth, doctors are less likely to explore risky treatment because of \nthe proliferation of lawsuits. A doctor has a better than 1 in 3 chance \nof being sued during his practice years. And the likelihood of suit has \nnothing to do with whether the doctor was negligent. GAO reports that \nalmost 60 percent of all suits are dismissed without a verdict or even \na settlement.\n  So, something is very wrong with our liability system and our bill \nwill help solve the problem. It contains many of the provisions that \nwere considered, on a bipartisan basis, in the Finance Committee last \nyear, during the health care debate. I have included a summary of the \nbill's provisions and I ask that the full text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that health care liability will get full \nconsideration and action in this Congress. There will be at least two \nopportunities--when we consider some targeted \n[[Page S2864]] health care reform and when we consider legal reform. It \nis very important that we tackle this issue and I look forward to \nprompt action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 454\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--That the civil \n     justice system of the United States is a costly and \n     inefficient mechanism for resolving claims of health care \n     liability and compensating injured patients and that the \n     problems associated with the current system are having an \n     adverse impact on the availability of, and access to, health \n     care services and the cost of health care in this country.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--That the health care \n     and insurance industries are industries affecting interstate \n     commerce and the health care liability litigation systems \n     existing throughout the United States affect interstate \n     commerce by contributing to the high cost of health care and \n     premiums for health care liability insurance purchased by \n     participants in the health care system.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--That the health care \n     liability litigation systems existing throughout the United \n     States have a significant effect on the amount, distribution, \n     and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reform that is designed to--\n       (1) ensure that individuals with meritorious health care \n     injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation, \n     including reasonable non-economic damages;\n       (2) improve the availability of health care service in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; and\n       (3) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty and unpredictability in the amount of \n     compensation provided to injured individuals.\n\n     SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this subtitle:\n       (1) Claimant.--The term ``claimant'' means any person who \n     commences a health care liability action, and any person on \n     whose behalf such an action is commenced, including the \n     decedent in the case of an action brought through or on \n     behalf of an estate.\n       (2) Clear and convincing evidence.--The term ``clear and \n     convincing evidence'' is that measure or degree of proof that \n     will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief \n     or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be \n     established, except that such measure or degree of proof is \n     more than that required under preponderance of the evidence, \n     but less than that required for proof beyond a reasonable \n     doubt.\n       (3) Health care liability action.--The term ``health care \n     liability action'' means a civil action in a State or Federal \n     court--\n       (A) against a health care provider, health care \n     professional, or other defendant joined in the action \n     (regardless of the theory of liability on which the action is \n     based) in which the claimant alleges injury related to the \n     provision of, or the failure to provide, health care \n     services; or\n       (B) against a health care payor, a health maintenance \n     organization, insurance company, or any other individual, \n     organization, or entity that provides payment for health care \n     benefits in which the claimant alleges that injury was caused \n     by the payment for, or the failure to make payment for, \n     health care benefits, except to the extent such actions are \n     subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974.\n       (4) Health care professional.--The term ``health care \n     professional'' means any individual who provides health care \n     services in a State and who is required by Federal or State \n     laws or regulations to be licensed, registered or certified \n     to provide such services or who is certified to provide \n     health care services pursuant to a program of education, \n     training and examination by an accredited institution, \n     professional board, or professional organization.\n       (5) Health care provider.--The term ``health care \n     provider'' means any organization or institution that is \n     engaged in the delivery of health care items or services in a \n     State and that is required by Federal or State laws or \n     regulations to be licensed, registered or certified to engage \n     in the delivery of such items or services.\n       (6) Health care services.--The term ``health care \n     services'' means any services provided by a health care \n     professional or health care provider, or any individual \n     working under the supervision of a health care professional, \n     that relate to the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any \n     disease or impairment, or the assessment of the health of \n     human beings.\n       (7) Injury.--The term ``injury'' means any illness, \n     disease, or other harm that is the subject of a health care \n     liability action.\n       (8) Noneconomic losses.--The term ``noneconomic losses'' \n     means losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, \n     inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, \n     disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of consortium, \n     and other nonpecuniary losses incurred by an individual with \n     respect to which a health care liability action is brought.\n       (9) Punitive damages.--The term ``punitive damages'' means \n     damages awarded, for the purpose of punishment or deterrence, \n     and not for compensatory purposes, against a health care \n     provider, health care organization, or other defendant in a \n     health care liability action.

The \n     provisions of this subtitle shall not preempt any State law \n     that--\n       (1) provides for defenses in addition to those contained in \n     this subtitle, places greater limitations on the amount of \n     attorneys' fees that can be collected, or otherwise imposes \n     greater restrictions on non-economic or punitive damages than \n     those provided in this subtitle;\n       (2) permits State officials to commence health care \n     liability actions as a representative of an individual; or\n       (3) permits provider-based dispute resolution.\n       (c) Effect on Sovereign Immunity and Choice of Law or \n     Venue.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by any State under any provision of law;\n       (2) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States;\n       (3) affect the applicability of any provision of the \n     Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976;\n       (4) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n     actions brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign \n     nation; or\n       (5) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation \n     [[Page S2865]] or to dismiss an action of a foreign nation or \n     of a citizen of a foreign nation on the ground of \n     inconvenient forum.\n       (d) Federal Court Jurisdiction Not Established on Federal \n     Question Grounds.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be \n     construed to establish any jurisdiction in the district \n     courts of the United States over health care liability \n     actions on the basis of sections 1331 or 1337 of title 28, \n     United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 104. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\n       A health care liability action that is subject to this Act \n     may not be initiated unless a complaint with respect to such \n     action is filed within the 2-year period beginning on the \n     date on which the claimant discovered or, in the exercise of \n     reasonable care, should have discovered the harm and its \n     cause, except that such an action relating to a claimant \n     under legal disability may be filed within 2 years after the \n     date on which the disability ceases. If the commencement of a \n     health care liability action is stayed or enjoined, the \n     running of the statute of limitations under this section \n     shall be suspended for the period of the stay or injunction.\n\n     SEC. 105. REFORM OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, an award for punitive damages may only be made, if \n     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if it is proven by \n     clear and convincing evidence that the defendant--\n       (1) intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated \n     to the provision of health care services;\n       (2) understood the claimant was substantially certain to \n     suffer unnecessary injury, and in providing or failing to \n     provide health care services, the defendant deliberately \n     failed to avoid such injury; or\n       (3) acted with a conscious disregard of a substantial and \n     unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury which the defendant \n     failed to avoid in a manner which constitutes a gross \n     deviation from the normal standard of conduct in such \n     circumstances.\n       (b) Punitive Damages Not Permitted.--Notwithstanding the \n     provisions of subsection (a), punitive damages may not be \n     awarded against a defendant with respect to any health care \n     liability action if no judgment for compensatory damages, \n     including nominal damages (under $500), is rendered against \n     the defendant.\n       (c) Requirements for Pleading of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--No demand for punitive damages shall be \n     included in a health care liability action as initially \n     filed.\n       (2) Amended pleading.--A court may allow a claimant to file \n     an amended complaint or pleading for punitive damages in a \n     health care liability action if--\n       (A) the claimant submits a motion to amend the complaint or \n     pleading within the earlier of--\n       (i) 2 years after the complaint or initial pleading is \n     filed, or\n       (ii) 9 months before the date the matter is first set for \n     trial; and\n       (B) after a finding by a court upon review of supporting \n     and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, that after \n     weighing the evidence the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (d) Separate Proceeding.--\n       (1) In general.--At the request of any defendant in a \n     health care liability action, the trier of fact shall \n     consider in a separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award, or\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n       (2) Only relevant evidence admissible.--If a defendant \n     requests a separate proceeding under paragraph (1), evidence \n     relevant only to the claim of punitive damages in a health \n     care liability action, as determined by applicable State law, \n     shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \n     compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (e) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--In determining \n     the amount of punitive damages in a health care liability \n     action, the trier of fact shall consider only the following:\n       (1) The severity of the harm caused by the conduct of the \n     defendant.\n       (2) The duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     the defendant.\n       (3) The profitability of the conduct of the defendant.\n       (4) The number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by the \n     defendant of the kind causing the harm complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (5) Awards of punitive or exemplary damages to persons \n     similarly situated to the claimant, when offered by the \n     defendant.\n       (6) Prospective awards of compensatory damages to persons \n     similarly situated to the claimant.\n       (7) Any criminal penalties imposed on the defendant as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant, when \n     offered by the defendant.\n       (8) The amount of any civil fines assessed against the \n     defendant as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant, when offered by the defendant.\n       (f) Limitation Amount.--The amount of damages that may be \n     awarded as punitive damages in any health care liability \n     action shall not exceed 3 times the amount awarded to the \n     claimant for the economic injury on which such claim is \n     based, or $250,000, whichever is greater. This subsection \n     shall be applied by the court and shall not be disclosed to \n     the jury.\n       (g) Restrictions Permitted.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to imply a right to seek punitive damages where \n     none exists under Federal or State law.\n\n     SEC. 106. PERIODIC PAYMENTS.\n\n       With respect to a health care liability action, no person \n     may be required to pay more than $100,000 for future damages \n     in a single payment of a damages award, but a person shall be \n     permitted to make such payments of the award on a periodic \n     basis. The periods for such payments shall be determined by \n     the adjudicating body, based upon projections of future \n     losses and shall be reduced to present value. The \n     adjudicating body may waive the requirements of this section \n     if such body determines that such a waiver is in the \n     interests of justice.\n\n     SEC. 107. SCOPE OF LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to punitive and noneconomic \n     damages, the liability of each defendant in a health care \n     liability action shall be several only and may not be joint. \n     Such a defendant shall be liable only for the amount of \n     punitive or noneconomic damages allocated to the defendant in \n     direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of fault or \n     responsibility for the injury suffered by the claimant.\n       (b) Determination of Percentage of Liability.--The trier of \n     fact in a health care liability action shall determine the \n     extent of each defendant's fault or responsibility for injury \n     suffered by the claimant, and shall assign a percentage of \n     responsibility for such injury to each such defendant.\n       (c) Prohibition on Vicarious Liability.--A defendant in a \n     health care liability action may not be held vicariously \n     liable for the direct actions or omissions of other \n     individuals.\n\n     SEC. 108. MANDATORY OFFSETS FOR DAMAGES PAID BY A COLLATERAL \n                   SOURCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, the total amount of damages received by an individual \n     under such action shall be reduced, in accordance with \n     subsection (b), by any other payment that has been, or will \n     be, made to an individual to compensate such individual for \n     the injury that was the subject of such action.\n       (b) Amount of Reduction.--The amount by which an award of \n     damages to an individual for an injury shall be reduced under \n     subsection (a) shall be--\n       (1) the total amount of any payments (other than such \n     award) that have been made or that will be made to such \n     individual to pay costs of or compensate such individual for \n     the injury that was the subject of the action; minus\n       (2) the amount paid by such individual (or by the spouse, \n     parent, or legal guardian of such individual) to secure the \n     payments described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Pretrial Determination of Amounts from Collateral \n     Services.--The reductions requires under subsection (b)(2) \n     shall be determined by the court in a pretrial proceeding. At \n     such proceeding--\n       (1) no evidence shall be admitted as to the amount of any \n     charge, payments, or damage for which a claimant--\n       (A) has received payment from a collateral source or the \n     obligation for which has been assured by a third party; or\n       (B) is, or with reasonable certainty, will be eligible to \n     receive payment from a collateral source of the obligation \n     which will, with reasonable certainty be assumed by a third \n     party; and\n       (2) the jury, if any, shall be advised that--\n       (A) except for damages as to which the court permits the \n     introduction of evidence, the claimant's medical expenses and \n     lost income have been or will be paid by a collateral source \n     or third party; and\n       (B) the claimant shall receive no award for any damages \n     that have been or will be paid by a collateral source or \n     third party.\n\n     SEC. 109. TREATMENT OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND OTHER COSTS.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Amount of Contingency Fees.--\n       (1) In general.--An attorney who represents, on a \n     contingency fee basis, a claimant in a health care liability \n     action may not charge, demand, receive, or collect for \n     services rendered in connection with such action in excess of \n     the following amount recovered by judgment or settlement \n     under such action:\n       (A) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the first $150,000 (or portion \n     thereof) recovered, based on after-tax recovery, plus\n       (B) 25 percent of any amount in excess of $150,000 \n     recovered, based on after-tax recovery.\n       (2) Calculation of periodic payments.--In the event that a \n     judgment or settlement includes periodic or future payments \n     of damages, the amount recovered for purposes of computing \n     the limitation on the contingency fee under paragraph (1) \n     shall be based on the cost of the annuity or trust \n     established to make the payments. In any case in which an \n     annuity or trust is not established to make such payments, \n     such amount shall be based on the present value of the \n     payments.\n       (b) Contingency Fee Defined.--As used in this section, the \n     term ``contingency fee'' means any fee for professional legal \n     services which is, in whole or in part, contingent upon the \n     recovery of any amount of damages, whether through judgment \n     or settlement.\n\n     SEC. 110. OBSTETRIC CASES.\n\n       With respect to a health care liability action relating to \n     services provided during \n     [[Page S2866]] labor or the delivery of a baby, if the health \n     care professional against whom the action is brought did not \n     previously treat the pregnant woman for the pregnancy, the \n     trier of fact may not find that the defendant committed \n     malpractice and may not assess damages against the health \n     care professional unless the malpractice is proven by clear \n     and convincing evidence.\n\n     SEC. 111. STATE-BASED ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n                   MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Application to Health Care Liability Claims under \n     Health Plans.--Prior to or immediately following the \n     commencement of any health care liability action, the parties \n     shall participate in the alternative dispute resolution \n     system administered by the State under subsection (b). Such \n     participation shall be in lieu of any other provision of \n     Federal or State law applicable to the parties prior to the \n     commencement of the health care liability action.\n       (b) Adoption of Mechanism by State.--Each State shall--\n       (1) maintain or adopt at least one of the alternative \n     dispute resolution methods satisfying the requirements \n     specified under subsection (c) and (d) for the resolution of \n     health care liability claims arising from the provision of \n     (or failure to provide) health care services to individuals \n     enrolled in a health plans; and\n       (2) clearly disclose to enrollees in health plans (and \n     potential enrollees) the availability and procedures for \n     consumer grievances, including a description of the \n     alternative dispute resolution method or methods adopted \n     under this subsection.\n       (c) Specification of Permissible Alternative Dispute \n     Resolution Methods.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General, in consultation with \n     the Secretary and the Administrative Conference of the United \n     States, shall, by regulation, develop alternative dispute \n     resolution methods for the use by States in resolving health \n     care liability claims under subsection (a). Such methods \n     shall include at least the following:\n       (A) Arbitration.--The use of arbitration, a nonjury \n     adversarial dispute resolution process which may, subject to \n     subsection (d), result in a final decision as to facts, law, \n     liability or damages. The parties may elect binding \n     arbitration.\n       (B) Mediation.--The use of mediation, a settlement process \n     coordinated by a neutral third party without the ultimate \n     rendering of a formal opinion as to factual or legal \n     findings.\n       (C) Early neutral evaluation.--The use of early neutral \n     evaluation, in which the parties make a presentation to a \n     neutral attorney or other neutral evaluator for an assessment \n     of the merits, to encourage settlement. If the parties do not \n     settle as a result of assessment and proceed to trial, the \n     neutral evaluator's opinion shall be kept confidential.\n       (D) Early offer and recovery mechanism.--\n       (i) In general.--The use of early offer and recovery \n     mechanisms under which a health care provider, health care \n     organization, or any other alleged responsible defendant may \n     offer to compensate a claimant for his or her reasonable \n     economic damages, including future economic damages, less \n     amounts available from collateral sources.\n       (ii) Binding arbitration.--If, after an offer is made under \n     clause (i), the claimant alleges that payment of economic \n     damages under the offer has not been reasonably made, or the \n     participants in the offer dispute their relative \n     contributions to the payments to be made to the claimant, \n     such disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration \n     in accordance with applicable rules and procedures \n     established by the State involved.\n       (2) Standards for establishing methods.--In developing \n     alternative dispute resolution methods under paragraph (1), \n     the Attorney General shall assure that the methods promote \n     the resolution of health care liability claims in a manner \n     that--\n       (A) is affordable for the parties involved;\n       (B) provides for timely resolution of claims;\n       (C) provides for the consistent and fair resolution of \n     claims; and\n       (D) provides for reasonably convenient access to dispute \n     resolution for individuals enrolled in plans.\n       (3) Waiver authority.--Upon application of a State, the \n     Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, may \n     grant the State the authority to fulfill the requirement of \n     subsection (b) by adopting a mechanism other than a mechanism \n     established by the Attorney General pursuant to this \n     subsection, except that such mechanism must meet the \n     standards set forth in paragraph (2).\n       (d) Further Redress.--Except with respect to the claimant-\n     requested binding arbitration method set forth in subsection \n     (c)(1)(A), a claimant who is dissatisfied with the \n     determination reached as a result of an alternative dispute \n     resolution method applied under this section may, after the \n     final resolution of the claimant's claim under the method, \n     initiate or resume a cause of action to seek damages or other \n     redress with respect to the claim to the extent otherwise \n     permitted under State law. State law shall govern the \n     admissibility of results of any alternative dispute \n     resolution procedure and all statements, offers, and other \n     communications made during such procedures, at any subsequent \n     trial. An individual who indicates or resumes a health care \n     liability action shall only prevail if such individual proves \n     each element of the action beyond a reasonable doubt, \n     including proving that the defendant was grossly negligent or \n     intentionally caused injury.\n\n     SEC. 112. REQUIREMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF MERIT.\n\n       (a) Requiring Submission with Complaint.--Except as \n     provided in subsection (b) and subject to the penalties of \n     subsection (d), no health care liability action may be \n     brought by any individual unless, at the time the individual \n     commences such action, the individual or the individual's \n     attorney submits an affidavit declaring that--\n       (1) the individual (or the individual's attorney) has \n     consulted and reviewed the facts of the claim with a \n     qualified specialist (as defined in subsection (c));\n       (2) the individual or the individual's attorney has \n     obtained a written report by a qualified specialist that \n     clearly identifies the individual and that includes the \n     specialist's determination that, based upon a review of the \n     available medical record and other relevant material, a \n     reasonable medical interpretation of the facts supports a \n     finding that the claim against the defendant is meritorious \n     and based on good cause; and\n       (3) on the basis of the qualified specialist's review and \n     consultation, the individual, and if represented, the \n     individual's attorney, have concluded that the claim is \n     meritorious and based on good cause.\n       (b) Extension in Certain Instances.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), subsection (a) \n     shall not apply with respect to an individual who brings a \n     health care liability action without submitting an affidavit \n     described in such subsection if--\n       (A) despite good faith efforts, the individual is unable to \n     obtain the written report before the expiration of the \n     applicable statute of limitations;\n       (B) despite good faith efforts, at the time the individual \n     commences the action, the individual has been unable to \n     obtain medical records or other information necessary, \n     pursuant to any applicable law, to prepare the written report \n     requested; or\n       (C) the court of competent jurisdiction determines that the \n     affidavit requirement shall be extended upon a showing of \n     good cause.\n       (2) Deadline for submission where extension applies.--In \n     the case of an individual who brings an action to which \n     paragraph (1) applies, the action shall be dismissed unless \n     the individual submits the affidavit described in subsection \n     (a) not later than--\n       (A) in the case of an action to which subparagraph (A) of \n     paragraph (1) applies, 90 days after commencing the action; \n     or\n       (B) in the case of an action to which subparagraph (B) of \n     paragraph (1) applies, 90 days after obtaining the \n     information described in such subparagraph or when good cause \n     for an extension no longer exists.\n       (c) Qualified Specialist Defined.--\n       (1) In general.--As used in subsection (a), the term \n     ``qualified specialist'' means, with respect to a health care \n     liability action, a health care professional who has \n     expertise in the same or substantially similar area of \n     practice to that involved in the action.\n       (2) Evidence of expertise.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     evidence of required expertise may include evidence that the \n     individual--\n       (A) practices (or has practiced) or teaches (or has taught) \n     in the same or substantially similar area of health care or \n     medicine to that involved in the action; or\n       (B) is otherwise qualified by experience or demonstrated \n     competence in the relevant practice area.\n       (d) Sanctions for Submitting False Affidavit.--Upon the \n     motion of any party or on its own initiative, the court in a \n     health care liability action may impose a sanction on a \n     party, the party's attorney, or both, for--\n       (1) any knowingly false statement made in an affidavit \n     described in subsection (a);\n       (2) making any false representations in order to obtain a \n     qualified specialist's report; or\n       (3) failing to have the qualified specialist's written \n     report in his or her custody and control;\n     and may require that the sanctioned party reimburse the other \n     party to the action for costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n               Subtitle B--Biomaterials Access Assurance\n\n     SEC. 121. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 122. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the \n     [[Page S2867]] overall market for the raw materials and \n     medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 123.

Scope:\n       a. Applies to any action, filed in federal or state court, \n     against a health care provider, professional, payor, hmo, \n     insurance company or any other defendant (except vaccine-\n     related injuries);\n       b. Preempts state law to the extent it is inconsistent with \n     the provisions herein; no preemption for state laws which:\n       (1) provide additional defenses;\n       (2) greater limitations on attorneys' fees;\n       (3) greater restrictions on punitive or non-economic \n     damages;\n       (4) permit state officials to institute action;\n       (5) permit provider-based dispute resolution.\n       c. Does not create federal jurisdiction for health care \n     liability actions.\n       2. Uniform Statute of Limitations:\n       Two years from the date injury discovered or should have \n     been discovered, except that any person under a legal \n     disability may file within two years after the disability \n     ceases.\n       3. Limit on Punitive Damages:\n       a. Awarded if proved by clear and convincing evidence \n     defendant:\n       (1) intended to injure;\n       (2) understood claimant was substantially certain to suffer \n     unnecessary injury and deliberately failed to avoid injury; \n     or\n       (3) acted with conscious disregard of substantial and \n     unjustifiable risk which defendant failed to avoid in a way \n     which constitutes a gross deviation from the normal standard \n     of conduct.\n       b. No punitive damages where compensatory damages of less \n     than $500 are awarded.\n       c. Punitive damages may not be pleaded in original \n     complaint. A complaint may be amended within, the earlier of, \n     2 years of original complaint or 9 months before the case is \n     set for trial, and after court finds substantial probability \n     that claimant will prevail on the claim for punitive damages.\n       [[Page S2870]] d. At the defendant's request, punitive \n     damages must be considered in a separate proceeding and, if \n     so requested, no evidence relevant to the claim for punitive \n     damages may be admitted in the proceedings for compensatory \n     damages.\n       e. In determining the amount, court must consider only:\n       (1) severity of harm;\n       (2) duration of defendant's conduct and any concealment;\n       (3) profitability of defendant's conduct;\n       (4) number of products sold/procedures rendered which \n     caused similar harm;\n       (5) similar awards of punitive damages in similar \n     circumstances;\n       (6) prospective awards of compensatory damages to similarly \n     situated persons;\n       (7) criminal penalties imposed on defendant;\n       (8) civil fines imposed.\n       f. No award may exceed the greater of 3 times the amount of \n     economic damages or $250,000.\n       4. Periodic Payment of Damages:\n       No more than $100,000 may be required to be paid in one \n     single payment. The court will determine the schedule for \n     payments, based on projection of future losses and reduced to \n     present value. This requirement may be waived, in the \n     interests of justice.\n       5. Several, not Joint, Liability:\n       Defendant liable only for the amount of non-economic and \n     punitive damages allocated to defendant's direct proportion \n     of fault or responsibility. The trier of fact determines \n     percentage of responsibility of each defendant. No vicarious \n     liability for direct acts or omissions.\n       6. Collateral Source:\n       Total damages must be reduced by payments from other \n     sources made, or to be made, to compensate individual for \n     injury that is the subject of the health care liability \n     action. The offset is reduced by any amount paid by the \n     injured party (or family member) to secure the payment. The \n     reductions must be determined by the judge in a pretrial \n     proceeding.\n       7. Attorneys' Fees:\n       Limits attorney contingent fees to 33\\1/3\\% of the first \n     $150,000 and 25% of any amount in excess of $150,000.\n       8. Obstetric Cases:\n       No malpractice award against a health care professional \n     relating to delivery of a baby, if the health care \n     professional did not previously treat the woman during the \n     pregnancy, unless malpractice proved by clear and convincing \n     evidence.\n       9. State Based Alternative Dispute Resolution:\n       a. Prior to the filing, or immediately following the filing \n     of the action, the parties must participate in a state \n     administered alternative dispute resolution system.\n       b. The Attorney General will develop adr methods for use by \n     the states, including arbitration, mediation, early neutral \n     evaluation, early offer and recovery. The parties may elect \n     binding arbitration.\n       c. Adr must promote resolution of health care liability \n     claims in an affordable, timely, fair and convenient manner. \n     States may be granted waivers if they have programs that meet \n     these standards.\n       d. Any party dissatisfied (except where binding arbitration \n     selected) may continue the action in court and may prevail \n     only if each element of the case is proved beyond a \n     reasonable doubt,\n      including that the defendant was grossly negligent or \n     intentionally caused injury. State law governs the \n     admission of adr proceedings.\n       10. Certificate of Merit:\n       Requires that, prior to bringing a lawsuit, an individual \n     (or his or her attorney) to submit an affidavit declaring \n     that the individual reviewed the facts with a qualified \n     specialist and that the specialist has concluded the claim is \n     meritorious. A qualified specialist means a health care \n     professional with expertise (the specialist practices or \n     teaches or has experience or demonstrated competence) in the \n     same or substantially similar area of practice as that \n     involved in the case. A court may impose sanctions for the \n     submission of a false affidavit.\n\n                Subtitle B--Biomaterial Access Assurance\n\n       1. Summary:\n       The Biomaterial Access Assurance Act would allow suppliers \n     of the raw material (biomaterial) used to make medical \n     implants, to obtain dismissal, without extensive discovery or \n     other legal costs, in certain tort suits in which plaintiffs \n     allege harm from a finished medical implant.\n       The Act would not affect the ability of plaintiffs to sue \n     manufacturers or sellers of medical implants. It would allow \n     raw materials suppliers, however, to be dismissed from \n     lawsuits if the generic raw material used in the medical \n     device met contract specifications, and if the biomaterial \n     supplier cannot be classified as either a manufacturer or \n     seller of the medical implant.\n       2. Scope:\n       a. Establishes that any biomaterial supplier may seek its \n     dismissal from a civil action within the parameters of the \n     Subtitle.\n       b. Applies to any civil action brought by a claimant in \n     Federal or State court against a manufacturer, seller, or \n     biomaterial supplier, on the basis of any legal theory, for \n     harm allegedly caused by an implant.\n       c. Preempts State law to the extent the bill establishes a \n     rule of law.\n       3. Grounds for Dismissal:\n       a. Requires dismissal of a biomaterial supplier unless the \n     claimant establishes that the supplier:\n       (1) was itself the manufacturer of the implant;\n       (2) was itself the seller of the implant; or\n       (3) furnished raw materials that failed to met applicable \n     contractual requirements or specifications.\n       b. A supplier may be deemed to be a manufacturer only if \n     the supplier registered as such with the FDA pursuant to \n     medical device requirements or if the HHS Secretary issues a \n     declaration that the supplier should have registered as such. \n     Establishes a procedure for the Secretary to issue such a \n     declaration.\n       c. A supplier may be deemed to be a seller if the supplier \n     itself resold the implant after it had been manufactured and \n     had entered the stream of commerce.\n       d. With respect to contractual requirements, a supplier may \n     be liable for harm only if the claimant shows that the \n     biomaterial were not the actual product for which the parties \n     contracted or the biomaterial failed to meet certain \n     specifications and that failure was the cause of the injury. \n     The relevant specifications are those:\n       (1) provided to the supplier by the manufacturer,\n       (2) provided by the manufacturer (either published, given \n     to the manufacturer, or included in an FDA master file), or\n       (3) included in manufacturer submissions that had received \n     clearance from the FDA.\n       4. Procedures for Dismissal:\n       a. A supplier named as a defendant or joined as a co-\n     defendant may file a motion to dismiss based on the defenses \n     set forth above.\n       b. A plaintiff must sue a manufacturer directly whenever \n     jurisdiction over the manufacturer is available. A plaintiff \n     must submit an expert's affidavit certifying that the \n     biomaterial were actually used and were the cause of the \n     alleged harm and that the case has merit.\n       c. Specific rules are established for the handling of a \n     motion to dismiss, including discovery limitations, summary \n     judgment procedures, and staying the proceedings.\n       d. The manufacturer, not the supplier, may conduct the \n     proceeding on the motion if an appropriate contractual \n     indemnification agreement exists. The possibility of \n     frivolous claims against a supplier is reduced by permitting \n     the court to require the plaintiff to pay attorney fees if \n     the plaintiff succeeds in making the supplier a defendant, \n     but ultimately is found to have a meritless claim.\n       5. Effective Date: The bill will apply to civil actions \n     commenced on or after the date of enactment.\n\n\n           title II--protection of patient health and safety\n\n       1. Quality Assurance:\n       Requires each state to establish a health care quality \n     assurance program and fund, approved by the Secretary of HHS. \n     Allocates 50% of all punitive damage awards to be transferred \n     to the fund for the purpose of licensing and certifying \n     health care professionals, implementing programs, including \n     programs to reduce malpractice costs for volunteers serving \n     underserved areas.\n       2. Risk Management Programs:\n       Professionals and providers must participate in risk \n     management program to prevent and provide early warning of \n     practices which may result in injuries. Insurers must \n     establish risk management programs and require participation, \n     once every 3 years, as a condition of maintaining insurance.\n       3. National Practitioner Data Bank:\n       Requires that information on the discipline of health care \n     practitioners, including suspension or revocation of licenses \n     or hospital privileges, be accessible to the public.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nMcConnell and Kassebaum today in introducing the Liability Reform and \nQuality Assurance Act of 1995. I thank Senator McConnell for his \nleadership on the bill.\n  Mr. President, our present system for compensating patients who have \nbeen injured by medical malpractice is ineffective, inefficient, and in \nmany respects, unfair. The system promotes the overuse of medical tests \nand procedures, and diverts too much money away from victims. The Rand \nCorp. has estimated that injured patients receive only 43 percent of \nspending on medical malpractice and medical product litigation. And \nvictims often receive their awards after many years of delay.\n  Our medical malpractice system is a stealth contributor to the high \ncost of health care. The American Medical Association reports that in \nthe 1980's liability insurance premiums grew faster that other \nphysician practice expenses. The cost of liability insurance has been \nestimated at $9 billion in 1992.\n  So called defensive medicine costs are an even greater concern. The \nOffice of Technology Assessment has found that as many as 8 percent of \ndiagnostic procedures are ordered primarily because of doctors' \nconcerns about liability. These defensive practices present a hidden \nbut significant burden on our health care system. The health care \n[[Page S2871]] consulting firm, Lewin-VHI, has estimated that physician \nand hospital charges for defensive medicine were as high as $25 billion \nin 1991.\n  Taxpayers and health care consumers bear the financial burden of \nthese excessive costs. Liability insurance and defensive medicine \npremiums drive up the cost of Medicare and Medicaid and of private \nhealth care premiums. Further, in some specialties, such as obstetrics, \nwhere malpractice premiums have skyrocketed, malpractice liability may \nbe reducing access to quality health care. The American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists report of that malpractice costs for \nob/gyns increased 350 percent between 1982 and 1988, and that by 1988, \n41 percent of those ob/gyns surveyed indicated that they had made \nchanges in their practice patterns, such as ceasing to serve high-risk \npatients, because of malpractice concerns.\n  The bill we're introducing today will begin to address these \ninefficiencies and perverse effects of our malpractice system by \ndirecting a greater portion of malpractice awards to victims, by \ndiscouraging frivolous law suits, and by enhancing quality assurance \nprograms. Key provisions of this malpractice reform bill include:\n  Establishing a uniform statute of limitations, 2 years from the date \nthe injury was discovered.\n  Allowing periodic payments for awards greater than $100,000.\n  Applying several, not joint and several liability for noneconomic and \npunitive damages.\n  Limiting attorneys' contingency fees to 33\\1/3\\ of the $150,000 of an \naward and 25 percent of any amount above $150,000.\n  Establishing a clear and convincing evidence standard for doctors \ndelivering a baby who had not previously treated the pregnant women.\n  Requiring States to establish mandatory alternative dispute \nresolution.\n  Strengthening the standard for awarding punitive damages and \nestablish State health care quality assurance programs funded with 50 \npercent of punitive damage awards.\n  Requiring providers and insurers to participate in risk management \nprograms every 3 years to better detect and prevent practices which may \nresult in patient injury.\n  Increasing consumer access to the National Practitioner Data Bank \nwhich contains information on disciplinary actions against health care \nproviders.\n  The bill also incorporates legislation I introduced earlier this year \nwith Senator McConnell and others, S. 303, the Biomaterials Access \nAssurance Act of 1995. That bill seeks to ensure that raw materials \ncontinue to be available for use in life-saving medical devices. It \nallows suppliers of raw materials or biomaterials used to make medical \nimplants to obtain dismissal, with minimal legal costs, from certain \ntort suits in which plaintiffs allege harm from a finished medical \nproduct containing the biomaterial.\n  Many of the reform ideas in the legislation we are introducing today \nwere proposed or cosponsored by Democrats and Republicans in the last \nCongress as part of comprehensive health care reform bills. A number of \nthese ideas were embraced last year by a group of us participating in \nthe bipartisan Senate mainstream coalition. But we had little chance to \ndebate these issues in the last Congress. I am optimistic that we will \nhave the opportunity in this Congress to pass a bipartisan medical \nmalpractice reform bill. I encourage my colleagues to consider this \nlegislation and join Senator McConnell, Senator Kassebaum, and me as we \nseek to improve our medical malpractice system.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 455. A bill entitled the ``Consultation Clarification Act''; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     Consultation clarification Act\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend \nthe Endangered Species Act. I am introducing a bill critical to the \npeople of this country who are held hostage by the inappropriate \nimplementation of a provision of the Endangered Species Act.\n  One abuse in particular has caused me to rise today with an urgent \nneed to make a clarification to the Endangered Species Act.\n  Late last month a Federal judge issued an injunction to protect an \nendangered strain of salmon. This action resulted in the shutting down \nof all mining, logging, and grazing in six Idaho National Forests. It \ndidn't cover just the activities that would affect the salmon, it \nincluded all activities on lands that represent 30 percent of the land \nin the State of Idaho. And worse, it adversely affected people lives \nand jobs in half of the States.\n  Mr. President, this is the area of the State of Idaho where people's \njobs are needlessly at risk because of the vagaries of the courts and \nFederal agencies. The court imposed a 5-day injunction on all \nactivities on the national forests covering 30 percent of the area of \nthe State of Idaho and jeopardizing the jobs of nearly 5,000 workers, \nworkers on projects that have been in continuous operation that the \nForest Service has determined will not jeopardize the endangered salmon \nruns. And adding uncertainty to another 5,000 workers whose jobs are \ninfluenced by the project work.\n  Mr. President, 2,500 people rallied in Challis, ID, January 21 to let \ntheir Government know that they are frustrated that no one is \nconsidering their plight. They are facing loss of jobs, not having \nmoney for food and clothing, and the uncertainties of having to move \nfrom their homes. I got a letter from Russell Ebberts who is an eighth \ngrader in Challis, ID. He's facing having to move if his Dad looses his \njob. And Danny Fisher and Karena Turpin were planing on getting married \nin June. Their wedding and future plans have been shattered. And as \nlong as there is a threat of a recurrence of that injunctions, they \nmust continue to be worried.\n  The current injunction, when it was in effect, affected mainly mining \noperations, but future injunctions, when they come will affect grazing, \ntimber harvest including salvage, and other activities. We have \nestimated that if the injunction is put in\n place again in March, it will cost $65,000 per day in the loss of \nfolks' wages across Idaho. That is intolerable.\n  The insanity of this injunction was that many of the projects that \nwould be shut down had already been the subject of consultation under \nthe Endangered Species Act and had been determined to not harm the \nsalmon.\n  Let me repeat that important point, Mr. President. These are projects \nthat had already been the subject of consultation, and had been found \nto have no effect on the salmon. Nonetheless, just because these \nprojects were contained within a national forest management plan, and \nthe plan had not yet been consulted upon for the salmon, the projects \nwere subject to immediate cessation.\n  Why, you ask, had the plan not been made subject to consultation? \nThat is the irony of this judge's order. The plans in the six national \nforests had been consulted upon, in addition to the projects within the \nplans. The problem was that the salmon was listed under the Endangered \nSpecies Act after the forest plans had been consulted upon.\n  Well, Mr. President, the injunction was temporarily lifted, until \nMarch 15. Hopefully this will be enough time for the National Marine \nFisheries Service to complete consultation on the forest plans. But, if \nanything goes wrong, the injunction may be imposed again. As the year \nprogresses, more and more people's jobs will be at risk. These \nuncertainties in folks' lives are not necessary.\n  The legislation my colleague from Idaho and I are sponsoring does \nonly one thing, it clarifies that it has never been the intent of \nCongress to give the regulatory agencies two opportunities to consult \non the same project. It was never the intent to cause a project that \nhas already been approved under the Endangered Species Act to come to a \nhalt while the plan of which it is a part goes through a second review.\n  Since the enactment of the Endangered Species Act, Congress has \nenacted laws requiring agencies to do broad plans for their activities. \nThese agencies are required by Federal law to have different levels of \nplanning--a broad scale long term plan and then site specific plans.\n  Court decisions like this one have begun to force an interpretation \nthat \n[[Page S2872]] there must be consultation on both levels of planning \nand that both these plans and the resulting projects may be held up if \nthe consultation on both has not been completed.\n  This is double jeopardy. We\n   cannot afford to allow our Federal Government to waste taxpayers \ndollars in essentially looking at the same project twice. We can no \nlonger throw out years of planning and community involvement on these \nplans every time a new species is listed. The laws and regulations for \nboth the Forest Service and the BLM allow for these kinds of updates--\nthey are called amendments and require the kinds of public involvement \nthat put people back into the management of their public lands.\n\n  Mr. President, it is time that Congress is clear about what we \nintended for the consultation process. My bill amends section 7 of the \nEndangered Species Act to clarify that when a consultation has been \ncompleted on a project, the project does not need to stop while \nconsultation is done on the overriding plan.\n  This is a necessary clarification of the intent of Congress on this \nissue. Its intent is to avoid unnecessary multiple consultations on a \nproject. We envision that it will help with existing situations in \nOregon, Idaho, New Mexico, and California and it will prevent many \nother States from getting in the same situation that we are currently \nfacing in Idaho.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that we are not intending to \nreform the Endangered Species Act with this bill. That reform effort is \none that I feel needs careful consideration, constructive debate, and \nsubstantive suggestions over the months ahead. We are planning hearings \non this broader reform bill and are looking to submit a comprehensive \nreauthorization bill in the fall.\n  Mr. President, my bill will fix a small, but critical part of the \nfrustrations caused by liberal interpretations of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. And, it will head off potential catastrophes in the short \nrun that will bog down the kind of innovative discussions that are \nneeded to bring forth the best possible bill reauthorizing the \nEndangered Species Act, to benefit the species truly at risk and to \nhelp, not hinder the American people.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dorgan, \n        and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 456. A bill to improve and strengthen the child support collection \nsystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the interstate child support responsibility act\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the crucible of American society \nis the family. Today the family faces stresses and injuries that we \nhave never seen before in this country. Almost every child is affected \nby these pressures: the 40 percent of children who go home to an empty \nhouse every afternoon because both parents work as well as the 27 \npercent of children who live with only one parent. Our efforts as a \nnation must address these stresses by seeking to recouple sexual \nbehavior and childbearing with family responsibility. That \nresponsibility involves giving time, love, care, and attention, but it \nalso includes food, clothing, and medical care. We should send a clear \nmessage, above all to young men: If you father a child, whether or not \nyou are married to the mother of that child, be prepared to set aside \none-sixth or more of your earnings every year for 18 years to help that \nchild grow up healthy, educated, and responsible.\n  That's the principle of child support. Today, Mr. President, I rise \nto introduce a bill that will reinforce that principle by repairing all \nthe holes in the tattered, State-based system of child support \nenforcement. That system has not worked well. It left $5.1 billion in \ncourt-ordered child support uncollected last year. It succeeds in \nestablishing paternity for less than 40 percent of out-of-wedlock \nbirths. Still, the complex Federal-State system succeeds in collecting \n$3.98 for every dollar spent on enforcement. We face a choice. We can \nthrow out the State system and replace it with a Federal bureaucracy, \nwhich might be more cumbersome but would be as hard to run away from as \nthe IRS. Or, we can try to repair the State system, help States work \ntogether better, require some uniformity, and help the States by \ncreating national databases of child support orders and new hires. That \nis the path that I and a number of my colleagues of both parties have \nchosen in developing the bill we introduce today.\n  About 17.6 million children live with just one parent. There are \nalmost 10 million women who are raising children on their own. Almost \none-third of them live below the poverty level. Less than 60 percent \nhave child support orders. Only half of those who have child support \norders receive the full amount due.\n  Mothers who do not receive child support do all they can to remain \noff of welfare. By definition, almost every family receiving Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children should be receiving child support, \nexcept in cases where one parent is deceased or in the small number of \ntwo-parent families participating in the AFDC-UP program. When we talk \nabout welfare, we have to recognize that for every woman who is raising \nchildren, receiving welfare and not working, there is a father who is \nnot raising the children and who may or may not be working. Either way, \nhe is exploiting welfare as much or more than the mother who is \nreceiving welfare. Tougher child support enforcement has resulted in \ncollections for 873,000 families on welfare in 1993, and much of that \nmoney went back to the taxpayers to make up for welfare payments \nalready made.\n  If this Congress undertakes a serious effort at welfare reform, child \nsupport enforcement along the lines we propose today must be a part of \nit. I am very pleased that my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, especially Congresswomen Marge Roukema and Nancy \nJohnson, were able to persuade the leadership of the Ways and Means \nCommittee to expand the Contract With America's welfare reform bill to \ninclude comprehensive child support reform. But as I said last year, if \nwelfare reform continues to be delayed by controversy, we must not \nallow child support to be delayed along with it. There is consensus on \nchild support, and there are also three times as many mothers due child \nsupport who are not eligible for welfare as are. They should not have \nto wait until we fix the welfare system before they receive the support \ndue them.\n  The link to welfare makes child support a valid concern of the \nFederal Government, but it is also a Federal concern because one-third \nof all child support cases are interstate cases, which means that the \nparents live in different States. These cases are the most difficult to \nresolve. By moving from State to State and changing jobs, parents can \nsystematically avoid paying child support, or even being located so \nthat their wages can be withheld, for about a year at a time. These \ndeliberate evasions occur against a backdrop of inconsistent State \nlaws, inadequate staff and computer resources, and a continually \ngrowing caseload due to the tremendous rise in out-of-wedlock births.\n  Expanded paternity establishment is key to improving interstate child \nsupport enforcement. Every year more than 1 million children are born \nto unmarried women, about one-fourth of all births that year. About 57 \npercent of black children, 23 percent of Hispanic children, and 17 \npercent of white children born in 1990 were born to unwed mothers. In \n1990, 68 percent of all births to women between the ages of 15 to 19 \nwere out of wedlock.\n  Out-of-wedlock births need not automatically consign a mother and \nchildren to poverty. They can be handled like a divorce; support can be \nordered and enforced. But in about one-quarter of the cases, the State \ncannot even get started, because they cannot obtain any information \nabout the father.\n  Many of the paternity establishment provisions of my earlier bill \nwere passed in the 1993 budget package, which required States to \nestablish hospital-based paternity establishment programs. These \nprograms are now up and running, and are demonstrating a significant \nincrease in the number of child support cases in which the father can \nbe identified, so that support can be ordered and the other enforcement \nmechanisms can kick in. About 85 percent of fathers are in touch with \nthe child and mother at, or soon after, the \n[[Page S2873]] birth. Many fathers visit their children in the hospital \nor birthing center. Programs that target these fathers and provide \nopportunities for them to acknowledge paternity can do a lot to cut \ndown on the number of children for whom paternity has not been \nestablished.\n  For the situations where the father was not targeted at the hospital, \nthis bill contains provisions which would make it easier for paternity \nto be established by courts or administrative agencies. It makes it \nless difficult to locate out-of-State fathers by expanding the locate \ninformation and services available to custodial parents and child \nsupport professionals. It mandates changes in evidence standards which \nremove many of the obstacles\n that now exist to paternity establishment across State lines. It \nprovides State child support agencies for the first time with a Federal \nincentive to work on establishing paternity, not just collecting child \nsupport that has already been ordered.\n\n  Even when parentage is established, custodial parents always seem to \nbe one step behind noncustodial parents. If a noncustodial parent gets \na job in another State, child support officials do not usually learn \nabout the job change until the next quarter in which the employer has \nto report payroll information. By the time child support officials in \nthe custodial parent's State learn the information, the noncustodial \nparent has often moved to another job. A year can pass. This scenario \nis played out over and over in interstate cases.\n  This bill requires information on every new hire to be filed in a \nnational database, which States can regularly search for the names or \nSocial Security numbers of parents who owe support to children in their \nStates.\n  To eliminate the problems associated with establishing a support \norder across State lines, my bill requires the States to expand their \nlong-arm statutes to reach more out-of-State noncustodial parents. It \nrequires States to recognize and enforce child support orders from \nother States, and it also requires all States to adopt the Uniform \nInterstate Family Support Act, adopted by the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws, verbatim so that inconsistencies \nbetween the States in case processing and enforcement can be \neliminated.\n  Even where a support order has been established, custodial parents \nstill have problems collecting money, especially in interstate cases. \nIn response, this bill requires the States to take tougher measures \nagainst parents who do not pay their child support. It requires them to \npass laws making it possible for delinquent parents to lose their \nprofessional and occupational licenses, hitting them in a sense at \ntheir livelihood. It requires the States to hold off issuing driver's \nlicenses to delinquent parents. It calls for the expanded use of credit \nreporting--it is interesting that a noncustodial parent can be \ndelinquent on a car loan and that fact can be reported on a credit \nreport, but the fact that he or she is delinquent on child support \nmight not be reported. In addition, this bill requires the States to \nintercept lottery winnings, money judgments, and other income of \nnoncustodial parents who owe child support. This bill also requires the \nStates to make it easier to freeze the bank accounts of delinquent \nparents, and requires the States to make it a State crime to willfully \nfail to pay child support.\n  Finally, this bill responds to staffing the training issues which \nhave plagued child support professionals for decades. In a GAO report I \nand the other congressional members of the commission requested, it was \nreported that the average caseload per child support case worker is \n1,000 cases. Can you imagine, Mr. President, 1,000 cases? This bill \nrequires the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct \nstaffing studies in every State and report such findings to this body \nand the States. It also requires the Office of Child Support \nEnforcement to make training assistance available to State child \nsupport agencies.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents a consensus, an overdue \nconsensus, about the kinds of repairs that are needed in the child \nsupport system. It began with the recommendations of the U.S. \nCommission on Interstate Child Support Enforcement, of which I was a \nmember. I put those recommendations forward as legislation in 1992, as \ndid my colleagues on the commission, Representatives Marge Roukema and \nBarbara Kennelly. Last year, the administration took those central \nrecommendations and added some detail about the national databases of \nchild support orders and new hires. Late last year and early this year, \nthe House Caucus on Women's Issues took up the subject, and earlier \nthis month introduced a bill modeled on the administration's and my \nearlier bill. The bill we introduce today is intended to be the Senate \ncompanion to H.R. 785, the Johnson bill in the House, with only minor \ndifferences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be \ninserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 456\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

It would establish uniform procedures among \n     states; create state and national databases to locate absent \n     parents and garnish the wages of parents who owe child \n     support; improve paternity establishment; and make it easier \n     to modify child support orders as necessary.\n       The legislation is based on recommendations of the U.S. \n     Commission on Interstate Child Support Enforcement, the \n     Office of Child Support Enforcement at HHS, and child support \n     administrators from many states. Its provisions are \n     comparable to those of S. 689 in the 103d Congress (the \n     Bradley bill) and the child support section of S. 2224, the \n     Work and Family Responsibility Act, updated to account for \n     more recent innovations in enforcement at the state level. It \n     also parallels H.R. 785, with exceptions as noted below.\n\n\n                            state uniformity\n\n       States would be required to adopt the Uniform Interstate \n     Family Support Act (UIFSA) in its entirety. This model \n     legislation, already adopted by 20 states, sets a framework \n     for determining jurisdiction of interstate cases, and governs \n     the relationship among states.\n       The Full Faith and Credit Act, signed into law last year, \n     which requires every state to respect child support orders \n     from other states, would be modified to follow UIFSA.\n       States would establish administrative procedures for \n     paternity establishment, subpoenas, liens, access to \n     financial information, and suspension of drivers' and \n     professional licenses for parents in arrears on child \n     support. Custodial parents would not have to go to court.\n\n\n                     enforcement of support orders\n\n       Outlines the procedures by which a state may suspend the \n     licenses (including driver's, professional and occupational) \n     of delinquent non-custodial parents, as well as procedures \n     through which the state may place liens on the delinquent \n     parent property.\n       Requires states to report to credit bureaus delinquencies \n     that exceed 30 days.\n       Grants families who are owed child support the right to \n     first access to an IRS refund credited to a delinquent non-\n     custodial parent, except for amounts due from time the family \n     received AFDC.\n       Subjects federal employees to the same withholding and \n     enforcement rules as other workers. Clarifies rules for \n     active-duty military personnel.\n       Extends the statute of limitations for the collection of \n     child support arrearage to the child's 30th birthday.\n       Permits the denial of a passport for individuals who are \n     more than $5,000 or 24 months in arrears.\n       Establllishes state-based demonstration projects to address \n     non-custodial parents' visitation and custody issues.\n\n\n                        state automated systems\n\n       Each state would establish a database of basic information \n     about every child support order opened in that state. This \n     data would be sent to a national registry on a regular \n     [[Page S2888]] basis to aid in enforcement of interstate \n     cases.\n       States would centralize the collection and disbursement of \n     information and payments. Employers would be able to send \n     withheld income to one state location, even if a county has \n     jurisdiction over the child support order. States may \n     contract the collection and distribution system out to \n     private firms.\n\n\n        national systems--expanded federal parent locator system\n\n       The modified Federal Parent Locator System would contain \n     three components: a databank of Child Support Orders; \n     directory of new hires, and expanded locator.\n       The Databank of Child Support Orders contains information \n     on child support orders, as obtained from the individual \n     states.\n       The Directory of New Hires will record basic information \n     supplied by employers. This data will be compared against the \n     child support data in order to better track down parents \n     evading payment of child support, especially on the \n     interstate level.\n       The expanded locator component allows states to access \n     federal information to not only enforce orders, but also to \n     establish paternity and establish and modify orders.\n\n\n                   voluntary paternity establishment\n\n       The process of determination of paternity would be \n     simplified, and voluntary paternity processes enhanced. These \n     provisions would strengthen the hospital-based paternity \n     establishment provisions enacted into law in the 1993 budget \n     reconciliation.\n       For parents who voluntarily acknowledge paternity, a signed \n     affidavit would be presumed to be a final judgement of \n     paternity 60 days after signature. Both parents must be \n     informed of their rights and responsibilities before signing \n     the acknowledgement. Exceptions to the final judgement status \n     include fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.\n       Minor parents who sign the voluntary acknowledgement not in \n     the presence of a parent or guardian may rescind that \n     acknowledgment at any time until turning 18, or until court \n     proceedings in which the teen and his or her attorney, parent \n     or guardian is present.\n       At state option, states may waive fees charged to fathers \n     who cooperate with the state, e.g. for genetic testing.\n\n\n            modification and establishment of support orders\n\n       Requires that child support orders may be reviewed by a \n     state at the request of either parent every three years or \n     when there is a substantial change in the financial \n     circumstances of either parent.\n       Requires parents to exchange financial information \n     annually.\n       Establishes a National Child Support Guidelines Commission, \n     which will develop support order guidelines which states may \n     adopt of Congress may consider adopting nationally.\n\n\n                   program administration and funding\n\n       Increases the base federal matching rate for child support \n     services from 66% to 75%. Creates an incentive payment to \n     state of up to 15% for paternity establishment and overall \n     performance of a state IV-D program. Strengthens penalties on \n     states for failure to comply with program requirements.\n\n\n                                 costs\n\n       Increased match rate will cost approximately $300 million \n     over five years. Other costs to federal and state taxpayers \n     have not been scored by CBO, but all will be offset by \n     increased collections. (The existing program, despite flaws, \n     collects $3.98 for every $1 spent.)\n\n\n              differences between senate bill and h.r. 785\n\n       Senate bill authorizes a demonstration in several states of \n     innovative procedures to mediate disputes over visitation and \n     custody.\n       Senate bill is slightly less prescriptive to states.\n       Senate bill includes more specific instructions to the \n     Commission on Child Support Guidelines, and permits the \n     Commission to conclude that national guidelines are not \n     needed.\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Child \nSupport Act of 1995, introduced by Mr. Bradley.\n  With over half of our marriages ending in divorce in the United \nStates, and more and more children being born out-of-wedlock, single \nparent households have become more and more common. Most of the \nchildren in these homes grow up to be healthy and happy contributors to \nour society. Too many, however, are abandoned by a parent at a young \nage and struggle into adulthood. Mom or Dad, while raising a child, is \nworking to make ends meet--without the help of the child's other \nparent.\n  We have spent a great deal of time talking about family and the role \nof the State in preserving traditional families. We have talked at \ngreat length about how to help poor unwed and single mothers become \nindependent from government handouts. Certainly, a central factor as to \nwhy these mothers are on welfare in the first place and may not be able \nto get off, is because of the lack of support coming from their child's \nfather.\n  Only 58 percent of single mothers had a child support order in 1990--\nthe vast majority of single mothers had applied for such an order but \nwere unsuccessful in receiving one. The numbers are quite stark: over \nhalf of the 17.2 million children in single parent\n homes in our Nation are living in poverty.\n\n  I think there is consensus on this issue--Republican or Democrat, \nRhode Islander or Mississippian--we all agree that the time has come \nfor Congress to become more involved in ensuring that children are not \ncheated out of a healthy childhood. This legislation does an admirable \njob of addressing the problems of ``dead-beat'' parents.\n  Currently, States have a rather haphazard way of collecting child \nsupport. With the ease in which citizens move from one State to \nanother, there is a real need to have strong and efficient \ncommunication between the States in collecting child support. This \nlegislation addresses this problem through the creation of a national \ndata base of child support orders. States will be required to \nperiodically contribute new child support orders to this registry which \nmay then be accessed by other states. Clearly, such a program aids \ngreatly in tracking down interstate cases. In addition, by requiring \nparents to exchange financial information annually and streamlining the \ncollection and distribution policy of the States, this legislation will \nmake it far less complicated to ensure that those families deserving of \nchild support moneys will get it.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this crucial legislation. By \nsome estimates, in 1990, if we had enforceable child support orders \nreflecting ability to pay, single mothers and children would have \nreceived nearly $50 billion in child support. I am sure that you would \nagree that such a number is astounding. This money is wilfully being \nkept from the children who need it. We cannot, in good conscience, talk \nabout reforming our welfare system without discussing more effective \nways to ensure that poor children are in fact receiving the fiscal and \nemotional support that they need in order to grow and to thrive. Thank \nyou very much for your time and consideration.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nBradley today as a cosponsor of the Interstate Child Support \nResponsibility Act of 1995. My esteemed colleague from Connecticut, \nRepresentative Johnson, introduced a similar bill in the House, and I \nthank them both for their leadership on this issue. The bill will \ngreatly strengthen our child support enforcement system. This year, as \nCongress debates dramatic changes to our welfare system, we should make \nchild support enforcement a key part of our welfare reform agenda and \nshould pass the comprehensive reforms set forth in this act.\n  A tough child support enforcement system has three far-reaching \nbenefits for our society. First, child support directly improves the \nlives of millions of children. An increasing number of our children \ndepend on child support. Thirty years ago the vast number of children \nlived with both of their parents. But an astounding 50 percent of all \nchildren born in the 1980's will spend some time in a single-parent \nfamily. Children living with only one parent are all too likely to \nexperience poverty. In 1992, half of the children living in single-\nparent families--over 8 million children--were poor. Improving child \nsupport enforcement will directly improve the quality of these \nchildren's lives and their chances for a bright future.\n  Second, enhancing child support enforcement will help keep families \noff of public assistance. About 45 percent of families enter our \nwelfare system as a result of a divorce or separation, and another 30 \npercent seek welfare assistance after having a child out-of-wedlock. \nReceiving support from the absent parent can make the difference for \nmany families between self-sufficiency and dependency.\n  Third, strengthening child support enforcement sends a critical \nmessage of responsibility to parents. The decision to have a child has \nprofound moral content. Our child support policies must clearly signal \nthat our society will hold all parents accountable for \n[[Page S2889]] their children. In an era of skyrocketing out-of-wedlock \nbirths and rising teen pregnancy rates, child support enforcement \npayments must become a well known and unavoidable fact of life for \nabsent fathers and mothers. Would-be ``dead-beat'' dads must know that \nthey can't\n simply cross a State border to escape support payments.\n\n  For too many parents today, child support collection is not a \ncertainty. Less than 60 percent of custodial mothers establish a child \nsupport order. And only half of support orders are paid in full. The \nUrban Institute estimates that the gap between the amount of child \nsupport parents should be paying and the amount we are actually \ncollecting is $34 billion a year.\n  The bill we are introducing today will help close that child support \ncollection gap. It will help States at each step of the child support \ncollection process. The bill will make it easier for States to locate \nabsent noncustodial parents; establish paternity; establish a court \norder; and enforce payment of court orders.\n  To help States locate parents and collect child support the bill, \namong other things: Requires States to automate and centralize child \nsupport order data to aid in enforcement of interstate cases; requires \nemployers to notify States of new hires and establishes a Federal \ndirectory of new hires to aid in locating parents; streamlines \nprocedures for voluntary paternity establishment; provides States with \ngreater financial incentives to establish paternity; requires more \nfrequent modification of child support orders so awards will increase \nwith parents' earnings; requires States to have procedures for \nsuspending drivers licenses and professional licenses of deadbeat \nparents; and provides greater incentives for States to increase child \nsupport collection.\n  The bill will also support State demonstration projects to address an \nunderlying cause of some parents' failure to pay child support because \naccess or visitation rulings limit their involvement in their \nchildren's lives. The bill will help States try new ways of working \nwith families to increase noncustodial parents' visitation privileges \nand their financial commitment to their children.\n  While the bill will impose modest administrative costs on States and \nthe Federal Government, it will also save both levels of government \nmoney over the long term. That is why State welfare administrators \nsupport it. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Reports \nthat for every $1 spent on child support enforcement, $4 is collected. \nThe collected funds are delivered to families and are used in part to \nreimburse Federal and State governments for welfare expenditures. This \nbill's provisions will increase the rate of return on our investment, \nbenefiting children, families, and taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that child support enforcement must \nbe a part of our welfare reform strategy. Last month I introduced S. \n246, the Welfare Reform That Works Act--a bill that would help States \nmake bold changes to their welfare systems to move welfare recipients \ninto the work force and strengthen families. I stated when I introduced \nthe bill, and I want to reiterate now, that the States ability to \nachieve our welfare reform goals will be limited if we do not improve \nour child support enforcement programs. States' welfare caseloads will \nbe higher and their budgets lower if deadbeat parents can continue to \nevade their responsibilities, if teenagers know that they can continue \nto have babies without consequences.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Bradley and the \nbill's other cosponsors in supporting the act.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

GUIDELINES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 8\n\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute is the lead Federal \n     agency for research on the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and \n     treatment of cancer;\n       Whereas health professionals and consumers throughout the \n     Nation regard the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute \n     as reliable scientific and medical advice;\n       Whereas it has been proven that intervention with routine \n     screening for breast cancer through mammography can save \n     women's lives at a time when medical science is unable to \n     prevent this disease;\n       Whereas there are statistical limitations to evaluating the \n     efficacy of mammography in a 5-10 year age range of women, \n     using existing studies designed to test the efficacy of \n     mammography in a 25-30 year age range of women;\n       Whereas there were numerous shortcomings identified in a \n     Canadian study designed to address reduction of mortality \n     from breast cancer in the 40-49 age range;\n       Whereas to date, it is not possible to have the same degree \n     of scientific confidence about the benefit of mammography for \n     women ages 40-49 as exists for women ages 50-69 due to \n     inherent limitations in the studies that have been conducted;\n       Whereas meta-analysis (combining the results of several \n     studies) is sometimes useful, and the studies used to reach \n     the National Cancer Institute's conclusions were not easily \n     combined because of variations in design, technology, \n     screening interval, the inclusion or exclusion of clinical \n     breast examination, and quality;\n       Whereas the existing clinical trial data are inadequate to \n     provide a definite answer to the efficacy of early detection \n     in the 40-49 age group and there has been a dramatic change \n     in technology during the 30-year period since the initiation \n     of the first study of breast cancer screening;\n       Whereas the majority, approximately 80 percent, of women \n     who are diagnosed with breast cancer have no identifiable \n     risk for this disease;\n       Whereas breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death \n     among women in the age group 15-54;\n       Whereas the American Cancer Society and 21 other national \n     medical organizations and health and consumer groups are at \n     variance with the recently rescinded guideline of the \n     National Cancer Institute for mammography for women ages 40-\n     49; and\n       Whereas the statement of scientific fact on breast cancer \n     screening issued by the National Cancer Institute on December \n     3, 1993, will cause widespread confusion and concern among \n     women and physicians, erode confidence in mammography, and \n     reinforce barriers and negative attitudes that keep women of \n     all ages from being screened: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) adequately designed and conducted studies are needed to \n     determine the benefit of screening women ages 40-49 through \n     mammography and other emerging technologies;\n       (2) the National Cancer Institute's statement of scientific \n     fact on breast cancer screening should clearly state that the \n     uncertainty of evidence for women in this age group is due to \n     the limitations of existing studies (as of the date of \n     issuance of the statement); and\n       (3) the National Cancer Institute should reissue the \n     recently rescinded guideline for mammography for women ages \n     40-49 or direct the public to consider guidelines issued by \n     other organizations.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, breast cancer is the most common \nform of cancer in American women. One out of every eight women in the \nUnited States will develop breast cancer in her lifetime--a staggering \nincrease from the 1-out-to-14 rate in 1960. An estimated 2.6 million \nwomen in America are living with breast cancer--1.6 million who have \nbeen diagnosed and an estimated 1 million do not yet know they have the \ndisease. And every 12 minutes, a woman will die from breast cancer.\n  We do not know what causes breast cancer, or how to cure it. Women \nwith breast cancer are dying at the same rate today as they did in the \n1930's, and the same basic methods of treatment are being used--\nsurgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Clearly, we need to promote \nresearch into the cause of, optimal treatment of, and cure for breast \ncancer.\n  However, another importance weapon in fighting the battle against \nbreast cancer is detecting breast cancer in its early stages. Survival \nrates drop dramatically the later the disease is diagnosed. And one of \nthe most important tools for early detection is mammography, a low-dose \nx ray used to examine a woman's breasts.\n  Recognizing the important of consistent guidelines on breast cancer \nscreening, the American College of Radiology convened a series of \nmeetings in 1987. As a result of those meetings, in June 1989, 12 U.S. \nmedical organizations including the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, and the National Cancer Institute endorsed \nbreast cancer screening guidelines which advised that asymptomatic \nwomen should begin having mammograms at age 40.\n  However, in 1993, the National Cancer Institute rescinded its \nguidelines stating that there was no evidence that the examinations \nsignificantly reduced breast cancer deaths in that age group. It seems \nclear, upon closer inspection, that studies used to reach the National \nCancer Institute's conclusions did not warrant a rescission of the \nguidelines because there were significant variations in design, \ntechnology, screening intervals, the inclusion or exclusion of clinical \nbreast examination, and quality between studies. Furthermore, the \nNational Cancer Institute's statement has caused widespread confusion \nand concern among women and physicians, eroded confidence in \nmammography, and reinforced barriers and negative attitudes that \ndiscourage women from seeking mammograms.\n  Consequently, I am introducing this resolution expressing the sense \nof the Congress that adequately designed and conducted studies are \nneeded to determine the benefit of screening women ages 40 to 49 \nthrough mammography and other emerging technologies, that the National \nCancer Institute's statement on breast cancer screening should clearly \nstate that the uncertainty of evidence for women in this age groups is \ndue to limitations of studies conducted prior to the rescission of its \nguidelines, and that the National Cancer Institute should reissue its \nguidelines.\n  Hopefully, by reducing the barriers which presently discourage women \nfrom seeking mammograms, the adoption of this resolution will add to \nour limited arsenal of weapons to fight breast cancer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2890-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2890-S2891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n               BALANCED BUDGET CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                     GRAMM AMENDMENTS NOS. 285-286\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRAMM submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, the Air Force and Navy are quietly \nscrapping our electronic warfare [EW] squadrons. At best, the Services \nare making penny wise and pound foolish decisions. At worst, the Air \nForce and Navy are attempting to force Congress into funding an all-\nstealthy tactical aviation fleet. Either way, America is on the verge \nof losing its decisive edge in EW.\n  Reviewing the ``Conduct of the Persian Gulf War,'' one is struck by \nthe crucial role EW played in achieving air superiority:\n\n       The attacks on the Iraqi electronic order of battle [EOB] \n     affected every aspect of [the] air supremacy operation. \n     Coalition aircraft conducting air defense suppression \n     missions saturated Iraqi airspace with jammers, shooters, and \n     bombers. Iraqi defense that attempted to engage were \n     disrupted, and risked being destroyed. EF-111A's and EA-6B's \n     were used in stand-off and close-in orbits to jam early \n     warning, acquisition, and [Ground Control Intercept] GCI \n     radars. EC-130H Compass Call aircraft jammed radio \n     communications, data links, and navigation systems. F-4G's, \n     F-16's, EA-6B's, A-6E's, A-7E's, and F/A-18's used [High-\n     Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles] HARMs to destroy acquisition, \n     GCI, and target tracking radars. Various aircraft dropped \n     bombs on air defense emplacements and control facilities. \n     [Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses] SEAD forces and bomb \n     droppers caused confusion, hesitation, and loss of \n     capability, which degraded Iraqi air defense capability.\n\n  This confusion, hesitation, and loss of capability was directly \nresponsible for the spectacular success of our air and ground \ncampaigns. More importantly, air superiority was a key element in \nreducing Coalition losses in men and material. Yet, a mere 4 years \nsince Desert Storm, our EW capability is rapidly wasting away for lack \nof funds.\n  The most immediate dilemma facing Congress is the proposed \ntermination of the EF-111A System Improvement Program (SIP). EF-111 \nperformance, pre-SIP, was described in glowing terms in the ``Conduct \nof the Persian Gulf War:''\n\n       [EF-111As] were part of the initial surge of aircraft \n     across the Iraqi border the first night of the war, and \n     established orbits to escort strike packages into the H-3 and \n     Baghdad areas. They jammed EW, height finder, GCI, and \n     target-acquisition radars, and were effective in tricking the \n     enemy into opening fire at fake radar returns in areas where \n     there were no Coalition aircraft.\n\n  It should be noted that only F-117's were cleared for Baghdad, a \npoint that I will return to in a moment.\n  The SIP will significantly enhance the effectiveness, reliability, \nand maintainability of the already proven EF-111. Unfortunately, the \nAir Force proposed, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense \naccepted, the termination of the SIP in fiscal year 1996 for budgetary \nreasons preparatory to retiring the aircraft in fiscal year 1997.\n  To compensate for the loss of EW capability that will result from the \ntermination of the SIP and retirement of the EF-111A, the Air Force has \nsuggested a number of alternatives:\n       [[Page S2893]] Navy EA-6B's can handle EW duties: Jointness \n     at its most cynical. The EA-6B Advanced Capability (ADVCAP) \n     upgrade was cancelled by the Navy in February 1994. The \n     future of Navy EW is in disarray, and it is likely that EA-6B \n     modernization will be limited to safety of flight \n     improvements until the retirement of the aircraft;\n       Stealthy aircraft require less EW support: Perhaps, but, as \n     mentioned before, F-117's benefited from EW support in the \n     skies over Baghdad. Stealth is actually an EW force \n     multiplier, because the jamming power and techniques needed \n     to hide an aircraft with the radar cross section (RCS) of a \n     B-52 will be many times more effective hiding an aircraft \n     with the RCS of a sparrow; and,\n       Jamming pods can replace stand-off jammers: This is, at \n     best, only a partial solution. Pods provide only self-\n     protection, frequencies, power output, and techniques are \n     limited, man-in-the-loop responsiveness is lost, and aircraft \n     maneuverability, payload, speed, and range are reduced.\n\n  The menu of options presented by the Air Force is hardly ideal, and, \ntaken separately, or in some combination, represent a significant \ndiminution of U.S. EW capability. Worse yet, the use of prior year EF-\n111A SIP funds as a source for the supplemental by the House \nAppropriations Committee may foreclose our opportunity to debate the \nwisdom of the EF-111A SIP cancellation. If prior year EF-111A SIP funds \nare rescinded, the termination of the program will be irreversible.\n  So what do we do? First, drop EF-111A SIP funds as a source for the \nsupplemental. Second, pry loose the congressionally mandated Joint \nTactical Electronic Warfare Study. Third, if the study says what I \nthink it will, ensure that the fiscal year 1996 defense authorization \nand appropriations bills include funds to maintain and modernize the \nEF-111A, EA-6B, and F-4G (``Wild Weasel'') fleets.\n  The alternative is to let the services have their way, and let \nAmerica's EW advantage erode. This erosion will have profound \nimplications for Congress. Without proper EW support, conventional \naircraft are almost immediately obsolete. For Members vaporlocking over \nthe cost of the F-22, it is worth considering that the 442 F-22's \nproposed will only fill out 4 of the 20 Fighter Wing Equivalents \n(FWE's) in the Bottom Up Review Force. That means one of two things: \nFirst, we buy 17 more FWE's worth of stealthy tactical aircraft, or \nsecond, we accept considerably higher losses among conventional \naircraft in the next conflict. For Congress, an ugly choice.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2892-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2893-S2901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  RULES OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

(See Rule 9 on Procedures for Handling Committee \n     Sensitive and Classified Materials.)\n       (j) Release of Reports to Public: No information pertaining \n     to, or copies of any Committee report, study, or other \n     document which purports to express the view, findings, \n     [[Page S2894]] conclusions or recommendations of the \n     Committee in connection with any of its activities or \n     proceedings may be released to any individual or group \n     whether governmental or private, without the authorization of \n     the Committee.

If \n     either the Chairman or the Vice Chairman concludes from \n     the report that it appears that the Member may be \n     ineligible, the Member shall be notified in writing of the \n     nature of the particular proceeding and the reason that it \n     appears that the Member may be ineligible to participate \n     in it. If the Member agrees that he or she is ineligible, \n     the Member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice Chairman. \n     If the Member believes that he or she is not ineligible, \n     he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman, and if they both agree that the Member is not \n     ineligible, the Member shall continue to serve. But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the Member is ineligible, while the Member believes \n     that he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be \n     promptly referred to the Committee. The Member shall \n     present his or her arguments to the Committee in executive \n     session. Any contested questions concerning a Member's \n     eligibility shall be decided by a majority vote of the \n     Committee, meeting in executive session, with the Member \n     in question not participating.\n       (3) A Member may also disqualify himself from participating \n     in a Committee proceeding in other circumstances not listed \n     in subparagraph (k)(1).\n       (4) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any Member \n     from any initial review, investigation, or other proceeding \n     requiring the appointment of another Member in accordance \n     with subparagraph (k)(5).\n       (5) Whenever a Member of the Committee is ineligible to \n     participate in or disqualifies himself from participating in \n     any initial review, investigation, or other substantial \n     Committee proceeding, another Member of the Senate who is of \n     the same party shall be appointed by the Senate in accordance \n     with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Rule XXIV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate, to serve as a Member of the \n     Committee solely for the purposes of that proceeding.\n       (6) A Member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff Member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff Member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any Member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff Member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff Member. At the direction or with the consent of the \n     staff director or outside counsel, a staff Member may also be \n     disqualified from participating in a Committee proceeding in \n     other circumstances not listed above.\n       (l) Recorded Votes: Any Member may require a recorded vote \n     on any matter.\n       (m) Proxies; Recording Votes of Absent Members:\n       (1) Proxy voting shall not be allowed when the question \n     before the Committee is the initiation or continuation of an \n     initial review or an investigation, or the issuance of a \n     report or recommendation related thereto concerning a Member \n     or officer of the Senate. In any such case an absent Member's \n     vote may be announced solely for the purpose of recording the \n     Member's position and such announced votes shall not be \n     counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee Member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts and Foreign Travel Requests \n     Between Sessions and During Extended Recesses: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjourment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV, \n     and to approve or disapprove foreign travel requests which \n     require immediate resolution.\n       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other \n     Agencies and Departments: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n                rule 2: procedures for sworn complaints\n\n       (a) Sworn Complaints: Any person may file a sworn complaint \n     with the Committee, alleging that any Senator, or officer, or \n     employee of the Senate has violated a law, the Senate Code of \n     Official Conduct, or any rule or regulation of the Senate \n     relating to the conduct of any individual in the performance \n     of his or her duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the \n     Senate, or has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect \n     upon the Senate.\n       (b) Form and Content of Complaints: A complaint filed under\n        paragraph (a) shall be in writing and under oath, and \n     shall set forth in simple, concise and direct statements:\n       (1) The name and legal address of the party filing the \n     complaint (hereinafter, the complainant);\n       (2) The name and position or title of each Member, officer, \n     or employee of the Senate who is specifically alleged to have \n     engaged in the improper conduct or committed the violation \n     (hereinafter, the respondent);\n       (3) The nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation, including, if possible, the specific provision of \n     the Senate Code of Official Conduct or other law, rule, or \n     regulation alleged to have been violated.\n       (4)(A) A statement of the facts within the personal \n     knowledge of the complainant that are alleged to constitute \n     the improper conduct or violation.\n       (B) The term ``personal knowledge'' is not intended to and \n     does not limit the complainant's statement to situations that \n     he or she personally witnessed or to activities in which the \n     complainant was a participant.\n       (C) Where allegations in the sworn complaint are made upon \n     the information and belief of the complainant, the complaint \n     shall so state, and shall set forth the basis for such \n     information and belief.\n       (5) The complainant must swear that all of the information \n     contained in the complaint either (a) is true, or (b) was \n     obtained under circumstances such that the complainant has \n     sufficient personal knowledge of the source of the \n     information reasonably to believe that it is true. The \n     complainant may so swear either by oath or by solemn \n     affirmation before a notary public or other authorized \n     official.\n       (6) All documents in the possession of the complainant \n     relevant to or in support of his or her allegations may be \n     appended to the complaint.\n       (c) Processing of Sworn Complaints:\n       (1) When the Committee receives a sworn complaint against a \n     Member, officer or employee of the Senate, it shall determine \n     by majority vote whether the complaint is in substantial \n     compliance with paragraph (b) of this rule.\n       (2) If it is determined by the Committee that a sworn \n     complaint does not substantially comply with the requirements \n     of paragraph (b), complaint shall be returned promptly to the \n     complainant, with a statement explaining how the complaint \n     fails to comply and a copy of the rules for filing sworn \n     complaints. The complainant may resubmit the complaint in the \n     proper form. If the complaint is not revised so that it \n     substantially complies with the stated requirements, the \n     Committee may in its discretion process the complaint in \n     accordance with Rule 3.\n       (3) A sworn complaint against any Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate that is determined by the Committee to \n     be in substantial compliance shall be transmitted to the \n     respondent within five days of the determination. The \n     transmittal notice shall include the date upon which the \n     complaint, was received, a statement that the complaint \n     conforms to the applicable rules, a statement that the \n     Committee will immediately begin an initial review of the \n     complaint, and a statement inviting the respondent to provide \n     any information relevant to the complaint to the Committee. A \n     copy of the Rules of the Committee shall be supplied with the \n     notice.\n\n\n    Rule 3: Procedures on Receipt of Allegations Other Than a Sworn \n                     Complaint; Preliminary Inquiry\n\n       (a) Unsworn Allegations or Information: Any Member or Staff \n     Member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, and \n     any other person may report to the Committee, any credible \n     information available to him or her that indicates that any \n     named or \n     [[Page S2895]] unnamed Member, officer or employees of the \n     Senate may have--\n       (1) violated the Senate Code of Official Conduct;\n       (2) violated a law;\n       (3) violated any rule or regulation of the Senate relating \n     to the conduct of individuals in the performance of their \n     duties as Members, officers, or employees of the Senate; or\n       (4) engaged in improper conduct which may reflect upon the \n     Senate. Such allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee Member, or a \n     Committee staff Member.\n       (b) Sources of Unsworn Allegations or Information: The \n     information to be reported to the Committee under paragraph \n     (a), may be obtained from a variety of sources, including but \n     not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints that do not satisfy all of the \n     requirements of Rule 2;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints, whether or not \n     satisfying the requirements of Rule 2;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) Preliminary Inquiry:\n       (1) When information is presented to the Committee pursuant \n     to paragraph (a), it shall immediately be transmitted to the \n     Chairman and the Vice Chairman, for one of the following \n     actions:\n       (A) The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may \n     conduct or may direct the Committee staff to conduct, a \n     preliminary inquiry.\n       (B) The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly may \n     present the allegations or information received directly to \n     the Committee for it to determine whether an initial review \n     should be undertaken. (See paragraph (d).)\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, and subpoenas that \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman deem appropriate to obtain \n     information\n      upon which to make any determination provided for by this \n     Rule.\n       (3) At the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry, the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman shall receive a full report of its \n     findings. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     shall then determine what further action, if any, is \n     appropriate in the particular case, including any of the \n     following:\n       (A) No further action is appropriate, because the alleged \n     improper conduct or violation is clearly not within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee;\n       (B) No further action is appropriate, because there is no \n     reason to believe that the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation may have occurred; or\n       (C) The unsworn allegations or information, and a report on \n     the preliminary inquiry, should be referred to the Committee, \n     to determine whether an initial review should be undertaken. \n     (See paragraph (d).)\n       (4) If the Chairman and the Vice Chairman are unable to \n     agree on a determination at the conclusion of a preliminary \n     inquiry, then they shall refer the allegations or information \n     to the Committee, with a report on the preliminary inquiry, \n     for the Committee to determine whether an initial review \n     should be undertaken. (See paragraph (d).)\n       (5) A preliminary inquiry shall be completed within sixty \n     days after the unsworn allegations or information were \n     received by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. The sixty day \n     period may be extended for a specified period by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. A preliminary inquiry is \n     completed when the Chairman and the Vice Chairman have made \n     the determination required by subparagraphs (3) and (4) of \n     this paragraph.\n       (d) Determination Whether To Conduct an Initial Review: \n     When information or allegations are presented to the \n     Committee by the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, the \n     Committee shall determine whether an initial review should be \n     undertaken.\n       (1) An initial review shall be undertaken when--\n       (A) there is reason to believe on the basis of the \n     information before the Committee that the possible improper \n     conduct or violation may be within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee; and\n       (B) there is reason to believe on the basis of the \n     information before the Committee that the improper conduct or \n     violation may have occurred.\n       (2) The determination whether to undertake an initial \n     review shall be made by recorded vote within thirty days \n     following the Committee's receipt of the unsworn allegations \n     or information from the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or at the \n     first meeting of the Committee thereafter if none occurs \n     within thirty days, unless this time is extended for a \n     specified period by the Committee.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that an initial review is \n     not warranted because (a) there is no reason to believe on \n     the basis of the information before the Committee that the \n     improper conduct or violation may have occurred, or (b) the \n     improper conduct or violation, even if proven, is not within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee.\n       (A) If the Committee determines that an initial review is \n     not warranted, it shall promptly notify the complainant, if \n     any, and any known respondent.\n       (B) If there is a complainant, he or she may also be \n     invited to submit additional information, and notified of the \n     procedures for filing a sworn complaint. If the complainant \n     later provides additional information, not in the form of a \n     sworn complaint, it shall be handled as a new allegation in \n     accordance with the procedures of Rule 3. If he or she \n     submits a sworn complaint, it shall be handled in accordance \n     with Rule 2.\n       (4)(A) The Committee may determine that there is reason to \n     believe on the basis of the information before it that the \n     improper conduct or violation may have occurred and may be \n     within the jurisdiction of the Committee, and that an initial \n     review must therefore be conducted.\n       (B) If the Committee determines that an initial review will \n     be conducted, it shall promptly notify the complainant, if \n     any, and the respondent, if any.\n       (C) The notice required under subparagraph (B) shall \n     include a general statement of the information or allegations \n     before the Committee and a statement that the Committee will \n     immediately begin an initial review of the complaint. A copy \n     of the Rules of the Committee shall be supplied with the \n     notice.\n       (5) If a Member of the Committee believes that the \n     preliminary inquiry has provided sufficient information for \n     the Committee to determine whether there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the Member may \n     move that the Committee dispense with the initial review and \n     move directly to the determinations described in Rule 4(f). \n     The Committee may adopt such a motion by majority vote of the \n     full Committee.\n\n\n          rule 4: procedures for conducting an initial review\n\n       (a) Basis for Initial Review: The Committee shall promptly \n     commence an initial review whenever it has received either \n     (1) a sworn complaint that the Committee has determined is in \n     substantial compliance with the requirements of Rule 2, or \n     (2) unsworn allegations or information that have caused the \n     Committee to determine in accordance with Rule 3 that an \n     initial review must be conducted.\n       (b) Scope of Initial Review:\n       (1) The initial review shall be of such duration and scope \n     as may be necessary to determine whether there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (2) An initial review may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, and subpoenas that \n     the Committee deems appropriate to obtain information upon \n     which to make any\n      determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (c) Opportunity for Response: An initial review may include \n     an opportunity for any known respondent or his designated \n     representative, to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (d) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (e) Final Report: When the initial review is completed, the \n     staff or outside counsel shall make a confidential report to \n     the Committee on findings and recommendations.\n       (f) Committee Action: As soon as practical following \n     submission of the report on the initial review, the Committee \n     shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence. In this case, the Committee \n     shall report its determination to the complainant, if any, \n     and to the respondent, together with an explanation of the \n     basis for the determination. The explanation may be as \n     detailed as the Committee desires, but it is not required to \n     include a complete discussion of the evidence collected in \n     the initial review.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In this case, the Committee may attempt to correct or \n     to prevent such violation by informal methods. The \n     Committee's final determination in this matter shall be \n     reported to the complainant, if any, and to the respondent, \n     if any.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged \n     violation, if proven, although not of a de minimis nature, \n     would not be sufficiently serious to justify the severe \n     disciplinary actions specified in Senate Resolution 338, 88th \n     Congress, as amended (i.e., for a Member, censure, explusion, \n     or recommendation to the appropriate party conference \n     regarding the Member's seniority or positions of \n     responsibility; or for an officer or employee, suspension or \n     dismissal). In this case, the Committee, by the recorded \n     affirmative vote of at least four Members, may \n     [[Page S2896]] propose a remedy that it deems appropriate. If \n     the respondent agrees to the proposed remedy, a summary of \n     the Committee's conclusions and the remedy proposed and \n     agreed to shall be filed as a public record with the \n     Secretary of the Senate and a notice of the filing shall be \n     printed in the Congressional Record.\n       (4) The Committee may determine, by recorded affirmative \n     vote of at least four Members, that there is such substantial \n     credible evidence, and also either:\n       (A) that the violation, if proved, would be sufficiently \n     serious to warrant imposition of one of the severe \n     disciplinary actions listed in paragraph (3); or\n       (B) that the violation, if proven, is less serious, but was \n     not resolved pursuant to the procedure in paragraph (3). In \n     either case, the Committee shall order that an investigation \n     promptly be conducted in accordance with Rule 5.\n\n\n           rule 5: procedures for conducting an investigation\n\n       (a) Definition of Investigation: An ``investigation'' is a \n     proceeding undertaken by the Committee, by recorded \n     affirmative vote of at least four Members, after a finding on \n     the basis of an initial review that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within its \n     jurisdiction has occurred.\n       (b) Scope of Investigation: When the Committee decides to \n     conduct an investigation, it shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary for the Committee to determine whether \n     a violation within its jurisdiction has occurred. In the \n     course of the investigation, designated outside counsel, or \n     if the Committee determines not to use outside counsel, the \n     Committee or its staff, may conduct inquiries or interviews, \n     take sworn statements, use compulsory process as described in \n     Rule 7, or take any other actions that the Committee deems \n     appropriate to secure the evidence necessary to make this \n     determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any know respondent who is the subject of an \n     investigation. The notice shall be sent to the respondent no \n     later than five working days after the Committee has voted to \n     conduct an investigation. The notice shall include a \n     statement of the nature of the possible violation, and a \n     description of the evidence indicating that a possible \n     violation occurred. The Committee shall offer the respondent \n     an opportunity to present a statement or to respond to \n     questions from Members of the Committee, the Committee staff, \n     or outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate.\n       (e) Progress Report to Committee: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the investigation. Such reports \n     shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and according \n     to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and shall be \n     confidential.\n       (f) Report of Investigation:\n       (1) Upon completion of an investigation, including any \n     hearings held pursuant to Rule 6, the outside counsel or the \n     staff shall submit a confidential written report to the \n     Committee, which shall detail the factual findings of the \n     investigation and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of the fact of the investigation shall \n     be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary action \n     is recommended.\n       (2) The Committee shall consider the report of the staff or \n     outside counsel promptly following its submission. The \n     Committee shall prepare and submit a report to the Senate, \n     including a recommendation to the Senate concerning \n     disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report shall be \n     issued, stating in detail the Committee's findings of fact, \n     whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. The report \n     shall also explain fully the reasons underlying the \n     Committee's recommendation concerning disciplinary action, if \n     any. No recommendation or resolution of the Committee \n     concerning the investigation of a Member, officer or employee \n     of the Senate may be approved except by the affirmative \n     recorded vote of not less than four Members of the Committee.\n       (3) Promptly, after the conclusion of the investigation, \n     the Committee's report and recommendation shall be forwarded \n     to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy shall be provided \n     to the complainant and the respondent. The full report and \n     recommendation shall be printed and made public, unless the \n     Committee determines by majority vote that it should remain \n     confidential.\n\n\n                    Rule 6: Procedures for Hearings\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding. The Committee shall \n     accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it \n     recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the \n     Senate. (See Rule 5(d).)\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by majority \n     vote, designate any public or executive hearing as an \n     adjudicatory hearing; and, any hearing which is concerned \n     with possible disciplinary action against a respondent or \n     respondents designated by the Committee shall be an \n     adjudicatory hearing. In any adjudicatory hearing, the \n     procedures described in paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     7.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee Member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     Member.\n       (g) Witnesses:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by majority vote, rule that no \n     Member of the Committee or staff or outside counsel shall \n     make public the name of any witness subpoenaed by the \n     Committee before the date of that witness' scheduled \n     appearance, except as specifically authorized by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) Right To Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee Member, staff \n     Member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:\n       (1) Notice of hearings: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for adjudicatory hearings:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall \n     [[Page S2897]] be permitted to advise the witness of his or \n     legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent who is the \n     subject of an investigation, and any other person who obtains \n     the permission of the Committee, may personally or through \n     counsel cross-examine witnesses called by the Committee and \n     may call witnesses in his or her own behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by the party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness' scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness' counsel may submit to the \n     Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any Member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff Member if directed by a Committee \n     Member. The witness or witness' counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of evidence:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rules shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a majority vote of the Committee before the \n     recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of a majority of the Members of the full \n     Committee that the interests of justice require that such \n     evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any Member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any Member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff Member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the Member, staff \n     Member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any Member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the Member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is\n      practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the \n     corrections of a Member or witness if they determine that \n     such Member or witness has been afforded a reasonable time \n     to correct such transcript and such transcript has not \n     been returned within such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness' testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   rule 7: subpoenas and depositions\n\n       (a) Subpoenas:\n       (1) Authorization for Issuance: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     before a preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of obtaining \n     information to evaluate unsworn allegations or information, \n     or at any time during a preliminary inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and Service: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of Subpoena: The Committee, by majority \n     vote, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by it \n     or authorized for issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by \n     them.\n       (b) Depositions:\n       (1) Persons Authorized To Take Depositions: Depositions may \n     be taken by any Member of the Committee, designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition Notices: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff Member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time before a \n     preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of obtaining information \n     to evaluate unsworn allegations or information, or at any \n     time during a preliminary inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding. Deposition notices shall \n     specify a time and place for examination. Unless otherwise \n     specified, the deposition shall be in private, and the \n     testimony taken and documents produced shall be deemed for \n     the purpose of these rules to have been received in a closed \n     or executive session of the Committee. The Committee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness's failure to appear, or \n     to testify, or to produce documents, unless the deposition \n     notice was accompanied by a subpoena authorized for issuance \n     by the Committee, or the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at Depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) Deposition Procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any Member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any Member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no Member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to \n     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce \n     documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) Filing of Depositions: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn\n      statement about those facts with a request that it be \n     [[Page S2898]] attached to the transcript. The Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may rule on the witness's \n     request, and the changes or attachments allowed shall be \n     certified by the Committee's chief clerk. If the witness \n     fails to make any request under this paragraph within the \n     time limit set, this fact shall be noted by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. Any person authorized by the Committee may \n     stipulate with the witness to changes in this procedure.\n\n\n rule 8: violations of law; perjury; legislative recommendations; and \n               applicable rules and standards of conduct\n\n       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     majority vote that there is reason to believe that a \n     violation of law may have occurred, it shall report such \n     possible violation to the proper state and federal \n     authorities.\n       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee \n     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for \n     prosecution.\n       (c) Legislative Recommendations: The Committee shall \n     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such \n     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures \n     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure \n     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or \n     employees of the Senate. The Committee may conduct such \n     inquiries as it deems necessary to prepare such a report or \n     resolution, including the holding of hearings in public or \n     executive session and the use of subpoenas to compel the \n     attendance of witnesses or the production of materials. The \n     Committee may make legislative recommendations as a result of \n     its findings in an initial review, investigation, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (d) Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct:\n       (1) No initial review or investigation shall be made of an \n     alleged violation of any law, rule, regulation, or provision \n     of the Senate Code of Official Conduct which was not in \n     effect at the time the alleged violation occurred. No \n     provision of the Senate Code of Official Conduct shall apply \n     to, or require disclosure of any act, relationship, or \n     transaction which occurred prior to the effective date of the \n     applicable provision of the code.\n       (2) The Committee may conduct an initial review or \n     investigation of an alleged violation of a rule or law which \n     was in effect prior to the enactment of the Senate code of \n     Official Conduct if the alleged violation occurred while such \n     rule or law was in effect and the violation was not a matter \n     resolved on the merits by the predecessor Committee.\n\n\n  rule 9: procedures for handling committee sensitive and classified \n                               materials\n\n       (a) Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive materials:\n       (1) Committee Sensitive information or material is \n     information or material in the possession of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics which pertains to illegal or improper \n     conduct by a present or former member, officer, or employee \n     of the Senate; to allegations or accusation of such conduct; \n     to any resulting preliminary inquiry, initial review, or \n     investigation by the Select Committee on Ethics into such \n     allegations or conduct; to the investigative techniques and \n     procedures of the Select Committee on Ethics; or to other \n     information or material designated by the staff director, or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall \n     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the \n     unauthorized disclosure of Committee Sensitive information in \n     the possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for \n     protecting Committee Sensitive materials shall be in writing \n     and shall be given to each Committee staff Member.\n       (b) Procedures for Handling Classified Materials:\n       (1) Classified information on material is information or \n     material which is specifically designated as classified under \n     the authority of Executive Order 11652 requiring protection \n     of such information or material from unauthorized disclosure \n     in order to prevent damage to the United States.\n       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall \n     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the \n     unauthorized disclosure of classified information in the \n     possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for \n     handling such information shall be in writing and a copy of \n     the procedures shall be given to each staff Member cleared \n     for access to classified information.\n       (3) Each Member of the Committee shall have access to \n     classified material in the Committee's possession.

Removal \n     from the Committee offices of such documents or materials is \n     prohibited except as necessary for use in, or preparation \n     for, interviews or Committee meetings, including the taking \n     of testimony, or as otherwise specifically approved by the \n     staff director or by outside counsel designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (2) Each Member of the Committee shall have access to all \n     materials in the Committee's possession. The staffs of \n     Members shall not have access to Committee Sensitive or \n     classified documents and materials without the specific \n     approval in each instance of the Chairman, and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Members may examine such materials in the \n     Committee's offices. If necessary, requested materials may be \n     taken by a Member of the Committee staff to the office of a \n     Member of the Committee for\n      his or her examination, but the Committee staff Member shall \n     remain with the Committee Sensitive or classified \n     documents or materials at all times except as specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman or Vice Chairman.\n       (3) Any Member of the Senate who is not a Member of the \n     Committee and who seeks access to any Committee Sensitive or \n     classified documents or materials, other than documents or \n     materials which are matters of public record, shall request \n     access in writing.

A request for review \n     by the Office must be received in the Committee's office not \n     later than the 5th day after the time for the parties to file \n     a request for review with the Office has expired [a postmark \n     on the 5th day will not satisfy this timeliness requirement.] \n     Within 24 hours after filing a request for review with the \n     Committee, the Office shall serve a copy of such request on \n     all parties.\n       3.2 Transmittal of Record. As soon as possible, and in no \n     event later than 10 days after receipt by the Office of a \n     request for review or the Office's filing of a request for \n     review with the Committee, the Office shall transmit to the \n     Committee the full and complete record of the hearing board \n     connected with the decision for which review has been \n     requested. The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall promptly \n     serve notice of the Committee's receipt of the record on all \n     parties.\n [[Page S2901]] Rule 4. PROCEDURES UPON RECEIPT OF A REQUEST FOR REVIEW \n                      OF A HEARING BOARD DECISION\n\n       4.1 Briefs and Arguments.\n       (a) Petitioner brief. A party who filed a request for \n     review, or the Office if it requested review, may file a \n     brief in support of its position. The brief shall be filed \n     with the Committee and a copy served on any other party and \n     the Office, if it requested review, within 10 days of the \n     filing of the request for review with the Office, or the \n     Committee if the Office requested review.\n       (b) Respondent brief. A party may file a brief in response \n     to a petitioner's brief. Such respondent brief shall be filed \n     with the Committee and a copy served on any other party and \n     the Office, it the Office filed a request for review, within \n     15 days after service of the petitioner brief. If no \n     petitioner brief is filed, such respondent brief shall be \n     filed within 20 days of filing of the request for review. The \n     Office may file a respondent brief only if it failed a \n     request for review.\n       (c) Reply brief. Any reply brief shall be filed with the \n     Committee and served on all parties and the Office if it \n     requested review, within 5 days after service of the \n     respondent brief to which it replies. No one may file a reply \n     brief who did not file a petitioner brief.\n       (d) Alternative briefing schedule. With notice to all \n     parties and the Office, if it requested review, the Committee \n     may specify a different briefing schedule than that \n     prescribed by subsections 4.1 (a), (b) and (c).\n       (e) Additional briefs. At its discretion, the Committee may \n     direct or permit additional written briefs.\n       (f) Requirements for briefs. Briefs shall be on 8\\1/2\\ inch \n     by 11 inch paper, one side only, and 15 copies shall be \n     provided. No brief shall exceed 50 typewritten double spaced \n     pages, excluding any table of contents, list of authorities, \n     or attached copies of statutes, rules, or regulations. \n     Footnotes shall not be used excessively to evade this \n     limitation. All references to evidence or information in the \n     record must be accompanied by notations indicating the page \n     or pages where such evidence or information appears in the \n     record.\n       (g) Oral argument. At the request of a party or the Office, \n     the Committee may permit oral argument in exceptional \n     circumstances. A request for oral argument must specify the \n     circumstances which are asserted to be exceptional.\n       4.2 Remand.\n       (a) Only one Remand. There are two kinds of ramand. The \n     Committee may remand the record respecting a decision, or it \n     may remand the case respecting a decision, but in no event \n     can there be more than one remand with respect to a decision \n     of a hearing board. If the Committee remands the record \n     respecting a decision, there can be no further remand of any \n     kind with respect to such decision. If the Committee remands \n     the case respecting a decision, there can be no remand of any \n     kind with respect to a hearing board decision issued \n     following remand. A Committee decision remanding to the \n     hearing board shall contain a written statement of the \n     reasons for the Committee decision.\n       (b) Remand of the Record. Within the time for a decision \n     under subsection 308(d) of the Act, the Committee may remand \n     the record of a decision to the hearing board for the purpose \n     of supplementing the record. After the hearing board has \n     supplemented the record as directed by the Committee, the \n     hearing board shall transmit the record to the Office, and \n     the Office shall immediately notify the parties of the \n     hearing board's action and transmit the supplemented record \n     to the Committee. The Committee retains jurisdiction over a \n     request for review during remand of the record, and no new \n     request for review is needed for further Committee \n     consideration under section 308 of the Act. A record shall be \n     deemed remanded to the hearing board until the day the \n     Committee receives the supplemented record from the Office, \n     and the Committee shall transmit a written final decision to \n     the Office not later than 60 calendar days during which the \n     Senate is in session after receipt of the record as \n     supplemented on remand. The Committee may extend the 60 day \n     period for 15 days during which the Senate is in session.\n       (c) Remand of the Case. Within the time for a decision \n     under subsection 308(d) of the Act, the Committee may remand \n     the case to the hearing board for the purpose of further \n     consideration. After further consideration, the hearing board \n     shall issue a new written decision with respect to the matter \n     as provided in section 307 of the Act. If the Committee \n     remands the case to the hearing board, the Committee does not \n     retain jurisdiction, and a new request for review, filed in \n     accordance with Rule 3, will be necessary if a party or the \n     Office seeks review of a decision issued following remand.\n       4.3 Final Written Decision. All final decisions shall \n     include a statement of the reasons for the Committee's \n     decision, together with dissenting views of Committee \n     members, if any, and shall be transmitted to the Office not \n     later than 60 calendar days during which the Senate is in \n     session after filing of a request for review. The period for \n     transmission to the Office of a final decision may be \n     extended by the Committee for 15 calendar days during which \n     the Senate is in session. A final written decision of the \n     Committee with respect to a request for review may affirm, \n     modify, or reverse the hearing board decision in whole or in \n     part. The Committee may decide not to grant a request for \n     review of a hearing board decision. The Committee will serve \n     a copy of any final decision on all parties.\n\n\n        Rule 5. Hearing Board Referral of Testimonial Objections\n\n       5.1 Procedure for Ruling on Testimonial Objections. If any \n     witness to a hearing board proceeding appearing by subpoena \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify, or refuses to \n     produce a document, a hearing board may refer the objection \n     to the Committee for a ruling. Such referrals may be made by \n     telephone or otherwise to the Chairman or Vice Chairman of \n     the Committee who may rule on the objection or refer the \n     matter to the Committee for decision. If the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, overrules the \n     objection, the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee as \n     the case may be, may direct the witness to answer the \n     question or produce the document. The Committee, or the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, shall rule on objections as \n     expeditiously as possible.\n       5.2 Enforcement. The Committee may make recommendations to \n     the Senate, including recommendations for criminal or civil \n     enforcement, with respect to the failure or refusal of any \n     person to appear or produce documents in obedience to a \n     subpoena or order of a hearing board, or for the failure or \n     refusal of any person to answer questions during his or her \n     appearance as a witness in a proceeding under section 307 of \n     the Act. The Office shall be deemed a Senate committee for \n     purposes of section 1365 of Title 28 of the United States \n     Code.\n\n\n                      Rule 6. MEETINGS AND VOTING\n\n       6.1 Quorum, Proxies, Recorded Votes. A majority of the \n     members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for \n     purposes of issuing a decision under section 308 of the Act, \n     and for purposes of hearing oral argument if such argument is \n     permitted. Proxy votes shall not be considered for the \n     purpose of establishing a quorum, nor for purposes of \n     decisions under section 308 (c) and (d) of the Act. Decisions \n     of the Committee under section 308 (c) or (d) of the Act \n     shall be by recorded vote.\n       6.2 Meetings. Meetings to consider matters before the \n     Committee pursuant to the Act may be held at the call of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, if at least 48 hours notice is \n     furnished to all Members. If all Members agree, a meeting may \n     be held on less than 48 hours notice.\n\n\n                 Rule 7. CONFIDENTIALITY OF PROCEEDINGS\n\n       Confidentiality. The final written decision of the \n     Committee shall be made public if the decision is in favor of \n     a Senate employee who filed a complaint or if the decision \n     reverses a decision of the hearing board which had been in \n     favor of the employee. The Select Committee may decide to \n     release any other decision at its discretion. All testimony, \n     records, or documents received by the Committee in the course \n     of any review under these rules shall otherwise be deemed \n     ``Committee Sensitive Information'' and subject to the ``Non-\n     Disclosure Policy and Agreement'' as prescribed in Rule 9 of \n     the Committee's Supplemental Rules of Procedure.\n\n\n                    Rule 8. AUTHORITY TO DISCIPLINE\n\n       Official Misconduct. None of the provisions of the Act or \n     these rules limit the authority of the Committee under S. \n     Res. 338, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964), as amended, to \n     otherwise review, investigate, and report to the Senate with \n     respect to violations of the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     or any other rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the \n     conduct of individuals in the performance of their duties as \n     members, officers, or employees of the Senate.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2893-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2901-S2902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   VIOLENCE ON TELEVISION INITIATIVE\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, a recent report by the Journal of \nAmerican Medicine estimates that the average American child has watched \n100,000 acts of violence by the end of elementary school--including \n8,000 murders. By 18, the average child has watched 200,000 acts of \nviolence and 40,000 murders.\n  Parents are rightly concerned. As a father of four and a grandfather \nof four, with four more on the way, I am concerned.\n  Over the past year, Congress has begun to respond. We are asking \nwhether it is appropriate to get involved on behalf of the interests of \nChildren. Broadcasters are also beginning to pay attention. Last year, \ncable and broadcasting outlets agreed, with encouragement from \nCongress, to allow an independent monitor to review their programming \nfor violence. While the monitoring project is underway, the debate \ncontinues over whether Congress should regulate violence on television.\n  I believe that if the Federal Government plans to become involved in \nthis issue--which may be appropriate--the Federal Government must first \nlead by example.\n  That's why I have asked the three agencies, or federally related \ncompanies, that spend the most money per year on TV advertising, to \njoin me in developing a uniform policy regarding \n[[Page S2902]] advertising on violent television programming.\n  The three groups are the Department of Defense, which spent $37.3 \nmillion last year on television advertising, the U.S. Postal Service, \nwhich spent $22.9 million on television advertising last year, and \nAmtrak, which spent $8.1 million.\n  I was glad to learn that the Department of Defense, the Postal \nService, and Amtrak all have existing policies in place to monitor \ntheir advertising. Our goal in asking these three entities to sign this \npledge is to reaffirm their commitment by agreeing on a uniform policy \ndefines violence and establishes a common goal for spending their \nadvertising dollars.\n  We define violence as ``an act perpetrated on another person or \npersons with the specific intent to cause physical harm, injury and/or \ndeath.''\n  And we consider programs violent if they contain violence which is \ninappropriate or unnecessary to the story.\n  Generally, our definition excludes documentary programs, including \nnews and sporting programs.\n  This is not censorship. This is a voluntary agreement among Federal, \nor federally related entities to act in the best interest of Americans.\n  In voluntarily signing this pledge, the Department of Defense, the \nPostal Service, and Amtrak are sending an important message--that \nvarious elements of the Federal Government can work effectively \ntogether in the best interests of Americans. And they are saying we can \naccomplish worthwhile goals--such as limiting violence on television--\nwithout new legislation and regulations.\n  Our next goal is to encourage other agencies, and private companies \nto follow this example, and to take responsibility for the placement of \ntheir television advertisements.\n  Four reputable groups with an interest in the TV violence issue \nsupport our initiative. They are: Americans for Responsible TV; the \nNational Coalition on TV Violence; the National Education Association; \nand the National PTA.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to thank the representatives \nfrom the Department of Defense, the Postal Service, and Amtrak for \nattending this morning's announcement. Their cooperation and leadership \nin this initiative testifies to their concern about violence on \ntelevision.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2901-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KELLER GEORGE\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nKeller George, who was recently elected president of the United South \nand Eastern Tribes.\n  Mr. George, a resident of Oneida, NY, is a member of the Onieda \nIndian Nation, a nation whose triumphant history includes playing an \nintegral part in the victory of the colonists during the American \nRevolutionary War. Onieda Indians brought food to the American Army \nduring the harsh winter at Valley Forge, and fought by their side at \nthe Battle of Oriskany. The epic battle that took place at Oriskany \nrepresented a partnership between native Americans, Europeans, and \nAmericans for freedom and self-determination. The battle was the \nbloodiest in the revolution.\n  Mr. George has quite an impressive and extensive resume in serving \nboth the United States of America and the Onieda Indian Nation. For \nover 20 years he was a member of the U.S. Air Force. Mr. George has \nbeen a businessman, managing the Onieda Nation's first smokeshop. He \ncurrently holds the position of special assistant to Onieda Nation \nrepresentative Ray Halbritter. But that only scratches the surface of \nMr. George's substantial role as a leader in the Onieda Nation. He is \nalso first representative for the Onieda Nation's sovereign housing \nauthority, first representative and treasurer for the Onieda Indian \nNation Gaming Commission, a member of the Onieda Nation's men's \ncouncil, a member of the board of directors for the National Indian \nGaming Association, and vice president of the northeastern area of the \nNational Congress of American Indians.\n  Now Mr. George has risen to the position of president of the United \nSouth and Eastern Tribes. The United South and Eastern Tribes is \ncomposed of 21 tribes whose purpose is to provide leadership for its \nmember tribes and to advance the causes of all native Indians. Mr. \nPresident, all Americans can related to these causes. They include \nproviding educational opportunity and promoting understanding among the \ngeneral public of the achievements of their member tribes. I can think \nof no other person who is more qualified and more deserving of such a \nposition as Keller George.\n  I congratulate him on this tremendous achievement, and wish him the \nbest of luck in his new position.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2902-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   PUBLIC BROADCASTING CLARIFICATION\n\n Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wish to correct an error in my \nstatement from the Congressional Record of January 24, 1995. In a \ndiscussion of the financial potential of public broadcasting, my \nstatement as published stated that, according to the viewer magazine of \nWETA Washington, this public television station's viewers have an \naverage household net worth of $627,000 plus an average investment \nportfolio of $249,000. My statement should have been recorded as saying \nWETA's contributors, not its viewers, have that financial \nstatus.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2902-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 78--RECOGNIZING HALEYVILLE, AL, THE BIRTHPLACE OF \n                                ``911''\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, since communication is crucial to acting \nin any emergency, the familiar 911 emergency telephone system has been \nrecognized throughout the country as a key factor in fire, police, \nmedical, and rescue personnel being able to respond quickly. Often, \nthere are only a few precious minutes separating life and death. In \nmany cases, quick action means life.\n  Back on February 16, 1968, a historic first test call of the 911 \nsystem was made to a red telephone located at the Haleyville, AL, \npolice dispatch office, a call that marked the beginning of a service \nthat has helped save lives and protect property for 27 years. The call \nwas answered by Congressman Tom Bevill. The town's 911 system has been \nin continuous service ever since, longer than anywhere else in the \nNation.\n  Haleyville's telephone switching wiring, which required little \nmodification in order to accommodate 911, was the main reason it worked \nhere first. Haleyville is located in Winston County, in the northwest \ncorner of Alabama.\n  Alabamians are justifiably proud of the contribution they have made \nto public safety, and the resolution I introduced commends Haleyville \nfor its unique place in the history of the 911 service that we often \ntake for granted today.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this resolution.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2902-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2902-S2903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE U.N. CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this afternoon, in New York, Ambassador \nMadeleine Albright will sign the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the \nChild. This marks a small, but long overdue step toward improving the \nlot of the world's children. I urge the President to take a much \nlarger, and equally overdue step, and submit the convention at once to \nthe Senate for advice and consent to ratification.\n  I have stood on the Senate floor many times over the past 6 years to \ndiscuss the importance of this convention and to urge its ratification. \nThere are many arguments in favor of the convention, but they all boil \ndown to one basic point--children in less-fortunate circumstances \ndeserve the same rights and protections we demand for our own kids.\n  In addition, whether we ratify it or not, the convention is a \nreminder that we ourselves have much to do to make sure that every \nAmerican child enjoys the full benefits of the principles enshrined in \nthis convention. It is a standing reproach to our own unsuccessful \nefforts to end the tragedy of infant mortality, the terror of child \n[[Page S2903]] abuse, the scourge of drugs, and the wasted potential of \nschool dropouts.\n  The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes, as does \nU.S. law, that children need special protections. It states that every \nchild has the right to a name and nationality, stresses the importance \nof child survival measures, pledges the signatories to work to abolish \ntraditional practices harmful to children's health, recognizes the \nimportance of education, and prohibits sexual exploitation.\n  Opponents of the convention argue that it would insert government \ninto the parent-child relationship. They assert that it would take \nchildren away from parents. This simply is not true. The convention is \nexplicit on the primacy of the parents in the life of the child. For \nexample, article 5 states:\n\n       States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights \n     and duties of parents . . . to provide, in a manner \n     consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, \n     appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the \n     child of the rights recognized in the present Convention.\n\n  But, as a practical document, the convention also recognizes that \nthere will be times when the parents are unable to fulfill their \nresponsibilities. In these cases, the convention requires the State to \nstep in, in accordance with the best interests of the child. This is \nalready the practice in the United States. But, for the first time, the \nconvention lays down commonsense guidelines to make sure that, in those \nextraordinary cases in which the State must intervene, its actions are \nin fact in the best interests of the child.\n  So far, 176 nations have ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights \nof the Child. The list of countries that have not is a rogue's gallery \nof international pariahs such as Libya and Iraq. It is an embarrassment \nto the United States to be on this list.\n  But ratification is more than a matter of appearances. The lives of \nchildren are at stake. Until we ratify this convention, we will be \nunable to exert the leadership necessary to make a difference in the \nlives of the world's children. President Clinton has done the right \nthing by instructing Ambassador Albright to sign the convention. He \nshould now submit it to the Senate, and we should ratify it without \ndelay.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2902-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES!\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I doubt that there have been many, if any, \ncandidates for the Senate who have not pledged to do something about \nthe enormous Federal debt run up by the Congress during the past half-\ncentury or more. But Congress, both House and Senate, have never up to \nnow even toned down the deficit spending that sent the Federal debt \ninto the stratosphere and beyond.\n  We must pray that this year will be different, that Federal spending \nwill at long last be reduced drastically. Indeed, if we care about \nAmerica's future, there must be some changes.\n  You see, Mr. President, as of the close of business Wednesday, \nFebruary 15, the Federal debt stood (down to the penny) at exactly \n$4,828,675,772,079.58. This means that on a per capita basis, every \nman, woman and child in America owes $18,329.74 as his or her share of \nthe Federal debt.\n  Compare this, Mr. President, to the total debt about two years ago \n(January 5, 1993) when the debt stood at exactly \n$4,167,872,986,583.67--or averaged out, $15,986.56 for every American. \nDuring the past 2 years (that is, during the 103d Congress) the Federal \ndebt increased over $6 billion.\n  This illustrates, Mr. President, the point that so many politicians \ntalk a good game (at home) about bringing the Federal debt under \ncontrol, but vote in support of bloated spending bills when they get \nback to Washington. If the Republicans do not do a better job of \ngetting a handle on this enormous debt, their constituents are not \nlikely to overlook it 2 years hence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2903-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  WILLIAM F.

Graduating from West Point in 1951, Mr. Lackman \nserved in the Army for 22 years, retiring in 1973 with the rank of \ncolonel. He was a battle-hardened officer who led soldiers in combat \nduring two different wars, Korea and Vietnam. Among a number of other \nprominent decorations, he won the Silver Star and twice earned the \nCombat Infantryman's Badge.\n  Of profound significance is the fact that he was twice felled by \nbattlefield wounds, meriting two awards of the Purple Heart. \nNevertheless, he continued his military service because he was \ndedicated to the ideals embodied in the United States Constitution to \nwhich he had sworn an oath to support and defend.\n  In addition to his wartime uniformed service, Mr. Lackman worked in a \nnumber of diversified and important military assignments. He held \npolicy-related positions in both the Office of the Secretary of Defense \nand the Joint Staff. He also had the unusual distinction of having \ninstructed cadets at both the U.S. Military Academy and at the U.S. Air \nForce Academy. Long before the Goldwater-Nichols Act officially \nrecognized the need and codified a requirement for outstanding officers \nto serve in joint positions, Bill Lackman was walking point as a \n``purple suit'' officer.\n  Starting in 1976, Bill Lackman continued his devoted service to the \nNation as a Department of Defense civilian. He worked in positions of \nincreasing responsibility within the Defense Intelligence network \nculminating with his service, from 1992 to 1994, as the Director of the \nCentral Imagery Office in the Department of Defense. In that capacity, \nhe was responsible for all aspects of imagery reconnaissance, including \nsatellite photography, for the Department of Defense and various other \nnational intelligence agencies. The importance and complexity of that \nposition in this high tech age, replete with numerous and diverse \nthreats to our security, is unmistakable. Yet Bill Lackman was more \nthan worthy of the job and he accomplished his mission with integrity, \ndedication and professionalism.\n  Over the years, I had a number of opportunities to work with Bill. \nParticularly in my capacity as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I often sought out insights and advice from him on a variety \nof intelligence matters. In every instance, his input was thorough and \naccurate. Suffice it to say that my respect for Bill Lackman, as both a \nperson and an intelligence adviser, was profound.\n  Mr. President, I believe my colleagues will agree that William F. \nLackman, Jr., was an extraordinary public servant whose dedicated \nservice to the people of the United States, spanning more than 40 \nyears, is worthy of our eminent praise and respect. On behalf of all \nVirginians and a grateful Nation, I wish to extend my sympathies and \ngratitude to Bill's wife, Anne, his seven children, and his parents, \nMr. and Mrs. William F. Lackman.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2903-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2903-S2904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA'S AIR FORCE RESERVE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to nearly 900 \nVirginians who are some of the most dedicated members of our society. \nThey voluntarily serve our Nation as individual mobilization augmentees \nin the Air Force Reserve. Virginians have always served our Nation in \ntimes of peace and war. I take pride in these Air Force reservists \nbecause they are twice serving our country, as productive citizens and \nas citizen airmen. There are 12,000 individual mobilization augmentees \nin the Air Force Reserve. They serve with the active Air Force for \ntheir training, bringing the expertise from their civilian jobs to the \nmilitary. Most served on active duty, so we are keeping this valuable, \nexperienced investment in trained people for about 10 cents on the \ndollar.\n  I am especially proud to recognize the 900 individual mobilization \naugmentees of the Commonwealth of Virginia because of their dedicated \nservice. They balance family, civilian \n[[Page S2904]] career, and military service in a manner in which we can \nall take pride and carry on traditions that go back to George \nWashington and Lighthorse Harry Lee. It is an honor to commend these \nAir Force reservists and thank them for their service to the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2903-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RETIREMENT OF MILTON H. HAMILTON ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT TO THE \n                         SECRETARY OF THE ARMY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Secretary of the Army has announced \nthe retirement of a dedicated public servant, Mr. Milton H. Hamilton, \nAdministrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, at the end of \nFebruary. Mr. Hamilton has distinguished himself throughout his long \ncareer with the Army, especially during the last 15 years when he \nserved as the Administrative Assistant. The Army and the Nation will \nmiss him.\n  Mr. Hamilton became the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of \nthe Army, the Army's senior career civilian position, on March 31, \n1980. The position of Administrative Assistant is established by \nstatute and dates back to 1789 when the only other civilian position \nauthorized for the War Office was that of Secretary of War.\n  As the Administrative Assistant, Mr. Hamilton has been responsible to \nthe Secretary for the administration of the Department of the Army; \nserved as a focal point for transitions between administrations; and, \nauthenticated all departmental regulations and related publications. \nDuring a vacancy in the Office of the Secretary, he has had charge and \ncustody of all records, books, and papers of the Department.\n  Mr. Hamilton was born June 17, 1925, in Elkins, WV. He graduated from \nthe U.S. Military Academy in 1946 with a B.S. in military engineering. \nHe earned an M.B.A. from Syracuse University in 1959 and an M.S. in \ninternational affairs from George Washington University in 1965. Mr. \nHamilton has completed the residence requirements for a Ph.D. in \nbusiness administration at American University; is a graduate of the \nArmy War College (1965); the Federal Executive Institute (1978); and, \nSenior Managers in Government Program, Harvard University (1983). He \nhas been awarded the Army's Decoration for Distinguished Civilian \nService; Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service; the Meritorious \nCivilian Service Award; as well as DOD's highest award, the DOD Medal \nfor Distinguished Public Service. Mr. Hamilton has also been twice \nawarded the Presidential Ranks of Distinguished Executive and \nMeritorious Executive.\n  Before leaving active military service as a colonel in 1972, Mr. \nHamilton served in a wide variety of command and general staff \npositions, to include brigade commander, comptroller, program/budget \nmanager, researcher in personnel management, service school instructor, \nand politico-military policy formulator at the national level. He \nserved in combat with the 3d Infantry Division in Korea, and the 25th \nInfantry Division in Vietnam.\n  From 1972 to 1975, Mr. Hamilton was a project manager/principal \nscientist with General Research Corp. in McLean, VA. In this capacity, \nhe directed research and analyses pertaining to: organizational \neffectiveness and program evaluation; manpower utilization and \ndevelopment; resource allocations for forces and systems; national \nsecurity policy; military readiness; and planning, programming, and \nbudgeting.\n  Returning to Government service in December 1975, Mr. Hamilton was \nthe principal adviser in the Department of Defense on political \nmilitary economic aspects of United States relations with southern and \nwestern African countries. In May 1977, he became the Deputy Director \nfor Programming, Office of the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army, and served in \nthat capacity until his appointment as Administrative Assistant to the \nSecretary of the Army. As the Army's top civilian programmer, he had a \nmajor role in the shaping and resourcing of the Army's Future Years \nDefense Program which underlies the readiness of today's Army.\n  We honor Mr. Hamilton's selfless service, in peace and war, to the \nNation and the U.S. Army. We wish him and his family Godspeed and a \nhealthy and rewarding retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2904-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to join my distinguished \ncolleagues in honoring the 75th anniversary of the founding of the \nLeague of Women Voters of the United States of America this week. This \norganization has a tremendous record of encouraging women to be active \nin their communities and involved in promoting good public policy. The \nLeague of Women Voters can be very proud of its history of public \neducation and leadership that has helped to strengthen our Government \nand country over the years.\n  I also am extremely proud that a native West Virginian and a good \nfriend of mine, Becky Cain, is president of the league during its 75th \nanniversary celebration.\n  As we all know, the League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan political \norganization with 1,100 chapters and over 150,000 members and \nsupporters around the country. Open to both women and men, the league \nencourages the informed and active participation of citizens in \nGovernment through education, advocacy, and organization at the local, \nState, and national levels.\n  I know how important the league is for America. I have seen how their \ngrassroots efforts helped pass legislation such as the 1993 National \nVoter Registration Act, the historic motor-voter bill, which is making \nit easier for more Americans to register to vote and perform one of the \nessential acts in a democracy. Helping to enfranchise millions of \nAmericans is a fundamental effort to strengthen the fabric of our \ncountry.\n  In addition, the league has launched national campaigns such as the \n1992 Take Back the System Program that actively sought to increase \nvoter confidence and involvement in the electoral system. And as we all \nknow, the league is active at the State and local level in educating \nvoters and getting people involved in Government.\n  On many occasions, I have been proud to work with league, join in \ntheir nonpartisan debates, and participate in their events in West \nVirginia and Washington to debate the issues.\n  As we think about our country and the future, I believe that \nAmericans need organizations like the League of Women Voters more than \never to help develop the links and communication between people and \npublic servants that are so essential for our government to be \nresponsive and effective. The league and its members deserve our deep \nappreciation for their steadfast commitment to educating voters in a \nnonpartisan way about the tough choices and issues that we all must \nface and should try to resolve together.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2904-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2904-S2905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            WILLIAM LACKMAN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I cannot allow the passing of an American \nwhose unsung contributions over 44 years have served to enhance, in \nways that cannot be measured, the national security and well-being of \nthis country. I speak of Bill Lackman.\n  The name Bill Lackman is not known to the American public. But in the \nintelligence community, his is a household name. I know Bill only from \nhis many trips to the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify on the \ncomplex and necessary business of intelligence programs and budget. If \nI were asked to select one word which would best describe Bill, it \nwould be a professional--in the finest sense of the word. Bill knew his \nbusiness better than anyone and he was an articulate spokesman. It goes \nwithout saying that his wife Anne and his family will miss him. It will \nalso go without commentary that the intelligence community and his \ncountry will miss him.\n  At this point, I can think of no greater tribute to Bill than to \nrecount his career and contributions to his country.\n  Bill graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY, in \n1951 and served in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1973, rising to the rank \nof colonel in the Infantry. During his military career, he served \ncombat tours in Korea and Vietnam. He served as assistant professor of \nRussian history at the U.S. Military Academy, and he also served as \nassistant professor of international relations at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy. His military decorations include \n[[Page S2905]] the Silver Star, three awards of the Legion of Merit, \nfour Bronze Stars, the Army and Air Force commendation medals, two \nPurple Hearts, and two awards of the Combat Infantryman's Badge.\n  In 1976, Bill joined the intelligence community staff and rose to \nbecome the principal spokesman for the entire national intelligence \ncommunity budget. In 1986, he became deputy director of the \nintelligence community staff. For this service and his many \ncontributions, Bill was awarded the National Intelligence Distinguished \nService Medal in January 1993.\n  Bill was appointed the first Director of the Central Imagery Office \nby Secretary of Defense Cheney on May 22, 1992, where he pioneered many \nmanagement innovations in the provision of imagery to national defense.\n  Bill gave unselfishly to a country he loved. His contributions can \nnever be adequately repaid. He shall be missed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/16/senate-section/article/S2904-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I also want to commend the majority \nleader for cooperation over the last several hours as we have \nnegotiated this agreement. It is a fair agreement. It gives Senators an \nopportunity to present their amendments.\n  We have two days with which to present these amendments, and I hope \nSenators will avail themselves of the opportunities. We will have \nrollcall votes throughout those two days and certainly on Tuesday. So I \nhope that we can maximize the use of this time, and I am sure that all \nSenators will take advantage of the opportunity that this accords it.\n  I think it is a good agreement and I hope we can get to work on \nWednesday.\n  Mr. DOLE.
