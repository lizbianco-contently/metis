We are so indebted to You because You \nhave given Your prescription for perfect peace in providing help when \nwe go through periods of problems, pain, and perplexities. Sometimes \nour country looks like a puzzle, and we do not know what path to \npursue. One group promotes what they believe is truth, while another \ngroup believes they have the perfect plan. We pray that all people in \nour great diverse Nation will look to the Deity. Bind us together with \na pattern of fibers that will make a complete puzzle with a greater \npotential.\n  Encourage each of us when we are discouraged, give us confidence when \nin doubt, boldness when we are fearful, and strength when we are spent.\n  I pray that we may have a clear and crisp vision of Your plans, and \ngive us the honor, integrity, and uprightness to carry those plans \nforward. Let the mighty power of God become our power in all we do this \nday.\n  We entrust this day to our Lord who is the Light of the World.

Let me announce to my colleagues we have morning business \nuntil the hour of 2 p.m. today, and then at 2 p.m. there will be a \ncloture vote on the substitute amendment to H.R. 927, the Cuba \nsanctions bill. Yesterday's vote was 59 to 36. It is our hope that we \ncan invoke cloture today. This will be the third effort. And if we do, \nwe will continue consideration of the bill until disposed of. Second-\ndegree amendments to the substitute amendment may be filed up until 1 \np.m. today.\n  If cloture is not invoked, the Senate may turn to any of the \nfollowing items:\n  NASA authorization, which I understand is not controversial. We are \nclose to having some consent agreement on that.\n  Amtrak authorization, which may be referred to the Finance Committee \nbecause it has some tax provisions. Hopefully, if it is referred, it \ncan be done on a limited basis so it would come back here within 2 or 3 \nweeks.\n  Labor, HHS appropriations. We have been precluded from bringing that \nbill to the floor. It is my hope that Senators Specter and Harkin, the \nmanagers of the bill, can get together to see if they cannot work out \nsome agreement so we can pass Labor, HHS appropriations. Senator \nCochran will be working on that as sort of the expediter of the \nappropriations bills. This is the last appropriations bill to leave the \nSenate, and we are locked up over a number of provisions dealing with \nabortion, others dealing with striker replacement. It is my hope we can \nresolve some of those issues, bring it to the floor, have the votes, \nand go to conference.\n  State Department reorganization. Hopefully, they are about to reach \nan agreement between Senator Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator Helms, \nthe chairman of the committee. It was our hope that we could have \ndisposed of this matter by now. And I know there was a meeting \nyesterday. I hope we can follow up and maybe dispose of that today, and \nany available conference reports.\n  I might ask the Senator from Mississippi, are there any additional \nconference reports that may be coming to the floor on appropriations \nbills?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield, \nthe Transportation appropriations conference is one that has been the \nsubject of some hard work. Our chairman of the full committee, Senator \nHatfield, is chairman of that subcommittee here, and we are hopeful \nthat that bill will come to the floor in the form of a conference \nreport soon.\n  Energy and water is another where we are hopeful that differences can \nbe resolved between the House and Senate at an early date and we can \nget that conference report before the body.\n  Mr. DOLE. And the Agriculture appropriations bill has gone to the \nPresident?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It has gone to the President. We are happy that the \nSenate acted favorably on the report. So did the House. And that bill \nis now on its way to the President. We hope he will sign it. All \nindications are that he will. The Secretary of Agriculture indicated \nthat was his strong recommendation. Others in the administration have \nlikewise indicated they think the President will sign the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator, my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15261-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15261-S15262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MEASURES PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1322 AND S. 1328\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me first allay any fears that I intend \nto speak for 60 minutes. But I do have some colleagues who will join in \nusing this opportunity to talk about where we are going in the next \nseveral weeks. Of course, what we do in the next several weeks is \nrelatively less important than the impact on where we are going in the \nnext century. It is my belief and the belief of many of us that we have \nthe opportunity during this time to make a great deal of difference, \nand much of it has to do with the budget. It has to do with our ability \nto be responsible in spending and what we do.\n  I would like, if the Senator from New Mexico is ready, to yield to \nhave some basic comments with respect to the budget and where we are \ngoing with the budget. So if I might, Mr. President, I will yield to my \ncolleague from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First of all, let me in advance thank Senator Cochran \nfor organizing this time. I am only going to use a few minutes because \nI get more than enough time in expressing budget and fiscal problems \nfor our country. But today I want to start by saying the long, long \njourney of getting to a balanced budget from the standpoint of the \nSenate and all of the committees of this Senate doing their work is \ncompleted as of now.\n  In fact, just about a half-hour ago, dated today, I received a letter \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office directed to me as chairman of the \nBudget Committee signed by Dr. June O'Neill, Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, that says when we pass in the Senate and \nif the President will just sign what we have done, we have a balanced \nbudget, literally. For the first time in more than 25 years we have put \ntogether a package of reforms and changes, restraints and modifications \nin the law such that the authenticator of our budgets, the institution \ncreated to tell us the truth, has said in this letter that we have a \nbalanced budget.\n  Now, for many of us, this letter has been years, years, and years in \nthe making, and for some who have joined us recently, like the occupant \nof the chair and my good friend from Wyoming, they came and they lent \ntheir support to this very, very important endeavor in their first year \nof what may be for them many years of being Senators when the United \nStates spends only what it takes in and establishes a new premise that \nwe will only fund what we can afford.\n  So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I kick off this 1 hour \ntoday, and many to follow, when we explain why we are doing what we are \ndoing by saying to those who want future Americans to have a better \nstandard of living, for those seniors, those parents across this land \nthat are wondering why cannot our children have a better standard of \nliving, why cannot they get better paychecks. This is the beginning of \nthe reinstating across this land a U.S. economy that can grow and \nprosper with low inflation and provide an increasing standard of \nliving.\n  Why? Because it is obvious when you borrow so much money to pay for \nGovernment that you probably could not afford, you siphon off the \nresources and the productivity of our people, young and old. Those \naround now and those who will be here in a couple years, you take their \nproductivity and their wealth and you say the U.S. Government needs \nthat. We need it, to borrow it, to pay our bills, which we should not \nhave incurred in the first place. Mr. President, $4.6 trillion of that \nkind of debt, which sooner or later will stop growing when all these \nbills we are going to send to the President gets signed or when the \nPresident gets real and says how we will do it with real numbers, not \nwith phony economic numbers.\n  I repeat, it would not have been very difficult to get this letter \nfrom the Director of the Budget Office if we had the luxury that the \nPresident had. The President found $475 billion without cutting \nanything, without reforming anything. He just said, ``We'll have better \nnumbers than the Congressional Budget Office. Things are just going to \nbe so much better, Medicaid is not going to cost so much. You don't \nhave to change it. It is just going to stop costing so much.''\n  ``Medicare, you know, it is also going to stop costing so much,'' \nsaid the President. ``We are going to save a bunch of money because the \ncosts are going to start going down.'' He said, ``We're going to pick \nup interest.'' He says we are going to pick up $175 billion because he \nthinks we are going to grow more than the Congressional Budget Office \nsays, again, the authenticator of truism and the opposite of smoke and \nmirrors that we so long looked for around here and now we have.\n  So when the President comes to the party, after we have done what \nthis CBO Director says, after we pass what she says will get you the \nbalance, the ball is going to be in the President's court. What does he \nwant to do about it? We already had the Secretary of the Treasury, with \nweeping and gnashing of teeth about the debt limit, making changes in \nadvance of what he assumes might happen around here.\n  Mr. Secretary of the Treasury, while we recognize and respect your \npast business performance, we insist that you understand that we want, \ntoo, a balanced budget. We do not want America to default on its debt. \nBut, Mr. Secretary, we want a balanced budget. And we believe that the \nCBO Director told us today how you do it. You do not dream up better \nnumbers so you do not have to do so much, you do what must be done. No \nsmoke and mirrors. Reform the entitlement programs. You will get there. \nAmerica will have a much better place for its youngsters to grow up in \nand have the opportunity to prosper and grow in.\n  So, I will ask unanimous consent that the letter, and for those \ninterested, the attached charts be printed in the Record. The charts \nare now attached. And believe it or not, in 2002, the Congressional \nBudget Office, without a rosy scenario, with conservative economics, \nreal estimates, says we will have a $10 billion surplus.\n  Now, I know for many that is one of these ``believe it or nots,'' is \nit not? It has been so long since we ever thought about this seriously. \nYou never thought we could get there. And I might conclude after all my \nyears of trying to get there, I never thought we would be here today, \nand next week and the week after when we vote to do this. And I would \nhope some of those on the other side of the aisle will help us do it. I \nam not sure they will. But I hope they do not rely on the President's \nbudget as a means of getting there.\n  I have heard some very, very expert members of the Democratic Party \non that side of the aisle talk about the need to reform entitlement \nprograms. \n\n[[Page S 15263]]\n Well, reform did not mean that you wish away the costs by just sitting \ndown and saying it just is not going to cost that much, you do not have \nto change anything.\n  Let me tell everyone, I have been down that route. The one summit \nthat failed, when we got the Executive and the Congress together, \nfailed because we refused to reform entitlement programs. We estimated \ntheir costs. And much like the President, we estimated them very low. \nThe OMB Director thought they would not cost so much. We saw the \nresult. They cost a lot more than we predicted, and we never came close \nto the goals we had set.\n  We are not doing that. We are not doing that. We are taking on some \nvery tough issues. There is some pain. We think it is fair pain. And so \ntoday I am very, very proud to say that the journey toward a balanced \nbudget is perhaps drawing to an end.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 205(a)(4) of the fiscal year 1996 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. 67), I am submitting \nto the Senate the Congressional Budget Office certification of the \nreconciliation recommendations.\n  In accordance with the procedures set forth in the budget resolution, \nthe Budget Committee transmitted the recommendations received pursuant \nto section 105(a) of that resolution to the Congressional Budget Office \n[CBO]. CBO completed the required estimate and transmitted it to the \nSenate Budget Committee today. The estimate projects that enactment of \nthe legislation will result in a balanced total budget in 2002--indeed \nthere will be a $10 billion surplus in that year. This estimate does \nnot include projections of the fiscal dividend.\n  This certification triggers the revenue reconciliation instructions \nto the Senate Finance Committee contained in section 105(b) of the \nbudget resolution. Pursuant to that section, the Finance Committee must \nsubmit its revenue reduction recommendations to the Budget Committee \nwithin 5 days.\n  I submit officially for the Record the CBO's letter saying when we \npass the Senate proposals we will have a balanced budget in the year \n2002.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed the legislation submitted to the Senate Committee on \n     the Budget by eleven Senate committees pursuant to the \n     reconciliation directives included in the budget resolution \n     for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67). CBO's estimates of \n     the budgetary effects of each of those submissions have been \n     provided to the relevant committees and to the Budget \n     Committee. Based on those estimates, using the economic and \n     technical assumptions underlying the budget resolution, and \n     assuming the level of discretionary spending specified in \n     that resolution, CBO projects that enactment of the \n     reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget Committee \n     would produce a small budget surplus in 2002. The effects of \n     the proposed package of savings on the projected deficit are \n     summarized in Table 1, which includes the adjustments to \n     CBO's April 1995 baseline assumed by the budget resolution. \n     The estimated savings that would result from enactment of \n     each committee's reconciliation proposal is shown in Table 2.\n       As you noted in your letter of October 6, CBO published in \n     August an estimate of the fiscal dividend that could result \n     from balancing the budget in 2002. CBO estimated that \n     instituting credible budget policies to eliminate the deficit \n     by 2002 could reduce interest rates by 150 basis points over \n     six years (based on a weighted average of long-term and \n     short-term interest rates) and increase the real rate of \n     economic growth by 0.1 percentage point a year on average, \n     compared with CBO's economic projections under current \n     policies. CBO projected that the resulting reductions in \n     federal interest payments and increases in federal revenues \n     would total $50 billion in 2002 and $170 billion over the \n     1996-2002 period. Those projections were based on a \n     hypothetical deficit reduction path developed by CBO. The \n     deficit reductions estimated to result from the \n     reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget Committee, \n     together with the constraints on discretionary spending \n     proposed in the budget resolution, would likely yield a \n     fiscal dividend similar to that discussed in the August \n     report.\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                                          TABLE 1.--PROPOSED SENATE BUDGETARY CHANGES FROM CBO'S

I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me first congratulate the Senator from \nNew Mexico. This is a tough job. This is the toughest job in the \nCongress. Everyone likes the programs that we have. Everyone is \ninvolved in the programs. So you have to make some really tough \ndecisions. It has not been done for 25 years. So I certainly \ncongratulate the Senator, the Budget Committee, and the Finance \nCommittee. They are doing tough work.\n  So we say, why are we doing this? It is very tough. What is the \nbenefit? Let me tell you that I think there are substantial benefits. \nAs a matter of fact, I do not think there is any question whether we \nhave to do it.\n  One, if we are to be responsible, fiscally, morally, in terms of \npaying for what we ask for, you have to balance the budget. We have \ngone for a very long time, and we have known it, all of us, as citizens \nbut we have not cared too much. But now we are at a time when, for \nexample, interest on the national debt soon will become the largest \nsingle line item in the budget: $260 billion interest; not debt \nservice, not a reduction, interest. That is one reason we do it.\n  If you have a philosophy about government, should Government continue \nto grow and become larger, better Government, it has to do with \nbalancing the budget. If we do not ask ourselves, are we willing to pay \nfor the services that we ask for or are we going to put them on the \ncredit card, as we have done for a very long time, then we will \ncontinue to have larger and larger Government.\n  One of the benefits, I think, is to leave more money in the pockets \nof American families to spend as they chose to invest and create jobs.\n  Of course, I mentioned the interest. We will, next month, I suspect, \nbe asked to vote on raising the debt limit to $5 trillion--whatever \nthat is--$5 trillion because that is where we have gotten ourselves \nover a period of time. These young people, like these pages here, have, \nI think, $180,000 debt each they will inherit because we have not \nbalanced the budget.\n  So that is what it is all about. It is not really a question of \nwhether we do it, we must do it to be morally, fiscally responsible.\n  So we are doing the business this week. This is a defining moment, I \nbelieve, in a very long time. This is my first year in the Senate that \nI have been here. But I have been here for several years, 5 years, in \nthe House. We have not had a moment of that kind since I have been \nhere. But more importantly, we have not had a moment of that kind for \nmany years, a defining moment when we decide to make some fundamental \nchanges in Government.\n  It is not just the budget. The budget is reflective of it. The budget \nis the key to doing it. But much more will be changed besides simply \nbalancing the budget.\n  I do not think there is any question but what voters asked for \nchange. I do not think there is any question, as you go out to your \nconstituency and talk in town meetings, about where we are going. \nEveryone knows we have to do something different. Almost everyone knows \nthat you cannot keep doing the same thing and expect different results.\n  So we have before us this week and next week and will have before us \nnext month the defining moment. We will have before us a budget that \nwill bring us into balance in 7 years, the first time for a very long \ntime.\n  So I would like to talk a little bit about the process we go through \nto do that, as opposed to the detail, and it will be difficult. I would \nlike to talk a little bit about philosophy, because it is quite obvious \nthat there are two points of view. There is nothing wrong with that. \nThere are, clearly, at least two points of views. There are many views, \nof course, and they center on the role of the Federal Government in \nAmerica today. That is the reason we \n\n[[Page S 15265]]\nhave debate, that is the reason we have two parties, that is the reason \nwe vote, to get a sense of direction as to how we want to go.\n  Some, including the President, and many of the more liberal Members \non the other side, support more spending. That is a legitimate point of \nview, to spend more in the Federal Government, have more programs, have \nlarger Government. I do not happen to agree with that.\n  My view is that we strengthen this country by having more personal \nresponsibility, by having fewer programs that work better, that are \nefficient, that, in the case of welfare, are designed to help people \nwho need help, but to help them back into a position to help \nthemselves, not as a permanent establishment.\n  We have had 40 years where we just generally added to the social \nprograms. If they did not work quite right, we put some more money in \nthem. Now we have an opportunity to examine some of these programs, to \nsee, indeed, that they are accomplishing the purposes for which they \nwere established; to see, indeed, if they are efficient in terms of \ndelivering the services that we pay for; to consider if there is a \nbetter way to do it.\n  This is, after all, a Union of States, and the basic governing unit \nare the States. They come together in the federation, and the more \nthings, in my view, that the States can do, being closer to the people, \nthe more likely they are to be effective.\n  So there is a different point of view about that. The President \npromised a 5-year balanced budget as a candidate 3 years ago. Of \ncourse, that has not happened. What did happen, however, was the \nlargest tax increase in the history of this country that still left us \nwith a deficit.\n  Voters rejected the proposal last year, of course, for the Government \ntakeover of health care.\n  So where are we now? We have to have a budget that really means \nsomething. The President's first budget this year was rejected 99 to \nzip in this place. The budget that followed was touted as a balanced \nbudget, but CBO indicated that it will be $200 billion over at the end \nof the 10-year period and would never balance.\n  There has to be a little pain in balancing, and it has to be real \ncuts. It is tough. It is where we are. We have to really come to the \nsnubbing post and say are we going to commit ourselves to doing it and \nthe time is now.\n  I hope that we get some support and cooperation from the White House \nand the other side of the aisle. I do not suggest everyone is going to \nagree. There are, obviously, lots of points of disagreement in how you \ndo this, but the point is that we have to do it.\n  We have to save Medicare. If you like Medicare, if you want to have a \nhealth care program for the elderly, you have to change it. You cannot \nlet it continue to grow at 10 percent a year, unless you want to double \nthe contribution that is made to Social Security for part A. That is a \nfact.\n  I am a little concerned that as we move toward these decisions in the \npublic arena, making public policy, that we are moving more and more \ntoward sort of merchandising, towards the idea of using fright tactics \ninstead of facts.\n  I picked up something in the Denver paper the other day on my way \nback. The Denver paper is not exactly a conservative bulletin, but it \nasserted the allegation under the Clean Water Act that we are going to \ndump arsenic in the water supply. Of course we are not going to dump \narsenic in the water supply. Those are the kind of things that are \nbeing talked about as distortions, and they do not really come to the \nquestion of what we do to have a responsible Government, to be able to \nfinance the kinds of programs that really are meaningful over time.\n  So, Mr. President, I say, again, that we are approaching and involved \nin, and it is a treat for you and me and my associate from Minnesota in \nour first year here to be a part of the first time to have a real \nopportunity to balance the budget, and we have that. I certainly hope \nour associates in the Senate will cause that to happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15262-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15265-S15267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A MESSAGE OF HOPE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been told, and we hear over and \nover again that we have lost the war on words on the Republican side \nand that this, what has now become known as the ``big lie'' around the \ncountry, is selling; that people are buying the idea that the \nRepublicans are cutting Medicare and giving tax credits and tax relief \nfor the very wealthy.\n  Of course, this just is not true. I come here with a message of hope \nthis morning, because I really believe that the American people will \ncatch on. We are going to go through the same thing we went through a \ncouple years ago when they were talking about socializing medicine. I \nam not nearly as distressed as other people are because we have time, \ntime works in our favor, we have logic on our side, and we are seeing \nsome things happening right now that I get really quite excited about.\n  The other day, I picked up an editorial that was in the Washington \nPost. Mr. President, we are talking about the Washington Post now. This \nis not the Limbaugh Letter and this is not the Human Events, this is \nthe Washington Post. Generally, the Washington Post is more liberal on \ntheir editorial outlook. If anything, they are more on the Democratic \nside than the Republican side.\n  The editorial is called ``Meda- gogues.'' This is really a kind of \nneat article. The first paragraph says. I will paraphrase it:\n\n       Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole accused the Democrats and their \n     allies yesterday of conducting a campaign based on distortion \n     and fear . . . They're right; that's precisely what the \n     Democrats are doing--it's pretty much all they're doing--and \n     it's--\n\n  A crummy idea.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial, entitled \n``Medagogues,'' printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Medagogues\n\n       Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole accused the Democrats and their \n     allies yesterday of conducting a campaign based on distortion \n     and fear to block the cuts in projected Medicare spending \n     that are the core of the Republican effort to balance the \n     budget in the next seven years. They're right; that's \n     precisely what the Democrats are doing--it's pretty much all \n     they're doing--and it's crummy stuff.\n       There's plenty to be said about the proposals the \n     Republicans are making; there's a legitimate debate to be had \n     about what ought to be the future of Medicare and federal aid \n     to the elderly generally. But that's not what the Democrats \n     are engaged in. They're engaged in demagoguery, big time. And \n     it's wrong--as wrong on their part now as it was a year ago \n     when other people did it to them on some of the same health \n     care issues. Then, they were the ones who indignantly \n     complained.\n       Medicare and Medicaid costs have got to be controlled, as \n     do health care costs in the economy generally. The federal \n     programs represent a double whammy, because they, more than \n     any other factor, account for the budget deficits projected \n     for the years ahead. They are therefore driving up interest \n     costs even as they continue to rise powerfully themselves. \n     But figuring out how to contain them is enormously difficult. \n     More than a fourth of the population depends on the programs \n     for health care; hospitals and other health care institutions \n     depend on them for income; and you cut their costs with care. \n     Politically, Medicare is especially hard to deal with because \n     the elderly--and their children who must help care for them \n     to the extent the government doesn't--are so potent a voting \n     bloc.\n       The congressional Republicans have confounded the skeptics \n     who said they would never attack a program benefiting the \n     broad middle class. They have come up with a plan to cut \n     projected Medicare costs by (depending on whose estimates you \n     believe) anywhere from $190 billion to $270 billion over the \n     seven-year period. It's true that they're also proposing a \n     large and indiscriminate tax cut that is a bad idea and that \n     the Medicare cuts would indirectly help to finance. And it's \n     true that their cost-cutting plan would do--in our judgment--\n     some harm as well as good.\n       But they have a plan. Enough is known about it to say it's \n     credible; it's gutsy and in some respects inventive--and it \n     addresses a genuine problem that is only going to get worse. \n     What the Democrats have instead is a lot of expostulation, TV \n     ads and scare talk. The fight is about ``what's going to \n     happen to the senior citizens in this country,'' Dick \n     Gephardt said yesterday. ``The rural hospitals. The community \n     health centers. The teaching hospitals . . .'' The \n     Republicans ``are going to decimate [Medicare] for a tax \n     break for the wealthiest people, take it right out of the \n     pockets of senior citizens. . . .'' The American people \n     ``don't want to lose their Medicare. They don't want Medicare \n     costs to be increased by $1,000 a person. They \n\n[[Page S 15266]]\n     don't want to lose the choice of their doctor.''\n       But there isn't any evidence that they would ``lose their \n     Medicare'' or lose their choice of doctor under the \n     Republican plan. If the program isn't to become less generous \n     over time, how do the Democrats propose to finance it and \n     continue as well to finance the rest of the federal \n     activities they espouse? That's the question. You listen in \n     vain for a real response. It's irresponsible.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is what is going on around the \ncountry. I just feel very strongly that the people are not willing to \nbuy this.\n  I wish I had a blowup of it, but there is a cartoon that has been \nsent out, I guess, into all the districts by the Democrat senatorial \ncommittee that depicts us as individuals who are trying to cut taxes \nfor the superrich and we are going to be cutting Medicare. The things \nare just outrageous. It says: ``Inhofe feasts on tax cuts for the \nprivilege while children go to bed hungry.''\n  This is something that is, in my opinion, so extreme that the \nAmerican people are not going to buy it.\n  It was not long ago, just a little over a year ago, that the \nDemocrats were trying at that time to sell to the American people a \nprogram where the Government would run the health care system and \ndiscard a health delivery system that has been the most successful \nsystem in the history of all nations, of all mankind, and it was one to \nadopt a program that was similar to what they have in Canada, or the \nage-old failure in Great Britain or the Scandinavian countries; and \nthat is, all presume that the Government can run things better than the \nprivate sector.\n  We were all so distressed at that time. Keep in mind this is just a \nyear and a half ago. Even the American Medical Association bought a \nfull-page ad in the Wall Street Journal and said they were throwing in \nthe towel, raising the white flag, ``We surrender.'' For a few crumbs, \nthey were willing to give up this system and take Hillary's health care \nsystem, and that was only a year and a half ago.\n  I had an experience a couple weeks ago that drove home to me what a \ngreat system we have now. I have a close friend, Mr. President. He is \nan ear, nose, and throat surgeon in Tulsa, OK, one that has a very, \nvery fine reputation among his peers and nationwide. I was talking to \nhim and shared with him in casual conversation, about 20 years ago, \nthat I lost my sense of smell. He said, ``Come around sometime and I \nwill examine you.''\n  I went in and he said, ``You need to have surgery.'' It is called \nendoscopic nasal surgery. It is a really yucky thing to talk about. But \nnonetheless, this is 2 weeks ago. Today, I am walking around and I have \ncharacterized this, Mr. President, as the most significant non-\nChristian experience that I have had or change in my life. I now have \nhad this restored, and I have a sense of smell. This could not have \nhappened in any other country, where you have a choice of practitioners \nto go to, you have the state of the art and a degree of professionalism \nthat none of the other countries have. It happened to me.\n\n  Now, a year and a half ago, we were willing to give that up. And now, \nif you surveyed the American people, they know that we are making \nchanges, that we need to do something about medical malpractice. They \nknow we are going to come up with medical savings accounts and improve \nthe system we have now. But the Government is not going to take it \nover.\n  Well, this is what we are going through right now. By the way, this \nis, I think, unprecedented for the Washington Post to do. They came out \nwith another editorial, and this was on September 25, called \n``Medagogues, Cont'd.'' I will read the last two sentences:\n\n       The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut \n     connection because it is useful politically. It allows them \n     to attack and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. \n     We think it's wrong.\n\n  Again, that is what the Washington Post said.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at this point this editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 25, 1995]\n\n                           Medagogues, Cont'd\n\n       We print today a letter from House minority leader Richard \n     Gephardt, taking exception to an editorial that accused the \n     Democrats of demagoguing on Medicare. The letter itself seems \n     to us to be more of the same. It tells you just about \n     everything the Democrats think about Medicare except how to \n     cut the cost. That aspect of the subject it puts largely out \n     of bounds, on grounds that Medicare is ``an insurance \n     program, not a welfare program,'' and ``to slash the program \n     to balance the budget'' or presumably for any purpose other \n     than to shore up the trust fund is ``not just a threat to . . \n     . seniors, families, hospitals'' etc. but ``a violation of a \n     sacred trust.''\n       That's bullfeathers, and Mr. Gephardt knows it. Congress \n     has been sticking the budget knife to Medicare on a regular \n     basis for years. Billions of dollars have been cut from the \n     program; both parties have voted for the cutting. Most years \n     the cuts have had nothing to do with the trust funds, which, \n     despite all the rhetoric, both parties understand to be \n     little more than accounting devices and possible warning \n     lights as to program costs. Rather, the goal has been to \n     reduce the deficit. It made sense to turn to Medicare because \n     Medicare is a major part of the problem. It and Medicaid \n     together are now a sixth of the budget and a fourth of all \n     spending for other than interest and defense. If nothing is \n     done those shares are going to rise, particularly as the \n     baby-boomers begin to retire early in the next century.\n       There are only four choices, none of them pleasant. \n     Congress can let the health care programs continue to drive \n     up the deficit, or it can let them continue to crowd out \n     other programs or it can pay for them with higher taxes. Or \n     it can cut them back.\n       The Republicans want to cut Medicare. It is a gutsy step. \n     This is not just a middle-class entitlement; the entire \n     society looks to the program, and earlier in the year a lot \n     of the smart money said the Republicans would never take it \n     on. They have. Mr. Gephardt is right that a lot of their plan \n     is still gauzy. It is not yet clear how tough it will finally \n     be; on alternate days you hear it criticized on grounds that \n     it seeks to cut too much from the program and on grounds that \n     it won't cut all it seeks. Maybe both will turn out to be \n     true; we have no doubt the plan will turn out to have other \n     flaws as well.\n       They have nonetheless--in our judgment--stepped up to the \n     issue. They have taken a huge political risk just in calling \n     for the cuts they have. What the Democrats have done in turn \n     is confirm the risk. The Republicans are going to take away \n     your Medicare. That's their only message. They have no plan. \n     Mr. Gephardt says they can't offer one because the \n     Republicans would simply pocket the money to finance their \n     tax cut. It's the perfect defense; the Democrats can't do the \n     right thing because the Republicans would then do the wrong \n     one. It's absolutely the case that there ought not be a tax \n     cut, and certainly not the indiscriminate cut the Republicans \n     propose. But that has nothing to do with Medicare. The \n     Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection \n     because it is useful politically. It allows them to attack \n     and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. We think \n     it's wrong.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Finally, Mr. President, I feel confident that the \nAmerican people are not going to buy into this lie. I know it is a very \nshort message. I know the Democrats are rejoicing. They think they \nfooled the American people into thinking that the Republicans are going \nto cut Medicare in order to have tax cuts. There is no connection, as \nfar as tax cuts are concerned.\n  I hope that anyone in America that is looking at that and saying ``we \ndo not want tax cuts'' will stop and remember what happened in 1993. In \n1993, President Clinton came out with the largest single tax increase \nin the history of public finance in America or anyplace in the world. \nThese are not the words of conservative Republican Jim Inhofe. These \nare the words of a Democrat on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I suggest to you that anybody who was opposed to that major tax \nincrease that we did not need in 1993 ought to be supporting a tax cut. \nAll we are trying to do is repeal a lot of the damage that was done to \nthe American people in 1993. We may not be able to get by with this, \nuntil we change the personality in the White House. Nonetheless, we \nshould not connect what we are trying to do to save Medicare with the \nfact that we would like to have tax relief for the American people--not \nthe superrich, we are talking about the American people and child \ndeductions and that sort of thing.\n  I feel confident that we are going to be able to sell that message \nbecause it is right and honest. We are getting more and more support \naround the country from liberal editorial boards who are saying: ``That \nis enough; we are not going to perpetrate a lie on the American people \nsuch as the Democrat leadership is trying to perform.''\n  You know, it was Winston Churchill who said, ``Truth is \nincontrovertible.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little this afternoon not \nso much about taxes but taxpayers' money and about security.\n  Mr. President, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is certainly the most famous \nresidential street address in America. It is, of course, the address of \nthe White House--the crown jewel in a city that attracts 15 million \nvisitors every year.\n  Part of the excitement for White House guests is discovering that \ntheir President lives right alongside a busy street, just like many of \nthem do, that his house has an address, just like theirs does. The mail \ncarrier really does deliver letters each day to 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue, just exactly as it happens at every other home, in every other \ntown in America.\n  The White House is called the People's House because of its close \nrelationship with the American people. It is a familiar place where \nvisitors instantly feel at home.\n  The city has certainly grown around them, but Pennsylvania Avenue and \nthe White House have actually changed little since 1791, when George \nWashington gave his approval to Pierre L'Enfant's magnificent city \nplan. The bold stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue that shoots from the \nCapitol to the White House links the executive branch to the \nLegislative, physically and metaphorically.\n   By the early 1800's, Pennsylvania Avenue had become a busy \nthoroughfare, bringing people closer to the White House, and closer to \ntheir Government.\n   Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House was a natural place \nto hold the official ceremonies of a young nation. From there, \nPresident Lincoln reviewed troops heading off to battle in 1861. Later, \ndignitaries would gather on the avenue for inaugural parades.\n   People who were lost and looking for directions used to pull their \ncarriages up to the front door of the White House to ask for help. By \nthe middle of this century, it was station wagons and tour buses that \nmade their way past the Executive Mansion. Families on vacation, eager \nfor a close-up look at the home of the President, would travel the same \nroute their ancestors might have traveled.\n   When ordinary citizens could drive past the White House or walk past \nits gate, well, that said something special about the unique openness \nthat exists between the people and their President.\n   By 1995, Pennsylvania Avenue--the Main Street of America--had grown \nup. Over 80 feet wide, the modern, seven-lane thoroughfare was being \nused by more than 26,000 vehicles every day in the three-block stretch \nfronting the White House That is, until May 20 of this year, when all \ntraffic on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House came to a \nhalt. In the wake of the tragic bombing in Oklahoma City, and citing a \nsecurity risk for the President, the Treasury Department shut down \nthree blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue. For the first time in the 195-\nyear-history of the Executive Mansion, the people are no longer allowed \nto drive past the people's house.\n   The Secret Service says the street is not actually closed in front \nof the White House. In the Washington-speak that infects so many here, \nthe roadway is merely restricted to vehicular traffic. Even the \nPresident, when he gave the order to close Pennsylvania Avenue, said \nthe decision would not change very much except the traffic patterns in \nWashington. But a great deal more than that has changed. If you want to \nexperience intense security, try driving to the White House--even as an \ninvited guest, with permission to park on the grounds. A bunker \nmentality has taken hold.\n   Massive concrete barriers block Pennsylvania Avenue, keeping out \nunwanted traffic. The fortress-like effect is compounded by dozens of \nconcrete posts inset into the White House sidewalk.\n   Police cruisers patrol every intersection.\n   Vans--engines running, manned by officers with dogs--wait in the \nparking areas.\n   Uniformed Secret Service officers guard their new security stations, \ncirculate among the tourists and patrol the White House lawn.\n   Motorcycle officers and even officers on bicycles are there, too.\n   If you look carefully, you will see figures on the White House roof \nitself, binoculars in hand.\n   Drive into a parking area and you are stopped by armed officers who \nask if anyone has given you explosives to carry.\n   You are told to pull forward, where you are met by another officer, \nwho asks to check your trunk as he puts his bomb-sniffing dog through \nits paces.\n   Mr. President, I think it is safe to say that very few visitors feel \nat home these days at the White House. The openness is gone. The \ncloseness is gone. It has all been replaced with intimidation and fear. \nThe place is secure now--secure as a fortress--but what have we \nsacrificed for that security?\n   The cost of trading security for freedom cannot be calculated \nmathematically, but the cost can indeed be measured in three ways.\n   First, the knee-jerk closing of a major artery such as Pennsylvania \nAvenue has had a devastating financial cost for the District of \nColumbia and its businesses, its commuters, its tourists, its \nresidents. With the avenue closed for three blocks, and several \nsurrounding streets blocked off as well, the people who live, work, and \nvisit here and give life to this city are beginning to feel choked off \nfrom it. Nearby businesses and offices are no longer as accessible to \nemployees and clients. Traffic hassles compound the problem. A great \ndeal of parking space has been eliminated. And most troubling is the \nfact that the President ordered the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue, and \nthe Treasury Department carried it out, without any consultation with \nthe District, without any direct public input from the people this \naction would most disrupt. Add up the lost parking revenue, the cost of \nchanging street signs and signals, higher Metrobus subsidizes, and \npolice overtime, and as of June 30 of this year, the District estimated \nthat closing Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House had cost \nnearly $750,000. No one is willing to guess how high that figure might \nbe today.\n\n  And that does not begin to take into account the other indirect costs \nof the closing. How has this affected tour bus operators? They can no \nlonger drive their customers--many of whom are strapped for time, or \nunable to walk the extra three or four blocks--to drive past the White \nHouse.\n  How has this affected the public bus system? In order to provide the \nsame services it offered before the Pennsylvania Avenue shutdown, \ntransit officials estimate they will have to spend up to $200,000 more \nevery year by adding new buses and new drivers.\n  How has this affected local businesses and the customers who park \nnearby? That impact has yet to be calculated.\n  Mr. President, the people who depend on open access to Pennsylvania \nAvenue for their livelihoods say they have accepted the present \nclosure, but they are not going along with the idea that the avenue \nmust be blockaded forever. That case has simply not been made, they \nsay. I agree.\n  The second measure of the cost of this closing is the direct hit it \nmeans for the taxpayers. The Federal Government has since repaid the \nDistrict for some of the $750,000 in costs but, of course, that means \nthe taxpayers have once again been handed the bill. And there are more \nbills to come.\n  At an open house today at the White House Visitor Center, the \nNational Park Service is soliciting public input into the future of \nthis vital stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue. They have devised what they \ncall an ``interim beautification plan'' for the 1,600-foot strip of the \navenue between Lafayette Park and the White House. It involves \nreplacing large sections of the asphalt with grass, replacing the \npolice cruisers at each end of the avenue with guard booths equipped \nwith steel barricades, and replacing the old concrete barriers with new \nconcrete barriers disguised as planters.\n  ``Beautification,'' if that is what you want to call it, does not \ncome cheaply. Implementing this plan will cost the taxpayers an \nadditional $1.3 million, and it is only temporary. The proposed \n\n[[Page S 15268]]\npermanent, and certainly more expensive, plan for the site will be put \nin place just a couple of years from now.\n  Most Americans will not have the opportunity to visit the White House \nVisitor Center today to offer their comments. Most will not even know \nthat the future of Pennsylvania Avenue is under discussion. But if they \nwere here, I know they would have strong feelings they would want to \nshare about the Government's plans to limit public access to the White \nHouse.\n  And that is the third way to measure the price we pay when we trade \nsecurity for freedom: by calculating the high cost of Washington's \nparanoia on the national psyche.\n  Mr. President, all Americans are deeply concerned about the safety of \ntheir President. The security measures used to protect him must be well \nthought out, appropriate, and thorough. I do not question the desire to \nafford him every ounce of security we can muster, but I do question \nwhether we can satisfy that desire without sacrificing the people's \nfreedoms. The balance between security and freedom has been tipped too \nfar in favor of security.\n  Mr. Mark McCurry, the President's spokesman, says the American people \n``will have greater access to the front of the White House as a result \nof some of the changes they want to make.'' But that just is not so. \nHow can we cut off traffic from a historic stretch of Pennsylvania \nAvenue and claim we are improving access?\n  Once the ball starts rolling, where does it stop? Already, the \ndrastic security measures undertaken on Pennsylvania Avenue have set a \nprecedent and are being mirrored here on Capitol Hill. Access to two \nstreets on the Senate side of the Capitol have been shut off. Parking \nhas been eliminated or restricted in many places. Security at the \nCapitol itself has been tightened dramatically. Officials in other \nFederal buildings are asking that parking meters be removed from their \nsidewalks, too.\n  Where does it end? How much of Washington, DC, are we going to have \nto rope off before the public figures out we simply do not want them \nhere? As tragic as it sounds, that is the message we are sending to \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the American people who are not here to \nstand up for themselves, I ask my colleagues to join me in denouncing \nthe assault on our freedoms being undertaken on Pennsylvania Avenue. \nPresident Clinton has gone too far, but it is not too late to halt his \nefforts to close off the people's house on America's Main Street from \nthe people themselves.\n  I urge that we take action now, before a single spadeful of earth is \nturned.\n  In Le Roy, MN, population 900, the town's weekly newspaper reflected \nrecently on Washington's current obsession with security. I would like \nto read some of it:\n\n  ``We also wonder about the cost of the security around the Nation's \ncapitol and if this much security is truly needed,'' wrote Al Evans in \n                        the Le Roy Independent.\n\n       ``We are sure any midwesterner visiting there would \n     question this. Perhaps we in this area of the country are too \n     trusting, but there are limits to security measures.\n\n  The folks in Le Roy, MN, understand that closed streets do not equate \nwith an open democracy. Why do not the Washington bureaucrats and \npoliticians get it?\n  For 195 years, the address 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has been a symbol \nof a government accessible to the people. Yet our government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people is slowly becoming a \ngovernment just a little farther away from the people, too.\n  It is time we stood up and said ``that is enough.''\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15267-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15268-S15269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to comment on the set of issues that we will be spending \nmuch time on over the weeks ahead, those specifically related to our \nbudget, the reconciliation legislation, which will also include \nlegislation to reduce the tax burden on Americans, and the whole issue \nthat surrounds that concerning the economy of our country.\n  As I traveled throughout my State during last year's campaign and as \nI have traveled since that campaign, I have heard Americans and \nMichiganites in particular tell me two things. Both of the things they \nhave told me I believe are included in and really are the centerpieces \nof the budget that we are working to achieve here in the U.S. Senate.\n  The first thing they tell us is that they want a budget that is in \nbalance. Americans and people in my State are frustrated by the fact \nthat the U.S. Congress has gone a quarter of a century without bringing \nthe budget into balance. They have to do that in their families. Most \nof our States and our local communities have to balance their budgets. \nThe American people are frustrated when Washington cannot do the same \nthing, when we cannot bring ourselves to establish priorities, to set \nan agenda that allows us to spend no more than we take in.\n  People in my State also want a budget that is balanced and that is \nbalanced legitimately. They are tired of fancy bookkeeping in \nWashington, bookkeeping which allows us to think we are doing better \nthan we really are. That is why, I think, many people in my State \napplauded the President of the United States when he came to Congress \nnot too long ago and, with bipartisan encouragement, said that we \nshould use the statistics and the revenue estimates and the budget \nfigures of the Congressional Budget Office at both ends of Pennsylvania \nAvenue to make determinations as to where our Federal Government's \ndeficit was.\n  Interestingly, of course, we now have a slight change in direction \nhere in Washington. Here in the Congress, we have stuck to the ideal of \nbalancing the budget and we have used legitimate statistics compiled by \nthe Congressional Budget Office in calculating our budget to make sure \nit would be in balance based on the accurate readings of the CBO.\n  Unfortunately, now, as the actual rubber hits the road, at the other \nend of Pennsylvania Avenue, we have a detour. There what we see is a \ndiversion away from the use of CBO statistics, a diversion away from \nthe idea of using the same budgeting calculations that are used on \nCapitol Hill, and instead a throwback to days gone by when statistics \nthat are used in rosy scenarios, to balance the budget not with tough \nchoices and setting priorities, but rather making unrealistic estimates \nas to the economy's growth and unrealistic estimates as to the needs \nfor various promises and a variety of things allowing to balance the \nbudget through fancy bookkeeping.\n  I have to ask today, Mr. President, why has this occurred? Why have \nwe moved backward, and why has the White House chosen this course of \naction? Most people know the answer is simple. Without making those \nkinds of calculations that only can be made inside the Office of \nManagement and Budget, tough choices would have to be made. Politically \nunpopular choices would have to be made.\n  I ask another question today as well: Where was the balanced budget \nfervor in the White House earlier this year? Why has it come about so \nlate in the game? Again, I suggest that it is more politics than it is \npublic policy objectives.\n  Indeed, I sit on the Budget Committee, and earlier this year, in the \nspring, we had several representatives of the administration come \nbefore us to discuss the President's budget. When they did, of course, \nthat original budget was not in balance. It did not project a balance \nin years 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n  I asked, did you ever go through the exercise within the \nadministration of coming up with a balanced budget or a budget that \nwould reach balance in 7 years, recognizing that you might have done \nit, and concluded, for whatever reason, not to offer it because you did \nnot want to establish the priorities that would be required to balance \nthe budget? To my surprise, I was told that no one had ever gone \nthrough the exercise. This is as recently as the spring and, indeed, \nthe budget we had been offered by the White House, by the \nadministration, was the only budget that had been put together.\n\n  It makes me very suspicious, now, as we come to the end of this \nprocess, that suddenly we are told there is a budget, suddenly we are \ntold there is a commitment to a balanced budget, and \n\n[[Page S 15269]]\nsuddenly we are told the CBO numbers are no longer the ones that will \nbe used to attain that budget. It leads me to believe that we are \nbasically being told these things as we come upon an election year in \nwhich a central part of the debate in America will be whether or not \nthe American Government should spend no more money than it takes in.\n  Balance the budget and do it in a way that is credible and \nlegitimate, is one thing I hear in Michigan. The other thing I hear in \nmy State is that people want to be able to keep more of what they earn \nand that, in particular, the middle-class families of my State want to \nbe able to keep more of what they earn. Here, in Washington, inside the \nbeltway, in many of our committees and on the floor of the Senate \nitself as well as on the House side of the Capitol Building, we are \ntold by people who purport to represent constituencies back in their \nStates that there is no demand for reductions in taxes in America, that \nthis desire to reduce taxes is somehow a myth created by people on our \nside of the political aisle for whatever purpose, I guess, happens to \nbe convenient at the time.\n  I just want to know what constituencies those who claim Americans do \nnot want a tax cut represent, because I cannot go to any part of my \nState without being told by people how hard it is to make ends meet in \nAmerica, and in Michigan today. What people tell me is not that they \nwish somehow Government would intrude on their job site or their \nbusiness or their community and start dictating what salaries they \nshould earn. They do not tell me that. They do not tell me they want to \nsee Washington begin to create some kind of central economy management \nsystem here inside the beltway. What they tell me is, if you will just \nlet me keep a few more dollars that I earn in my paycheck, I would feel \na lot better.\n  It is interesting to me to hear people tell us they do not hear any \ncries back in their State for tax relief when, at the same time, many \nof the very same Members of Congress come to the floor, bringing charts \nwith them, to talk about the so-called middle-class squeeze that \nmiddle-class, hard-working, average American families are feeling \ntoday. Why is that middle-class squeeze being felt? The answer is quite \nsimple. It is because American families--hard-working families, where \npeople go out to work every day, and in some cases where more than one \nperson is in the work force, and they work very hard--find at the end \nof the week or the end of the quarter or the end of the month they do \nnot have as much money left after withholding and the payment of taxes \nas they need to make ends meet.\n  So, I think it is very disingenuous to, on the one hand, decry the \nfate of the middle class because of the difficult time middle-class \nAmericans are having making ends meet and at the same time claim \nmiddle-class families do not want a tax cut. The fact is, if we reduce \nthe taxes on families in this country there will be less of a squeeze, \nin particular less of a squeeze on the middle class. In my judgment, \nthose are simply mutually exclusive positions. I have a very hard time \nbelieving that in the constituencies of other Members of this body or \nin the House there is not the same yearning for an opportunity to \nattain the American dream, more chance of people keeping what they \nearn, that I hear from the constituents that I represent.\n  Here in the Senate we are trying. We tried during the budget \nresolution debates and we will try again in the next few weeks to \ndeliver on commitments we made to our constituents from one end of this \ncountry to the other, our commitments to bring the budget into balance \nand to do so with a legitimate, credible budget and at the same time \nallow hard-working, middle-class families to keep more of what they \nearn.\n  The alternative to that is business as usual. The alternative to that \nis more fancy, funny bookkeeping. The alternative to that is big \nGovernment in Washington calling more shots, making more decisions that \naffect the lives of our families.\n  So, as the debate proceeds, I hope, as people hear these arguments \nthat we cannot move to a balanced budget or that we cannot do it in 7 \nyears or we cannot have a tax cut, they will reflect on the fact that \nthe people making those arguments are the same people who have tended \nto be in charge for the last 40 years here in Washington as the budget \ndeficits have increased, as the Federal debt has increased, as taxes \nhave increased, and as the middle class has felt the corresponding \nsqueeze that comes about when too many of the dollars of hard-working \nAmericans are sent to Washington to fulfill the priorities of somebody \nelse.\n  I think if one reflects on that debate, they will conclude that that \nbudget which we passed here in the Senate earlier this year and that \nbudget we are going to try to now bring to conclusion in the weeks \nahead, puts us on the right path to achieving not only our objective of \nmaking sure our economy is strong, but achieving the other goals of \nbalancing the budget credibly and reducing the tax burden on hard-\nworking families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the long, arduous \nmarch, 32 years long, to balance the budget of the United States.\n  This is a most historic period in American history. On or about \nOctober 24, this Congress, the House and the Senate, will come head to \nhead with the decision to join with America in its call for properly \nmanaging our financial affairs.\n  What we have here is a classical contest between those who come from \nthe country arguing that Washington should stop doing business the way \nit has been and those who believe that Washington should continue just \nas it has been. Look at the essential questions that will be settled. \nIn the case of the budget, the new Congress, the majority, is arguing \nthat the budget should be balanced and it should be balanced within 7 \nyears.\n  I read from Newsweek magazine by author Joe Klein, who talks about \nthe chief spokesperson for the status quo, in name, the President of \nthe United States. He says:\n\n       The sloppy, hyperactive wonkiness that defined Clinton's \n     first 2 years in office has been supplanted by a sleek, \n     tactical cunning. He has traded activism for passivism. He \n     gives the appearance of taking stands--for some sort of tax \n     cut, some sort of welfare reform, some sort of balanced \n     budget--but these are ploys, mirages; they exist only to \n     undermine positions taken by the Republicans.\n\n  A fundamental goal of this vote on October 24 will be to balance the \nbudget. The President promised a balanced budget in 5 years when he ran \nfor President. He forgot the promise. He then said he would not offer a \nbudget, leave it to the Republicans. He then offered a budget that was \nunbalanced and received no votes when it was put before the Senate. It \nwas 99 to zero. He then said he would give us a balanced budget within \n10 years. But the Congressional Budget Office and all economists know \nthat is not so; it does not balance in 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, or \nany years. The status quo or change; balance the budgets or leave them \nspending new debt and deficits.\n  Second, tax relief. I read, Mr. President, from today's Washington \nTimes. And I am quoting the President:\n\n       It might surprise you to know that I think I raised [taxes] \n     too much, too.\n\n  President Clinton said last night he thinks he raised taxes too much \nin his first year in office. Fine. We are trying to refund that tax \nincrease. His tax increase, the largest in American history, was about \n$250 billion--status quo--tax more and spend more. We are proposing to \nlower taxes $245 billion--change, lower taxes on the working family, \nlower taxes on American business. Change or status quo.\n  We say in response to the Medicare trustees that Medicare must be \nsaved or it will go bankrupt in 6 years. We have offered a good plan. \nIt saves Medicare for current beneficiaries and those yet to come. It \nis reasonable and does what the country needs to have done.\n  What does the Democrat plan do? First of all, it is 21 pages. It is \nnot a plan. The Congressional Budget Office cannot score it because it \ndoes not have enough detail. At best, if it were so and it were a plan, \nwhich it is not, it would push the solvency out 24 months. Is that what \nthe beneficiaries are looking for, 24 months of a reprieve, or are they \nlooking for us to take this program and make it solid \n\n[[Page S 15270]]\nand solvent and something forever American family?\n  Status quo--just tinker with it, or change it and make it work?\n  Fourth, welfare reform: On October 24, if those votes prevail, \nwelfare as we know it today will never be the same. We are saying that \nwas a failed program. All America knows this. So we are changing it.\n  Who are the adversaries? Who wanted it left the same? Who has told \nthe country we ought not to change it? It is the other side of the \naisle.\n  So on these four great issues:\n  Balancing the budget: We stand with America, who says, ``Balance \nit.'' The President says, ``Stay with the status quo.''\n  Medicare: We say, ``Save it, change it, make it plausible, and reach \nsolvency for 10 to 20 years.'' What do they say? ``Keep it the way it \nis, tinker with it 24 months.''\n  Tax relief: ``Well, I raised taxes too much.'' We are saying, ``Fine. \nReduce them. Lower the burden on the working families so that the \nfamily can care for itself.''\n  And welfare: ``Change it.'' ``No, leave it the same.''\n  Mr. President, this is probably one of the most historical votes in \nthe history of the Congress. That question is, are we going to take the \nchanges that America is asking for and respond to them and do it, or \nare we going to defend Washington and three decades of bureaucracy, tax \nAmerica, spend America, and leave it the same? That is the fulcrum. \nThat is the question.\n  I hope every American is riveted on the votes that are cast and what \nthey stand for. Change it. A new way--go into the new century ready to \ndo it, an American century. Or the status quo that has brought us \nalmost to our knees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Mississippi \nis recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that the time under our \nspecial order has expired.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his \nremarks and also those other Senators who have spoken so eloquently and \nconvincingly this afternoon on the subject of the importance of our \nreconciliation process, balancing the budget, and ushering in a new era \nof fiscal responsibility.

Mr. President, we have heard a generous bit of discussion \nthe last couple of days on the floor of the Senate about Medicare by \npeople on the other side of the aisle. I must say the consistency with \nwhich the assertions are made on the floor of the Senate about Medicare \nreminds me of the consistency yesterday by the folks who came into this \nChamber and cast votes on term limits. It was very interesting to see \npeople who have served here 30 years cast their votes calling for term \nlimits; people here 20 years say, ``Well, we are in favor of term \nlimits.'' I saw one fellow who has been here 12 years vote for term \nlimits and walk out of the Chamber. And, of course, I know he just \nfiled for reelection for the next term.\n  This is the group that says, ``Stop me before I run again.'' It is \nthe same consistency of thought that allows them to make these kind of \nrepresentations on Medicare and taxes and their budget, or lack of \nconsistency, I might say.\n  They say, ``We are not cutting Medicare.'' What are people saying? \nWhy would they say we are cutting Medicare? The fact is, we know what \nit is going to cost to provide a Medicare Program for the next 7 years. \nThose costs are estimated.\n  The majority party is saying we want to provide $270 billion less \nthan it is going to cost. That is a cut. The senior citizens are going \nto pay more and get less. That is a cut. Oh, you can proclaim all you \nwant that it is not a cut. But the folks who pay more for less health \ncare is going to know it is a cut.\n  I thought, rather than have a Democrat who will be viewed as someone \ncowered by partisanship making the point, I would have a Republican \nmake the point so that we are not going to argue about whether or not \nthis is a cut or whether it is fair. Let me have Kevin Phillips, a \nRepublican political analyst, make the point. He made this not too long \nago, about a week or 2 ago on public radio.\n  He said:\n\n        Remember, at the same time as the Republicans proposed to \n     reduce Medicare spending by $270 billion over 7 years, they \n     want to cut taxes for corporations, investors and affluent \n     families by $245 billion over the same period. This is no \n     coincidence.\n\n  That is a Republican who says that.\n  Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst, responds to these folks who \nhave treated us to 2 hours now in 2 days of protest that they are not \ndoing what they are really doing, says:\n\n       Today's Republicans see Federal Medicare outlays to old \n     people as a treasure chest of gold for partial redirection in \n     their favorite directions; towards tax cuts for deserving \n     corporations, families, and individuals.\n\n  Kevin Phillips, a Republican, says:\n\n       The revolutionary ideology driving the new Republican \n     Medicare proposal is also simple. Cut middle-class programs \n     as much as possible and give the money back to the private \n     sector business, finance and high-income taxpayers.\n\n  Finally, not a Democrat, Kevin Phillips, a Republican, responds to \nthe 2 hours in 2 days of protests from people who say they are not \ndoing what they are doing, says:\n\n       Let's be blunt. If the Republican Medicare reform proposal \n     was a movie, its most appropriate title would be ``Health \n     Fraud II.''\n\n  This debate is about choices, and do not lament the fact that we do \nnot agree. The debate is healthy. It is what the democratic system is \nabout--different ideas, and seeking from those different sets of ideas \nthe best of those ideas, but which have the worst of the priorities in \nthis Chamber these days. Those priorities say let us kick 55,000 kids \noff the Head Start Program, and every single one of those kids has a \nname and some place in their chest they are hoping they get a start, \nhoping they get a decent chance. But there is not enough money for \n55,000 Head Start kids. There is not enough money to send kids to \ncollege, which is going to make it tough for families to send their \nkids to college because we do not have enough money. There is just not \nenough money for education and not enough money for health care. We \ncannot afford health care for the sick and the old. So we have to make \nsome adjustments there.\n  But there is enough money for--what? B-2 bombers, nobody ordered, 20 \nof them, $30 billion. Nobody wanted them. Nobody ordered them. The \nDefense Department did not ask for them. But they say we want to buy 20 \nanyway.\n  There is enough for a star wars program that nobody asked for. Enough \nfor F-16's nobody ordered; F-15's nobody asked for; two amphibious \nships for $2 billion this country does not need; and, yes, even $60 \nmillion for blimps that was written into the Defense budget. Who wrote \nit in? I could not find out. There were no hearings, no thought, and no \ndiscussion. Just buy some blimps. We cannot afford Head Start for kids. \nBut we can buy blimps, the Hindenburg strategy of American defense, I \nguess.\n  New ideas? No, no. Herbert Hoover with the shoeshine and a haircut; \nnothing new about this. This is not a new set of ideas, or a new \ndirection, or a new policy. It is, let us decide that the rich have too \nlittle and the poor have too much.\n  Kevin Phillips, a Republican, says this: Cut middle-class programs as \nmuch as possible and give the money back to private sector business, \nfinance, and high-income taxpayers. There is nothing new about that. \nBut it is not the right priority for this country. We ought to tighten \nour belt, and we ought to do it soon.\n  All of us believe that we ought to balance the budget, and we ought \nto do it the right way. All of us believe that you ought to invest for \nthe future in this country. All of us believe the right investment will \nproduce results for America. \n\n[[Page S 15271]]\n\n  I do not believe any of us really think that this set of priorities \nmakes sense for this country's future--B-2 bombers, star wars, blimps, \nships, submarines, and airplanes that nobody ordered, nobody asked for, \nand nobody wanted; $7 billion more pumped into the Defense \nappropriations bill that nobody asked for. And then we say we are \nsorry, Timmy, or Tommy or Ruth or Mary; you are 4 years old and poor \nand want a head start, you want an opportunity. We are sorry; America \ncannot afford you.\n\n  I wish to make one final point, and then I wish to yield to my friend \nfrom New Mexico. I was at an airport on Saturday, and a woman asked if \nshe could visit with me as I walked through the airport. I said sure. \nShe was a woman in her late seventies, and she began very quietly \nbecause she did not want anybody to hear. And as she began to speak, \nher chin began to quiver and she, I could tell, was going to have \ntrouble holding back tears. And tears filled her eyes, and here is what \nshe said to me. She said: My husband's in a nursing home, been there 3 \nyears. We have a very small farm. I have now sold most of it to pay for \nhis nursing home care. She said the problem is, I do not have any more \nmoney except we have got the home place, the house, and I wish to stay \nin my house. I do not want to have to sell my house. Her eyes were \nfilled with tears. She says: I am not asking for favors. We have never \nasked anybody for anything. We have never been on the end of a handout. \nWe have always made our own way. But this woman, in her late seventies, \nwith tears in her eyes and her chin quivering, says: All I wish to do \nis be able to live in my house.\n  The fact is all of these people are victims of policies that say we \nought to buy B-2 bombers and star wars instead of helping a 78-year-old \nwoman stay in her home, instead of deciding we should not drive that \nwoman into the poorhouse so that her husband can stay in a nursing \nhome. All of these people, that woman, a young 4-year old kid, all of \nthem have names. Senior citizens, Head Start kids, family farmers who \nare going to lose the farm, all of them have names. Those are the \nvictims of bad choices in budget priorities. It is why, as we debate \nthis, we have to think through what is good for our country, what \nadvances America's economic interests. Is it just making sure those who \nhave a lot get more? Or is it deciding, yes, the investors are \nimportant; yes, people who have done well and are successful are \nimportant to this country.\n  There is nothing wrong with that, no dispute about that. But there \nare others with needs in America that are important as well. Addressing \nthose needs sometimes represents an enormous investment. It breeds \nenormous returns for our future. That is what this debate is about. And \nthe outcome of this debate will determine what life is going to be like \nfor that older woman, who cries because she wants to keep her home, or \nfor some young child who deserves a start in the Head Start Program.\n  Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15270-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15271-S15272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MEDICARE AND MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair. I appreciate that time to speak \nabout some of what is going on in Congress. There is a lot going on, \nbut I wish to speak particularly about the Medicare and Medicaid \nproposals that we are going to have to vote on in the near future.\n  Mr. President, 30 years ago, when President Johnson signed into law \nthe Medicare legislation, which really did establish a contract with \nthe people of this country, New Mexico was very proud at that time \nbecause one of our great statesmen, Senator Clinton Anderson, was \nstanding with President Johnson there in Missouri at the time that \nlegislation was signed.\n  As many who have studied American history may recall, the legislation \nthat enacted Medicare was called the King-Anderson bill, and Anderson, \nof course, was the Senate sponsor of that legislation, and very proudly \nso.\n  Since that historic day in the summer of 1965, the Medicare Program \nhas made health care a reality for thousands of people throughout this \ncountry and, of course, thousands in New Mexico. It has been the \nlifeblood of many of my State's rural hospitals and rural health care \nproviders. Today, the program is at a serious risk, and I am not at all \nconfident that the contract that President Johnson and Senator Anderson \nthen had worked out and fought for will survive in the same form that \nthey enacted it.\n  The Republican majority here in Congress is proposing to reduce \nFederal resources for health care in this year's budget by $450 billion \nfrom Medicare and Medicaid. That will occur, of course, over the next 7 \nyears. In New Mexico, the result clearly will be less health care for \npoor children and a greater financial burden on seniors and families \nwho attempt to care for seniors.\n  Today, there are some 300,000 New Mexicans who depend upon Medicaid \nfor health care, and 60 percent of those 300,000--180,000, roughly--are \npoor children. I think that is a fact on which many have not focused in \nthis debate, particularly on Medicaid. A significant majority of the \npeople who are beneficiaries of Medicaid are poor children. That is \ncertainly true in my State.\n  Under legislation that has been proposed by the Republican majority \nin the House and the Senate, many of these children are bound to go \nwith less health care available to them. Both the House and Senate \nbills call for major reductions in Medicaid funds to my State, New \nMexico. In the House bill, the reductions in funding for New Mexico \nwill exceed $900 million over the next 7 years, almost $1 billion. In \nthe Senate bill, the reductions will exceed $600 million. The Federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services predicts that the loss in \nfunding will cause our State, New Mexico, to reduce the number of \npeople being served by Medicaid by 19 percent.\n  Now, if 19 percent of the 180,000 children presently served are \ndropped from the program, then more than 34,000 poor New Mexico \nchildren who today are covered by Medicaid will not be covered by \nMedicaid in the future.\n  Some may argue that this will never happen; that the State will make \nup the difference; that any shortfall in funds will be made up by our \nState legislature and/or Governor. If that is true, I guess my question \nis, why is my State joining with 23 other States in sending a letter \nprotesting the overly prescriptive and onerous provisions that are \ncontained in the Senate bill, specifically the requirements that States \nprovide health care for below-poverty-line pregnant women and children \nup to age 12.\n  Mr. President, under the current Medicaid Program, our State is \nrequired to provide service to these vulnerable individuals, and my \nquestion is, why do we not just continue with that requirement? \nAccording to the Governors' letter, which I referred to earlier, \ncontinuing with that requirement could potentially lead to a huge cost \nshift to the States and the States want the flexibility to avoid that \ncost shift and thereby reduce the benefits to that vulnerable group.\n  In New Mexico, more than 212,000 seniors and children and adults with \ndisabilities currently depend upon Medicare in addition to those who \ndepend upon Medicaid, and by the year 2002 more than 257,000 New \nMexicans are anticipated to be eligible for the program. More than \n210,000 of those will be seniors.\n  What do these program cuts that are contained in the legislation we \nare going to vote on this next week mean to seniors? According to the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons study of this issue, the \naverage Medicare beneficiary in my State will pay a minimum of $2,000 \nmore in higher deductibles, higher copays, and there are many services \nthat will not be covered. It also means a raising of the eligibility \nage from 65 to 67 beginning in the year 2003.\n\n  Mr. President, a cost shift of this type and this size is especially \ntough on New Mexico seniors and their families because so many of those \nin my State who are seniors live at or near poverty. One in every five \nNew Mexicans, including about 26,000 seniors, lives in poverty in my \nState. Many of the State's seniors are barely making ends meet today. \n\n[[Page S 15272]]\n\n  The question is, how can poor, elderly New Mexicans possibly come up \nwith the additional resources, this additional $2,000 that it is \nanticipated they will have to come up with? Medicaid currently pays for \n$188 million of nursing home care in New Mexico annually. I heard the \nSenator from North Dakota speak about the woman who had a husband in a \nnursing home.\n  We have many people in nursing homes in my State, and they benefit \nsubstantially from the payments that Medicaid makes. Through the \nMedicaid Program the State typically picks up the extra cost where \nMedicaid falls off. But to do so, under the cuts that are proposed, the \nState must raise additional revenue. And it would be substantial \nadditional revenue, this $188 million that I referred to earlier. That \nwould be in addition to the $600 to $900 million shortfall which also \nwould have to be made up if services were to continue as they presently \nare.\n  If New Mexico will not or cannot raise the revenue needed to keep the \nsafety net in place without Federal assistance for these 300,000 \ncurrent beneficiaries, the results are very clear, Mr. President. \nThousands of seniors and children in my State will be denied adequate \nhealth care in the future.\n  The arguments for these cuts are well known by all of us. Proponents \nsay the cuts are necessary to get us to a balanced budget. But if a \nbalanced budget is the goal, then my question is, why here today at \nthis very moment do we have a committee marking up a bill to cut taxes \nin this country by $245 billion over this same period? If a balanced \nbudget is the goal, and poor children and seniors have to do without \nhealth care in order to meet that goal, then why cannot the Congress \nalso limit spending for the Pentagon to the amount that the Pentagon \nrequested?\n  All of New Mexico's shortfall, every single dollar of New Mexico's \nshortfall in Federal funds for health care could be offset by foregoing \none of the additional B-2 bombers that the Republican Congress insists \non ordering.\n  So this debate, in my view, is not about whether we should reduce \nexpenditures on health care. Clearly, we need to make some reductions. \nAnd we will do that. The debate is how deep those cuts will be, where \nthe greatest burden of this deficit reduction will fall, what the \npriorities of this Nation are. These priorities should include \nmaintaining decent health care for the most vulnerable in our society. \nThe proposal that is being presented to us this next week does not \nprovide for that.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. And I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15271-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15272-S15273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OBJECTION TO FINANCE COMMITTEE MEETING\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the distinguished presiding officer and the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, crowds are gathering to watch a train wreck. It is \ngoing to be a budget wreck. And it is going to be a horrible, horrible \npileup. Maybe that ghoulish fascination about what is ahead is, in \nfact, distracting us, diverting us from the daily bashing that \nvulnerable Americans are taking every single day in the actions of this \nCongress.\n  But today, weeks before that big crash, I have seen enough. Speaking \nfor this Senator, the junior Senator from West Virginia, I have seen \nenough. I have been fighting, offering amendments, voting no, but today \nI object. I object to all of it, to taking one more step, to letting \nthe latest injury go unanswered.\n  I have put in an objection to the Senate Finance Committee's meeting. \nAnd as a result of my objection, they cannot meet after the hour of 2. \nAnd I will do that every day, and I will do that all the way through \nthe reconciliation process until a particular part involving old coal \nminers is removed from the bill the Senate Finance Committee is now \nworking on.\n  This new Republican leadership will go to any length to seize the \ncrown jewel of their contract. And that is to ring out $245 billion in \nnew tax breaks for a privileged few. But at what cost? At whose \nexpense? Every day their answer becomes more savage. Pilfering school \nlunch moneys, turning 4-year-olds away from Head Start classes, \neliminating standards for screening and testing for childhood diseases.\n  Where does it end? Not there. Brick by brick, they are tearing down \nthe Medicare Program, the efficient, effective, popular insurance \nprogram that protects senior citizens from poverty, which they once \nknew, and pain, turning their backs on the elderly and in nursing \nhomes, allowing again, as we cut out almost 10 years ago, patients in \nnursing homes who were considered to be disruptive to be tethered down, \ntied down, or drugged into passivity. That will now be legal. And it \nwill be done. Doubling the cost of health insurance for the most \nfragile amongst us. Had enough?\n  Sticking students with higher loan fees, squeezing out job training \nopportunities, cutting the number of college loans, opening a loophole \nto drop the disabled from health coverage. Senator Chafee and I did \nthat. It passed the Senate Finance Committee 17 to 3. Pregnant women, \nchildren 12 years and younger, and the disabled. And unilaterally it \nwas dropped. And then at the last moment, because some of us came to \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate to expose that ruse, it was put back in, \nsort of, by saying, ``Let the States set the standards.''\n  Charging families more to care for their mentally ill or retarded \nchildren. Closing the doors on more than half of our special ed \nclassrooms. How much more could they want? Mugging the working poor \nwith a $43 billion tax hike.\n  What do I mean by that? The earned-income tax credit being cut by $43 \nbillion. Those are people who are living out America's dream, working \nwithout health insurance, all of them virtually, but working, refusing \nto go on welfare, many of them making less money than if they were on \nwelfare, and their kids not getting Medicaid, health care coverage to \nboot. But they are doing it because they want to work.\n  So we talk about honoring work in America. And then we turn around \nand cut those who are at the very bottom edge of the working poor, a \n$43 billion tax increase for them, money which they earned which they \nwill now not get to keep because we are changing the rules on them.\n  We are turning off the heat, Mr. President. We are turning off the \nheat, quite literally, taking away money from remedial reading and \nwriting for poor children. Are they done yet? No. Not quite.\n  Today a new provision to unravel the health benefits for retired coal \nminers and their widows has been added to this long list of atrocities. \nIt is a small group, Mr. President, only 92,000 individuals in all 50 \nStates. A small group, I admit that; the average age, 76 years old. \nMost worked in the mines for decades back in the 1940's, 1950's, and \n1960's.\n  They had to work in 3-foot crawl spaces in ice water. They did the \nhard work, pick and shovel. And now we want to take away their health \ninsurance. It is being done in the Senate Finance Committee. These were \nthe people that fueled the economic growth and the prosperity of our \ncountry. These days I meet these miners that I am talking about in \ntheir homes in West Virginia. Many struggle to walk.\n  Mr. President, if I could only describe to you what it is for an \nolder miner, attached to oxygen, with black lung, with all kinds of \nproblems of breathing, taking a fistful of pills a day. Just a simple \nact, to watch that miner try to get up out of his chair and then to \nwalk very, very slowly across the room to the television set to change \nthe channel or to turn the set on or off, and then very slowly come \nback, fall back into that chair--almost a day's journey is the physical \nimpact of that.\n\n  These are the people we are talking about. Old people, ravaged by the \nonly work that they possibly could have done, because of where they \ngrew up and what work was available. Pills for blood pressure, for \nconstant joint pain. They do not have much. They never earned a lot. \nThere are no big pensions.\n  But these miners, Mr. President, traded wages every year. They traded \nwages that they got for digging coal to get health insurance security, \nbecause \n\n[[Page S 15273]]\nto the miner, health insurance is more significant in the long term \nthan the wages of the pension. But they wanted the health insurance in \ntheir old age, to earn coverage for their wives, too often widowed too \nearly. They sacrificed for the guarantee of coverage, a guarantee that \nwas sealed by this Government in law and which was promised to them by \nPresident Harry S. Truman, the U.S. Government, and which we, in a \nbipartisan way, passed into law in something called the Coal Act back \nin 1952, which is in the process of being repealed by the Republican \nmajority.\n  These benefits, Mr. President, were guaranteed by a promise made by \nthat President 50 years ago. So what is a contract worth? They ask; I \nask. These coal miners escaped floods, they escaped roof falls, they \nescaped explosions, they escaped the ravages of black lung. They still \nsurvive, a few of them, across this country, 92,000. But they may not \nsurvive this Republican Congress, and I am sad to say there is probably \nmore to come.\n  But for me, I have seen enough. I have seen enough. Every person has \na line, a line in the sand. Every one of my colleagues has a line. For \nme, the line is these old miners. I cannot, I will not, go back to West \nVirginia without knowing that I did everything--everything--to stop \nthis cruelty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, no amount of procedural pain or \nlegislative suffering that I, as a Senator, rightfully can impose--and \nwill--could possibly offset the pain and the suffering being imposed on \nso many fragile people by the measures being rammed through the Senate \nFinance Committee and this Congress.\n  I recognize that the powerful interests who will benefit from these \nharsh measures will probably win and these coal miners will probably be \ncut off. But I want to make it hard, and I have the right to make it \nhard, and I have the moral obligation to make it hard for anybody to do \nthat. I only wish I could make it as hard for them as they intend to \nmake it--we in the Congress, that is--for the children and the seniors \nand the students and the disabled and the poor working families and \nthose old coal miners. That is my line in the sand. I fully object to \nwhat this Congress is doing.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15272-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \nyielding to me.\n  Senator Boxer, whose work I have come to appreciate more and more in \nthis body, and I had a press conference in which we had some senior \ncitizens and some students, senior citizens talking about the need for \nstudent aid, students talking about how we have to protect our \ngrandparents. The reality is this should not be a partisan fight.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer has heard me mention before we have \nbecome excessively partisan. It is one of the changes that has happened \nin my years in Congress, and it is not a good change. I think, frankly, \nthe Republican Party is going to get hurt somewhat in the course of all \nthis. But there is too much partisanship in all of this. I do not \nbelieve it makes sense when we have huge deficits--and the Washington \nPost had an editorial about this this morning--to be saying we are \ngoing to have a tax cut.\n  It is like saying you are having a New Year's resolution of going on \na diet, and you are going to start it off by having a great big \ndessert. That is what we are doing now. We are going to balance the \nbudget, but we are going to have a $245 billion tax cut.\n  If we want to use that $245 billion for reducing the deficit, I would \nunderstand that. But that is not what is happening, and I do not think \nthere is any question about what we are going to impose on seniors. \nAlso--and it has not received as much attention as Medicare has--\nMedicaid is also going to really be hurt. Who receives Medicaid? The \nmajority of those who receive it are children, poor children--24 \npercent of our young people live in poverty--and senior citizens, those \nwho are in nursing homes. They are basically the primary recipients.\n  But it is part of a pattern of not being as responsive as we should \nbe. Let me just tie in with what those grandparents said out in front \nof the Capitol just a few minutes ago at the press conference on \nstudent aid.\n  The Presiding Officer will forgive me to say he is old enough, along \nwith me, to remember the GI bill. It is interesting how the GI bill \nemerged. The GI bill, which we look back to with great pride and say \nwhat a great thing it was for our country, was a matter of controversy. \nThere were those who said we ought to give a cash bonus to veterans, \nand the American Legion, to their great credit, said we ought to have \nthe GI bill which will provide education to veterans. That was the \nfight.\n  Today we have almost a similar fight. Cash bonus--we do not call it a \ncash bonus, we call it a tax cut. Like the cash bonus, it will be \nfrittered away and will not do much for our country. But if we put \nmoney into student aid, we are going to do something for our country.\n  Direct lending is under attack, and this is not a Democratic program. \nTom Petri, a Republican from Wisconsin, was the first one to suggest \nit. My colleague, Senator Dave Durenberger, was a cosponsor with me of \ndirect lending when it was introduced. Senator David Durenberger has \nproperly said, in regard to the role of banks and the guarantee \nagencies, ``This is not free enterprise, it is a free lunch.'' That is \nwhy the banks and the guarantee agencies are fighting for this.\n  The commission that looked into how we ought to have student aid, \nheaded by our former Republican colleague Senator Paula Hawkins, \nrecommended direct lending. Larry Lindsey, a Bush appointee to the \nFederal Reserve Board, has said we should have direct lending, it makes \nmore sense, in a letter to our colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham.\n  We have to be looking out for the interest of the young and the \nold, for everyone in our society. We have to reach out. And I hope we \nuse some common sense. We are going to be in this battle the middle of \nnext week. And to say we are going to have tax cuts for people at the \nsame time we deprive elderly and students of the help that they need, I \ndo not think is in the national interest.\n\n  I simply ask the Presiding Officer--and I know he cannot answer this \nfrom the chair--I have not yet had one person with an income over \n$100,000 come up to me and say, ``I ought to have a tax cut.'' I have \nhad a lot of people come to me and say, ``We should not be cutting back \non Medicare, we should not be cutting back on Medicaid, we should not \nbe cutting back to assistance to students.'' Those are the choices that \nwe have, and I hope we do the responsible thing here.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleagues in exposing to the light of day the real lasting affects of \nthe deep, reckless cuts in Medicare and Medicaid that are being rushed \nthrough this Congress. I want to focus specifically on the massive \nproposed scaling back of Medicaid and how it completely ignores the \nvalues of average, middle-income families today.\n  Let me focus for a minute on one of the hidden surprises in the \nMedicaid block grant proposal--one that is going to devastate the so-\ncalled sandwich generation--my generation. The sandwich generation is \nthose of us who are raising our kids at home, and who are also \nresponsible for the health and safety of our aging parents.\n  Today, under current Medicaid laws that have been in effect since \n1965, adult children are not held legally or financially liable for \ntheir parents' \n\n[[Page S 15274]]\nhealth care. If the parents' health deteriorates and they enter a \nnursing home, Medicaid helps with the costs if they personally meet \nfinancial requirements.\n  Republicans, however, today are proposing to repeal this protection, \nwhich will allow States to go after the life savings of adult children \nbefore Medicaid kicks in for their parents. In fact, if this law is \nrepealed, working families in 29 States will immediately be subject to \nState laws requiring them to bear astronomical long-term care costs now \ncovered by Medicaid.\n  What does this mean in pocketbook terms? Caring for an elder in a \nnursing home costs an average of $36,000 to $40,000 a year. By the way, \nthe cost of caring for a medically fragile child on a ventilator can \neasily cost as much as $86,000 a year, or more.\n  This could be catastrophic to the average family budget. It is \nprejudicial, and it is unfair. Let us not forget, these are families \nalready under stress trying to put food on the table, paying for their \nchildrens' education, and trying to save for their own retirement.\n  Some of these 29 States whose laws will go into effect if Medicaid is \nrolled back have general duty-to-support laws. These laws assume that \nsince parents take care of children, children must later take care of \nthe costs of their parents. Other States require reimbursement of \nnursing home and goods and services, similar to child support laws. \nSome States will actually impose criminal penalties for adults who do \nnot contribute to the cost of their parent or family member in a \nnursing home.\n  This means that working families will have to make new choices. They \nwill have to choose between allowing their mom to be cared for in a \nfacility where she will have access to medical attention and \nassistance, or quitting a job to take care of her at home.\n  They will have to choose between paying for one family member's \nmedical costs, or for the cost of another family member's education. Or \npaying for groceries. Or saving for retirement.\n  Working families should not be forced to make such untenable choices. \nNo one wants to make choices between the future of their own children, \nand the health of their parents. They should not have to.\n  So why are these cuts being suggested? We have no crisis, financial \nor otherwise, that could merit these draconian measures. Any money that \nmay be needed to continue our commitment to Medicare is not an issue \nwith Medicaid. Under the guise of saving money, this cut will actually \npit our citizens against one another.\n  There are 36 million financially strapped Americans on Medicaid: 4 \nmillion elderly Americans, 6 million disabled Americans, 8 million \nAmerican women, and most important, 18 million American children.\n  Under the Republican proposal, over the next 7 years nearly one in \nevery four Medicaid recipients will lose their coverage. Who will \nsuffer when our State governments run out of money?\n  Who will be turned down for benefits? An elderly woman waiting for \nvital nursing assistance? A disabled adult needing new sterile suction \ntubes for a ventilator? A medically fragile child whose body needs an \nessential mineral or amino acid to process food?\n  I can tell you this; I would not want to be the one making that \nchoice.\n  This is real. It is going to be felt by real families, with real \nproblems in my State and across this Nation.\n  I got a letter recently from a mother who is scared about how this \nassault on Medicaid might affect her son Patrick, who is a 45-year-old \nman with infantile autism, which among other things, means that he has \nno verbal language. During Patrick's early life, no insurance company \nwould cover the costs of his treatment or therapy, so it was no \nsurprise that by age 16 he had deteriorated to the point where he was \nalso afflicted with epileptic seizures.\n\n  When Patrick's parents finally learned, on their own, that their son \nqualified for Medicaid coupons when he was 22, Patrick's life changed. \nHe could receive treatment at any doctor, dentist, or pharmacy he \nneeded to see, even though his parents sometimes had to remind people \nwho tried to refuse the coupons that the medical schools they had \nattended had received Medicaid funding.\n  Today, Patrick lives freely in the community, in his mother's words \n``only because of the federally mandated program, Medicaid.'' \nRepublicans in Congress would make Patrick and his family compete at \nthe State level against pregnant mothers, severely mentally ill \nteenagers, elderly stroke victims in nursing homes, and medically \nfragile infants. All to be able to provide a tax break no one wants, to \npeople who do not need it.\n  This is nothing more than the legislative pursuit of political dogma, \nwithout regard for the consequences to real people.\n  The core principals in these proposals are all wrong. This is not the \nAmerica I grew up in, the country I believe cares about all of its \ncitizens, no matter who they are or where they come from, or how much \nthey are worth in financial terms.\n  Let is look at the real problem. If this Congress is serious, it will \nfocus on the $89 billion financial hole in Medicare, and will find a \nway to make these programs work better for families. We cannot just \ntoss people on the street and hope things turn out OK.\n  We hear so much about family values today. Well, I agree: it is time \nto start valuing our families. It is time to recognize that many many \nfamilies are struggling today. Their real needs are family wage jobs \nand economic security; a good education for their kids and health care \nthat is affordable.\n  These draconian cuts, so hastily thrown together, will only increase \neconomic insecurity of American families. I hope this Congress will \nhave the integrity and the intelligence to stop these unnecessary cuts \nnow, before it is too late.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by Senator \nMurray from the State of Washington. She says it well and says it with \nfeeling. I suppose some would say that we are hopelessly old-fashioned \nwhen we think that there are certain virtues in our country, the virtue \nof helping someone who needs help, extending a hand to those who are \ndown and out, caring about kids. There are certain virtues that are \nimportant, that ought to be at the front of the agenda, at the top of \nthe list.\n  I come from a town of about 300 people, and if you were to devise \nsome sort of fiscal policy or budget for my hometown and say, look, I \nhave an idea for this town, and here is my idea. Our town has 300 \npeople in it. What I am going to do is I am going to make a stop at \nsome of the poorest homes in our town, where people do not have much, \nand I am going to ask them to tighten their belts and take away a \nlittle of what they have. I am going to stop at the homes where people \nare trying to send their kids to college and say: You know what I want \nto do for you? I want to make it more expensive to send your kids to \nschool.\n  I want to stop at the middle-income working families' homes, who have \nparents in nursing homes, whose assets are exhausted and gone and say: \nWe are going to make a deal for you. You are going to have to pay more \nto have your parents in nursing homes.\n  I am going to stop at a home where a low-income single mother has a \nchild in Head Start and say, ``By the way, your little Timmy, age 4, \nhis name comes up on our list of 55,000 kids that we cannot afford to \nhave in the Head Start Program.''\n  Then in our travels around this small town of 300 people, we will \nsay, well, we have been to all the neighborhoods and told those folks \nwhat they have to sacrifice. We will stop by the wealthiest families in \ntown and give them the good news.\n  Know what the good news is we will say to the wealthiest folks in \ntown? ``We will give you a big tax cut.'' Do you know why? ``Because \nyou are successful, you are investors and you deserve it.''\n  Now, it is true we will not even bother to tell you we have been \ndriving around town all day telling the poorer folks and the middle-\nincome families how much they have to give, but we are delighted to \nstop at your house because we will give you a big tax cut. We think so \nmuch of you, we think so much of what you do we want you to have more.\n  I am saying that sense of priorities does not make sense to me. It is \nout of step. This is all about priorities and choices.\n  Frankly, I wish it were not partisan. For 10 months we have heard \npeople \n\n[[Page S 15275]]\nstand on the floor saying we are the ones that do not care about a \nbalanced budget. Nonsense. We are the ones that do not care about \nputting this country's fiscal house in order. Rubbish. For 2 days, an \nhour a day we have heard people stand up and say we are the ones that \ncould not have a plan. Baloney.\n  Of course, we have a plan. We do not have a plan like this. We have a \nplan that balanced the budget and does it the right way with the right \npriorities.\n  Here is a letter dated today by the head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and it is ``Chapter 2 in Budget Fraud'': This says, from the \nhead of the Budget Office, June O'Neill, Director, ``The CBO projects \nthat the enactment of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the \nBudget Committee would produce a small budget surplus in the year \n2002.''\n  Oh, really? A small budget surplus? Well, what it will produce is \n$110 billion deficit. This is budget fraud. I have sent a letter to the \nDirector of the CBO just now, and I am hoping to get an answer either \ntoday or in the morning that says, by the way, if you construct a \nletter like this following the law and not misusing Social Security \nfunds, what is the deficit in 2002?\n  The answer, if the Director of the Congressional Budget Office gives \nme an honest answer, is that the deficit in the year 2002 with this set \nof plans or these priorities will be $110 billion deficit in the year \n2002.\n  Now, we want to see some honesty in budgeting. I yield to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, the minority leader, who has come to the floor and \nwants to make a presentation on these priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15273-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15275-S15276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair and the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his eloquence and his leadership on this issue. He has \nspoken as passionately as I have seen him speak on an issue he cares \ndeeply about, and I am very grateful to him for the many occasions \nwhere he has come to the floor to speak out as strongly as he has again \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. President, this is an unusual week. I hope that everyone can \nfully appreciate the magnitude of what will happen this week. As we \nspeak, the Senate Finance Committee is meeting to discuss just how we \nwill divide up the $245 billion in tax cuts that we have been talking \nabout now for several months.\n  They are expected to complete their work tomorrow. Ironically, \ntomorrow is the very day the House of Representatives will take up a \nproposal to cut $270 billion from Medicare in an effort to pay for it.\n  So you have the interesting and very ironic juxtaposition of the \nSenate Finance Committee voting to cut $245 billion today and tomorrow, \nand the House voting simultaneously to pay for it by cutting $270 \nbillion in Medicare and ultimately $187 billion in Medicaid, to ensure \nthat we have enough left over.\n  We are deeply concerned, Mr. President, on the ramifications that all \nof this has; concern for a lot of reasons. Let me mention just four.\n  First, we are deeply concerned, and I could bring back all of the \nrhetoric we heard last year during the health care debate about closed-\ndoor decisionmaking, rhetoric we heard about the concerns raised by \nmany that we did not have an opportunity to discuss in open and public \ndebate all of the very significant and far-reaching ramifications of \nthe decisions being made.\n  Lo and behold, over the last several days, that is exactly what has \nhappened with regard to this tax package. Decisions were made, deals \nwere cut, long-term ramifications considered and explained away without \none opportunity for Democrats to be consulted or to participate. That \nis wrong. Closed-door decisionmaking, Mr. President, is wrong under any \ncircumstances, and it is wrong in this case.\n  We just saw evidence in the last couple of weeks about what kind of \ndeals can be cut behind closed doors, as doctors went in to speak to \nthe Speaker and came out smiling because of the new opportunities they \nhave to avoid responsibility in making the cuts on Medicare; avoid \nhaving to come under the scrutiny of those who would ferret out waste \nand abuse in the Medicare Program.\n  The Speaker made an announcement a couple of days later that he will \ngo after murderers first and he will talk later about what problems \nthere may be with fraud and abuse in the Medicare system, because we \nmay not have enough prison cells.\n  Mr. President, that is wrong. If that is what results in closed door \ndeals, it is doubly wrong.\n  We are equally concerned about the budgetary effect. Everybody has \ncome to the floor, time and again, to talk about what it is we are \ntrying to do with this reconciliation package, what we are trying to \ndo, going all the way back to the budget debate last spring and how \nimportant it was we did everything possible to ensure that we reach \nthat 2002 target day.\n  What do we find? Republicans have a choice between a tax cut which \nexacerbates the problem by $93 billion according to CBO and not \nachieving all of the goals that we want, or having a tax cut and doing \nall that Republicans have proposed we do with regard to providing this \nlargess to those who do not need it.\n  What do we find? Almost to a person, our Republican colleagues now \nsuggest that it is important to pass this tax cut, regardless of the \ndeficit ramifications. The $93 billion somehow is explained away. The \n$93 billion will not be explained away, Mr. President, and we have to \naddress that issue before we resolve this reconciliation matter.\n  Third, as we have said time and again, it is the distribution of \nbenefits that disturbs us a great deal. Providing huge tax cuts to \nmillionaires and requiring working families with incomes of less than \n$30,000 to pay more is just wrong. It is wrong, and that distribution \nis something that we will be dealing a lot more with in the coming days \nand weeks.\n  How is it we can possibly ask working families to pay more, and \nturning around and giving those who have so much yet another handout in \nthe form of tax benefits?\n  Perhaps the most troubling of all the aspects, Mr. President, is the \ndegree to which Medicare is being cut to accomplish this in the first \nplace. A Medicare cut of $270 billion, $187 billion in Medicaid, all in \nthis ruse that somehow it is those resources that will be used only for \ndeficit reduction, when we know full well that $270 billion is going to \nbe used for the tax cut that has nothing to do with taking further out \nwhatever solvency we can in the trust fund.\n  Bruce Vladeck said in an October 11 letter to Congressman Sam \nGibbons:\n\n       The cumulative effect of the Medicare Part A HI reductions \n     included in H.R. 2425 for FY 1996-FY 2002, offset by the cost \n     of repealing the OBRA'93 provision, would reduce Part A \n     expenditures by approximately $93.4 billion. Based on \n     estimates from the Health Care Financing Administration's \n     actuaries, the resulting year-by-year ``net'' Medicare Part A \n     savings would extend the life of the HI Trust Fund through \n     the third quarter of calendar year 2006. This estimate is \n     based on the intermediate set of assumptions in the 1995 \n     Trustees Report.\n\n  Mr. President, that says it as clearly as anyone can say it. While \nthe Republican proposal would cut $270 billion, the effect that it will \nhave on the trust fund is the same effect as the Democratic plan which \ncuts at 89.\n  I do not think anyone should be misled about the real motivations and \nthe real desire on the part of Republicans, understandably, to find a \nway to pay for the tax cut in the first place.\n  The real impact to real people is what we ought to be concerned \nabout. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota said it so well. \nThey are the most vulnerable. They are the people whose faces we must \nremember as we make these very important decisions--disabled people, \nelderly people, children, people who will be left out simply because we \nfailed to appreciate the magnitude of the personal impact that these \ndecisions will have on them.\n  I do not think a soul in the country voted last year to cut Medicaid \nbenefits to those who are disabled so we could give a tax cut to those \nwho do not need it. That is wrong. That set of priorities must be \nturned around, and over the course of the next several days we will do \nour level best to ensure that people fully appreciate the repercussions \nand ramifications of what some on the other side are prepared to do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  \n[[Page S 15276]]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOE ALLEN AZBELL\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Joe Allen Azbell--author, journalist, and \nadviser to Presidents and Governors--passed away on September 30 after \na lengthy illness. He was city editor of the Montgomery Advertiser \nnewspaper, a columnist for the Montgomery Independent, and the author \nof three books.\n  While his formal education ended with the fifth grade, Joe's \naccomplishments are truly historic. He is credited with helping make \nthe Montgomery bus boycott possible. Joining the staff of the \nAdvertiser in 1947, within 5 years he had become one of the youngest \ncity editors in the South. In December 1955, he ran a front-page story \non the impending bus boycott. The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., \nonce remarked that the boycott might never have occurred without this \npivotal article.\n  Born during the Great Depression in a small Texas dustbowl town, Joe \nAzbell ran away from home at the age of 12 because his parents did not \nallow him to read books, and his thirst for knowledge could not be \nquenched. He hid in small-town libraries, figuring that the truant \npolice would not look for him there. During World War II, he joined the \nArmy Air Corps and began his career in journalism.\n  Joe served as an advisor to every Alabama Governor going back to \nGordon Persons. He was especially close to George Wallace, for whom he \nwrote speeches during his presidential campaign. He supposedly came up \nwith the political slogan ``Send them a message'' for the campaign. \nJohn Chancellor of NBC called it the best political slogan of this \ncentury. He was also an advisor to every American President from Lyndon \nJohnson to George Bush.\n  Much of the success Joe Azbell enjoyed over the years was due to his \ncolorful personality and gift for getting along with all types of \npeople. He had a genuine interest in people and thoroughly enjoyed \ngetting to know them and talking to them. Likewise, people responded to \nhis charm, humor, and honesty.\n  Joe will be sorely missed by those who knew him both personally or \nonly through his excellent reporting and commentary. I extend my \nsincerest condolences to his family in the wake of their tremendous \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15275-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ORR GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Mr. William Orr ``Bill'' Graham passed \naway on September 28 after an extended illness. The Morgan County, AL, \nnative was founder and owner of Graham & Son Piano House and was active \nin his community and in State politics for many years.\n  Bill Graham attended Auburn University. He once received the Florence \nCivitan Club's Book of Golden Deeds Award for outstanding community \nservice. He was a charter member of the Florence Chamber of Commerce, \npresident of the North Tennessee Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica and was an organizer of the Camp Westmoreland Boy Scout Camp \nand the Kiwanis high school Key Clubs.\n  Bill was elected by the people of the Eighth Congressional District \nto serve on the State Democratic executive committee. He was also a \nmember of the Alabama Industrial Development Board. He organized the \ntalent contest at the North Alabama State Fair, was youth talent \ndirector of the MidSouth Fair in Memphis, a talent scout for the Ted \nMack Amateur Hour, and was instrumental in securing college \nscholarships for many deserving youth in the Shoals area.\n  In addition, Bill was talent coordinator for the Cerebral Palsy \nTelethon for many years, past president of the Gilbert School PTA, \nchairman of the administrative board of North Wood Methodist Church, \nand aide-de-camp to the battalion commander of the Alabama State \nNational Guard. He was also part of the management of the Birmingham \nBarons baseball team.\n  William O. Graham was truly an outstanding community leader who gave \nof himself in many years over his long life. He will be sorely missed. \nI extend my sincerest condolences to his family in the wake of their \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15276-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LEWIS E. McCRAY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, long-time West Alabama Planning and \nDevelopment Council Executive Director Lewis E. McCray has announced \nhis plans to retire at the end of this year. He has held the executive \ndirector position since October 1, 1967, when he became the first paid \ndirector of the council. When he was hired, the agency was known as the \nTuscaloosa Area Council of Local Governments and its members consisted \nof Tuscaloosa County and the cities of Tuscaloosa and Northport. \nInitially, the agency was funded through a program of the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  Under Lewis McCray's outstanding leadership, the agency has grown to \na membership of 7 counties and 34 municipalities. Due to its expanded \nmembership, its name was changed to the West Alabama Planning and \nDevelopment Council in 1971. It has been designated an Economic \nDevelopment District, Local Development District, Metropolitan Planning \nOrganization, and an Area Agency on Aging. The Council also administers \nthe Title V Senior AIDES Program and Community Development Block Grants \nand provides technical assistance to local governments.\n  Mr. McCray has been active in many civic and professional \norganizations. His professional affiliations currently include his \nservice as president of the Alabama Association of Regional Councils, \nmember of the board of directors of the National Association of \nDevelopment Organizations, member of the National Association of \nRegional Councils, the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama, the \nTuscaloosa County Industrial Development Authority, and the Tuscaloosa \nConvention and Visitors Bureau.\n  He is a native of Hale County, AL, and was educated in the public \nschools of Moundville and at the University of Alabama. Before being \nnamed executive director of the council, he taught business law and \naccounting at Shelton State Community College. He also served as the \nexecutive assistant to the late U.S. Congressman Armistead Selden.\n  I congratulate and commend Lewis McCray for an outstanding career and \nfor all he has done to benefit his community, region, and State. I wish \nhim all the best for a long, happy, and healthy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15276-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15276-S15277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE REVEREND H. KENNETH DUTILLE, JR.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, as we all know, the Senate can impose \ntremendous demands on its Members as we grapple with the difficult \ndecisions facing this body and this Nation. It is no surprise then, \nthat the Senate begins each of its sessions with a prayer delivered by \na distinguished religious leader.\n  Earlier today, that spiritual leadership came from the Reverend \nKenneth Dutille, Jr., of the First Baptist Church in Bath, ME. Reverend \nDutille is truly dedicated to his work, his congregation and his \ncommunity, and I am very pleased that he was selected to be one of two \nguest Chaplains we will have this month.\n  The distinction is deserved, for Reverend Dutille visits us with many \naccomplishments. He is a graduate of Baptist Bible College in \nSpringfield, MO, and the University of Maine. He holds a masters degree \nfrom the California Graduate School of Theology. In his many travels, \neducational and otherwise, he has preached in over 200 churches in New \nEngland alone.\n  It is praticularly fitting that Reverend Dutille lead the Senate's \ninvocation today because he brings with him an understanding of some of \nthe demands and pressures on those in public life. He is a selectman in \nhis town of Richmond and was a candidate for the Maine State \nLegislature in 1994.\n  Reverend Dutille also knows the strains and joys of a successful life \nas a small business owner, running the Good News Book Shop in \nBrunswick. Just recently, he added a book of his own to the shelves, \n``Images of America: Lewiston and Auburn.''\n  As evidenced by Reverend Dutille's invocation this morning, he is an \nasset to his congregation and his community. His accomplishments, \nboundless energy, and exemplary service make \n\n[[Page S 15277]]\nhim an excellent choice as the guest Chaplain.\n  Again, I am very pleased to have Reverend Dutille, his wife Patricia, \nand his daughter Melissa with us here today. I'm sure I speak for all \nof my colleagues in extending a very warm welcome on this special day.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I understand why the chairman made the \ndecision to delete title III from the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity Act. A determined minority--at the urging of the White \nHouse--was able to prevent action on the legislation. Mr. President, 94 \npercent of Republicans voted to invoke cloture, and 17 percent of \nDemocrats voted for cloture. I commend the Members of both sides of the \naisle willing to bring debate on this measure to a close. I know for \nthe Democrats it is not easy to stand up to the kind of White House \nblitz that has occurred.\n  Once again, the White House says one thing and does another. The \nWhite House talks about toughening the embargo on Cuba, and then works \nto undermine the sanction Castro fears most. The White House says it \nwants bipartisanship in foreign policy--in fact they are pleading with \nus on Bosnia--and then uses partisan arguments to derail this \nlegislation. Policy toward Castro's Cuba has been a perfect example of \nthree decades of bipartisan cooperation. In the House, 67 Democrats \nsupported a tougher version of this legislation. Nine Senate Democrats \nsupport cloture, and I expect many more would without the kind of \npressure coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Let there be no \nmistake--White House inflexibility has forced the change made today.\n\n  As I said last week, the Dole-Helms amendment--we already made 10 \nchanges to address administration concerns. We were willing to make \nmore to address issues raised in this debate--raising the threshold for \nlegal action from $50,000 to $100,000 for example, or extending the \neffective date from 6 months to 2 years after enactment. These are \nchanges that will presumably be considered in conference on H.R. 927.\n  I supported title III as drafted in the Dole-Helms substitute. Yes, \nit does give a new right of legal action that could bring more suits \nbefore American courts. But if clogging up the court system is a \nconcern of the White House or of opponents of this bill, I call on them \nto join with me to enact comprehensive tort reform. Opponents of this \nbill say title III would create a right for Cuban-Americans not enjoyed \nby Polish-Americans. They are right. And there is one critical \ndistinction--today, Poland is free while Cuba suffers under the boot of \nCastro's repression.\n  That is what it really comes down to--the Cuban people continue to \nsuffer while Castro searches for ways to finance his dictatorship. \nThere are legitimate differences over the best way to bring democratic \nchange to Cuba but we should be very clear about one thing: It is the \nchilling effect on investment in Cuba caused by the provisions of title \nIII that worries Fidel Castro the most.\n  I expect the Senate to conclude action relatively quickly on this \nlegislation. The international embargo on Cuba will be strengthened, \nand important provisions for the eventual transition to democracy will \nbe enacted. I remain hopeful--and I say this in a spirit of \nbipartisanship; we had it work in some other areas, not as many as we \nshould--that we can continue to work out a solution to the issue of \nproperty stolen by Fidel Castro so that is acceptable to at least 60 \nSenators.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues on this side and the others on the \nother side, and I hope, now that title III has been deleted, we could \nhave an overwhelming vote for cloture, let us go to conference, let us \nwork in a reasonable way--with the White House, if they would like to. \nI am certain the Senator from North Carolina would be willing to do \nthat.\n  Mr. HELMS. Hear, hear.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent I be able to address Senate for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina. I \nintend to vote for cloture as a result of the amendments he has made.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, this title III had virtually nothing to \ndo with Cuba and an awful lot to do with our own claims process in this \ncountry. While Poland may be free today, Vietnam and the Peoples \nRepublic of China are not. That would create unique distinctions for \nthose of Cuban nationality. While I have great sympathy for them, in \nterms of their right to bring actions for expropriated property, this \nwould create an egregious raid on the Treasury, in my view.\n  My hope would be the House would adopt the Senate language, in the \nabsence of title III and other provisions, so that we would be able to \nmove forward and send this bill to the President for his signature.\n  So I support cloture and urge my colleagues to do so, that we then \nmight consider other amendments on this legislation and move forward \nwith the bill.\n  But our objections, those of us who did object to this, had little or \nnothing to do with White House pressure, but rather our own examination \nof the bill and our recognizing the problems associated with title \nIII--as I said a moment ago, an egregious raid on the Treasury of the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15277-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I lay before the Senate amendment No. 2936 \nwhich includes title I and title II of the Libertad Act only. I ask it \nbe stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2936 to amendment No. 2898.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, title I of the Libertad Act strengthens \nsanctions against the Castro government. Some of the principal \nprovisions of that title include: urging the President to seek an \ninternational embargo against the Castro dictatorship; authorizing the \nPresident to support democracy-building efforts in Cuba and to help the \nvictims of Castro's repression; prohibiting financing to any person to \nfinance transactions involving U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban \nGovernment; and ensuring that U.S. foreign aid to former Soviet states \nis not being used to subsidize Castro's regime.\n  Title II of the Libertad Act lays out a proactive strategy to support \nCuba's transition to a democratically elected government. The \nprovisions of title II include instructing the President to develop a \nplan for providing support to the Cuban people during a transition to a \ndemocratically elected government. This title also authorizes \nassistance to meet the emergency and basic humanitarian needs of the \nCuban people during the transition period; and it gives the President \nflexibility to suspend the economic embargo during a transition and to \nterminate the embargo once a democratically elected government is in \noffice in Cuba.\n  Mr. President, the Libertad bill sends a clear message to the Cuban \npeople, and to other nations, that the United States will not do \nbusiness with Castro's dictatorship.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge Senators to support this legislation. \nI believe that enactment of the Libertad Act will help bring about \nCastro's departure from power, making Cuba free and democratic. The \npeople of Cuba deserve freedom, and we must not desert them now.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nlegislation. Like many of our colleagues, I am profoundly disappointed \nthat title III of this bill will be dropped today. I am disappointed \nthat we could not get the 60 votes we need to break a filibuster by \nthose who are not willing to tighten the noose tighter around Fidel \nCastro's neck.\n  It would be one of the great tragedies of history if the tidal wave \nof freedom that has covered the planet in the last 5 years were allowed \nto subside before it drowned Fidel Castro.\n  My basic objective here today, Mr. President, is to pass the Helms \nbill and go to conference, and then in conference bring back the title \nIII provisions, the provisions which will deny Castro the ability to \nentice foreign private investment to prolong his life as dictator in \nCuba which would prolong the misery of the Cuban people.\n  I believe that the bill that is now before us is an improvement over \nour current situation. It does strengthen the embargo. It does set up a \nprocedure whereby we make it more difficult for Castro's Cuba to get \nfunding through the United Nations or the world financial \norganizations. The bill gives us the ability to link our aid to \nRussia's actions as they relate to Cuba, both in Russia's trade \nrelationship and in their intelligence gathering. So I think the Helms \nbill, as it now is before the Senate, is an improvement on current law. \nWhat remains of that bill does not do the job the original bill did. We \nare all disappointed that we could not break the filibuster on that \nbill.\n  Yet, I am supportive of the remaining Helms provisions. I want to see \nthem adopted. I want to see us go to conference. I want to put title \nIII back in the bill and bring it back to the Senate and fight for its \npassage. I think it would be a great tragedy for our country, it would \nbe a great tragedy for everything we stand for in the world, it would \nbe a great tragedy for the Cuban people, if we do not do everything in \nour power to get rid of Fidel Castro.\n  The original Helms-Burton bill was an important step in the right \ndirection. I am for that bill. I intend to continue to fight for it. I \nurge my colleagues to support this measure today so that we can go to \nconference and get back the original bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that I may be allowed to \nproceed as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15277-5", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15278-S15282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THOMAS J. DODD\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak with my colleagues \ntoday about a remarkable and really historic event that occurred in my \nState of Connecticut this past Sunday, October 15, when the University \nof Connecticut dedicated the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, associated \nwith the University of Connecticut library. It is a center named, \nobviously, for the great former Senator from the State of Connecticut, \nfather of my colleague and dear friend, the current Senator Chris Dodd.\n  It was a spectacular day, a beautiful fall day in Connecticut, but \nobviously it was more than the weather that distinguished the day.\n  What happened really was a fitting tribute, that will go on through \nthe years and decades ahead, to Senator Tom Dodd and the remarkable \nrecord of achievement that he built here in the U.S. Senate where he \nserved from 1958 to 1970 and in the years before then. The events began \nwith a dedication at the library site itself and then proceeded to the \nGampel Pavilion \n\n[[Page S 15279]]\nwhere it looked to me like 8,000 or 9,000 people packed in to hear the \nPresident of the United States, President Clinton, deliver the first in \na lecture series that will emanate from the Thomas Dodd Research \nCenter, in this case specifically focused on the Nuremberg trials, 50 \nyears after, because Senator Tom Dodd was a prosecutor there.\n  Mr. President, Tom Dodd, as President Clinton said, spent his life in \nthe service of his country. He trained as a lawyer, served as an FBI \nagent, then as a lawyer for the U.S. Government. He was, throughout his \ncareer, a great fighter for freedom, for human rights. And it is to the \nstudy of human rights that this research center will be committed.\n  Senator Dodd fought the tyranny of racism as an attorney prosecuting \ncivil rights cases in the 1930's, which was a long time before most \nother Americans thought about the idea of civil rights.\n  And throughout his time here in the Senate, and before in the House, \nhe was a great fighter against the tyranny of communism, one of the \ngreat, principal, fervent anti-Communists of the cold war period who \nput us as a nation on a course to understand that the cold war was not, \nas some historical revisionists would have us believe, just a kind of \ntug of war between two great powers--the United States and Russia--but \na conflict of ideas, a continuation of the struggle between good and \nevil, between freedom and tyranny. That is, in its way, the history of \nour species on this Earth.\n  Senator Tom Dodd understood that the battle against communism, the \ncold war, was part of that struggle of good against evil.\n  His passion for justice, his hatred of oppression, his understanding \nthat human rights began with the vision that every individual is sacred \nbecause God created that individual, his understanding that we had to \nstrive to establish the rule of law to protect human rights and to \npromote justice was expressed magnificently, brilliantly in his work as \nan executive trial counsel at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal after \nthe war.\n  A film was shown of some of Tom Dodd's appearances at the Nuremberg \ntrial. It was riveting. He was brilliant and compelling, and in that \nextraordinary human historic experience, coming out of the devastation \nand lawlessness of the Holocaust, established the principle of justice \nthrough law.\n  Senator Chris Dodd, who spoke that day, reminded us that one of the \nremarkable achievements of the Nuremberg trial was not just those who \nwere guilty, who were convicted and severely punished, but that three \npeople were actually acquitted at Nuremberg and that, in its way, is a \ntestament to the rule of law and justice as well.\n  A beautiful building, 50,000 square feet, a repository of historic \npapers, Senator Dodd's and others--a living legacy that will go on from \ngeneration to generation bringing scholars there to study, to write and \nto be reminded of the centerpiece of the career of Senator Tom Dodd, \nwhich was the struggle for human rights and justice through law and the \nneed to continue to fight that battle.\n  Mr. President, the day on Sunday was a day in which we dedicated a \nbuilding, but it was also a day in which I think Connecticut was struck \nand riveted by what was happening to bring the building about. It was \ntruly an expression of devotion of a son to his father, an expression \nof the love of Chris Dodd and his brothers and sisters for their father \nand their commitment to honor his memory. As I had the opportunity to \nsay on Sunday in Connecticut, as beautiful a fulfillment as I have ever \nseen of the Biblical commandment, honor one's father and mother, and \nthe Dodd family did it with dignity and with purpose befitting their \nfather, Tom Dodd, on Sunday in Connecticut.\n  But, of course, the truly significant way and the ongoing way in \nwhich my colleague from Connecticut and dear friend, Chris Dodd, honors \nthe memory of his father is by the extraordinary quality of his service \nin this body by his personal fight for human rights throughout the \nworld and at home, and particularly at home for the rights of children, \nunderstanding and reminding each of us, as Senator Chris Dodd has so \noften on this floor, that a child who is without adequate food, without \nadequate shelter, without adequate parentage, without decent health \ncare, without safety and protection from crime and abuse, suffers in \nthat child's way, as much as people who are forced to live under \ntyranny, and in that sense, is deprived of human rights as well.\n  It struck me, and I know my colleagues on the floor, knowing and \nloving Senator Chris Dodd as I do, will share the thought that I had on \nSunday, which was, as we thought about Nuremberg and we thought about \nthe Second World War and the films were there of the Holocaust and the \ngenocide, that our colleague and friend, Senator Chris Dodd, in his \nservice, in his life, is the diametric opposite of the evils that were \nportrayed and lived and suffered through in the Second World War; \nreally a person without bias, a person of great warmth and compassion, \na person of openness to all and a person who really in his life carries \non the legacy that his father left.\n  It was a spectacular day which had great meaning for the Dodd family, \nwhich truly honored the memory of Senator Thomas Dodd, which the \nPresident graced with a magnificent speech, talking as the President \ndid about the record of Senator Tom Dodd, but also bringing it to bear \non the acts of genocide that have occurred in the former Yugoslavia, on \nthe importance of the war crimes tribunal that is now going on in The \nHague directed to the war crimes that have been committed in the former \nYugoslavia. And, finally, the President expressed support for the idea \nof a permanent court of international justice, a permanent court \noperating perhaps through the United Nations, emanating out of the \nUnited Nations, which could stand as witness and deterrent, as Senator \nDodd did at Nuremberg, to prosecute those who violate accepted rules of \ninternational justice and fairness.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe text of President Clinton's remarks at the University of \nConnecticut dedication of the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center on Sunday, \nas well as several articles from the Connecticut press, the Hartford \nCourant in particular, about the life and service of Senator Tom Dodd \nand what it means to each of us today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Transcript of President Clinton's Remarks at Dedication of Thomas J. \n                 Dodd Research Center, October 15, 1995\n\n       Thank you very much, President Hartley. Governor Rowland, \n     Senator Lieberman, members of Congress, and distinguished \n     United States senators and former senators who have come \n     today; Chairman Rome, members of the Diplomatic Corps; to all \n     of you who have done anything to make this great day come to \n     pass; to my friend and former colleague, Governor O'Neill, \n     and most of all, to Senator Dodd. Ambassador Dodd, and the \n     Dodd family: I am delighted to be here.\n       I have so many thoughts now. I can't mentioning one--since \n     President Hartley mentioned the day we had your magnificent \n     women's basketball team there, we also had the UCLA men's \n     team there. You may not remember who UCLA defeated for the \n     national championship--(laughter)--but I do remember that \n     UCONN defeated the University of Tennessee. And that made my \n     life with Al Gore much more bearable. (Laughter.) So I was \n     doubly pleased when UCONN won the national championship. \n     (Applause.)\n       I also did not know until it was stated here at the outset \n     of this ceremony that no sitting President had the privilege \n     of coming to the University of Connecticut before, but they \n     don't know what they missed. I'm glad to be the first, and I \n     know I won't be the last. (Applause.)\n       I also want to pay a special public tribute to the Dodd \n     family for their work on this enterprise, and for their \n     devotion to each other and the memory of Senator Thomas Dodd. \n     If, as so many of us believe, this country rests in the end \n     upon its devotion to freedom and liberty and democracy, and \n     upon the strength of its families, you could hardly find a \n     better example than the Dodd family, not only for their \n     devotion to liberty and democracy, but also for their \n     devotion to family and to the memory of Senator Tom Dodd. It \n     has deeply moved all of us, and we thank you for your \n     example.

He was 26 and full of energy and \n     ideas for his first formal brush \n\n[[Page S 15280]]\n     with elective politics. He loved people, loved the political arena, \n     loved everything about it.\n       But the campaign was sputtering, and even a rookie could \n     understand why. Three years earlier, Sen. Thomas Dodd, D-\n     Conn., had become only the seventh person in history to be \n     censured by the U.S. Senate. And now the censure--for \n     improper use of campaign funds--hung like an anvil around the \n     neck of the candidate.\n       Of course, what everyone, including young Dodd, could see \n     coming, happened. And when the Election Day mauling was over, \n     he drove back to the family's Old Lyme home, crushed. He \n     thought he had let down the father he respected and loved so \n     much.\n       But Daddy, as Chris Dodd called his father, was not \n     scowling. ``He poured a glass of Dewar's scotch,'' recalled \n     Chris Dodd, ``and thanked me for putting in the time.''\n       His father's grace in defeat--rather than his triumphs at \n     the top--helped convince Chris Dodd that politics was an \n     honorable profession. And the son, now Sen. Christopher J. \n     Dodd, D-Conn., has dedicated at least part of his own career \n     to ensuring that his father is remembered as an honorable \n     politician.\n       ``Sometimes, I think almost everything Chris Dodd does down \n     here is meant to vindicate his father,'' said Sen. Daniel K. \n     Inouye, D-Hawaii, who served in the Senate with both Dodds.\n       He has taken up some of the issues his father held dear, \n     such as foreign policy and children's welfare.\n       He has kept his father's memory alive in the Senate \n     chambers. Chris Dodd sits behind his father's desk and keeps \n     his father's barrel-back, wood-and-leather chair in his \n     office. A huge illuminated portrait of Thomas Dodd looks down \n     on visitors to the office's conference room.\n       And he has worked quietly to rehabilitate the Dodd name. \n     The very presence of Chris Dodd in the U.S. Senate is daily \n     testimony to the success of that effort. And Sunday's \n     dedication of the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the \n     University of Connecticut is his monument.\n       The Dodd family helped raise over $1 million for programs \n     at the center, which will house the senior Dodd's political \n     papers, along with other archival material.\n       The four-day conference that coincides with the center's \n     dedication will focus on the legacy of the Nuremberg trials. \n     Thomas Dodd's year as a Nuremberg prosecutor was ``the \n     seminal event in my father's professional life,'' Chris Dodd \n     said.\n       ``I had given thought over the years to what would be a \n     fitting memorial,'' the younger Dodd said. ``We'd thought of \n     a road or a bridge or a park, but I didn't like the idea of \n     people driving over his name.\n       ``This is a research center at the flagship university in \n     our state, just a few short miles from where he was raised. \n     There's a lot of symbolism to it. My father would have loved \n     this,'' he said.\n\n\n                         shielded from censure\n\n       Chris Dodd said he has been able to maintain his love of \n     politics, while many in his family have not, because he was \n     not a witness to his father's humiliation. After graduating \n     from Providence College in 1966, the younger Dodd joined the \n     Peace Corps and went to the Dominican Republic.\n       He was there when his father became the first caught by an \n     ethical system that was undergoing profound changes in the \n     1960s. Stung by charges that Secretary of the Senate Bobby \n     Baker used his office to help his business, the Senate set up \n     an Ethics Committee in 1964.\n       The Dodd case would be its first mission. In February 1966, \n     a month after columnists Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson began \n     writing articles accusing Dodd of using campaign money for \n     personal expenses, Dodd asked the new committee to look into \n     the complaints.\n       The committee held hearings in the summer of 1966 and \n     continued them the next year. Dodd testified that money \n     raised at testimonial dinners were ``to be spent at the \n     discretion of the recipient.'' In response to a complaint \n     that he helped a Chicago public relations representative gain \n     favor with the West German government, Dodd said he was \n     simply an errand boy for the executive.\n       The committee recommended he be censured on two counts--\n     using campaign money for personal expenses and billing trips \n     to both the Senate and to private organizations.\n       The Senate would not censure him on the second charge; it \n     agreed to strike it, 51-45. But it did vote 92-5 to censure \n     him on the first charge, with only Sens. Abraham A. Ribicoff, \n     D-Conn.; John Tower, R-Texas; Russell Long, D-La; Strom \n     Thurmond, R-S.C.; and Dodd himself opposing the resolution.\n       It was a stunning setback for a politician who just three \n     years earlier was being seriously considered by President \n     Johnson for the vice presidency.\n       Chris Dodd received newspaper clippings, sent by family and \n     friends, about his father's ordeal, but he did not live \n     through it directly. He did not have to endure the daily \n     batterings from Pearson and Anderson, or read about the march \n     of Connecticut figures to the Ethics Committee in 1967 to \n     testify about his father, or hear his father's May 15, 1967, \n     radio speech to the people of Connecticut in which he called \n     his pending censure ``a strange coming together of hateful \n     and vengeful interests.''\n       ``They may have been trying to shield me,'' Chris Dodd said \n     of his family. ``I was living in a vacuum.''\n       By the time he returned to the United States on Christmas \n     Eve 1968, U.S. politics involved other topics.\n       Despite the Senate's resounding verdict, Thomas Dodd \n     continued to serve, maintaining his seniority and \n     chairmanship of the juvenvile delinquency subcommittee and \n     vice chairmanship of the internal security subcommittee. In \n     1968, he saw Congress pass the gun control legislation he had \n     championed for years, albelt a watered-down version of what \n     he had sought.\n       He lost his seat in 1970, largely because of the censure. \n     Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., then a U.S. representative from \n     southwestern Connecticut, won with 41 percent of the vote. \n     Democrat Joseph Duffey got 34 percent, and Dodd was third \n     with 24.5 percent.\n       When Thomas Dodd died in May 1971, four months after \n     leaving the Senate, the rehabilitation of the Dodd name began \n     in earnest.\n       Senators offered tributes on the floor. Sen. James Allen, \n     D-Ala., recalled how, ``He fought unceasingly against crime, \n     juvenile delinquency and drug addiction.'' Sen. James \n     Buckley, Conservative-N.Y., called him ``an eminent analyst \n     of Cold War strategy.''\n       In February 1972, Ribicoff asked the Senate to give its \n     unanimous consent to printing colleagues' eulogies in a \n     special book, a memorial to Thomas Dodd. That book is \n     available today in the U.S. Senate library.\n\n\n                           Winning as a Dodd\n\n       But restoration of the Dodd name has come more from his \n     son's political success than his colleagues' flowery words.\n       Thomas Dodd did not urge his children to become involved in \n     politics--``We were never asked to pose for pictures,'' \n     recalled Chris Dodd--but the son could not help notice all \n     the excitement his father's work was generating.\n       Chris Dodd was a teenager when his father was elected to \n     the Senate in 1958. ``He was working all the time, and at \n     night he'd most likely be at some function or another.'' \n     Chris Dodd said, ``But when he'd come to the house, you'd be \n     aware of his arrival. Dogs would bark, people would get \n     excited. He may not have been home for dinner at 5:30, but \n     bonds were forged in different ways.''\n       The younger Dodd liked the idea of going into politics, but \n     it was not a burning ambition. ``I knew enough to know that \n     was not the kind of ambition you should have, that becoming a \n     member of Congress is something you don't always control,'' \n     he said.\n       Chris Dodd did not make the classic young man's political \n     moves. He moved to North Stonington, hardly a hotbed of \n     Democratic activity. He joined a law firm that did not \n     encourage people to run for office. And he lived in a \n     congressional district represented by Robert H. Steele Jr., a \n     Republican who at the time looked like he could hold the seat \n     until the 21st century.\n       Still, Chris Dodd ran for the House of Representatives in \n     1974, an election held three months after President Nixon \n     resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Even though it \n     was a good time for Democrats, ``A lot of people told me I \n     could never get elected with the Dodd name,'' Chris Dodd \n     recalled. He did, of course, ``and then people told me it was \n     because of the Dodd name,'' he said.\n       Inouye viewed the son as a man on a mission.\n       Chris Dodd's style, his choice of issues, his way of \n     dealing with people is all meant to convey the idea that his \n     father was a person of honor and Chris is here to remind you \n     of that, said Inouye and others.\n       Though he was only 36 when he joined the Senate in 1981, he \n     quickly befrinded some of his father's colleagues, including \n     Inouye and Sens. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; Robert C. Byrd, \n     D-W.Va; and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.\n       And he didn't forget one of his father's few supporters \n     during the censure vote. Chris Dodd was one of only three \n     Democratic senators to back John Tower's controversial and \n     unsuccessful nomination as secretary of defense in 1989.\n       ``Their presence on the Senate floor is very similar,'' \n     said Inouye. ``When I look at Chris Dodd and close my eyes, I \n     can imagine Tom Dodd speaking.''\n       Kennedy also notices a similarity in how the two men put \n     together legislation. Chris Dodd makes a habit of visiting \n     Connecticut high schools to talk to youngsters, particularly \n     about the problems of weapons in schools. Then he returns to \n     Washington and uses anecdotes to help him push for a bill.\n       Thomas Dodd would do the same kind of thing. ``He'd get in \n     his car and, go around Maryland and Virginia and go to gun \n     shops,'' Kennedy recalled. ``He would find out what was \n     happening and then translate that into legislation.\n       ``When Tom Dodd or Chris Dodd wanted something, they were \n     bulldogs,'' Kennedy said.\n       There are, however, important differences between the two. \n     One of them is their relationship with the Kennedys.\n       Chris Dodd is viewed as Kennedy's best friend in the \n     Senate. Thomas Dodd, on the other hand, was one of the few \n     prominent New England officeholders to endorse then-Senate \n     Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson over then-Sen. John F. \n     Kennedy in the 1960 battle for the Democratic presidential \n     nomination.\n       There are personality differences as well. ``Tom Dodd was \n     more reserved; Chris is more of a glad-hander,'' said \n     Thurmond, who was a \n\n[[Page S 15281]]\n     Democrat when Tom Dodd arrived in the Senate.\n       Hollings put it more bluntly. ``Christopher has a much more \n     engaging personality,'' he said.\n       And Chris Dodd is much more of an insider than Thomas Dodd \n     ever was. In 1963, the elder Dodd blasted Senate Majority \n     Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., on the Senate floor.\n       Chris Dodd, on the other hand, competed for the job of \n     Senate Democratic leader last year and lost, even after a \n     late start, by only one vote. A month later, he became \n     President Clinton's hand-picked choice as Democratic National \n     Committee general chairman.\n\n\n                           liking the linkage\n\n       The father and son have taken up some of the same issues. \n     Chris Dodd likes to draw a line between his father's work in \n     the 1930s with the National Youth Administration, a \n     Depression-era agency that helped children from poor families \n     get education and employment training, and his own work \n     today.\n       Chris Dodd chaired the Senate's subcommittee on children, \n     families, drugs and alcoholism until Republicans won the \n     Senate in 1994. He remains the Senate's leading voice on \n     children's issues, most recently brokering a compromise to \n     the welfare reform bill that will mean $8 billion in extra \n     money for child-care programs during the next five years.\n       ``I can see him moving bills like that,'' said Chris Dodd. \n     ``I'd like to think he'd be more supportive than not of what \n     I do, very proud.''\n       In foreign policy, Chris Dodd was able to see finished \n     something his father had helped start.\n       In 1950, Thomas Dodd, then a member of a special American \n     Bar Association committee, had urged members of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee to approve a treaty establishing \n     penalties for genocide.\n       Yet the Senate for years refused to ratify the treaty, some \n     senators fearing the U.S. sovereignty would be compromised.\n       The son battled hard for his father's cause. In 1984, Chris \n     Dodd, who like his father served on the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, quoted on the Senate floor his father's \n     words from two decades earlier: ``For me, the genocide \n     convention has a special personal meaning because as \n     executive trial counsel at Nuremberg I had spread before me, \n     in nightmarish detail, the whole incredible story of Nazi \n     barbarism.''\n       Two years later, as the Senate debated the treaty again, \n     Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., recalled the senior Dodd's \n     commitment. ``Tom Dodd, the father of Sen. Chris Dodd, \n     contributed a special zeal to this effort,'' he said. ``It \n     was his opinion that had it [the treaty] been in existence \n     when Hitler first came to power the tragic events of his \n     regime might have been prevented.''\n       Finally, in 1986, as the Cold War wound down, the Senate \n     approved the treaty.\n       Father and son, however, were not always in sync, \n     particularly on foreign policy.\n       Thomas Dodd was a relentless anti-Communist from his \n     Nuremberg days. Though representatives from the Soviet Union \n     were part of the tribunal, his dealings with them made him \n     think they were capable of the same kinds of horrors as the \n     Nazis.\n       They are ``probably doing this same sort of thing behind \n     the Iron Curtain now,'' he said in his 1950 testimony, \n     ``Russia in its plan, as I see it, wishes to influence people \n     all over the world.''\n       While many Democrats were urging the United States to pull \n     troops out of Vietnam in the late 1960s, Thomas Dodd remained \n     staunchly behind the war effort.\n       By contrast, his son, though no rabid anti-war activist, \n     came to oppose the Vietnam War in 1968, and served in the \n     U.S. Army Reserve to avoid being sent to Vietnam.\n       In the Senate, Chris Dodd opposed the Reagan \n     administration's efforts to provide military aid to ``freedom \n     fighters'' trying to unseat the democratically elected and \n     socialist government of Nicaragua. He pushed hard for \n     economic aid to address fundamental economic problems in the \n     Caribbean and Central America.\n       But the son warned that the differences between father and \n     son should not be overstated. They are of two different eras, \n     but share the same values and thoughts, he said.\n       ``I have a lot of affection and admiration for my father,'' \n     said Chris Dodd. ``I like the tradition. I like the \n     linkage.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Oct. 8, 1995]\n\n            Tom Dodd's Letters Open New Window Into History\n\n                          (By Mark Pazniokas)\n\n       A half-century ago, amid the rubble of a vanquished \n     Germany, the victorious Allies put Nazi leaders on trial for \n     crimes against peace and humanity.\n       The Reich's unspeakable atrocities were laid bare in a \n     dozen trials and hundreds of convictions. But the Nuremberg \n     trials had an even more noble aspiration: to make \n     international law a force for peace.\n       Beginning today, The Courant will explore the meaning of \n     the trials and their ambiguous legacy in a four-part series. \n     Next week, the University of Connecticut will commemorate the \n     50th anniversary by dedicating the Thomas J. Dodd Research \n     Center and holding a conference on human rights and the rule \n     of law.\n       Horror fills the yellowed letter, written long ago in a \n     bombed out hotel. It is dated Aug. 14, 1945, the day after a \n     wide-eyed Thomas J. Dodd arrived in Nuremberg, Germany, to \n     prosecute the Nazis.\n       Three months after V-E Day, the stench of death still hung \n     heavy in the summer air. An estimated 20,000 dead lay \n     entombed in the rubble of the old city, where legions had \n     rallied for Hitler before the war.\n       Half the population of 400,000 fled before the Americans \n     took the city in April. Many of those who stayed now slept in \n     cellars, emerging each morning like mice to forage in the \n     dusty ruins.\n       ``Grace, my dearest one,'' Dodd wrote to his wife, safe at \n     home in Connecticut with their five children, the youngest \n     being the 14-month-old Christopher. ``Here I am in the dead \n     city of Nuremberg.''\n       So began an unbroken stream of letters that Tom Dodd, then \n     a 38-year-old government lawyer abroad for the first time, \n     would write daily from Nuremberg until sailing home in \n     October 1946.\n       The collection remained unseen outside the Dodd family \n     until last month, when Sen. Christopher J. Dodd granted The \n     Courant access for stories marking the 50th anniversary of \n     the first Nuremberg war-crimes trial.\n       Nuremberg was the real ``trial of the century,'' a yearlong \n     dissection of how the Nazis murdered millions and pillaged a \n     continent.\n       Twenty-one men stood trial before an unprecedented \n     International Military Tribunal, which the four Allied powers \n     created to mete out justice and compile an incontrovertible \n     record of Nazi outrages. Architects of the tribunal also had \n     a higher hope: to set an international standard for judging \n     war crimes.\n       Tom Dodd returned home a hero from Nuremberg, poised for a \n     political career that would make him a congressman, a senator \n     and a national figure opposed to communism, which he viewed \n     as the moral equivalent of Nazism.\n       But the letters to his wife show a man who was at a \n     crossroads at Nuremberg, bedeviled by doubts about his career \n     and even his continued participation in what he knew was a \n     historic trial.\n       Hopes of entering politics seemed to be slipping away. He \n     told his wife in one pessimistic letter that the future \n     belonged to the men who spent the war in uniform. Dodd had \n     been a federal prosecutor during the war.\n       Dodd's children long had viewed the letters as his private \n     notes to their mother. She supported their father through his \n     many triumphs and, in 1967, his censure by the Senate for \n     misusing campaign funds. The Dodds died within 20 months of \n     each other: Tom in May 1971, months after losing his Senate \n     seat; Grace in January 1973.\n       ``Many of them,'' Chris Dodd said recently of his father's \n     Nuremberg letters, ``are what I would consider to be love \n     letters.''\n       They are full of tender references to ``that day in St. \n     Paul.'' Tom Dodd and Grace Murphy married May 19, 1934, in \n     St. Paul, Minn., where he was assigned as an FBI agent.\n       Most are written by hand in a flowing script, in ink when \n     available, in pencil when necessary. They are conversations \n     between the sometimes-crusty prosecutor and his ``dearest \n     Grace.''\n       ``I am not conscious of proper grammatical construction or \n     of word choice or any formality,'' he told Grace. ``I am on \n     the sofa and I am talking to you and I'll be darned if I will \n     pick my words like a parson preparing a sermon.''\n\n\n                         from norwich to london\n\n       Tom and Grace Dodd made their goodbyes before dawn at Union \n     Station in Washington, D.C., on July 27, 1946. Dodd had been \n     recruited from the U.S. attorney general's staff for the \n     United Nations War Crimes Commission.\n       ``You made a memorable picture for me as I gazed out the \n     taxicab window until the dimness of the dawn light blotted \n     your loveliness out,'' Dodd wrote her from London, his first \n     stop in Europe.\n       He one day would become a foreign policy expert, relied \n     upon by Lyndon B. Johnson, but in 1945 he was small-town \n     Connecticut. He was born in Norwich and lived in Lebanon, a \n     part of the state that had more cows than people.\n       His letter from London is enthusiastic travelogue, full of \n     details about his flight aboard a military transport that \n     hopscotched from Washington to Newfoundland to Prestwick, \n     Scotland, where he caught another flight to London.\n       Trans-Atlantic air travel was still a novelty, and Dodd \n     stayed up most of the night chatting with a crewman, who \n     regaled him with tales of planes lost without a trace in the \n     North Atlantic.\n       At first light, Dodd wrote gratefully, ``The sun came up \n     beautifully about 4:30 a.m. London time.''\n       Dodd had graduated from Yale Law School in 1933, an Irish-\n     Catholic at a blue-blooded institution. He was president of \n     the Yale Democratic Club and organizer of ``the Flying \n     Wedge,'' a cadre that passionately defended Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt's New Deal.\n       He spent a year as an FBI agent, chasing John Dillinger \n     through the Midwest; served for a time as director of the \n     National Youth Administration in Connecticut; then tried \n     civil rights cases for the Justice Department. During the \n     war, he prosecuted spies and profiteers.\n       He cut an impressive figure. His hair, prematurely going \n     gray, was brushed straight back. He had piercing eyes and \n     thick, dark eyebrows, a ringing speaking voice and the same \n     sarcastic wit later shown by Christopher, the son who would \n     follow him onto the national political stage.\n\n[[Page S 15282]]\n\n       In London, Dodd felt humbled by the war-weary populace.\n       ``They stared at the cab from eyes that I could not meet, \n     attired in clothing that made me wince,'' Dodd wrote. ``I \n     really feel ashamed when these people stare--for they \n     recognize an American by the quality of his clothing.''\n       Of course, he had seen nothing yet. In a few months, Dodd \n     would be numb to the horror of war and complain about being \n     bored by the confession of a man who murdered 1\\1/2\\ million \n     people at Auschwitz.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me indicate we believe we can have \ndebate on the Simon amendment yet this afternoon. I understand the \nSenator from North Carolina will offer an amendment which will be \naccepted on behalf of Senator Bradley. That will leave the Helms \namendment and the two Dodd amendments.\n  We are hoping to start at 10:30 tomorrow morning on the bill and \nrecognize Senator Dodd, with, if there is not a time agreement, a short \nperiod of debate. We are trying to accommodate Senator Dodd's schedule, \nso I hope he will accommodate ours tomorrow.\n  I want to congratulate the Senator from North Carolina. I regret we \nwere one vote short, 59 to 36. So it was necessary, as the chairman has \nindicated, to delete title III.\n  It is the hope of everyone when we get into conference we can work \nout some consensus so we can come back with a conference report and \npick up that additional vote and maybe more.\n  It seems to me there are good points to this bill. The strength of \nthis bill was title III, and we will revisit it. There will be some \nversion of it in the conference report. Again, I think the chairman is \nto be commended. We will go to conference and see what happens.\n  Also, it is my hope tomorrow--I discussed this briefly with Senator \nKerry from Massachusetts--that we could move to the State Department \nreorganization bill. They indicate they will make an offer to Senator \nHelms this afternoon.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. If that is acceptable under a 4-hour time agreement, we can \ncomplete action on that, too.\n  After the debate on the Simon amendment, and anything else being done \nwith reference to this, I think it is my intention to recess so the \nSenate Finance Committee can meet and complete its work, because they \nmay be going late into the evening.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader, \nand I share his regret that we had to go through all of this. Sometimes \nit is absolutely essential that we do. I have no hard feelings toward \nanybody about it. I just wish we could have moved along a little more \nrapidly. I appreciate all the help the majority leader has given.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2930 to Amendment No. 2936\n\n(Purpose: To make limited exceptions to restrictions on assistance for \n the independent states of the former Soviet Union imposed by the bill)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Bradley and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for Mr. \n     Bradley, proposes an amendment numbered 2930 to amendment No. \n     2936.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, strike line 1 and all that follows through line \n     14 on page 16 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(5) except for assistance under the secondary school \n     exchange program administered by the United States \n     Information Agency, for the government of any independent \n     state effective 30 days after the President has determined \n     and certified to the appropriate congressional committees \n     (and Congress has not enacted legislation disapproving the \n     determination within the 30-day period) that such government \n     is providing assistance for, or engaging in nonmarket based \n     trade (as defined in section 498(k)(3)) with, the Government \n     of Cuba, or''.\n       (2) Subsection (k) of section 498B of that Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2295b(k)), is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Nonmarket based trade.--As used in section \n     498A(b)(5), the term `nonmarket based trade' includes \n     exports, imports, exchanges, or other arrangements that are \n     provided for goods and services (including oil and other \n     petroleum products) on terms more favorable than those \n     generally available in applicable markets or for comparable \n     commodities, including--\n       ``(A) exports to the Government of Cuba on terms that \n     involve a grant, concessional price, guarantee, insurance, or \n     subsidy;\n       ``(B) imports from the Government of Cuba at preferential \n     tariff rates;\n       ``(C) exchange arrangements that include advance delivery \n     of commodities, arrangements in which the Government of Cuba \n     is not held accountable for unfulfilled exchange contracts, \n     and arrangements under which Cuba does not pay appropriate \n     transportation, insurance, or finance costs;

Mr. President, I have sent an amendment to the desk to \nensure that high school exchanges with students from the New \nIndependent States of the former Soviet Union will continue to build \nbridges between our country and theirs. In essence, this amendment \nexempts the high school exchange program from the operation of section \n107 of this bill, which would otherwise allow such programs to cut off \nif an NIS country engages in certain activity enumerated in that \nsection.\n  This program is unique. It calls for a personal involvement that \nother aid programs do not demand of Americans. It not only benefits the \nnewly independent states, but it benefits Americans as well. Host \nfamilies and American students learn from having foreign students in \ntheir homes and classrooms. Americans studying in Kiev, St. Petersburg, \nVilnius, and Almaty are witnessing first hand the new frontiers of \ndemocracy and they return home with a better understanding of the \npeople of those nations.\n  Since 1993, over 12,000 high school students from the New Independent \nStates have visited the United States to live with American families \nand study in this country. As their home countries of Armenia, Russia, \nUkraine, Kazakhstan, and the other NIS countries are making the \ntransition to post-Soviet societies, these students come to our country \neager to learn about the privileges and opportunities that come with \nliving in a democracy and free market economy.\n  This program plays a tremendously important role in our relationship \nwith the newly independent states. It allows these young students to \nexperience life in a multicultural, market-based democracy. It forges \nconnections between the people of this country and theirs, which will \ncontinue as these future leaders take back to their home countries a \nnew perspective on the world and valuable, lasting bonds. But the \nimpact of the exchanges goes beyond those students who are actually \nchosen to participate in the program. There is a ripple effect, as \nthese students share their experiences with their families, friends, \nand fellow students back home.\n  This unique program accords tremendous benefits and for that reason, \nit must be allowed to continue.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I strongly support the secondary exchange \nprograms in the Bradley amendment. These semester and academic year \nprograms are one of the more successful assistance programs we have \nwith the new Independent States of the former Soviet Union. The \nSenator's amendment is in keeping with the spirit and intent of the \nRussia sections of the Libertad bill. I am prepared to accept the \namendment exempting this program from the Libertad bill's restrictions \non aid to the former Soviet States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2930) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15282-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15283-S15284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WE MUST END THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN AMERICA AND MAKE EVERY HOME SAFE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know we are about to go into recess, \nand I thank my colleagues for their graciousness. I appreciate this \ntime. I come before the Senate to underscore my commitment to ending \ndomestic violence in America. As I have said on the floor before, every \ntime a person in my State of Minnesota dies at the hand of an abuser, I \nwill make sure that their story becomes a part of the Congressional \nRecord.\n  As my colleagues know, October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. \nIt is a month that is designated to raise awareness about domestic \nviolence. In addition, the YWCA has designated this week as their call \nfor a ``Week Without Violence.'' Today, in particular, their efforts \nwill focus on confronting violence against women. So, Mr. President, it \nis for this reason that I have chosen this special day to come to the \nfloor of the Senate to make this statement.\n  It is with some sadness, pain, and anger that I will read the names \nof five Minnesota women and one Minnesota child who were apparently \nkilled at the hands of someone they knew. The circumstances are \ndescribed in the record compiled by the Minnesota Coalition for \nBattered Women. Mr. President, I must state at the onset that none of \nthe people charged in these murders has been convicted yet. Therefore, \nI will not use the victims' real names.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate to describe these cases so that we \nwill remember how deeply this violence scars our society. And most \nimportantly, as a reaffirmation of any commitment--and I hope the \ncommitment of all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike--to \nwork toward ending the cycle of violence. Indeed, Mr. President, if we \nare ever going to stop the violence in our communities, in our \nworkplaces, and in our streets, we are going to have to begin by \nstopping violence in our homes.\n  Mr. President, domestic violence continues to be the single most \nsignificant cause of injury to women in the United States of America. \nYet, this violence knows no boundaries of age, or gender, or race, or \ngeography, or income, or education. The violence goes on year after \nyear and generation after generation. A study by the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention at the Department of Justice found \nthat mistreated youngsters who grow up in violent homes were twice as \nlikely to commit brutal crimes as were children from nonviolent homes. \nNot surprising. If you grow up in brutal circumstances, that can very \nwell make you brutal.\n  In Minnesota, in 1994, at least 19 women and 7 children were brutally \nkilled by a spouse, a former partner, or someone they knew. So it is \nwith pain, but also with great determination, I ask that we honor the \nmemory of individuals who apparently died as a result of domestic \nviolence. We should be mindful of the fact that these women could be \nyour friends, they could be your neighbors, they could be your \ncoworkers, they could be your sisters, they could be your mothers, they \ncould be your wives.\n  It is from my heart that I ask that we end this kind of violence, \nthat we do everything we can to end this kind of violence that has such \na painful cost for individuals, their families, and their communities.\n  Individuals: Sue, 31. A sheriff's deputy found the bodies of her and \nher ex-husband in a bed in their home. Authorities had no doubt the \nhomicides were murder-suicide, and believe her ex-husband shot her as \nshe slept, and then shot himself. Both were wearing nightclothes, and a \nsingle-shot, 12-gauge shotgun was found by the side of the bed.\n  Joyce, age 27. She and her boyfriend were found dead in the apartment \nthey shared. The police said that the boyfriend apparently shot her and \nthen turned the gun on himself. A shotgun was found near the bodies.\n  Marie, 30. She was found dead from stab wounds. Her husband was \narrested and charged with second-degree murder.\n  Deborah, age 51. She was found buried in a wilderness area. Her son \nwas charged with first-degree murder in the strangulation death of his \nmother. He admitted to killing her because she did not like his \ngirlfriend. He said he strangled his mother with the power cord of his \nradio, and then put her body in the trunk of the car and drove to the \nwilderness area and buried her.\n  Carol, age 40. Her 6-year-old son reported that she and her boyfriend \nwere seated on the couch and fighting. Her boyfriend had a rifle \npointed at her head and told her he would kill her if she contacted the \npolice. She then reportedly said, ``Go ahead.'' And her son \n\n[[Page S 15284]]\nsaid he then heard two shots. The boyfriend has been charged with \nsecond-degree murder.\n  Anne, age 3. She died after being stabbed in the head. Her stepfather \nhas been charged with first-degree murder in her death and attempted \nmurder and second-degree assault in the stabbing of his wife. The \ndetails of her death are too gruesome to talk about on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, these are the recent cases of victims only in \nMinnesota, and only those that have been documented and well-\npublicized. Looking at the national statistics, I know there must be \nmany more cases that go unreported.\n  An American Medical Association report cites some horrifying \nstatistics: Nearly one quarter of the women in the United States of \nAmerica--more than 12 million--will be abused by a current or former \npartner sometime during their lives--one quarter of the women in the \nUnited States of America; 47 percent of husbands who beat their wives \ndo so three or more times a year; according to FBI statistics, at least \n30 percent of murdered women are killed by their intimate male partner; \nevery 13 seconds, a child in the United States of America is reported \nabused or neglected; and more than three children--more than three \nchildren--die each day in the United States as a result of abuse or \nneglect.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer stand by and say it is someone else's \nproblem. What are we waiting for? Too many have spoken with their \nvoices and with their lives, and this violence must end.\n  Last year, the Congress passed new laws to protect victims and to \nprevent violence. Senator Biden has taken a major leadership role in \nhelping to pass the Violence Against Women Act.\n  The first comprehensive piece of legislation on the subject of \nviolence against women was milestone legislation for this Congress and \nfor this Nation. We all must continue to fight any efforts to weaken \nthe crime bill, including efforts to scale back the Violence Against \nWomen Act or the funding for it.\n  Mr. President, domestic violence is also a critical issue to me when \nwe talk about reforming the welfare system.\n  I said on the floor before, it took Monica Seles 2 years to play \ntennis again after being stabbed. Can you imagine what it would be like \nif you were beaten over and over and over again?\n  We must make sure that States have the option to give exemptions to \nwomen who have been beaten or children who have experienced this. They \nmay not be able to work in 2 years. The last thing you want to do is \ncut them off of assistance and give them no other choice but to go back \ninto very dangerous homes.\n  There is much to be done. We must be a voice for the victims; the \nwomen, the men, and the children who live in fear every moment of their \nlives, never knowing when the abuse will come or how lethal the next \nattack will be.\n  We must be unrelenting in our campaign to say as Senators what my \nwife Sheila says wherever she goes in Minnesota: We will not tolerate \nthe violence; we will not ignore the violence; and we will no longer \nsay it is someone else's responsibility.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to work with the survivors, the \nadvocates, the medical professionals, the justice systems in our \nStates, and to support full community funding and full community \ninvolvement in ending this violence. I urge my colleagues to work with \npassion and conviction to make this a priority of our work in the U.S. \nSenate. We must do everything we can to make homes the safest places \nthat they can be.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from North Carolina for \ngiving me this opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15283-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15284-S15287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2934 to Amendment No. 2936\n\n  Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, as I indicated, I think part of free speech \nis that we do not just get the Government line on anything. I do not \ncare what it is--popular, unpopular. That means that we ought to have \nthe freedom to travel where there is no risk.\n  That includes unpopular countries. That includes China. I happen to \nbe one of those, along with the Senator from North Carolina who is very \ncritical of the human rights record of the Chinese Government, but I \ndefend the right of American citizens to travel.\n  I defend the right of American citizens if there is no risk to travel \nto Iran or Iraq. It does not mean I approve of any of those \ngovernments. The same for Cuba.\n  The leader of Cuba has probably the worst human rights record of any \nleader in this hemisphere. There is no question about that.\n  There are two questions. One, do you change policy by restricting \ntravel, or do you change policy by permitting travel? That is one \nquestion. The second question is, is this a first amendment right or is \nit in the spirit of the first amendment?\n  On the first question, whether it can change and modify the \ngovernment there, I recognize that people who are sincere can disagree. \nWe faced this same debate with the Soviet Union. There were those who \nfor a time said Americans should not travel to the Soviet Union because \nyou simply encourage that Government by giving them hard currency. \nOthers said--and it turned out to be right--we ought to travel there so \nwe can expose more people to our point of view.\n  Virtually every other government in the world--the British, the \nFrench, the Canadians--in fact, when I say ``virtually,'' I think we \nare alone and the Senator from North Carolina can correct me, I think \nwe are alone among the nations of the world in not permitting travel to \nCuba.\n  Israel was the only nation that voted with us in the United Nations \nbut Israel is putting in investment in Cuba.\n  I just think our isolation here just does not make sense. The reality \nis, American citizens do travel to Cuba today. Now, they go by way of \nCanada or Mexico, but not one American citizen has been arrested for \nit. Not one American citizen has been fined. Not one American citizen \nto my knowledge has had his or her passport taken away.\n  I think our policy just does not make sense. Americans ought to have \nthe liberty, the freedom, to travel to Cuba unless there is a physical \nrisk.\n  Now, if there is a danger that someone is going to be taken as a \ncaptive there, or something like that, that is different. The southern \npart of Lebanon, for example, would not be safe for Americans. I \nunderstand that. But I think we ought to be free to travel there, and \nthat goes for any dictatorship anywhere. I think it is a way of \npromoting freedom. I think it is also a basic freedom that American \ncitizens ought to have.\n  That is basically my argument. In terms of philosophy, my guess is \nthe Senator from North Carolina would agree with me. In terms of its \nspecific application to Cuba, he may not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before I make comments about the amendment \nof the Senator, let me ask if he is aware of the effort by the majority \nand minority leader to achieve a time for the Finance Committee to \nmeet? There is an objection to the committee meeting while the Senate \nis in session.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am not trying to prolong that. I am willing to recess at \nthis point. I was told by my staff what the majority leader preferred.\n  Mr. HELMS. I wanted to be sure that the Senator knew that. I do not \nwant to interrupt the Senator's delivery or his argument at all.\n  Will the Senator be willing to enter into a time agreement for this \nafternoon, provided both sides have 10 minutes each in the morning?\n  Mr. SIMON. That will be perfectly acceptable to me.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well, how much more time this afternoon?\n  Mr. SIMON. I, frankly, have presented the cause. It is not \ncomplicated. So I am willing to yield to my colleague. I probably would \nlike 2 minutes to respond to whatever he might have to say, and then we \ncould recess and each have 10 minutes tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, my \nfriend and my neighbor in the Dirksen Building, is always cooperative. \nIf I say anything to excite him about his amendment, he will be \nentitled to take as much time as he needs to reply to me.\n  I do not agree with the amendment, and I hope it will not be \naccepted. But let me say this, Mr. President, I never have any question \nabout the good intent of the Senator from Illinois on any issue, \nincluding this one. He sincerely believes the flow of American citizens \nto Cuba will promote positive change in Cuban society. But, in the \ncontext of Fidel Castro's regime, in my judgment, the belief that \ntourism will change Castro's tyranny cannot be supported by the facts. \nHere is why.\n  I say, with all friendliness, the loudest advocate of the Senator's \namendment would be Fidel Castro, because he is trying to lure tourists \ninto Cuba so they will bring hard cash which he could use to buy a \nlittle bit more time for his regime.\n  As a matter of fact, for years Mr. Castro has lured Europeans, \nCanadians, Mexicans, and others to Cuba. But from the beginning, Castro \ntypically set up a structure to isolate foreign tourists and tourist \nfacilities from the larger Cuban population. As a matter of fact, some \nof the major newspapers in this country and elsewhere refer to this \nsystem of Mr. Castro's as ``tourist apartheid.''\n  What has been Mr. Castro's purpose in promoting tourism? It has not \nbeen to improve the lives or freedoms of the Cuban people. Tourists \nvisiting Cuba have access to food, shelter, and recreation not \navailable to the poor Cuban people themselves. But this does not bother \nFidel Castro and his cronies. Mr. Castro tolerates the tourist trade \nbecause he needs, as I said earlier, the hard cash--the hard currency \ngenerated by tourism to subsidize his corrupt regime.\n  Even the employment generated by tourism supports the regime. Here is \nhow that works. The Cuban Government, that is to say Castro's \nofficials, decide who will work in the tourist resorts. Nobody else \nneed apply. With the Cuban State economic sector collapsing, jobs are \nbecoming more and more scarce in Cuba and working in a tourist area \nbecomes leverage that Castro uses as people struggle to find work in \norder to feed and care for their families.\n  There is another tragic phenomenon that has emerged from Castro's \nefforts to attract foreign tourists. It is called sex tourism. More and \nmore, Cuban women, some little girls as young as 14 years of age, are \nprostituting themselves because they cannot find any other way to feed \nthemselves and their families. An Italian travel magazine recently \nidentified Cuba as the ``paradise of sexual tourism,'' ranking it above \nThailand and Brazil as the place to go for what the magazine called \n``erotic tourism.'' This is just one of the perverted legacies of the \nCastro revolution.\n  The free flow of American citizens to Cuba would be no more effective \nin reforming Castro's regime than has been the flow of Canadian, \nEuropean, and Latin American tourists up to now. And lifting the travel \nrestrictions, I say to my friend with all due respect, will not--will \nnot--expedite Castro's departure. Rather, it will help keep Castro in \npower by giving him badly need hard currency.\n  The Treasury Department rules now allow for travel by journalists and \nby \n\n[[Page S 15286]]\npeople engaged in educational or religious activities, as well as \ntravel for humanitarian reasons, including permission to travel for \nthose accompanying humanitarian donations to the Cuban people and \nindividuals traveling in connection with recognized human rights \norganizations.\n  Restrictions on the right to travel are within the bounds of the \nConstitution. Twice the United States Supreme Court has heard \nchallenges to the rules governing travel to Cuba. Every time, the Court \nhas upheld the regulations, holding that the right to international \ntravel is not without limitations when the restrictions are connected \nwith the national security interests of the United States. In the case \nof Cuba, it is in our national interest to deny Fidel Castro the hard \ncurrency that would be brought in by tourism.\n  If the amendment of my friend is approved, the result would be to \nlimit the President's ability to restrict travel. There are, in my \njudgment--and I say this with respect to my friend--there are valid \nnational security reasons why travel to Cuba should be regulated. \nApproval of this amendment will serve to give hope to Castro, and that \nis why I must oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles from the \nMiami Herald, one on April 24, 1995, and one on February 28, 1995, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Feb. 28, 1995]\n\n            Italian Magazine Ranks Cuba as a Sexual Paradise\n\n       The Italian travel magazine Viaggiare has named Cuba the \n     ``paradise of sexual tourism'' after an informal survey of \n     journalists, travelers and tour operators.\n       Cuba obtained 23 points out of a possible 30, higher than \n     Thailand and Brazil, each of which scored 21 points, and the \n     Dominican Republic, which had 20 points, the magazine said in \n     a special section in its March edition devoted to ``erotic \n     tourism'' worldwide.\n       ``We suggest staying in the cottages of the Hotel Comodoro \n     . . . where it will be much easier to retire in sweet \n     company,'' the magazine says. It also suggests that readers \n     walk along Fifth Street in Varadero beach, ``where you can \n     easily find jineteras, the local prostitutes.''\n       Cuba, which has said tourism will soon surpass sugar \n     exports as its largest source of hard currency, has its \n     largest European clientele in Italy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          Need for Tourists' Dollars Fueling Cuba Prostitution\n\n                          (By Lizette Alvarez)\n\n       The young woman takes a drag on her cigarette and slides \n     off her slippers. The rickety wooden chair she sits on \n     wobbles. A bare light bulb dangles above.\n       ``Some I like, some I don't like,'' she said, a touch of \n     regret frosting her words, ``But I'm not with them for love. \n     I'm with them out of necessity.''\n       In Cuba, prostitution has become a tourist trade like any \n     other, only it pays better. Young women cluster outside the \n     Riviera Hotel, home to a trendy salsa club. They sit in \n     fashionable restaurants. They amble down the Malecon, \n     flagging down tourist cars, advertising their availability \n     with tight ultra-short skirts.\n       The Italian magazine Viaggiare recently raved about Cuba as \n     a sexual playground for tourists. The island--which closely \n     controls the spread of AIDS--ranked first in the magazine's \n     sex-destination survey, surpassing even brothel hot spots \n     like Thailand and Brazil.\n       For a country that took great pride in stomping out \n     prostitution after the 1959 revolution, it's a distinction \n     the government could do without.\n       Vilma Espin, head of the Cuban Federation of Women and \n     estranged wife of Raul Castro, recently railed against \n     prostitutes in Cuba, calling them a ``great embarrassment'' \n     to the country. She blames a shortage of morals, not money, \n     for the booming sex trade, as does her brother-in-law, \n     President Fidel Castro.\n       Her speech, widely publicized in Cuba, did not sit well \n     with the island's women, who skewered Espin for sidestepping \n     reality. One Havana woman argued that prostitution in Cuba \n     today is much more disturbing than it was prior to 1959 \n     because it is more blatant.\n       ``This prostitution did not exist before,'' said the Havana \n     woman. ``You didn't have professionals--engineers, \n     architects--prostituting themselves . . . The revolution has \n     created this. And now Vilma Espin stands on the stage with \n     her Christian Dior dress.''\n       A few days after the speech, the young hooker seated in \n     this two-room apartment smirks at Espin's words. Nobody \n     believes that a morality breakdown is driving Cuba's \n     flourishing prostitution trade, she said.\n       Among most people here there is no rousing condemnation, \n     only an implicit understanding. You do what you must.\n       ``There are other ways to survive in this country,'' she \n     admitted. ``But they are too difficult. And I have my son and \n     my mother to think about.''\n       Prostitutes, who generally work for themselves, are \n     routinely fined by police for ``sexual contact'' and are \n     detained for a spell. But in reality, prostitution is a game, \n     a nod, and a wink and a handshake--between client, hooker, \n     and government workers.\n       Finding a hooker is not difficult. Hookers linger outside \n     hotels and inside expensive restaurants. The clients wine and \n     dine them and the women stay with them during the length of \n     the trip, a week or so. When the men go home, they leave \n     behind $50 or $100.\n       ``Usually you don't ask for money up front,'' the young \n     woman said. ``It's up to them. Sometimes they don't leave you \n     anything.''\n       The whole arrangement is based on a series of bribes. To \n     get a jinetera, as they are dubbed, up to a hotel room, a \n     tourist slips $20 to the guard on duty and another few \n     dollars to the elevator operator, the two people who see \n     everyone's comings and goings.\n       Some prostitutes fear their newfound international \n     notoriety could trigger a crackdown. That is not likely to \n     happen as long as the economic crisis shaking the country \n     persists. Even tourism officials say there is not a lot that \n     can be done.\n       ``We have to find a way so that Cuban women can find other \n     ways to live,'' said Orlando Rangel, a tourism official.\n       But for women along the Malecon that's wistful thinking.\n       ``This isn't ever going to change,'' the prostitute said. \n     ``Since I was 14 I was told it was going to change, but every \n     day the only thing I see more of is need.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will be very brief in response to my \nfriend.\n  I could buy his arguments on assisting with hard cash if there was \nany consistency to our policy. We do not follow that in China. The \nSenator from North Carolina and I agree, we do not like the government \nthat is in charge in China. We do not follow that in North Korea. We \nare in agreement, we do not like the Government of North Korea. You can \nlist a number of nations and, in terms of security, frankly, Cuba is \nless of a long-term threat than China is, for example, in terms of \nsecurity. So I think that argument simply is not valid.\n  The second basic thrust is, somehow we can isolate Castro. That has \nbeen our policy for the last few decades and, obviously, it has not \nworked.\n  I think it makes much more sense to try to open up Cuba and to also \nkeep in mind that, if tomorrow Fidel Castro should die of a heart \nattack or something happen to him, we ought to be preparing the ground \nso the successor government is a free government, is a democracy. That \nis in our interest. That is in the interest of the people of Cuba.\n\n  Under the present law, theoretically--I say theoretically because any \nAmerican who wants to get around this can do it very easily by giving \nsome money to a Mexican airline or a Canadian airline, and a great many \nother countries. But you cannot travel directly from the United States \nto there, and people who have relatives cannot visit the relatives. And \nhuman rights organizations, like Amnesty International, which would go \nthere and be critical of the Castro record on human rights--which is \nnot a good record--are not permitted to do so.\n  I think we would be much better off if we said to Americans that--\nunless you have a physical threat--Americans can travel wherever they \nwant so that we do not have to follow some Government line in terms of \nhow we get information. I think it is a basic freedom that we ought to \nhave as Americans.\n  I hope the amendment can be adopted. I do not want to prolong this. I \nknow the Finance Committee wants to meet. I yield to my friend from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, again, every time I get into a debate with \nPaul Simon it is like a fraternity meeting. We are such close personal \nfriends even though we frequently disagree.\n  I say to the Senator that the policy against Cuba is working. Castro \nis on the ropes. And he wants the hard currency that tourism brings in \nbecause that will give him a few more days, and a few more weeks, or \nwhatever. As far as a heart attack that he may have, I will not say \nthat I want anybody to have a heart attack. But I want him to get off \nthe backs of the Cuban people as quickly as possible, and I know the \nSenator from Illinois does, too.\n  The infusion of hard currency is the only thing that is going to save \nCastro \n\n[[Page S 15287]]\nnow. He needs that money, and that is the reason he is selling off real \nestate which does not belong to Castro's government any more than that \ntable does. But he is selling this property off nevertheless. He is \nfrantic to get hard currency. That is the reason he wants very much to \nhave the tourism.\n  And the proximity of Cuba--how many times have we said this Communist \ncountry is 90 miles off our shore? That is precisely the point. You \ncannot make a case about China and North Korea because they are so far \naway that the number of United States tourists are relatively minimal \nbecause many Americans cannot afford to travel there.\n  I say to the Senator with all due respect that I just cannot agree \nwith the amendment. That is my last word.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, believe it or not, I will take just 1 more \nminute. When you say Castro is on his last ropes, I heard that 5 years \nago. I heard that 10 years ago. I heard that 15 years ago. I heard it \n20 years ago, and so forth.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator. I have already violated my last word \nstipulation. But back then they had an infusion of cash from the Soviet \nUnion which no longer exists.\n  Mr. SIMON. That is true. But today they have an infusion of British, \nFrench, and other investments that they did not have then.\n  Let me just say--because the Senator mentioned North Korea--that the \nplace in the world today where you have more troops facing each other \nacross a border where there is no contact with the other side is Korea. \nI do not remember the number, but I think we have about 140,000 troops \nin South Korea; American troops. I think you could use the argument we \nshould not be propping this Government that might be a threat to \nAmerican troops. But we do not, and we believe--and I think this is \ncorrect--maybe we can have an influence on that Government of North \nKorea which, believe it or not, is even harsher than the government of \nCastro.\n  But I respect my colleague from North Carolina. This is an area where \nwe simply have a disagreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote on the \nSimon amendment tomorrow there be 20 minutes equally divided between \nthe two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say that the Senate will recess shortly--within 5 \nminutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15284-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15287-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15287-S15288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SAMMY HOWARD, MAYOR OF PHENIX CITY, ALABAMA\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Sammy Howard \nfor his recent election as the new mayor of Phenix City, Alabama, a \nvibrant community in the east-central part of the State. Still widely \ncalled ``Coach'' Howard since he was a high school football coach for \nso many years, Sammy most recently was a highly successful banker in \nPhenix City. As a coach, he led his teams to 113 victories out of a \ntotal of 140 games.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an article which appeared in \nthe Columbus, GA, Ledger-Enquirer on the life and career of Sammy \nHoward be printed in the Record after my remarks. It tells about his \nodyssey from student athlete to coach to banker to mayor.\n  I wish ``Coach'' Howard all the best as he takes over the reins of \ngovernment in Phenix City.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Columbus (GA), Ledger-Enquirer, Sept. 11, 1995]\n\n              Phenix City Mayor-Elect Not in Game for Self\n\n                           (By Richard Hyatt)\n\n       Nina Jo Keel had her rules. You made a speech in class or \n     you failed. But there was something about that shy kid who \n     nervously told her he would have to take an ``F,'' that he \n     couldn't get up in front of his friends and do that. Bending \n     her own rule, she let him make his speech in private so he \n     could escape with a ``D.''\n       Forty years after she taught speech at Central High School, \n     she would watch the 6 o'clock news and mentally get out her \n     red pencil. Her health wasn't good and the boys she taught \n     had turned into men, but in her heart, they were still her \n     students and she was still their teacher. That's why she \n     picked up the telephone and called that 10th-grader who had \n     become a successful Phenix City banker.\n       ``She finally taught me how to say amphitheater,'' Sammy \n     Howard said.\n       She died several months ago, so Nina Jo Keel never got to \n     see that frightened high school kid become Mayor-elect of \n     Phenix City. He couldn't make a speech in class, but next \n     month he will become the spokesman for the community in which \n     he grew up.\n       Never did anyone forecast that Curtis Samuel Howard Jr. \n     would ever be called mayor. He was a football player, then a \n     coach, and in a universe the size of Phenix City, there are \n     no higher callings. It's been 17 years since he blew a \n     whistle or covered a blackboard in X's and O's and yet he \n     can't escape the game that paid for his education.\n       ``Some people still look at me as coach,'' Howard said. ``I \n     saw a former player in the bank the other day and he called \n     me Coach Howard. They don't call me mister and they can't \n     bring themselves to call me Sammy. I'll always be the \n     coach.''\n       The traits of a player and coach are as close to him as \n     debits and credits. He has used them to build a banking \n     career and he talks about the need for teamwork in making the \n     city operate effectively. There are a few football trappings \n     in his office, including a mint-condition ticket to the 1951 \n     Auburn-Alabama game, the season the two schools renewed their \n     rivalry.\n       Growing up, some of those traits were not so attractive.\n       ``I've always been driven by a desire to win,'' Howard \n     said. ``That almost got me barred from Little League. I'd get \n     mad at the other kids if they made an error. Chuck Roberts, \n     with the Housing Authority, was my coach. He talked to me and \n     said I couldn't chase the other players around the field when \n     I got mad.''\n       Red Howard, his late father, was also a competitor. In \n     1919, he scored Auburn's only touchdown in a victory over \n     Georgia. He was the manager of the Frederick Douglas housing \n     complex in Phenix City. He also had a temper.\n       ``Sammy and I were double-dating one time and we borrowed \n     Mr. Howard's 1953 Pontiac couple. We had a flat tire and we \n     jacked up the fender instead of the bumper. Mr. Howard had \n     some choice words for us,'' said Pat Thornton, a Central High \n     classmate who is plant manager of Brumlow Mills in Calhoun, \n     Ga.\n       The Howard family lived on Dillingham Street, not far from \n     the bridge into Columbus and not far from many of the \n     gambling joints that--like it or not--are so much a part of \n     the community's history.\n       ``We were just a few blocks away, but you know, we never \n     felt scared. We never even locked our doors,'' Howard said.\n       But when he started playing football, he soon learned that \n     being from Phenix City was a stigma in the eyes of God-\n     fearing people who had heard the Sin City reputation.\n       ``This is still an issue. This problem won't go away in my \n     lifetime. We still have that reputation,'' Howard said.\n       The Central team he played on was a talented group. They \n     went 6-1-3, including a victory over Sidney Lanier, ending \n     that Montgomery school's 19-game victory streak. Howard ran \n     back a kickoff 95 yards. But his classmates talk about one he \n     didn't score. That one came with 20 seconds to play against \n     Columbus High. Central was seeking a third straight Bi-City \n     championship. Howard had scored twice and apparently scored a \n     third touchdown that would have meant a victory.\n       It was called back because of a penalty.\n       ``It was better to complain about the call because if you \n     admitted the call was right people would want to know who was \n     guilty. They would have run him out of town,'' Howard said.\n       He was captain of the football team, vice president of the \n     senior class and an All-Bi-City player. He was even voted the \n     cutest male graduate. Only he wasn't cute enough to get a \n     college football scholarship.\n       ``Bill Bush and I went 400 miles for a tryout at Southwest \n     Mississippi Junior College in Summit, Mississippi. We had to \n     make it. We didn't have the money to get back home,'' he \n     said.\n       In his second year, he was an All-American halfback on a \n     team that was undefeated. He even married the homecoming \n     queen.\n       Those two years were important to Howard. He was away from \n     home. He found there was more to life than football. That was \n     a painful lesson. He had to overcome two concussions and a \n     broken nose his first year in Mississippi.\n       His play grabbed the attention of major college coaches. \n     Even though he had grown up as one of the few confessed \n     Auburn fans in \n\n[[Page S 15288]]\n     Phenix City, a few minutes alone with Bear Bryant changed all that. At \n     Alabama, his injuries continued to mount so he played very \n     little. Three decades later, he is reminded of those \n     injuries.\n       ``I had my neck operated on a few years ago and the surgeon \n     said I had either been in a bad car wreck or else I got one \n     lick too many playing football.''\n       Coaches and teachers had played an important role in his \n     life, so he decided to become a high school coach. Red \n     Jenkins, his junior college coach, had become head coach in \n     Yazoo City, Miss., and he offered Howard a job as a junior \n     high coach.\n       His career almost ended after a single game.\n       His team played a terrible first half and he took them to \n     the end zone where he pitched a fit, throwing his clipboard \n     and using locker room language, with the heat of his tirade \n     directed at a single player.\n       The next day he was summoned to the superintendent's office \n     and when he arrived the room was filled with a number of \n     proper ladies. They were horrified at his behavior. He was in \n     trouble until the superintendent asked the only woman who \n     hadn't spoken what she thought.\n       ``What did you say to that boy?'' she asked the young coach \n     who didn't want to repeat his words.\n       ``I said something I shouldn't,'' he said.\n       ``What did you say?'' she said again.\n       He sheepishly repeated the word.\n       ``That's exactly what I would have called him,'' she said.\n       The woman was Mrs. Jerry Clower. Her husband was a \n     fertilizer salesman then. Their son was a football player \n     like his dad, who had played at Mississippi State. They were \n     staunch Baptists and became staunch friends to Howard, who \n     two years later became head coach.\n       Clower, a member of the Grand Ole Opry, is now a legendary \n     comedian who gets paid for telling the stories he has always \n     told.\n       ``I thank my God for every rememberance of Sammy Howard. In \n     1969, he took 30 little boys and won a state championship. \n     They played against teams from Jackson that would dress out \n     100 players and they won every game,'' Clower said.\n       Clower, who offered the pre-game prayer before every game, \n     talked about Howard's decency and how he was real, not a \n     phony. It was a difficult time in Yazoo City. During \n     Christmas break, federal judges ruled that after the holiday \n     they would be only one school in town. Desegregation came \n     abruptly.\n       One of the students who came from the black school was Mike \n     Espy, who became a congressman from Mississippi and, most \n     recently, Secretary of Agriculture. He was president of the \n     student body at his school and the adults were quibbling over \n     who would be president at the new school.\n       ``I was impressed,'' Howard said. ``He said he thought the \n     white student ought to be president--as long as they promised \n     that the following year a black student would have the job.''\n       Clower was impressed with Howard.\n       ``My son played every minute under Sammy Howard. He so \n     loved him that he wanted to be a coach like Sammy Howard. \n     Right now, he is coaching in Gulfport, Mississippi,'' Clower \n     said.\n       Wanting a challenge and wanting to be nearer home after the \n     death of his father, Howard became football coach at Hardaway \n     High in Columbus, a program that the previous year did not \n     produce a single victory. He made progress, but in three \n     years took a different challenge.\n       In 1973, he moved home to Phenix City, becoming head coach \n     at Glenwood School, at the time a fast-growing private \n     school. He was there five years. He became principal as well \n     as coach and in his final year won a state title. He left \n     coaching with 113 victories in 140 games.\n       He joined F Bank as a trainee in 1978 and in two years \n     was made president. Through evolution, that bank became part \n     of the Synovus family and Howard its president. Jimmy Yancey, \n     former president of CB in Columbus, is now his boss at \n     Synovus. Yancey said it isn't unusual for someone with a \n     coaching background to be successful as a banker.\n       ``It obviously has to do with leadership and Sammy showed \n     that as a high school coach. He gets along with people and he \n     deals with people. Those things are more important than a \n     technical knowledge of banking. He inspires people to rally \n     around him and Phenix City is fortunate that he wanted to be \n     its mayor,'' Yancey said.\n       Howard was among a group of leaders shopping for a \n     candidate. Everybody said no. Finally, Jerry Holly, a rival \n     banker, turned to Howard and asked why he didn't run.\n       Judy Howard was one reason. She had been the wife of a \n     coach, so she had sat in the stands and heard her husband \n     ridiculed and criticized. As the wife of a mayor, she would \n     face similar taunts. So will Howard.\n       ``The mayor is the most visible of any elected official. \n     You're always there. I'm going to the Central game and I'll \n     bet 20 people will ask me about being mayor. Coaching \n     prepares you for this,'' he said.\n       Forty-seven of his 56 years have been spent in this \n     community, so he thinks he knows its needs. He talks about \n     the need to bridge the gap between north and south Phenix \n     City and he has set three goals:\n       To improve the appearance of downtown Phenix City.\n       To improve the city's infrastructure, such as roads and \n     sewers.\n       To narrow the scope on what kind of industry the community \n     will seek.\n       These things are challenges.\n       ``We are a city of 30,000 with the tax base of a town of \n     15,000,'' he said. ``If we were a city sitting alone like \n     Eufaula it would be different. But we aren't. Our people do \n     so much of their shopping in Columbus.''\n       Working for a Columbus organization, he believes the \n     friction between the two towns is vanishing. ``The problem \n     isn't between the cities, it's between the states,'' he said.\n       Howard said yes to becoming major--no one ran against him--\n     because of the needs in the business community and because of \n     the life this city has given him.\n       ``That sound like the politically correct thing to say but \n     I mean it,'' he said. ``I didn't need this job. I didn't need \n     the recognition. I've had more of that than I deserve in a \n     lifetime. I won't be out there for myself. I'll be out there \n     for Phenix City.''\n       Just like a coach who wants to win.\n       ``I see that as a plus in being mayor because we will be in \n     a quest for a championship. I guess if I ever lose that \n     desire it'll be time to quit.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15287-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15288-S15289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HAL SELF SELECTED FOR ALABAMA SPORTS HALL OF FAME\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Hal Self, who \nwas recently selected as one of the 6 new inductees into the Alabama \nSports Hall of Fame for 1996. He was an outstanding football player at \nthe University of Alabama and later revived the football program at \nFlorence State College, now the University of North Alabama. Due to his \nleadership and dedication, football at North Alabama has emerged as one \nof the very best small college programs in the entire nation, having \nclaimed the national championship in 1993 and 1994.\n  Sports has always run through the veins of Hal Self. He was a \nstandout in football, basketball, and baseball at Decatur High School \nbefore entering the University of Alabama in 1941. He quarterbacked the \nCrimson Tide teams in 1941, 1942, 1944, and 1945, leading his troops to \nall four of the major post-season bowls at that time--Cotton, Orange, \nSugar, and Rose.\n  He went into coaching after college, serving for 2 years at Athens \nHigh, where he went 15-5. In 1949, he began restoring the football \nprogram at Florence State and coached there for 21 years, compiling a \n110-81-8 record, often playing against much larger schools with older \nand more established programs.\n  In 1969, he gave up coaching for the athletic director's post, \nserving there for 2 years. He stayed on as a full professor in the \nUniversity of North Alabama physical education department until he \nretired in 1984.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a recent article on Hal Self \nappearing in the Huntsville Times be printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Hal Self Gets Top Sports Honor\n\n                            (By John Pruett)\n\n       Hal Self, who grew up in Decatur, went on to football fame \n     at the University of Alabama and later resurrected the \n     football program at Florence State College, has been selected \n     as one of the six new members of the 1996 class of the \n     Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\n       Self joins a six-man group that includes former Auburn \n     football star Bo Jackson, the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner; \n     former Alabama, basketball player Leon Douglas; former Auburn \n     Olympian Harvey Glance, now Auburn's head track coach; former \n     Alabama High School Athletic Association executive director \n     Herman ``Bubba'' Scott; and Jacksonville State's former one-\n     armed football star, Jodie Connell.\n       Self and the others will be inducted into the ASHOF on \n     Saturday, Feb. 24, at the Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center.\n       ``This, in my opinion, is the ultimate honor for anyone who \n     was ever involved in sports in the state of Alabama,'' Self \n     told The Huntsville Times over the weekend from his home in \n     Florence, where he lives in retirement. ``I'm deeply honored \n     and humbled by the whole thing. What it does is put you up \n     there with the best.''\n       Self grew up as a football, basketball and baseball star at \n     Decatur High School, where he played for legendary coach \n     Shorty Ogle. He was the quarterback in Ogle's Notre Dame Box, \n     the same offense that Self found when he went to Alabama on a \n     football scholarship in 1941.\n       Self had several other scholarship offers and almost went \n     to Howard College, but was persuaded to attend Alabama by \n     Crimson Tide assistant coach Paul Burnham.\n       ``Alabama had a whale of a football team when I got down \n     there,'' Self said. ``The morale was great and Coach Frank \n     Thomas was \n\n[[Page S 15289]]\n     in his prime. We had some terrific players, guys like Holt Rast at end \n     and Taterhead Nelson at tailback, both All-Americans.''\n       Self played on the freshman team in 1941 and was redshirted \n     the following season. Alabama did not have a football team in \n     1943 because of World War II, but Self was a starter in 1944 \n     and became one of the top players in the Southeastern \n     Conference in 1945, when he won the coveted Jacobs Blocking \n     Trophy.\n       He played in Alabama's 29-26 loss to Duke in the Jan. 1, \n     1945 Sugar Bowl and scored two touchdowns in the Tide's last \n     Rose Bowl appearance, a 34-14 romp over Southern California \n     in 1946. Self scored two touchdowns against the Trojans in \n     the final college game.\n       ``Those were two games to remember,'' Self said, \n     ``Grantland Rice called the Duke game `the greatest bowl game \n     ever played.' The Rose Bowl was of those special memories. \n     Nobody gave us a chance, but it was never a game, really. \n     Harry Gilmer just went to work and they couldn't handle him. \n     We finally cleared the bench. Late in the game, Coach Thomas \n     turned to Nick Terlizzi, who had a cast on his leg, and said, \n     `Nick, you want to tell your kids some day that you played in \n     the Rose Bowl?' Nick said sure, and he went limping into the \n     game, wearing that cast.''\n       At 24, Self was hired as head coach at Athens High School, \n     where he compiled a 15-5 record. Two years later, Florence \n     State president Ed Norton hired Self to take over the long-\n     dormant athletic program at what would later become the \n     University of North Alabama. For the next 21 years, Self and \n     his lone assistant, George ``Bull'' Weeks, built a first-rate \n     small college football program with limited scholarship \n     funds. The Lions were 110-81-8 during the Self regime, which \n     ended in 1969 when he stepped down to become the school's \n     athletic director.\n       Self moved into the UNA physical education department two \n     years later and stayed on as a full professor until his \n     retirement in 1984.\n       ``The thing I treasure most about my years at Florence is \n     that in 21 years, we never had a player who participated for \n     four years that didn't get a degree to go with it,'' Self \n     said. ``That, and the fact that we had more than 100 of our \n     boys who went on to become coaches.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15288-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES M. JONES\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and congratulate \nJames M. Jones, who recently retired from his position as the clerk of \ncourt for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Alabama. \nMr. Jones served with the bankruptcy court for nearly 30 years, from \nSeptember 1966 through his retirement effective September 1 of this \nyear.\n  James began his career as an insurance manager in 1954. After 12 \nyears in the field, he found his true calling as a member of the \njudicial staff of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, eventually rising to \nbecome clerk of the court for the middle district. He served there for \n16 years with distinction, dedication, and consummate professionalism. \nHe was an active member of the National Conference of Bankruptcy Clerks \n[NCBC], assisting in the incorporation of the organization and in the \nwriting of its original bylaws. He later chaired and served on numerous \ncommittees of NCBC, and has been a featured speaker at numerous \norganizational meetings and seminars on the issue of bankruptcy.\n  James Jones was born June 30, 1930 in Morgan County, AL to James D. \nand Dora Kilpatrick Jones. In 1950, he married Janene Hocutt, with whom \nhe had four children--Sharon, Steve, Craig, and Lyn. He was educated at \nAuburn University and Jones Law School in Montgomery. He served in the \nU.S. Army during the Korean war, and represented the First Army as an \nobserver to the second atomic bomb test at Yucca Flat, NV in 1951.\n  I extend my very best to James and his family as he embarks on his \nwell-deserved retirement. I hope it is as long, healthy, and productive \nas his career has been.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15289-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. TOM VAUGHAN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to commend \nand congratulate Dr. John Thomas ``Tom'' Vaughan, who retired from his \nposition as dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Auburn \nUniversity last month. The fifth dean in the history of veterinary \nmedicine at Auburn, he served from June 1977 until September 1995.\n  A Tuskegee, AL, native, Dr. Vaughan graduated with honors from \nAuburn's College of Veterinary Medicine in 1955. His affiliation with \nthe field of veterinary medicine as a student, faculty member, \ndepartment chair, and dean spanned an incredible 42 years.\n  As dean, Dr. Vaughan successfully led the college through numerous \nchallenges. Despite major fiscal limitations, his leadership inspired \ndynamic instructional changes which made Auburn an internationally \nrecognized institution in animal welfare and computerized teaching. He \nstimulated plans for curriculum alterations to coincide with the \nchanges inherent to the field. As chairperson of the Auburn University \nCore Curriculum Commission, his was a pivotal voice in initiatives \nwhich led to the school's enhanced overall academic reputation.\n  Dr. Vaughan's strategic vision including the expansion of career \nopportunities for veterinarians in clinical practice, corporate \nenterprises, research projects, and in government agencies. He was \ncommitted to the Extension Service, agribusiness, and public health. \nHis work has benefitted the public greatly through improvements in the \nfood animal industry, research on diseases and pathology common to \nanimals and people, expansion of graduate programs, and the training of \nquality veterinarians from all segments of society.\n  Dr. Vaughan served in several capacities on behalf of the National \nAssociation of State Universities and Land-grant Colleges. He chaired \nits Commission on Veterinary Medicine and served on its Commission on \nFood, Environment, and Renewable Resources. He is a former president of \nboth the American College of Veterinary Surgeons and the American \nAssociation of Equine Practitioners.\n  He authored a total of 22 chapters in various veterinary textbooks, \nwrote numerous professional journal articles, and coauthored two books. \nHe was selected as the Alabama Veterinary Medical Association's \nVeterinarian of the Year in 1985. Just last year, he received the \nDistinguished Service Award from the prestigious Tennessee Walking \nHorse Breeders and Exhibitors' Association. At Auburn University, Dr. \nVaughan was an enthusiastic member of the John and Mary Franklin \nFoundation Lectures Committee and also a member of the University \nSenate.\n  Dr. Tom Vaughan's outstanding leadership and total dedication to his \nfield have contributed directly in innumerable ways to the \ndistinguished service of many graduates of Auburn's veterinary school, \none of the oldest in the nation. He has established benchmarks of \nservice and excellence that will inspire and sustain his colleagues, as \nwell as challenge the profession for many years into the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15289-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15289-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15289-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15289-S15290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 629.

A bill to make available without fiscal year limitation the \noffsetting collections of the Federal Communications Commission for \nelectromagnetic spectrum auctions; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n      the spectrum auction offsetting collection availability act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Spectrum \nAuction Offsetting Collection Availability Act. This bill is simple and \nwould save a fiscal problem currently being faced by the Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC].\n  The FCC currently must expend funds in order to conduct spectrum \nauctions. When such auctions occur, the Commission is authorized to \nretain from the auction proceeds to offset the overhead costs of \nconducting the auction. This plan is logical and clearly benefits all \nconcerned--especially the taxpayers.\n  However, it has been brought to my attention that when an auction is \nconducted late in the fiscal year, and the revenues come in too late to \nbe expended during that fiscal year, the Commission does not have the \nauthority to use the funds collected. This creates an unintentional \nmonetary crisis at the collected. This creates an unintentional \nmonetary crisis at the FCC. Clearly, the FCC should be able to keep \nthis money for more than 1 year in order to support spectrum auctions.\n  Currently there is much debate as to whether we should cut the FCC's \nfunding or not. That is a debate for another \n\n[[Page S 15291]]\nday and quick passage of this bill should not be interpreted by any as \nan indication as to a Member's view on overall FCC funding levels. This \nbill simply allows the FCC to continue to conduct its auctions in a \nmanner that does not require the use of appropriated funds.\n  Similar language has already been added to both H.R. 1869, the FCC \nAuthorization Act of 1995 and the proposed House Reconciliation bill. \nIt is not controversial and makes common sense.\n  I would hope that it would be passed by the Senate in the very near \nfuture or that it could be added to the first appropriate legislative \nvehicle moving on the Senate floor. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spectrum Auction Offsetting \n     Collection Availability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FROM SPECTRUM AUCTIONS.\n\n       Section 309(j)(8)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 309(j)(8)(B)) is amended by inserting after the second \n     sentence the following new sentence: ``Such offsetting \n     collections shall remain available until expended.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1331. A bill to adjust and make uniform the dollar amounts used in \ntitle 18 to distinguish between grades of offenses, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    TITLE 18 UNIFORMITY ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Title 18 \nUniformity Act of 1995 and urge my colleagues' support for this bill.\n  This bill makes technical adjustments to make uniform the dollar \namounts used in title 18 to distinguish between grades of offenses.\n  This bill raises the dollar threshold that triggers more severe \npunishment of certain unlawful acts. This change allows the punishment \nto better fit the crime by raising the threshold to a reasonable level \nbefore the extended imprisonment option becomes effective. This bill \nfurthers our interest in applying equal justice and better utilization \nof incarceration space. I urge its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1333. A bill to clarify the application of certain Federal \ncriminal laws to territories, possessions, and commonwealths, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n THE POSSESSIONS AND TERRITORIES CRIMINAL LAW CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Possessions \nand Territories Criminal Law Clarification Act.\n  This law, which is purely technical in nature, is needed to clarify \nan ambiguity in a number of Federal statutes as to their coverage of \ncrimes occurring in the territories, possessions, and commonwealths of \nthe United States. This ambiguity arises because these statutes contain \nreferences to State law, without any indication of whether they are to \nbe applied to territories or other entities which are not States.\n  My bill would clarify that these ambiguous Federal criminal statutes \napply to the territories, possessions, and commonwealths of the United \nStates, as well as to the 50 States. I ask my colleagues to support \nthis legislation, and urge its swift approval.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1333. A bill to provide for a reduction of sentence for providing \nuseful investigative information, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the substantial assistance clarification amendment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Substantial \nAssistance Clarification Amendment Act of 1995. This amendment to \nFederal sentencing procedures clarifies the procedures by which the \nGovernment may move that the court sentence a defendant below a \nstatutory minimum sentence based on the defendant's cooperation with \nthe Government.\n  My bill removes the requirement that a substantial assistance \nreduction be based on information relating to a particular person being \ninvestigated or prosecuted. Instead, under my bill, such a reduction \ncould be given in exchange for substantial assistance in the \ninvestigation or prosecution of any offense, even if the defendant is \nunaware of the specific person or persons involved.\n  My bill will assist Federal prosecutors in their task of bringing \ncriminals to justice by giving them additional leverage with which to \nuncover needed evidence. It will also provide incentives to defendants \nto come clean, and mitigate their crimes by cooperating with the \nprosecution.\n  This bill does nothing to lessen the punishment for truly culpable \ndefendants who deserve the full measure of punishment the law provides. \nIt simply strengthens a tool in the prosecution's toolbox. It furthers \nthe interests of justice, and I urge its passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 1334. A bill to amend chapter 28 of title 35, United States Code, \nto provide for noninfringing uses of patents on medical and surgical \nprocedures; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the medical procedures innovation and affordability act\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will address what I believe is a growing problem in \nthe medical community. It may come as a surprise to my colleagues in \nthe Senate, to health care consumers, and even to some physicians, that \nthe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issues patents for purely medical \nprocedures.\n\n  Most physicians are unaware that patents can be issued for medical \nprocedures, and even if they were, few would seek to limit the ability \nof other physicians to use the most up-to-date and effective procedures \nin providing health care. Yet, an alarming trend of obtaining and \nenforcing medical procedure patents is on the rise in the medical \ncommunity, and I strongly believe that a legislative solution is \nnecessary.\n  Mr. President, for most of our history, advancements in medical \nprocedures, independent of a new medical device or pharmaceutical, were \nnot considered patentable. In 1954, the Patent Office reversed its \nprior rulings and issued a decision which has been interpreted to \nprovide broad authority for the issuance of medical method patents. The \nincreasing incidence of the issuance of these patents is in conflict \nwith broader health policy goals.\n  Mr. President, advances in health care are encouraged and fostered in \nan atmosphere where professionals share their research and publish the \nresults of their work. Physician specialties conduct annual meetings to \ndiscuss the latest techniques, and important discoveries are published \nand subject to the critical peer review process. There is simply an \nelement of unfairness if doctors are allowed to claim ownership of \nprocedures which were developed based on years of cooperative clinical \nexperience and research.\n  A recent lawsuit, and increasing demand for the payment of royalties \non patented medical procedures, has caused a growing concern that the \nissuance of medical method patents will increase the cost of health \ncare, and quite possibly, keep physicians from providing the best \ntreatment available. For example, in 1993, Dr. Samuel Pallin, an \nArizona ophthalmic surgeon, sued Dr. Jack Singer, a Dartmouth Medical \nSchool professor of ophthalmology, for patent infringement involving a \ntechnique for stitchless cataract surgery. Dr. Pallin sought a patent \non the technique, even though many ophthalmic surgeons, including \nDartmouth's Dr. Singer, were using this technique before Dr. Pallin \nsought his patent.\n  And this is not an isolated example. Medical method patents issued in \nrecent months include patents relating to implanting a knee prosthesis, \nclosing an incision in muscle tissue, calculating the risk of coronary \nheart disease, using donor plasma for ear infections, diagnosing \nAlzheimer's disease, treating rheumatoid arthritis, performing laser \nsurgery without damaging nearby tissue, treating bone disorders, \ntreating aneurysms, and the list goes on and on. Obviously, doctors and \nothers have begun to realize that if the practice of granting and \nenforcing medical method patents continues to spiral, they must protect \nthemselves \n\n[[Page S 15292]]\nby seeking patents on procedures they use. That prospect is \nfrightening.\n  Mr. President, the practice of enforcing medical patents against \nphysicians and other health care providers has profoundly negative \nimplications for the entire health care field. And that is why I am \nintroducing legislation that would provide an exception from the \ndefinition of patent infringement for medical and surgical procedures. \nWith this approach, physicians and others will still be entitled to \nseek and obtain a medical method patent, but there will be no \ninfringement if the procedure is used by other physicians or other \nlicensed health care practitioners. And because the legislation does \nnot impose a ban on the issuance of medical method patents, there \nshould be no concern that the legislation would prohibit biotechnology \ncompanies from enforcing their patent rights against commercial users \nwith respect to any patentable advancements in areas such as gene \ntherapy, cell therapy, or with respect to new uses for well-known \ndrugs. Additionally, Mr. President, there is an explicit exemption for \nthe commercial manufacture of drugs, medical devices and any other \nproducts regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which should \nalso provide substantial protection for the biotechnology industry.\n  Mr. President, more than 80 nations, including Japan, Germany, Great \nBritain, and France, prohibit the issuance of medical method patents. \nIncreased enforcement of medical method patents will increase health \ncare costs, limit access to quality health care, and ultimately put \npatient privacy at risk. The legislation I am introducing will limit \nthe enforcement of medical method patents against physicians, while \npreserving the rights of the biotechnology industry. I believe this \nlegislation is both balanced and necessary, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15290-7", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. McConnell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 881, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify provisions relating to church \npension benefit plans, to modify certain provisions relating to \nparticipants in such plans, to reduce the complexity of and to bring \nworkable consistency to the applicable rules, to promote retirement \nsavings and benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 942\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bond, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 942, a bill to promote \nincreased understanding of Federal regulations and increased voluntary \ncompliance with such regulations by small entities, to provide for the \ndesignation of regional ombudsmen and oversight boards to monitor the \nenforcement practices of certain Federal agencies with respect to small \nbusiness concerns, to provide relief from excessive and arbitary \nregulatory enforcement actions against small entities, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the names of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Thurmond], the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], \nand the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] were added as cosponsors of S. \n949, a bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in \ncommemoration of the 200th anniversary of the death of George \nWashington.\n\n\n                                S. 1027\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from Arizona \n[Mr. Kyl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1027, a bill to eliminate the \nquota and price support programs for peanuts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nKentucky [Mr. Ford] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1028, a bill to \nprovide increased access to health care benefits, to provide increased \nportability of health care benefits, to provide increased security of \nhealth care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of individuals \nand small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15292-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n   THE CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 2938\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HELMS submitted an amendment intended to proposed by him to \namendment No. 2898 proposed by Mr. Dole to the bill (H.R. 927) to seek \ninternational sanctions against the Castro government in Cuba, to plan \nfor support of a transition government leading to a democratically \nelected government in Cuba, and for other purposes;

Mr. President, I rise to invite the attention \nof the Senate to an article in the October 2 edition of the Washington \nTimes entitled ``Abdicating on the Case for the Endowments.'' The \nauthor is Leonard Garment, a Washington lawyer who has followed the \nissue of Federal funding of the arts and humanities since he worked as \nWhite House counsel to President Richard Nixon.\n  ``That soft gurgling you hear,'' writes Mr. Garment, ``is the sound \nof the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities being slowly \nstrangled to death.''\n  In the article, Mr. Garment lists the abuses of the public trust \nthat, in his words, ``denigrate the values of millions of taxpaying \nAmericans.'' The notorious Andres Serrano project. The panels that \njudge projects by ideological litmus tests and fund the politically \ncorrect. The wheelbarrows full of money dumped into frivolous whimsies.\n  He concludes that the solution is not to throw the baby out with the \nbathwater--to risk weakening America's cultural treasures because of \nthese abuses. Rather, he advocates a clean break with the past. He \nwould disassemble and rebuild them from the ground up.\n  ``Such reforms,'' he writes ``are not only possible but already on \nthe congressional table--in the form of a bill, jointly introduced by \nSenators Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Robert Bennett of Utah, that \naddresses every one of these issues.''\n  I am gratified that a man of Mr. Garment's stature and experience \nsupports our bill. I recommend this excellent article to my colleagues, \nand I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 2, 1995]\n\n               Abdicating on the Case for the Endowments\n\n                          (By Leonard Garment)\n\n       That soft gurgling you hear is the sound of the National \n     Endowments for the Arts and Humanities being slowly strangled \n     to death. The House of Representatives has voted to fund the \n     endowments at drastically reduced levels and take them out \n     entirely in two years. The Senate, while not imposing a \n     similar deadline, has also slashed the endowments' money.\n       Yet most fans of the endowments are walking around with \n     ``What, me worry?'' smiles on their faces. Since they \n     survived, they think their arguments worked and that they can \n     just keep making these arguments again and again until their \n     opponents' fervor cools. Then it will be business as usual.\n       I fear the endowment enthusiast overestimate the stamina of \n     their friends and underestimate the resentment of their \n     adversaries, in Congress and out. The editorial stalwarts at \n     The Washington Post, for example seem to have quietly tiptoed \n     out of the current debate, leaving it to Jonathan Yardley, \n     The Post's senior book reviewer and distinguished social \n     commentator--a man with cast-iron convictions, by the way--to \n     call for an end to the Endowments (Aug. 28, Sept. 10, Sept. \n     25). During this barrage, the Post gave ``Taking Exception'' \n     time to a wearily hackneyed defense of the humanities \n     endowment by one of its senior officials (Sept. 19). Jane \n     Alexander, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, \n     the lead horse of the cultural troika, appears to have taken \n     a sabbatical powder from public advocacy, apparently content \n     to let matters rock along without risking a misstep that \n     might upset the congressional stay of execution.\n       The national endowments are making a miserable mistake in \n     thus defaulting on the attacks against them, letting the \n     once-splendid arts and humanities enterprise fade slowly into \n     history with little more than befuddled whimpers of support. \n     This is a pity, since every legitimate objection made by \n     those who want to pull the plug on the endowments can be \n     answered. What has been missing, as usual, is the creative \n     intelligence and the legislative will necessary to do so.\n       After 30 years of reasonably close observation of the \n     spasms of congressional support and hostility toward the \n     endowments, it seems to me that the current mixture of \n     indifference and resentment, reflecting the powerful \n     conservative political tide, involves five major categories \n     of complaint. First, it is said that the endowments have \n     supported artistic and humanities projects that denigrate the \n     values of millions of taxpaying Americans. Robert \n     Mapplethorpe, Andres Serrano, Annie Sprinkle and Her \n     Magnificent Speculum, blah, blah, blah. All true. However \n     these unpleasant projects came to be funded, the relevant \n     fact is that they should not have been. But the chance of \n     such mistakes in the future can be reduced to near-zero if \n     the endowments are prohibited from awarding grants, subgrants \n     or fellowships to individuals. These personal subventions \n     have been the main instruments of the corrosive damage \n     inflicted on the endowments.\n       Next, the endowments are called mutual back-scratching \n     societies that use their hundreds of so-called ``peer \n     panels'' to support highly personal and ideological \n     judgements about art and scholarship. True again. But this \n     need not be if we eliminate the large array of narrow and \n     manipulable peer panels and create a small number of cross-\n     disciplinary advisory groups, less vulnerable to parochialism \n     and conflict of interest, to advise the endowment leadership \n     on the distribution of endowment resources. The arts and \n     humanities are too important to be left to artists and \n     humanities--who are intensely concerned, and understandably \n     so, with self-expression, not with safeguarding cultural \n     institutions from political harm. Individual grants and \n     fellowships are a fine idea but quintessentially the business \n     of private foundations and corporate or individual donors. \n     And I refuse to believe that an artist or scholar who has \n     something important to say will pack up his palette or PC if \n     he or she is not paid in advance. Just try making the \n     argument for the necessity of individual grants to the hordes \n     of young writers, painters and musicians who work \n     without complaint at part-time jobs to support their \n     particular muses.\n       Third, critics contend that the endowments are used by \n     federal arts bureaucracies as instruments for their own \n     private agendas. Also true. To the extent that the law \n     permits, we should clear out these long-timers--who think \n     they, not the taxpayers, own the endowments. We should make \n     the rest accountable to a council subject to Senate \n     confirmation as well. The council should be composed of \n     mature persons required by law to be genuinely ``learned in \n     the arts and humanities.'' Even allowing for the occasional \n     political hack who will slide through, such a council would \n     be very difficult for bureaucracies to roll.\n       Front and center for years now, the big complaint is that \n     the endowments try to be all things to all constituencies \n     rather than acting out of their own sense of national \n     cultural mission. For this grievance Congress has a remedy at \n     hand. It can establish by law that the endowments will \n     support only American cultural institutions whose weakening \n     or destruction would mean the loss of irreplaceable \n     treasures. These institutions--there are not that many--would \n     be selected by the national council and would be the nation's \n     indisputable best: The great museums, symphony orchestras, \n     jazz ensembles, art schools, performing arts centers, ballet, \n     operas and theater companies. In short, they would be the \n     emblems of the honor that America gives to its major cultural \n     institutions and of the importance it ascribes to them as \n     instruments of aesthetic education. Congress also can (and \n     should) stipulate that \n\n[[Page S 15294]]\n     a substantial part of the federal arts and humanities budgets will be \n     distributed, by formula, to states and local governments for \n     the support of local equivalents of the national treasures, \n     mandating substantial community outreach as a condition of \n     the award of public support. This money would also be subject \n     to a categorical ban on individual grants.\n       Finally, the endowments are said to be overloaded with \n     administrative costs and redundancies in areas, such as film \n     production, already supported by the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting and the Public Broadcasting System. A final \n     ``true.'' To solve this problem, the two endowments (and the \n     Institute for Museum Services) should be consolidated into a \n     single endowment under unified leadership, with a presiding \n     chairman and three deputies for the arts, humanities and \n     museum services components. This merger would save millions \n     of dollars, and each of the constituent organizations would \n     benefit immensely from the enhanced cross-disciplinary \n     scrutiny. The humanities section of the new endowment could \n     be constructively pared by at least a third of its present \n     budget with that money redistributed to meet large and urgent \n     arts and museum services needs. (Thumb through the annual NEH \n     catalogue of humanities grants; if you can explain 10 percent \n     of these mystifying projects, you should be the next dean of \n     Harvard College.)\n       Such reforms are not only possible but already on the \n     congressional table--in the form of a bill, jointly \n     introduced by Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Robert \n     Bennett of Utah, that addresses every one of these issues. It \n     would be a shame if partisans of the endowments ignored this \n     bill and thus missed the opportunity to anticipate and block \n     the future proposals that will otherwise lead inevitably to \n     the evisceration of the endowments. It may be too late in the \n     budget cycle to consider structural reforms'' right now; but \n     reauthorization or deauthorization time will soon roll around \n     and a deep breath and a careful look at the history and \n     future structure of the endowments will be in order.\n       The national endowments are powerful symbols of an American \n     commitment to the support and dissemination of the arts and \n     humanities at a time when a horrifying junk culture pervades \n     our public spaces. Even aside from this concern, abandoning \n     the endowments would be a shabby act, utterly unworthy of a \n     great nation. Their massive 30-year contribution to American \n     culture dwarfs their mistakes. They furnish unequaled \n     cognitive tools for early education for the children of what \n     will be the largest and most complex multi-cultural nation in \n     the world.\n       Ways and means can be debated; what I believe unarguable is \n     that the endowments should not be destroyed--slowly, swiftly \n     or at all--simply because aggressive cultural predators and \n     self-indulgent members of the federal bureaucracy have \n     occasionally corrupted the work of the agencies over the past \n     three decades. And if these persons and organizations now \n     hope to stave off reform, believing responsible defenders of \n     the endowments will simply go away, those of us who care for \n     the arts and humanities and understand their importance \n     should not let them get away with it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15293-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. While we are waiting, Mr. President, let me mention that \nsince February 1992, I have each day the Senate has been in session \nreported to the Senate the exact total of the Federal debt as of the \nday before the close of business, or in the case of Mondays the \nprevious Friday. I call it the bad news about the Federal debt, and \ntoday's news about the Federal debt is pretty bad.\n  Before we have ``another go,'' as the British put it, with our little \npop quiz that I so often have, I hope Senators will remember one \nquestion, one answer, about this $5 trillion debt that the Congress of \nthe United States has run up for future generations to pay off. That \none question on my pop quiz is: How many millions of dollars would it \ntake to add up to $1 trillion?\n  While anybody within earshot is thinking about that, I would suggest \nthat we bear in mind that it was the U.S. Congress, where I work--here \nand the House of Represenatives on the other side--that ran up this \nFederal debt that now exceeds $4.9 trillion. We are going to hit $5 \ntrillion before this year is out. And these young people who are \nserving as pages, their generation and generations following them, will \nbe struggling to pay off the debt. Every day that we fail to balance \nthe Federal budget runs the debt up further.\n  All right, what about the total Federal debt as of the close of \nbusiness yesterday, October 17? The total Federal debt down to the \npenny stood at $4,968,953,453,657.73. Now, this figure is not far from \n$5 trillion.\n  Another depressing figure discloses that on a per capita basis, \nassuming that every man, woman, and child would accept and pay off \nsomehow his or her share of the debt--and we know that only about half \nof the people, men, women, and children, will in fact pay any taxes at \nall, but if everybody had a share and paid it off, it would amount to \n$18,862.23 per man, woman, and child.\n  Now, then, remember the question that I asked in my little pop quiz? \nHow many million in $1 trillion? There are 1 million million in $1 \ntrillion. That gives you some idea of the enormity of the debt and the \nenormity of the irresponsibility of the Congress during the past \ngeneration or more.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, awaiting wrap-up information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. For the final time this afternoon, I ask unanimous consent \nthat further proceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS.

I thank the Chair.\n  Following the disposition of H.R. 927, it is the hope of the leader \nthat the \n\n[[Page S 15295]]\nSenate may consider the State Department reorganization bill, if the \nmanager's amendment can be worked out by that time.\n  Now then, the NASA authorization is a probability in terms of \nconsideration tomorrow.\n  Therefore, additional votes can be expected following the disposition \nof H.R. 927.\n  Also, all Senators should be on notice that the majority leader \nintends to turn to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill on Friday of this \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15294-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I understand that we are on automatic pilot. \nWhen I finish, we will go out?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will say, the Senate Finance Committee will resume markup \nof the $245 billion tax reduction bill. I am not certain precisely when \nthat will be. I think somewhere around 5 o'clock. The chairman, Senator \nRoth, will be in contact with the committee members.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, Washington can be a scary place sometimes \nand pretty scary around the time of Halloween. But yesterday's \nannouncement from Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin about expiration of \nthe debt ceiling on October 31 brings Halloween scare tactics to a \nwhole new level.\n  I was dismayed to see the administration resort to this sort of game-\nplaying on the debt ceiling and the budget situation. And I am sure \nmany in the financial community were as dismayed as I was.\n  Mr. President, investors around the world are watching our \nperformance here in Washington and they are particularly watching how \nwe Republicans are handling the Nation's financial situation.\n  So far the reaction has been very positive. Look at U.S. long-term \ninterest rates, a key sign of investor confidence in the U.S. economy. \nThe bond market has been strong and the rates have been steadily \ndeclining as the financial community sees our determination as a \nRepublican Congress to finally deal with the problem of the Federal \nbudget deficit once and for all.\n  Last December--right after the Republicans swept the 1994 \ncongressional elections--the interest rates on 30-year bonds began \ntheir decline from 8.0 percent to 6.29 percent today. The interest rate \non long-term bonds has declined steadily since this spring when we \npassed our budget resolution to get on a path to a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002. It is our actions as a Republican Congress that have \nspurred confidence in our country's future economic security.\n  Today we find ourselves in the ironic situation of a Secretary of the \nTreasury--the U.S. Government official with the primary responsibility \nof promoting confidence in the economy--actually trying to disrupt the \nfinancial markets.\n  Secretary Rubin has politicized this debate. His actions yesterday to \nreduce normal, previously scheduled borrowing next week can only be \ninterpreted as designed to disrupt the market. No Secretary of the \nTreasury should try to be destabilizing our financial markets.\n  As Secretary Rubin said in his letter--about the only sentence in it \nI agreed with--``This is no way for a great Nation to conduct its \nfinancial affairs.''\n  I hope that no one will be fooled by these Halloween scare tactics \nfrom the administration. In fact, even after yesterday's announcement \nthe bond market was strong. The American people want us to do the job \nof getting the deficit under control.\n  Mr. President, no one wants a default. And scare tactics are no way \nto prevent such a default. I can guarantee that we in the Congress will \nwork hard to see to it that there is no default by the U.S. Government \non its obligations.\n  But make no mistake: We will not retreat in our battle to end the \nstranglehold that the Federal deficit has on future generations of \nAmericans. This is the year to do the heavy lifting necessary to get \nour Nation's financial house in order and I trust the administration \nwill choose to be helpful in the serious work ahead of us in the coming \nweeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/18/senate-section/article/S15295-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
