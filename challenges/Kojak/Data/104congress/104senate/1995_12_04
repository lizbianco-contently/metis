I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as the Congress comes back from the weekend recess, a \nlot of people I know throughout the country, and in my State of \nLouisiana in particular, have been wondering whether Congress is going \nto be able to get together to solve the budget crisis. We do not have a \nlot of time before December 15, and there is the prospect of yet \nanother shutdown of the Federal Government because Congress has not \nbeen able to resolve how to come together on a plan to balance the \nbudget over a specified period of time.\n  Mr. President, I will make a couple of comments about that impasse \nbecause I think indeed it is very serious. I remember looking at the \nNew York Times on Saturday morning. It was a report on the progress \nthat Congress has made on this effort to balance the budget. I will \nread perhaps a couple of sentences from that article on Saturday by Mr. \nDavid Rosenbaum:\n\n       The budget negotiations this week between Congress and the \n     White House were a complete bust. For 3 days in a row, \n     lawmakers and administration officials met around a table in \n     a conference room in the Capitol of the United States, closed \n     the doors, accomplished absolutely nothing, and came out and \n     accused each other of refusing to negotiate in good faith. \n     Then, on Thursday afternoon, they adjourned until next week. \n     No one savvy about Washington politics was surprised.\n\n  Mr. President, at a time when President Clinton can bring all the \nheads of the territories in Bosnia to Dayton, OH, and ask them to sit \nin a room until they reach an agreement ending a war that has been \ngoing on for centuries, can we not bring together the parties in this \nbody called Congress to agree on what we should do with the budget?\n  I mentioned another article, which I think is right on target. It is \nby our distinguished leader, Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic \nleader. He \n\n[[Page S 17876]]\npointed out in this article, which appeared in Roll Call:\n\n       People of this country are sick and tired of a Government \n     that does not understand their problems or their neighbors' \n     problems, sick and tired of politicians fighting over things \n     that the rest of the country cannot understand, and, most of \n     all, they are sick and tired of the fact that it seems \n     impossible to get anything done in Washington.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that it is time, when we talk about the \nbudget, for the moderates in both parties to come together and help \nresolve this problem. I am absolutely convinced that you cannot put \npeople in a room who have visions of what the future of this country \nshould be like that are as different as night and day. It is my opinion \nthat the most difficult problems cannot be solved from the left working \nin, nor from the right working toward the center. I am absolutely \nconvinced that you cannot take the fringes of any political party and \ntry and use that methodology to solve difficult problems, such as a \nbudget problem.\n\n  I know that all the folks that are working on the budget are people \nof good faith and have strong beliefs about what a budget agreement \nshould accomplish and what it should contain. Mr. President, I am \nsuggesting today that there are moderates on the Democratic side--\nmoderates in the Democratic Party, both in the House and in the Senate, \nthat really want to have a budget agreement. I think it is now time for \nthe moderates on both sides of our political parties to try and band \ntogether to help resolve this problem. I am very concerned that as the \ndays go by and hours keep ticking off the clock, that we are not making \nthe progress needed and necessary in order to solve this problem before \nyet another deadline occurs.\n  As it was said in the Saturday article I quoted, the talks so far \nbetween Congress and the White House were a complete bust. Mr. \nPresident, we owe to the American people much more than that. We owe \nthe best talent, the best minds, and the best dedicated public servants \nto work together across party lines to bring this debate to a closure. \nLet me suggest a couple of things I think moderates can agree to.\n  First, I think it is certainly possible that we can agree that there \nshould be a balanced budget and it should be in 7 years. Point No. 1.\n  Second, I think that all of this debate about which economic \nassumptions we are going to use to help solve this problem almost \nborder on the point of being ridiculous. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has suggested that growth is going to be about 2.3 percent next \nyear. The Office of Management and Budget suggested that growth rate \nwill be about 2.5 percent. Is there not a middle ground between those \ntwo numbers, a figure between 2.3 and 2.5 that people with good \nintentions cannot agree to? I suggest that we split the differences \nbetween those, and I think that is something that can be done. I think \nit can be done in a way that brings about the best economic assumptions \nthat we need in order to fix this problem.\n  Third, I think people should be able to agree on a Consumer Price \nIndex adjustment. The people who have looked at this issue have \nrecommended that, clearly, the Consumer Price Index on which we base so \nmany of our economic programs is overstating the cost of products that \nconsumers buy and that an adjustment of somewhere up to 1 percent \nperhaps is a reasonable and rational adjustment.\n  I suggest that we could take a point, a percent adjustment, and by \ndoing that really allow us a great deal more flexibility in solving \nthis budget impasse.\n  Fourth, I think we ought to be able to agree on a tax cut that is \nreasonable and fair. Some have suggested no tax cut at all, zero. Some \nhave suggested we absolutely have to have $245 billion in tax cuts. Is \nthere not, again, a middle ground that we could agree on that comes up \nwith a reasonable tax cut and save somewhere in the range of $100 to \n$150 billion over the 7-year period? Is that not a fair compromise to \nthose who say we should have none and those who say we should have the \nhigher amount? I suggest it is.\n  The fifth point I think we should be able to come together on is the \nfact that the savings we have from these procedures I just outlined \nshould be utilized to put back money in Medicare and Medicaid and the \nearned income tax credit and the welfare program, environmental \nprograms, and yes, equally if not more important, the education \nprograms which determine the future of the people of this country and \nuse those extra funds to increase some of those drastic, suggested cuts \nin those programs.\n  Mr. President, I think reasonable people in both parties who could \ncall ourselves moderate should be able to get together and do these \nthings. I think it is more difficult when you have people who are on \nthe left in their party, or on the right in their party trying to \nresolve these differences. Is it not better to have a group of people \nin the middle who are moderates who can agree, and once we get an \nagreement which I think is pretty easy to get to, work it out so that \nwe then move toward the outside to solve the problem?\n  The way to solve this problem is working from the center out, not \nfrom the left end or from the right end, but, rather, working out the \nprinciples. These five principles I outlined I think give us the strong \nbasis for trying to reach a balanced budget in 7 years, one that, \nhopefully, this President would be able to see meets the needs that he \nhas outlined, solves the problem, and everybody comes away a winner.\n  I do not see how anybody wins if we have another stalemate. Everybody \nloses. Yet if we do reach an agreement, everybody should win. And \nwinners or losers in the Congress is not really what it is all about; \nit is whether we will craft a program that the American people can win \nwith and the future generations can say that Congress did the right \nthing when they were called upon to meet this challenge.\n  I strongly suggest that now is the time for moderates in the \nRepublican Party and the Democratic Party to start talking to each \nother. There is nothing wrong with that. That is what a democratic \nGovernment is all about--compromises, meeting together, solving the \nproblems in the center, and then working it away, and these agreements \nare received by more people in order to reach a majority.\n\n  I am just very concerned if we do not do that, if we try and solve \nthis problem from the left working in or from the right working in, we \nwill just have a stalemate. I do not think there is any political \ncapital in bringing this Government to a closure again because we at \nthat time will be admitting once again we cannot make Government work. \nThat is not why we were sent to Congress. Just the opposite is the \nreason we are here.\n  I call today upon moderates in both parties to start talking, to \nmeeting, to see if we cannot agree on these five principles I have \ntried to outline and take it from there and see where it leads us.\n  I suggest, in conclusion, we might be very surprised that it leads us \nto a balanced budget agreement that the Congress can pass with great \nenthusiasm, and this President will find that he will be able to \nsupport it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17875-7", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17876-S17877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I was very saddened to learn of the \nretirement of Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming. He and I came here \ntogether in the class of 1978 and have served with each other on the \nJudiciary Committee, tackling some contentious nominations and other \nhigh-profile issues. He has emerged as a true leader on many issues \nincluding immigration and population issues. He is someone I would term \na ``character,'' for he is certainly one of the more colorful and \nhumorous individuals to have ever served in the Senate. His quick wit \nis legend, and many of us--Democrat and Republican alike--have been \nvictims of it at one time or another over the years, but, much more \noften the beneficiaries of it. He uses it both ways--to score a point \nbut more often to break an unresolved impasse.\n  Senator Simpson is the son of former Wyoming Governor and Senator \nMilward Simpson and has been in and around politics all his life. Born \nin Denver, CO, in 1931, he earned both his bachelor of science and law \ndegrees at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. He served in the U.S. \nArmy from 1954 to 1956 and began his career as a litigator, raising his \nfamily in Cody, WY, \n\n[[Page S 17877]]\nand serving as assistant attorney general of Wyoming and in the State \nlegislature. He was elected to the Senate in 1978 and quickly became a \nrising star in his party. He was seriously considered for the Vice \nPresidential nomination in 1988 and has led the fight for passage of \nmany major legislative efforts. His service as his party's whip was \noutstanding, but in matters of conscience, he never lost his \nindependence.\n  Of course, our friend from Wyoming is best known here and throughout \nthe country for his colorful personality. He is widely known for having \none of the best senses of humor in Washington and one of its most \nacerbic tongues on occasion. He has entertained friends with his keen \nsense of comic timing, his witty delivery, and a standard portfolio of \njokes and anecdotes, many of which could not be printed in the \nCongressional Record or other reputable publications. When he leaves \nthe Senate, he could pursue a number of different careers. He has the \ntalent to be another Johnny Carson. He could successfully pursue many \nother fields, for he has a brilliant legal mind and has the ability to \nget to the core of an issue rapidly.\n  I count him as one of my closest friends. His beautiful, thoughtful, \nand gracious wife, Ann, is likewise a superb individual and my wife and \nI will never forget their genuine kindness and concern when Elizabeth \nAnn suddenly became ill on an overseas trip earlier this year.\n  It has been my privilege and pleasure to serve with Senator Alan \nSimpson over the last 17 years, and I look forward to our last year \nhere together. I congratulate him on an outstanding career, and hope \nthat we have not seen the last of him in the public arena. We need his \nleadership, his passion for the issues, and his humor to help lighten \nour load.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17876-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, while Mark Hatfield's retirement \nannouncement did not take me by complete surprise--for such decisions \nhave become virtually a weekly event here in the Congress--I was \nnonetheless disappointed and saddened to learn that he would not be \nseeking reelection to the Senate next year. He is one of the senior \nMembers of this body, and has been a national leader of uncommon \nearnestness, moderation, honesty, and principle. He is known for his \nlack of excessive partisanship and for always yielding to his \nconscience on the many difficult matters that come before us. He is \nthoughtful, deliberative, intellectual, and never fails to do what he \nbelieves to be right and in the best interest of his State and country.\n  The people of Oregon have entrusted Senator Hatfield with its reins \nof leadership through State or national office since 1956, when he was \nelected secretary of state at the age of 34. In 1958, he was elected \nGovernor, serving for 8 years. In 1966, he was elected to the Senate \nand has been here ever since.\n  He is a deeply religious man who has been a spiritual leader as well \nas a public one. His leadership of our Senate Prayer Breakfast group \nover the years has been nothing short of inspirational. I have also \nenjoyed working with him on the National Prayer Breakfasts each year, \nsomething he had been involved with even at the State level when he was \nGovernor back in Oregon. Our friend from Oregon has led by example; his \nreligious convictions and quiet, friendly manner have been a powerful \ndemonstration of how an ideal public official should conduct himself. \nHe has been one for us to look at and emulate, regardless of our own \npolitical views.\n  As a young serviceman, he was one of the first Americans to see \nHiroshima after it was bombed. This experience left its mark, and \nSenator Hatfield has been an unfailing leader on issues relating to \nnuclear deterrence and non-proliferation.\n  Mark Hatfield was born in Dallas, OR in 1922, and graduated from \nWillamette and Stanford Universities. He served in the Navy during \nWorld War II, commanding landing craft at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Early \nin his career, he was a teacher of political science and has written \nextensively on public policy issues. Since January, he has chaired the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, a daunting task in its own right, but \nparticularly challenging this year. He had previously served in that \ncapacity. His graciousness and earnestness have not been diminished by \nthe fierce budget wrangling this year.\n  Senator Hatfield and I will be leaving the Senate at the same time, \nso I will not be serving here once he is gone. But I do know that those \nMembers who do remain after him will find it a much lesser place in his \nabsence. I am proud to call him a friend, I congratulate him on his \noutstanding career and for the way he has always conducted himself, and \nwish him and Antoinette all the best for a happy, healthy, and lengthy \nretirement. I also look forward to serving with him over the next year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17877-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17877-S17878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE RETIREMENTS OF ALAN SIMPSON, MARK HATFIELD, AND NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, three of our colleagues have just recently \nannounced they are not running again for reelection. The most recent is \nSenator Simpson.\n  I got to know Al Simpson when I was a State legislator and he was a \nState legislator. We were at a meeting that a foundation pulled \ntogether of what they, accurately or inaccurately, called the \noutstanding legislators from various States, and I got to know Alan \nSimpson there.\n  I have worked with him over the years. He and I differ on some \nthings, but he is a legislator's legislator. He really legislates. He \nsits down and works things out. He is a man of reason. He is not \nfrightened by a new idea. I think he has made a tremendous contribution \nto the Senate, to his State of Wyoming, and to the Nation, and I am \nvery proud to have served with him.\n  I will add, one of the things that characterizes Senator Simpson, \nSenator Hatfield, and Senator Kassebaum is something the Presiding \nOfficer has heard me talk about before, and that is there is not \nexcessive partisanship. One of the things that has changed in my 21 \nyears, soon to be 22 years here in Congress, is that we have become \ngradually more partisan. Both parties share the blame on this, and it \nis not a good thing. It is like the budget process. We issue \nstatements, we have press conferences, we denounce each other instead \nof sitting around a table, working things out. Alan Simpson, Mark \nHatfield, and Nancy Kassebaum were the kind of people who worked things \nout.\n  I have, up until the last election, served as chairman of three \nsubcommittees. I do not think we ever had a party-line vote in any of \nmy subcommittees. That meant sometimes I had to give a little more than \nI wanted. Sometimes others did. But I think the net effect was a good \none for the Nation and, strangely, I think, good for the two parties. I \nthink the public senses that we are excessively partisan and there is a \nnegative attitude toward both the Democratic and Republican Parties out \nthere. I hope we can move away from that.\n  The second person who recently announced that he is retiring is \nSenator Mark Hatfield. Most people think about Mark Hatfield in \nconnection with chairing the Appropriations Committee, or a hundred and \none other things that he does. I think of Mark Hatfield particularly \nfor his leadership in the area of arms control. Long before others \nraised the flag that maybe we should not be spending so much money on \narms, Mark Hatfield was telling us that.\n\n  Even today we spend more on our defense budget than the next eight \ncountries combined. It does not make sense. If we take the 1973 budget \non defense and add the inflation factor, we are spending more today \nthan we were in 1973. In 1973 we were involved in Vietnam, we faced the \ncold war with what was then the Soviet Union and a nuclear threat \nthere. We ought to be paring it down. Mark Hatfield has been a \n\n[[Page S 17878]]\nvoice of reason. Again, like Alan Simpson, he has been one who has been \nwilling to work with people on the other side.\n  Senator Nancy Kassebaum is the same. I read the stories about her, as \nI did about all of my colleagues and their contributions. One of the \ncontributions Nancy Kassebaum has made has been on the Subcommittee on \nAfrica, in the Foreign Relations Committee. She chaired that for a \nwhile. Nancy Kassebaum did not get any votes back home in Kansas by \nchairing the Subcommittee on African Affairs, but made an immense \ncontribution in the very same way that Alan Simpson gets no votes in \nWyoming by chairing the Subcommittee on Immigration.\n\n  One of the things that we have in this body are people of real \nability who have a sense of public service. And we need more of that, \nand a little less, as I indicated, partisanship and power grabbing. But \nSenator Kassebaum is primarily thought of by her work on the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee in which the Presiding Officer serves. And \nshe has done a superb job there over the years, part of it in these \nyears as chairman where she has had to make some very difficult \ndecisions as we passed a budget resolution that cuts back on some of \nthe things that she favors. But the contributions that she has made \nover the years have been very significant.\n  I have been proud to serve with all three. The people of Wyoming, \nOregon, and Kansas can be very proud of these three Senators--Senator \nSimpson, Senator Hatfield, and Senator Kassebaum.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anyone seeking the floor, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Are we in morning business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17877-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17878-S17880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SENDING UNITED STATES TROOPS TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I, like many people, have been distressed \nover the weekend listening to a lot of the comments as to what is going \non in Bosnia, and this seems to be--and it is portrayed by this \nadministration that it is--a done deal. Many Republicans and many \nDemocrats are also saying that it is a done deal; that the troops are \ngoing to go; the President has made up his mind. The President, back in \nFebruary 1993, made a commitment of 25,000 American troops on the \nground in Bosnia, and he has decided they are going to go. So I guess \nthe easy thing is to say, well, the President made the decision; I may \nnot agree with it or I may agree with it but nonetheless the decision \nis made, and we want to support our troops that are over there.\n  I am really getting tired of the demagoging that is going on about \nsupporting the troops that are over there, as if this thing is a done \ndeal. I grant you, Mr. President, I agree that the President of the \nUnited States does have the constitutional right to deploy troops. I \nthink it is wrong, and historically it has not been done. The \nPresidents have come to the American people and have come through \nCongress for resolutions of approval, and this President has chosen not \nto do this.\n  Of course, I will remind all America that the House of \nRepresentatives, the other body, has already on two occasions expressed \nitself in a very, very strong vote in opposition to the deployment of \nground troops to Bosnia. So we turn on the talk radio shows and we look \nat the news accounts, and they say, well, it is already a done deal and \nCongress has no role; Congress is not relevant in this debate.\n  I just do not buy that. I think this is still America, and the \nAmerican people can be heard, and the best way for the American people \nto be heard is through their elected representatives. I think we have \njust a few hours to stop this thing. I am talking now about the mass \ndeployment.\n\n  Yes, the President has already sent several hundred troops into the \narea of Tuzla, which is the northeastern sector, in which I had \noccasion to spend quite a bit of time, and I see an environment which \nis the most hostile environment that perhaps we have ever had the \noccasion to deploy any American troop into in the history of this \ncountry. We talk about and can identify that there are more than 6 \nmillion mines of all shapes and sizes that are out there, and you \ncannot do anything about rendering those mines harmless because the \nground is now frozen and they will not appear really until a heavy \nvehicle gets on top of them. Of course, we are talking about the \ndeployment of 130 M1 tanks and several other armored vehicles, so it is \na very frightening thing. It is a frightening thing to think it is not \njust a matter of three factions that do not like each other in the \nformer Yugoslavia. It is not just the Serbs and the Croats and the \nMoslems, because in addition to that you have the Bosnian Serbs, you \nhave the Bosnian Moslems, you have the Arkan Tigers, you have the Black \nSwans, you have the Afghanistans, you have the Iranians. You have all \nof these, what we call rogue factions over there. And yet they say it \nis a done deal.\n  I think it is too easy to say that. I hope that everyone in America \nwill demand that their Senator get on record on this issue. Mr. \nPresident, we are going to give them the opportunity to get on record \non this issue. Last week, I served notice that there is going to be an \nup-or-down vote on the sending of troops into Bosnia.\n  It is not a matter of supporting our troops that are there. You bet \nwe support them. I know something about being a troop. I used to be in \na troop, and I wanted the support of the American people and got it. I \nthink every Member of this Senate, every Member of the other body, is \ngoing to support our troops wherever they are.\n  That is not the issue. That is a copout. The issue is, should they be \nover there to begin with? I can remember so well when Michael Rose, who \nwas the commanding general of the troops, the U.N. troops, in Bosnia \nsaid, if America sends troops over there, they will have more \ncasualties than they had in the Persian Gulf. That was 390.\n  In the Senate Armed Services Committee, when I asked Secretary Perry \nand Secretary Christopher and General Shalikashvili--I said, ``Is that \nmission to contain a civil war and to protect the integrity of NATO \nworth more than 400 American lives?'' And Secretary Perry said yes; \nSecretary Christopher said yes; General Shalikashvili said yes. But I \nsay no, because, you see, Mr. President, they were speaking on behalf \nof the President of the United States, the top people, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of State, and, of course, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  So now we say it is a done deal and that Congress is not relevant. \nBut I say we are going to have a vote on this, and people are going to \nhave to be responsible for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that at this point an \neditorial be printed in the Record, a December 1 editorial by Abraham \nSofaer.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Clinton Needs Congress on Bosnia\n\n                         (By Abraham D. Sofaer)\n\n       President Clinton has appealed to Congress and the American \n     people to support his policy committing 20,000 ground troops \n     to implement the peace agreement reached between Serbia, \n     Croatia and Bosnia. It is a tribute to the American people \n     that the president is accorded the greatest deference when he \n     calls for the greatest sacrifice. Americans respond, at least \n     initially, to such appeals from their President.\n       But Mr. Clinton is exploiting this quality. He has \n     presented the agreement and the American role in its \n     enforcement as an accomplished fact, though the documents \n     have yet to be signed by the parties, and numerous \n     preconditions to U.S. involvement have yet to be fulfilled. \n     He is consulting with Congress, but he is already sending \n     troops to the area without any form of legislative approval. \n     Indeed, he claims that, while he would welcome Congress's \n     approval, he plans to go ahead regardless.\n       Presidents often try to get what they want by leading \n     aggressively. Congress nevertheless has a duty to study \n     carefully the proposed operation and then express its view. \n     The essential first step in that debate is to read the \n     documents signed recently in Dayton. The complex agreement, \n     with 12 annexes, calls for Bosnia to remain a single but \n     divided nation, and all the warring factions \n\n[[Page S 17879]]\n     to withdraw to specific lines. The agreement covers virtually all \n     aspects of future life in Bosnia, including the division of \n     its governments, the contents of its constitution, the \n     selection of its judges, and the manner in which its police \n     force is to be chosen and trained. Of principal interest to \n     Congress, though, are those aspects of the agreement that \n     create obligations and expectations for the U.S. to fulfill.\n\n\n                            our obligations\n\n       These obligations, when carefully examined in context, \n     carry to the ultimate extreme the policy of forcing a \n     settlement on the Bosnians, rather than attempting to create \n     an internal situation that is militarily balanced. Most \n     significantly, the agreement makes the U.S., through the \n     ``implementation force'' (IFOR), the military guarantor of \n     the overall arrangement.\n       The role of U.S. troops cannot be characterized as \n     ``peacekeeping.'' Even ``implementation'' understates our \n     obligation, IFOR will be close to an occupying army, in a \n     conflict that has merely been suspended. We are likely to \n     have as many difficulties acting as occupiers without having \n     won a victory as the U.N.'s war crimes tribunal is having in \n     attempting to apply its decisions in Bosnia without the power \n     to enforce them.\n       IFOR's principal responsibilities are set out in Annex 1(a) \n     of the agreement:\n       The parties agree to cease hostilities and to withdraw all \n     forces to agreed lines in three phases. Detailed rules have \n     been agreed upon, including special provisions regarding \n     Sarajevo and Gorazde. But IFOR is responsible for marking the \n     cease-fire lines and the ``inter-entity boundary line and its \n     zone of separation,'' which in effect will divide the Bosnian \n     Muslims and Croats from the Bosnian Serbs. The parties agree \n     that IFOR may use all necessary force to ensure their \n     compliance with these disengagement rules.\n       The parties agree to ``strictly avoid committing any \n     reprisals, counterattacks, or any unilateral actions in \n     response to violations of this annex by another party.'' The \n     only response allowed to alleged violations is through the \n     procedures provided in Article VIII of the Annex, which \n     establishes a ``joint military commission''--made up of all \n     the parties--to consider military complaints, questions and \n     problems. But the commission is only ``a consultative body \n     for the IFOR commander,'' an American general who is \n     explicitly deemed ``the final authority in theater regarding \n     interpretation of this agreement. . . .'' This enormous \n     power--to prevent even acts of self defense--will carry \n     proportionate responsibility for harm that any party may \n     attribute to IFOR's lack of responsiveness or fairness.\n       IFOR is also given the responsibility to support various \n     nonmilitary tasks, including creating conditions for free and \n     fair elections; assisting humanitarian organizations; \n     observing and preventing ``interference with the movement of \n     civilian populations, refugees, and displaced persons''; \n     clearing the roads of mines; controlling all airspace (even \n     for civilian air travel); and ensuring access to all areas \n     unimpeded by checkpoints, roadblocks or other obstacles. \n     Taken together, these duties essentially give IFOR control \n     of the physical infrastructure of both parts of the \n     Bosnian state. It seems doubtful that the 60,000-man force \n     could meet these expectations.\n       Article IX of the agreement recognizes the ``obligation of \n     all parties to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution \n     of war crimes and other violations of international \n     humanitarian law.'' This is an especially sensitive matter. \n     Yet there is no mechanism in the accord for bringing to \n     justice men who haven't been defeated in battle and who \n     aren't in custody. This means that IFOR is almost certain to \n     come under pressure by victims and human rights advocates to \n     capture and deliver up the principal villains. Will it do \n     better than we did in fulfilling our promise to capture \n     Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia?\n       The agreement makes vague promises about reversing ``ethnic \n     cleansing'' by guaranteeing refugees the right to return to \n     their homes. Since this is in practice impossible, the West \n     will end up paying billions in compensation awards promised \n     in the agreement.\n       The agreement contains numerous provisions regarding the \n     manner in which Bosnia is to be governed, with checks and \n     balances built in that are based on ethnic or geographic \n     terms. But Americans traditionally have not believed in such \n     divisions of political authority. We fought the Civil War to \n     put into place an undivided nation based on the principle \n     that all people are of equal worth, and all must live in \n     accordance with the law. It took a Tito to keep the \n     ethnically divided Yugoslavia together. Will IFOR now assume \n     his role of enforcing a constitution based on principles \n     abhorrent to Western values? Even if the basic structure of \n     the government works, what role will IFOR have to play in \n     resolving disputes over the numerous sensitive areas that the \n     parties have seen fit to write into the accords? If the \n     parties don't resolve some matters successfully, they are \n     likely to blame IFOR for these failures.\n       Finally, the agreement draws a vague distinction between \n     ``military'' and ``civilian'' matters. Ultimate authority \n     over the latter is allocated to a U.N. high representative, \n     who is to act through a ``joint civilian commission'' \n     consisting of senior political representatives of the parties \n     and the IFOR commander or his representative. The high \n     representative is to exchange information and maintain \n     liaison on a regular basis with IFOR, and shall attend or be \n     represented at meetings of the joint military commission and \n     offer advice ``particularly on matters of a political-\n     military nature.'' But it is also made clear that the high \n     representative ``shall have no authority over the IFOR and \n     shall not in any way interfere in the conduct of military \n     operations or the IFOR chain of command.''\n       This may seem a reassuring confirmation of IFOR's power to \n     avoid U.N. restrictions on the use of force. Ultimately, \n     however, IFOR's role could be made untenable if it finds \n     itself in a confrontation with the U.N.'s designated \n     representative about the proper handling of a ``political'' \n     matter. What would happen, for example, if the U.N. high \n     representative determined that U.S. forces had gone too far \n     in defending themselves under President Clinton's policy of \n     effectively responding to attacks ``and then some''?\n\n\n                               either/or\n\n       Congress cannot redo the agreement reached by the parties. \n     But there is no need for lawmakers to accept President \n     Clinton's either/or approach--either support his plan to \n     implement the agreement, or pull out entirely. If the \n     agreement represents a genuine desire for peace among the \n     warring parties, then presumably the accord is not so fragile \n     as to depend on the oral commitment of U.S. troops made by \n     the administration (and which isn't even part of the \n     agreement). Congress can and should consider other options. \n     The U.S., for example, could assist European forces in \n     demarcating the boundary lines, and could enforce peace in \n     the area through the threat of air strikes on important \n     targets. Or the U.S. could offer greater monetary and \n     diplomatic support for the agreement but not any ground \n     troops.\n       Whatever happens with the troop commitment, Congress should \n     insist that the agreement's provisions allowing the training \n     and arming of the Bosnian Muslims be rigorously adhered to. A \n     balance of power among the hostile parties is ultimately the \n     only basis for long-term stability in the region. And if \n     American troops are sent to Bosnia, they will be unable to \n     leave responsibly until such a balance has been developed. \n     That would certainly take longer than the yearlong limit \n     imposed by the administration.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. This is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who \ntook the time to read the some 12 annexes that we have to this \nagreement that has been initialed and all that was said.\n  We realize the responsibility that we have in the United States for \nthis so-called peacekeeping effort. But stop and think. This is not \npeacekeeping; this is peace implementation. There is a little thing \ncalled mission creep. We saw it in Vietnam. We saw it in Somalia. It is \na thing where you go in and tell the American people, ``We are just \nkeeping peace. There is no war on over there.''\n  Mr. President, I was in the northeast sector of Bosnia. There is a \nwar going on over there. The firing did not stop. The firepower is \ngoing on right now. You can hear it. You are walking around with a \nshrapnel jacket and helmet. You are not doing that to keep warm even \nthough you are doing anything you can to keep warm in that area. There \nwas a blizzard 3 weeks ago when I was there.\n  Nonetheless, when this scholar read the accords, not only are we \nresponsible for implementing, that is, making peace; but we also are \nresponsible for rebuilding the infrastructure. This $2 billion they \nbandy around is not even a drop in the bucket of what we are going to \nhave to spend if the President has his way and has a mass deployment \ninto Bosnia.\n  I had a telephone conversation not more than just 10 minutes ago with \na retired captain, Jim Smith, who lost his leg in Vietnam and lost his \nson in Somalia. His son was one of those soldiers, one of those 18 \nRangers that were sent over there originally for some type of a \nhumanitarian mission that was supposed to open up the roads so we could \nsend humanitarian goods in to some of the Somalian people.\n  Yes, that seemed to be a good idea. It was a 45-day mission to start \nwith. Then President Clinton was elected. I was serving in the other \nbody at the time, and every month we sent a resolution that said, ``Mr. \nPresident, bring our troops home from Somalia. We do not have anything \nat stake there in terms of our Nation's security.'' He did not do it \nand did not do it and did not do it until finally 18 of our Rangers \nwere murdered in cold blood, their corpses were mutilated and dragged \nthrough the streets of Mogadishu. And one of those corpses was Cpl. Jim \nSmith, the son of Capt. Jim Smith.\n  I talked to Capt. Jim Smith, who spent a career in the military and \nknows a lot more about it than I do. Captain Smith said there are so \nmany parallels between what happened to his \n\n[[Page S 17880]]\nson and what is going to happen to many other sons and daughters if we \nallow the mass deployment of troops into Bosnia.\n\n  He said one of the things that stuck in his mind was the last letter \nthat he got from his son, Cpl. Jim Smith, who said, ``Dad, the biggest \nproblem we have is we don't know who the good guys and the bad guys \nare.'' This was in Somalia. This was one of the last letters, maybe the \nlast letter, written by Cpl. Jim Smith before his body was dragged \nthrough the streets of Mogadishu. He said, ``We don't know who the good \nguys and the bad guys are.''\n  That is exactly what happened 2\\1/2\\ years ago when President Clinton \nmade the first decision for airdrops. I asked the person--and I cannot \nuse his name in this public forum because it was a restricted meeting--\nI said, ``How do you know when we drop the stuff whether it's going to \nget to the good guys or the bad guys?'' He scratched his head and said, \n``You know, I don't think we know that. Come to think of it, I'm not \nsure we know who the good guys and the bad guys are.''\n  That is because if you take a snapshot of any time in the history of \nBosnia or the former Yugoslavia, you will find that at one time the \nCroats are the bad guys and the Serbs are the good guys; another time \nthe Moslems have just finished butchering several thousand people, they \nare the bad guys, the Croats are the good guys. Most recently we assume \nthe Serbs are the bad guys, so we, under the direction of President \nClinton, chose sides in that civil war. At that time, many of us said, \nas soon as they do airdrops, then there will be airstrikes, and then \nthey will want to send troops in. And that is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  So this not over. It is not a done deal. I know the President right \nnow is on a wave. His numbers look good. Mr. President, I can \nunderstand that, because you are an excellent politician. You just came \nback from Europe. You were talking about how everyone was cheering you \nover there. No wonder they are cheering over in Europe. You are saying \nwe are committing 70 percent of the cost for this, and we are \ncommitting 30 percent of our troops to fight with your other troops, to \nfight your battles for you.\n  That is not our battle over there. That is relative to the security \ninterests of Western Europe and Eastern Europe, not the United States.\n  I saw the accounts on television when President Clinton was talking \nto the troops over there. I can remember when I was a troop, so I know \nhow a troop thinks. When I was over there talking to those same troops \njust a few days before the President was there, they had one question. \nThey said, ``What is our mission? Why are we going to this hostile \narea? Why is the President obsessed in sending us into Bosnia?''\n\n  I only say this today. I know we are out of time, Mr. President. I \njust want to say that it is not over yet. I reemphasize there will be \nno free rides. There is going to be a vote. Most likely it will be \nWednesday, not the vote that the leader has that is going to be a \nwatered-down version of conciliatory remarks about what has gone on \nover there and about protecting our troops. We all know we are going to \nsupport our troops.\n  But this is going to be a vote on, Are we going to have a mass \ndeployment of troops into Bosnia? Yes or no. And every Senator on this \nfloor is going to have to make a record and stand up and say how he \nfeels so that the people at home will know.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, how your calls are coming in in your \noffice back in Tennessee. But I can tell you what mine are in Oklahoma. \nThey are about 100 to 1 against it. That is because there is an \ninfinite wisdom of the people of this country once left alone to make \nup their mind and make that judgment. It is not a beltway decision. It \nis not a Washington, DC, decision. It is not the kind of wisdom you get \nin the White House or within the beltway. It is back in real America \nwhere real people, real fathers and mothers are, sons and daughters who \nare going to be over there, shipped over to this endless war in Bosnia.\n  It is not going to be 12 months, Mr. President. When we were up in \nthe area of Tuzla where our troops are going to be deployed, I said \nsomething about 12 months, and they all laughed. They said, ``You mean \n12 years.'' This is the time for it to be stopped. If Somalia had been \nstopped before the murder of the 18 Rangers over there and their \nmutilated bodies were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, that \nwould not have happened. This is the time to stop this before the \nmutilated bodies of Americans are dragged through the streets of Tuzla.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17878-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17880-S17881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BOSNIA AND HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are now debating in this country the \nquestion of deployment of United States troops to Bosnia. As we engage \nin that discussion this week, I think it would be appropriate if we \ntake a moment to go back and talk about the last major U.S. deployment \nof troops in a trouble spot situation. Of course, I am talking about \nHaiti.\n  Today, Mr. President, there are approximately 2,500 United States \ntroops in Haiti, down from a much higher figure previously. These \ntroops, Mr. President, were deployed in the interest of the future of \npeace and democracy in Haiti. It is vitally important to Haitian \ndemocracy that there be an orderly transfer of power in Haiti in the \ncoming weeks.\n  On December 17 of this year--in just a few days--elections are \nscheduled to take place. These elections on December 17 are to be \nfollowed, on February 7, by the swearing in of a new President of \nHaiti. Mr. President, all over the world the orderly transition of \npower is considered the true hallmark of democracy.\n  This orderly, routine transfer of power is what separates true \ndemocracy from pseudodemocracy. It is what separates the democratic \ncountries in the world from other countries. And there is no truer test \nof a democracy than its ability routinely to carry out this awesome \ntransfer of power.\n  Mr. President, in the past, President Aristide has indicated that he \nunderstands this and that he understands the importance of this. In \nfact, on May 29 of this year, Senator Specter and I met with President \nAristide at the White House in Haiti. We asked him at that time in a \nfairly lengthy conversation if he can envision any circumstances under \nwhich he would retain power. His answer was an unequivocal no. Senator \nSpecter asked him again, could he envision any circumstances that he \nwould retain power, stay in office. His answer, no.\n  Then I asked President Aristide, ``Mr. President, many of your \nsupporters may urge you to stay on, they may appeal to your patriotism, \nthey may tell you that you are the only one who can carry out the \nduties of the Presidency, that your country needs you. How will you be \nable to resist those comments? How will you be able to resist those \npleas?''\n  President Aristide's answer was very simple. He said, ``Senator, I \nhave no choice. The Constitution takes precedence over the wishes of my \nsupporters.''\n  Over the last couple of weeks, there has been some confusion about \nwhether President Aristide will leave office. There has been some \nindication that he might not step down as scheduled. His views on this \nmatter appear to be a moving target. The most recent accounts over the \nweekend, last Friday specifically, are that he said that he will step \ndown after all and that he was really misunderstood in the comments \nthat he made a few days prior to that.\n  Mr. President, it is vitally important that President Aristide does, \nin fact, step down, that he follows his Constitution, the Constitution \nof Haiti.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the vital importance of President \nAristide's routine departure from office. Last year, the United States \nwent to the brink of a full-scale invasion in support of constitutional \ndemocracy in Haiti. We want and the Haitian people want a strong and \nstable democracy in Haiti. To achieve that, there has to be an orderly \ntransfer of power. The Haitian people deserve it.\n  Earlier in this century, William Faulkner described Haiti as \n``homeless and desperate on the lonely ocean, a little lost island'' \nthat had suffered ``200 years of oppression and exploitation.'' \n\n[[Page S 17881]]\n\n  Faulkner's words could have just as well have been uttered last year, \nwith the addition of several decades. The people of Haiti deserve hope. \nThey need to know that the world shares their aspiration to be a full \nmember of the community of nations. They have waited a long time. They \nhave waited long enough.\n  I believe it is important that all of us--this country, other \ncountries of the world--put President Aristide on notice that to flirt \nwith the idea of clinging to power in violation of his country's \nConstitution would be to risk a huge step backward for the Haitian \npeople. It is long past time to break the cycle of oppression in Haiti. \nThe routine, orderly departure from office of President Aristide will \nbe a major step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17880-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO REV.

Halverson passed away last week. For 14 years \nhe tended to the spiritual needs of this body and all the people who \nmake it work.\n  Educated at Wheaton College and Princeton Theological Seminary, \nReverend Halverson worked in several places including California, his \nlast place of ministry prior to moving to Washington. As the 60th \nChaplain of the Senate most of our Nation knew Reverend Halverson from \nthe prayer he delivered every morning. His respectful and quiet manner \nwas a example to us all for how to conduct ourselves and treat others \nwith dignity. I remember with fondness the mornings when I sat as the \nacting President of this chamber, and listened to Reverend Halverson \nspeak, urge and console not only the Members of this body but everybody \nlistening throughout the Nation.\n  Besides his duties as Chaplain of the Senate Reverend Halverson also \nwas a minister to the Fourth Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, MD, and \nan author of several books. He took a lifetime interest in trying speak \nto the improvement of the moral being of individuals, and the moral \nhealth of our Nation. I will miss Reverend Halverson, our country will \nmiss Reverend Halverson, and this body will miss Reverend Halverson, \nbut we are all better because of his life. I hope the example of his \nlife will continue to set a standard for us all.\n  I know that Reverend Halverson's wife Doris and all the members of \nhis family know better than all of us what an exceptional and spiritual \nman he was.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to honor the \nmemory of our long-time Senate Chaplain and spiritual leader, Dr. \nRichard Halverson, who passed away November 28. Dr. Halverson served as \nChaplain for 14 years, joining the Senate in 1981 shortly after I, too, \nentered the Senate. He retired this past March after distinguished \nservice to this body and to the Nation.\n  As Senate Chaplain, Dr. Halverson played many roles. His prayers \nwould open each daily session of the Senate, often reminding Senators \nof the higher objectives of our work. When passions ran high over \ncontroversial legislation, Dr. Halverson's opening prayers would give \nSenators pause for reflection and helped maintain the Senate's \ntradition of reasoned, respectful debate.\n  I came to know Dr. Halverson well through his attendance at our Bible \nstudy sessions, where he came to learn and share his thoughts on the \nOld Testament. He was a gracious, valued participant and we benefited \nfrom his spiritual insight.\n  As many know, Dr. Halverson established himself as a Chaplain who \nnever tired of selfless service. He was always available to spend time \nwith someone who needed his time, either for spiritual guidance or \ncounsel. His energies were not just directed at Senators, but at their \nspouses and staffs, and hundreds of Senate employees. In this role, he \nplayed a vital role in keeping the fabric of the U.S. Senate together.\n  The Senate was a better place for having had the compassionate \nservice of Dr. Halverson as its Chaplain for 14 years, and the Nation \nowes him its gratitude for the role he played in our midst.\n  My wife, Joan, and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Dr. \nHalverson's wife, Doris, and his many children and grandchildren. We \nwill all miss his faithful, caring presence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17881-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed two \nimportant bills impacting the charitable community--H.R. 2525 and H.R. \n2519. Enactment of these bills was urgently needed to put a stop to \nunwarranted litigation and ensure that charities can continue to accept \ngift annuities from generous donors across the country. For these \nreasons it was important for me to clear the way to immediate passage \nof the bills.\n  Charities are critical to the Nation and to communities across the \ncountry. And charitable gift annuities are an important method for them \nto raise much-needed funds. This legislation will allow universities, \nhospitals, and other important local and national charities to continue \ntheir significant contributions to communities and the needy.\n  I commend my colleagues in the House and Senate for working quickly \nto craft this legislation. Almost 2,000 charities across the country \nhave been defendants in unnecessary and unwarranted litigation. This \ncongressional act will end the litigation, freeing charities to \ncontinue their important work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17881-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1833, which the clerk will now \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1833) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is now recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \n1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995.\n  I understand that many people on both sides of this issue have very \nstrongly held beliefs. I respect those whose views differ from my own. \nAnd, I condemn the use of violence or any other illegal method to \nexpress any point of view on this issue.\n  This bill, however, presents a very narrow issue: whether one rogue \nabortion procedure that has probably been performed only by a handful \nof abortion doctors in this country, that is never medically necessary, \nthat is not the safest medical procedure available under any \ncircumstances, and that is morally reprehensible, should be banned.\n  This bill does not address whether all abortions after a certain week \nof pregnancy should be banned, or whether late-term abortions should \nonly be permitted in certain circumstances. It bans one particular \nabortion procedure.\n\n[[Page S 17882]]\n\n  I chaired the Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill that was held \non November 17. After hearing the testimony presented there, as well as \nseeing some of the submitted material, I must say that I find it \ndifficult to comprehend how any reasonable person could examine the \nevidence and continue to defend the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  That procedure involves the partial delivery, in the late second or \nthird trimester of pregnancy, of an intact fetus into the birth canal. \nThe fetus is delivered from its feet through its shoulders, so that \nonly its head remains in the uterus. Then, either scissors or another \ninstrument is used to poke a hole in the base of the skull. This is a \nliving baby at this point, in a late trimester of living. Once they \npoke that hole in the base of the skull, at that point, a suction \ncatheter is inserted to suck out the brains. This bill would simply ban \nthat procedure.\n  The bill was first brought up on the Senate floor in early November. \nOn November 8, the Senate voted to commit the bill to the Judiciary \nCommittee for a hearing and a report of the bill within 19 days, which \nincluded a holiday recess.\n  We held a comprehensive, 6\\1/2\\-hour hearing on the bill on November \n17. To facilitate consideration on the floor, I have directed that a \nhearing record be printed on an expedited basis.\n  In addition, so that all Senators can have immediate access to the \ntestimony and other evidence adduced at the hearing, last week I had \nthe committee distribute to each Senator a photocopied set of the \nentire hearing record, including inserts and written submissions.\n  The committee heard testimony from a total of 12 witnesses presenting \na variety of perspectives on the bill. I wanted to ensure that both \nsides of this debate had a full opportunity to present their arguments \non this issue, and I think that the hearing bore that out.\n  Brenda Shafer, a registered nurse who worked in Dr. Martin Haskell's \nOhio abortion clinic for 3 days as a temporary nurse in September 1993, \ntestified as to her personal experience in observing Dr. Haskell \nperform the procedure that would be banned by this bill. Dr. Haskell is \none of only two--maybe four doctors who have acknowledged performing \nthe procedure--only two have acknowledged it, but there may be four of \nthem who do this procedure.\n  The committee also heard testimony from four ob-gyn doctors--two in \nfavor of the bill and two against, from an anesthesiologist, from an \nethicist, and from three women who had personal experiences either with \nhaving a late-term abortion or with declining to have a late-term \nabortion. Finally, the committee also heard from two law professors who \ndiscussed constitutional and other legal issues raised by the bill.\n  The hearing was significant in that it permitted the issues raised by \nthis bill to be fully aired. I think that the most important \ncontribution of the hearing to this debate is that the hearing record \nputs to rest a number of inaccurate statements that have been made by \nopponents of the bill and that have unfortunately been widely covered \nin the press.\n  Because the Judiciary Committee hearing brought out many of the facts \non this issue, I would like to go through the most important of those \nfor my colleagues to clear up what I think have been some of the major \nmisrepresentations--and simply points of confusion--on this bill.\n\n\n                        Misrepresentation no. 1\n\n  The first and foremost inaccuracy that we must correct once and for \nall concerns the effects of anesthesia on the fetus of a pregnant \nwoman. I must say that I am personally shocked at the irresponsibility \nthat led some opponents of this bill to spread the myth that anesthesia \ngiven to the mother during a partial-birth abortion is what kills the \nfetus.\n  Opponents of this measure presumably wanted to make this procedure \nappear less barbaric and make it more palatable. In doing so, however, \nthey have not only misrepresented the procedure--which is bad enough--\nbut they have spread potentially life-threatening misinformation that \ncould prove catastrophic to women's health.\n  By claiming that anesthesia kills the fetus, opponents have spread \nmisinformation that could deter pregnant women who might desperately \nneed surgery from undergoing surgery for fear that the anesthesia could \nkill or brain-damage their unborn children.\n  Let me illustrate how widespread this misinformation has become:\n  In a June 23, 1995, submission to the House Judiciary Constitution \nSubcommittee, the late Dr. James McMahon, the other of the two doctors \nwho has admitted performing the procedure, wrote that anesthesia given \nto the mother during the procedure caused fetal demise.\n  Syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman wrote that, when statements of \nsupporters of the bill are reviewed, ``You wouldn't even know that \nanesthesia ends the life of such a fetus before it comes down the birth \ncanal.''\n  Let me note also that, of course, if the fetus was dead before being \nbrought down the birth canal, then this bill by definition would not \ncover the procedure performed to abort that fetus. The bill covers only \nprocedures in which a living fetus is partially delivered.\n  All but the head of this living fetus is outside, and then they \npuncture the back of the skull and suck out the brain so that the skull \ncollapses and the baby can then be pulled out. There is no doubt in my \nmind that the reason the head is in is so that they will not be accused \nof infanticide.\n  An editorial in USA Today on November 3, 1995, also stated, ``The \nfetus dies from an overdose of anesthesia given to its mother.''\n  In a self-described fact sheet circulated to Members of the House, \nDr. Mary Campbell--the medical director of Planned Parenthood who \ntestified at the Judiciary Committee hearing--wrote:\n\n       The fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the \n     mother intravenously. A dose is calculated for the mother's \n     weight which is 50 to 100 times the weight of the fetus. The \n     mother gets the anesthesia for each insertion of the \n     dilators, twice a day. This induces brain death in a fetus in \n     a matter of minutes. Fetal demise therefore occurs at the \n     beginning of the procedure while the fetus is still in the \n     womb.\n\n  When that statement was referenced to the medical panel at the \nJudiciary Committee hearing by Senator Abraham, the president of the \nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists, Dr. Norig Ellison, flatly \nresponded, ``There is absolutely no basis in scientific fact for that \nstatement.''\n  The American Society of Anesthesiologists was invited to testify at \nour hearing precisely to clear up this obvious misrepresentation. They \nsought the opportunity to set the record straight.\n  What was terribly disturbing about this distortion was that it could \nendanger women's health and women's lives. The American Society of \nAnesthesiologists has made clear that they do not take a position on \nthis legislation, but that they came forward out of concern for this \nharmful misinformation.\n  The spreading of this misinformation strikes me as a very sad \ncommentary on the lengths that those who support abortion on demand, \nfor any reason, at virtually any time during pregnancy, and apparently \nregardless of the method, will do to defend each and any procedure, and \ncertainly this procedure. The sacrifice of intellectual honesty is very \ndisheartening.\n  As Dr. Ellison testified, he was\n\n       Deeply concerned . . . that the widespread publicity given \n     to Dr. McMahon's testimony may cause pregnant women to delay \n     necessary and perhaps lifesaving medical procedures, totally \n     unrelated to the birthing process, due to misinformation \n     regarding the effect of anesthetics on the fetus.\n\n  He stated that the American Society of Anesthesiologists, while not \ntaking a position on the bill,\n\n       . . . have nonetheless felt it our responsibility as \n     physicians specializing in the provision of anesthesia care \n     to seek every available forum in which to contradict Dr. \n     McMahon's testimony. Only in that way, we believe, can we \n     provide assurance to pregnant women that they can undergo \n     necessary surgical procedures safely, both for mother and \n     unborn child.\n\n  Dr. Ellison also noted that, in his medical judgment, in order to \nachieve neurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth abortion \nprocedure, it would be necessary to anesthetize the mother to such a \ndegree as to place her own health in jeopardy.\n  In short, in a partial-birth abortion, the anesthesia does not kill \nthe fetus. The baby will generally be alive after \n\n[[Page S 17883]]\npartly being delivered into the birth canal and before having his or \nher skull opened and brain sucked out.\n  That is also consistent with evidence provided by Dr. Haskell \ndescribing his use of the procedure. In his 1992 paper presented before \nthe National Abortion Federation, which is part of the hearing record, \nDr. Haskell described the procedure as first involving the forceps-\nassisted delivery into the birth canal of an intact fetus from the feet \nup to the shoulders, with the head remaining in the uterus. He does not \ndescribe taking any action to kill the fetus up until that point.\n  In a 1993 interview with the American Medical News, Dr. Haskell \nacknowledged that roughly two-thirds of the fetuses he aborts using the \npartial-birth abortion procedure are alive at the point at which he \nkills them by inserting a scissors in the back of the head and \nsuctioning out the brain.\n  Finally, in a letter to me dated November 9, 1995, Dr. Watson Bowes \nof the University of North Carolina Medical School wrote,\n\n       Although I have never witnessed this procedure, it seems \n     likely from the description of the procedure by Dr. Haskell \n     that many if not all of the fetuses are alive until the \n     scissors and the suction catheter are used to remove brain \n     tissue.\n\n  Simply put, anesthesia given to a mother does not kill the baby she \nis carrying.\n\n\n                        Misrepresentation No. 2\n\n  Let me move on to the next misrepresentation. Another myth that the \nhearing record debunks is that the procedure can be medically necessary \nin late-term pregnancies where the health of the mother is in danger or \nwhere the fetus has severe abnormalities.\n  Now, there were two witnesses at the hearing who testified as to \ntheir experiences with late-abortions in circumstances in which Dr. \nMcMahon performed the procedure. Both women, Coreen Costello and Viki \nWilson, received terrible news late in their pregnancies that the \nchildren they were carrying were severely deformed and would be unable \nto survive for very long.\n  I would like to make it absolutely clear that nothing in the bill \nbefore us would prevent women in Ms. Costello's and Ms. Wilson's \nsituations from choosing to abort their children. That question is not \nbefore us, and it is not one that we face in considering this narrow \nbill.\n  I also would like to point out that I have the utmost sympathy for \nwomen--and their husbands and families--who find themselves receiving \nthe same tragic news that those women received.\n  Regardless of whether they aborted the child or decided to go through \nwith the pregnancy, which is what another courageous witness at our \nhearing, Jeannie French of Oak Park, IL, chose to do--and as a result, \nher daughter Mary's heart valves were donated to other infants--their \nexperiences are horrendous ones that no one should have to go through.\n  The testimony of all three witnesses was among the most heart-\nwrenching and painful testimony I have ever heard before the committee. \nMy heart goes out to those three women and their families as well as \nany others in similar situations.\n  However, the fact is that medical testimony in the record indicates \nthat even if an abortion were to be performed under such circumstances, \na number of other procedures could be performed, such as the far more \ncommon classical D procedure or an induction procedure.\n\n  When asked whether the exact procedure Dr. McMahon used would ever be \nmedically necessary--even in cases like those described by Ms. Costello \nand Ms. Wilson, several doctors at our hearing explained that it would \nnot. Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing Ob-Gyn and clinical professor in \nDayton, Ohio, stated that she had never had to resort to that procedure \nand that none of the physicians that she worked with had ever had to \nuse it.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, the director of medical education in the department \nof obstetrics and gynecology at the Mount Sinai Medical Hospital Center \nin Chicago, stated that a doctor would never need to resort to the \npartial-birth abortion procedure.\n\n\n                        Misrepresentation No. 3\n\n  This ties in closely to what I consider the next misrepresentation \nmade about the partial-birth abortion procedure: the claim that in some \ncircumstances a partial-birth abortion will be the safest option \navailable for a late-term abortion. Testimony and other evidence \nadduced at the Judiciary Committee hearing amply demonstrate that this \nis not the case.\n  An article published in the November 20, 1995, issue of the American \nMedical News quoted Dr. Warren Hern as stating, ``I would dispute any \nstatement that this is the safest procedure to use.'' Dr. Hern is the \nauthor of ``Abortion Practice,'' the Nation's most widely used textbook \non abortion standards and procedures. He also stated in that interview \nthat he ``has very strong reservations'' about the partial-birth \nabortion procedure banned by this bill.\n  Indeed, referring to the procedure, he stated, ``You really can't \ndefend it. I'm not going to tell somebody else that they should not do \nthis procedure. But I'm not going to do it.''\n  In fairness to Dr. Hern, I note that he does not support this bill in \npart because he feels this is the beginning of legislative efforts to \nchip away at abortion rights. We have included a statement from him in \nthe Record. His opinion on the procedure, however, is highly \ninstructive.\n  I think Dr. Nancy Romer, a professor in the department of obstetrics \nand gynecology at the Wright State University School of Medicine and \nthe vice chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Miami \nValley Hospital, both in Dayton, OH, explained it best. I will quote \nher entire statement on this point:\n\n       If this procedure were absolutely necessary, then I would \n     ask you, why does no one that I work with do it? We have two \n     high-risk obstetricians, and a medical department of about 40 \n     obstetricians, and nobody does it. We care for and do second-\n     trimester abortions, and we have peer review. We are watching \n     each other, and if we truly were doing alternative procedures \n     that were killing women left and right, we would be out there \n     looking for something better. We would be going to Dr. \n     Haskell and saying, please, come help us do this. And we \n     are not. We are satisfied with what we do. We are watching \n     each other and we know that the care that we provide is \n     adequate and safe.\n\n  I think that says it all as far as safety is concerned.\n\n\n                        Misrepresentation no. 4\n\n  Another misrepresentation that should be set straight concerns claims \nthat the partial-birth abortion procedure that would be banned by this \nbill is in fact performed only in late-term pregnancies where the life \nof the mother is at risk or where the fetus is suffering from severe \nabnormalities that are incompatible with life.\n  I certainly do not dispute that in a number of cases the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure has been performed where the life of the \nmother was at risk or where the fetus was severely deformed.\n  Substantial available evidence indicates, however, that the procedure \nis not performed solely or primarily where the mother's life is in \ndanger, where the mother's health is gravely at risk, or where the \nfetus is seriously malformed in a manner incompatible with life.\n  The fact of the matter is--and I know this is something that \nopponents of the bill have not faced--this procedure is being performed \nwhere there are only minor problems with the fetus, and for purely \nelective reasons.\n  Dr. Haskell stated in testimony given under oath last month, on \nNovember 8, 1995, in Federal district court in Ohio, that he performs \nthe procedure on second trimester patients for some medical and some \nnot so medical reasons. [See Dist. Ct. Tr. at 104.] That court \ntranscript is part of the hearing record.\n  In transcripts from Dr. Haskell's 1993 interview with the American \nMedical News--also part of the hearing record--Dr. Haskell states \n``most of my abortions are elective in the 20-24 week range. In my \nparticular case, probably 20 percent are for genetic reasons [and] the \nother 80 percent are purely elective.'' Meaning that 80 percent of \nthose kids that are destroyed are normal kids.\n  Dr. Romer testified that she has cared for patients who had received \na partial-birth abortion from Dr. Haskell for reasons that were purely \nbased on the woman not wanting a baby, for--as she put it--social \nreasons.\n  Most important, however, medical testimony at our hearing indicated \nthat a health exception in this bill is \n\n[[Page S 17884]]\nnot necessary because other abortion procedures are in fact safer and \nbetter for women's health.\n  As for examples of overly broad health rationales for this procedure, \nDr. McMahon indicated--in a 1995 letter submitted to Congress and in a \n1993 interview with the American Medical News--that, although all of \nthe third trimester abortions he performed were nonelective, \napproximately 80 percent of the abortions he performed after 20 weeks \nof pregnancy were therapeutic.\n  Dr. McMahon then provided the House Judiciary Committee with a \nlisting of the so-called therapeutic indications for which he performed \nthe procedure. That list is a real eye opener.\n  The single most common reason for which the partial-birth abortion \nwas performed by him was maternal depression. He also listed substance \nabuse on the part of the mother as a therapeutic reason for which he \nperformed the procedure.\n  In terms of fetal so-called abnormalities, Dr. McMahon's own list \nindicates that he performed the procedure numerous times in cases in \nwhich the fetus had no more serious a problem than a cleft lip.\n  Dr. Haskell has similarly acknowledged that he is not performing the \nprocedure in critical instances of maternal or fetal health. In Dr. \nHaskell's testimony in Federal district court in Ohio last month, Dr. \nHaskell stated: ``Patients that are critically ill at the time they're \nreferred for termination, I probably would not see. Most of the \npatients that are referred to me for termination are at least healthy \nenough to undergo an operation on an outpatient basis or else I would \nnot undertake it.''\n\n  When asked about the specific health-related reasons for which he \nperformed the partial-birth abortion procedure, Dr. Haskell specified \nthat he has performed the procedure in cases involving high blood \npressure, diabetes, and agoraphobia on the part of the mother. [See \nDist. Ct. Tr. at 105.] Of course, agoraphobia is the fear of going \noutside. Dr. Haskell acknowledged that in district court. That, to me, \nis outrageous.\n  Now, let me be perfectly clear that I do not doubt that in some cases \nthis procedure was done where there were life-threatening indications.\n  However, I simply must emphasize two points.\n  First, those cases are by far in the minority. We should get the \nfacts straight so that our colleagues and the American people \nunderstand what is going on here.\n  Second, the most credible testimony at our hearing--confirmed by \nother available evidence--indicates that even where serious maternal \nhealth issues exist or severe fetal abnormalities arise, there will \nalways be other, safer abortion procedures available that this bill \ndoes not touch.\n\n\n                        Misrepresentation No. 5\n\n  Finally, the next misrepresentation I would like to correct concerns \nwhether this procedure exists. That claim should be put to rest once \nand for all.\n  Some opponents of this measure still insist on claiming that the \nprocedure banned by this bill--the partial-birth abortion procedure--\ndoes not exist solely because the two doctors who have admitted \nperforming the procedure--the late Dr. McMahon of Los Angeles and Dr. \nHaskell of Ohio--used different terms for the procedure.\n  The bill clearly defines the term partial-birth abortion as ``an \nabortion in which the person performing the abortion partially \nvaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and \ncompleting the delivery.'' I think that the term partial-birth abortion \ndoes provide an accurate, shorthand description of that full \ndefinition.\n  Dr. Haskell refers to the procedure as a D, while the late Dr. \nMcMahon referred to the procedure as an intact D As medical \nwitnesses at the hearing pointed out, the procedures--by whatever \nname--are virtually unheard of in the medical and scientific \nliterature.\n  As Dr. Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill wrote to me, ``The term `partial-birth abortion' is accurate as \napplied to the procedure described by Dr. Martin Haskell in his 1992 \npaper. There is no standard medical term for this method.''\n  I submit that there is no medically accepted terminology for the \nprocedure because the procedure has not been medically accepted.\n  There can be no question, however, that the procedure banned by this \nbill does exist and has been performed repeatedly. That is disturbing. \nIt is troubling.\n  We should be confronting the ethical dilemmas the procedure raises \nrather than sticking our heads in the sand and quibbling about whether \nthe procedure exists under any particular name or another.\n\n  On that note, I would like to close by highlighting a statement made \nat our hearing by Helen Alvare of the National Conference of Catholic \nBishops. She remarked that opponents of this bill keep asking whether \nenacting it would be the first step in an effort to ban all abortions.\n  In her view, however, the real question should be whether allowing \nthis procedure would serve as a first step toward legalized \ninfanticide. I urge the bill's opponents to ask themselves this \nquestion. What is the real purpose of this procedure?\n  That is the fundamental problem with this procedure. It involves \nkilling a partially delivered baby.\n  The previous debate on this bill ended when the Senate voted to \nrequire a Judiciary Committee hearing. Let me say to my colleagues in \nthe Senate that the testimony presented during this hearing more than \nconfirmed my view that this procedure is never medically necessary and \nshould be banned.\n  This testimony, regardless of one's view on the broader issue of \nabortion, provides ample justification for an ``aye'' vote on H.R. \n1833.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Senator Boxer and I \nhave an informal agreement that after approximately 30 minutes I would \nyield the floor to her, if the Chair would be kind enough to remind me \nif I get carried away.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 1833, the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995. I at this time would like to \nexpress my sincere gratitude to the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, \nfirst, for his splendid leadership on the issue of protecting the \nrights of the unborn. He has long been a champion of that issue, long \nbefore this Senator came to the Senate. But, also, I thank him for \nconducting the hearing, doing it in a fair manner, allowing all \nwitnesses on both sides of the issue to be heard. He certainly \nperformed a very valuable service, and I very much owe him a debt of \ngratitude for that.\n  Mr. President, as I am sure you know, initially I opposed the motion \nto refer this bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing \ngiven the full record developed during the House's consideration of the \nbill. I did not really believe that the Senate needed to have a \nhearing. The House had extensive hearings on the bill, as you know, and \nquite a bit of debate.\n  Ultimately, however, I agreed to support the motion to refer the bill \nto the committee for the hearing because I was convinced that the more \nmy colleagues could learn about this procedure about the brutality and \nthe inhumaneness of it, the so-called partial-birth abortion procedure, \nI believed that the more my colleagues learned, the more I would have \nan opportunity to get more votes, frankly, in opposition to it. I \nbelieve that the bill will garner support, in other words, garner \nsupport to outlaw this procedure.\n\n  Later in my remarks today I am going to comment in some detail about \nthe excellent hearing held by Senator Hatch and the Judiciary Committee \non H.R. 1833. That hearing was held on November 17.\n  But first, Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues of \njust why it is that we are here. I want to focus again one more time on \nexactly what a partial-birth abortion is. The term ``birth'' involved \nin this procedure is somewhat interesting in the sense that it is \ncalled a partial birth, yet it is an abortion. I want to remind my \ncolleagues of why a supermajority, a two-thirds majority, of the House \nof Representatives voted to pass this bill on November 1--two-thirds. \nAnd I would also like to remind my colleagues of why that supermajority \nencompassed both party and ideological lines on both sides, why it \ncrossed those party \n\n[[Page S 17885]]\nand ideological lines, why it included such people as House minority \nleader Richard Gephardt, Speaker Gingrich, House minority whip David \nBonior, and House majority leader Dick Armey, pro-choice Democrat \nPatrick Kennedy, and pro-choice Republican Susan Molinari.\n  Mr. President, the sole purpose of H.R. 1833 is to ban a very \nspecific method of abortion that is performed at a time in the \ngestation period of about 5 months and continues on through the ninth \nmonth of gestation. So at any period of time between the fifth and the \nninth month of gestation right up until the day of birth, these \nabortions can be and are performed.\n  These are late-term babies, Mr. President. There really is not any \nother term for it. You can cover it up and coat it a little bit by \nusing other terms. But they are late-term babies, the youngest of \nwhom--the youngest of whom--at 5 months may have a fighting chance to \nlive on their own outside of the womb, and the older of whom \nunquestionably, unless there were severe abnormalities or birth \ndefects, could live outside the womb.\n  So this specific abortion method called partial-birth abortion--that \nis what it is called--it is a straightforward, plain English term for a \nprocedure in which a living baby's body is brought entirely into the \nbirth canal, except for the child's head, which the abortionist holds \ninside the mother's womb, in other words, keeps the child from coming \ncompletely out of the womb, restrains the child, keeping the head \ninside the womb before he punctures the baby's head with scissors and \ninserts a suction catheter inside that incision and literally sucks the \nbrains out of the child.\n\n  It is understandable that the defenders of partial-birth abortions do \nnot like the clearly descriptive and entirely accurate term ``partial-\nbirth abortion.'' I think most people on both sides of the aisle would, \nif they do not always agree with, certainly respect the words of \nPulitzer Prize winning commentator George Will, who points out in an \nexcellent column in the latest issue of Newsweek--he says, ``Pro-\nabortion extremists object to that name, preferring,'' instead now of \npartial-birth abortion, ``preferring `intact dilation and evacuation' \nfor the same reason that the pro-abortion movement prefers to be called \npro-choice.''\n  Mr. Will goes on to conclude that what is intact here is a baby. That \nis what is intact, a baby. So, instead of ``partial-birth abortion,'' \nwe call it ``intact dilation and evacuation,'' the removal of a child \nfrom the womb after taking the child's life by inserting a catheter \ninto the back of the head through an incision made by scissors, with no \nanesthetic, and suck the brains out.\n  As I remind my colleagues today what a partial-birth abortion is, I \nam going to again use a series of illustrations that depict the \npartial-birth abortion procedure. I have done this before on the floor. \nI have been criticized for it. The press has not gotten it right. Some \nof them have not gotten it right. I was accused of showing photographs \nof aborted babies. I was accused of displaying a rubber fetus, whatever \nthat is, all kinds of distortions of the record.\n  But what I have here are simple medical diagrams. That is all they \nare. They simply say what the procedure is and simply show it in \npictures. I am going to show it again briefly here to show what we mean \nby partial-birth abortion because I think we should understand what it \nis.\n  As I do it, keep in mind that these illustrations have appeared in \nthe American Medical Association's official newspaper, the AMA News. \nThese are not my drawings. They are not drawn by the pro-life movement. \nThey are not drawn by anyone other than they appeared in the AMA News. \nSo they are medically accurate, they are straightforward, they are \nhonest depictions of the partial-birth abortion procedure as described \nin an 8-page paper written in 1992 by Dr. Martin Haskell who has \nconfessed, admitted, to performing more than 1,000--1,000--of these \nabortions--1,000 by one doctor, 1,000 abortions between the 5th and 9th \nmonth, Mr. President. Dr. Haskell's papers are included in the \nJudiciary Committee's official record of its November 17 hearing on \nthis bill.\n  In a tape recorded interview with the AMA News on July 5, 1993, Dr. \nHaskell himself said:\n\n       The drawings are accurate from a technical point of view.\n\n  Moreover, during a June 15, 1995 hearing before the House Judiciary \nCommittee's Constitution Subcommittee, Johns Hopkins University Medical \nSchool Prof. Courtland Robinson, testifying on behalf of the National \nAbortion Federation, was questioned by Congressman Charles Canady about \nthe same illustrations of the partial-birth abortion procedure that I \nwill be showing my colleagues again today. Dr. Robinson agreed that \nthey were technically accurate, commenting ``this is exactly probably \nwhat is occurring at the hands of the physicians involved.''\n  This is a person who testified for the National Abortion Federation. \nSo I think we ought to lay to rest the misrepresentations and the \ndistortions and, frankly, the outright lies that have been perpetrated \nabout me and about what I have presented on this floor. These are \nmedically approved drawings that even the other side says are \ntechnically accurate.\n  Dr. Watson Bowes, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the \nmedical school of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, also, \nin his own right, an internationally recognized expert on fetal and \nmaternal medicine, wrote a letter to Congressman Canady:\n\n       Having read Dr. Haskell's paper, I can assure you that \n     these drawings accurately represent the procedure described \n     therein.\n\n  Let us look at the first illustration. With the aid of ultrasound, \nthe abortionist determines the position the baby is in, and after he \ndetermines that, he reaches in with the forceps and takes the child by \nthe feet with the forceps and turns it around inside the womb. Keep in \nmind that this is a late-term living baby.\n  Then, as you can see, Mr. President, the baby's leg is pulled out \ninto the birth canal with the aid of the forceps. The baby is turned \naround so that it is a breech birth, because, obviously, if the head \ncomes out first, it becomes a breathing child. If the feet come out \nfirst, it can be aborted, not a living thing. That is what we are told.\n  So the abortionist has to turn the child around. Usually it is the \nother way around, but now we turn the child around and make a breech \nbirth here. So the baby's leg comes through the cervical opening and \ninto the birth canal.\n  In the third illustration, we see that the abortionist now has the \nchild enough removed from the forceps to be able to take the child in \nhis or her hands from, as you can see in the drawing here, somewhere \nabout midtorso. The abortionist takes ahold of this child, and he or \nshe begins to pull the child all the way out of the womb and into the \nbirth canal, with the exception of the head.\n\n  Let me just pause here for a moment to reflect on what is happening. \nIf this were a doctor and this were a happy time, a woman wanting this \nchild for whatever reason, this little child would be a patient--a \npatient, Mr. President. But this child is not a patient here, not in \nthis procedure. There is no choice of his or her own. This child is not \na patient. This child is a victim of the abortionist's hands. What \ncould be kind, loving, gentle hands are now the hands of death, \nbecause, sadly, the abortionist's purpose we now see coming in the \nfourth illustration.\n  The horror of this is beyond all imagination, as far as I am \nconcerned, having witnessed the birth of three of my own children, \nknowing what a beautiful experience that is to see. The abortionist \nholds the baby by the shoulders--I mean holds the baby by the \nshoulders--to prevent the child from being born, because the moment the \nhead comes through the birth canal and out into the world, it has the \nprotection of the Constitution of the United States.\n  So this doctor has to be very sure that this little head does not \nslip out, so he holds the child, he prevents the child from being born, \nbecause--and this may be a little girl or a little boy, but let us, \njust for the sake of argument, call it a little girl--if her head slips \nout, she is born alive. We cannot let that happen if we are \nabortionists, can we? That is a problem.\n  The columnist, John Leo, pointed out in his excellent article in the \nNovember 20 issue of U.S. News & World Report:\n\n\n[[Page S 17886]]\n\n       Stopping the head just short of birth is a legal figleaf \n     for a procedure that doesn't look like abortion at all. It \n     sounds like infanticide.\n\n  So, as I said, Mr. President, the abortionist holds the baby's head \nwith the hand tightly. Obviously, the muscular action here, the \ncontractions move this child from the womb. That is natural. But after \nthe gripping at the shoulders with these hands in an unspeakably brutal \nact of, I believe, inhumanity, the abortionist jams a pair of scissors \ninto the baby's skull. This is a late-term baby, fully capable of pain \nand feeling pain, and before he withdraws those scissors, which he \nopens to separate the wound, he enlarges that hole at the base of the \nbaby's skull and inserts that catheter.\n  As you can see in the last drawing, what was moments before a living \nbaby now hangs limp in the hands of the abortionist.\n  Remember what happens: Catheter in, suck out the contents of the--it \nis interesting, some of the pro-choice, pro-abortion people call it the \ncontents, the contents of the head, not the brains.\n  You see, it sounds too much like a baby or a child to say ``brains,'' \nso you say ``contents,'' as if we were talking about a can of beans or \nsomething that you empty. Then in order to kill this baby, he uses that \nsuction catheter to suck the baby's brains out--not the contents of \nsome inanimate object--and the dead baby then is removed.\n  I ask my colleagues, if that is not a baby there, what is it? I ask \nanybody who wants to take the floor today and say to me that you \nsupport this procedure, tell me what it is if it is not a baby. And if \nit is a baby, then we are killing it, are we not? If it is not a baby, \nwhat is it? What is it?\n  I ask my colleagues and anyone else who may be listening, if you \npicked up the newspaper tomorrow morning in your hometown, wherever \nthat may be--Anywhere, U.S.A.--and the front page of that paper said \nthat the local pound decided to kill 100 unwanted puppies and kittens, \nwith no anesthetic, by putting scissors in the back of the neck, by \ninserting a catheter in the back of the head and sucking the brains \nout, what would you think? My colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, \nAmerican people, I think you would be outraged, I think you would be \nprotesting probably in front of the SPCA; you would be calling it \nhorrible, disgraceful, and saying, ``What are we doing? Why would I put \nmy dog to sleep in such an inhumane manner?''\n  Well, Mr. President, we are doing it to children. We are doing this \nto children. There you have it. But for the decision of someone else, \nnot the baby, what could have been that beautiful journey in the \nprocess of birth, through the birth canal and into the world, which \neach and every one of us took because nobody got here without being \nborn--there may have been other procedures, I grant, such as a \ncesarean, where you may have been born, but in most cases through the \nbirth canal. But that beautiful journey from our mother's safe, warm \nwomb in the birth canal and out into the wonderful world. But that is \nnot what happens here. It is perverted by the abortionist into a savage \nrendezvous with death. That is exactly what it is. It is a rendezvous \nwith death.\n  Do you know what? I have been called an extremist because I have said \nthat, because I have been down here on the floor showing these \ndrawings, pointing out to the American people what this is. I am \naccused of being an extremist. What is the person who performs this \nact? What is that person? In a partial-birth abortion, the journey of \nlife, the beautiful process of birth--birth--this is not the average \nabortion we are talking about. They are bad enough, and everybody knows \nhow I feel about those, but that is not the issue here. This is the \nissue of late-term abortions, which is why so many pro-choice, clear-\nthinking, sensible Democrats and Republicans, liberals and \nconservatives, in the House of Representatives voted to stop it, \nbecause they were horrified by it.\n  The people who do it are the extremists. That is who the extremists \nare. This journey of life is interrupted in the ultimate act of violent \noppression. The abortionist uses his brute strength, his powerful \nhands, against an innocent little child, helpless, defenseless child. \nHe stops her journey into life, holds her by the shoulders and jams \nscissors into her head and removes her brains.\n  Mr. President, this is the United States of America. When I came to \nthe Senate in 1991, I never really dreamed that I would have to take \nthe floor of the Senate and defend the right of a child, perhaps as old \nas 8\\1/2\\ to 8\\3/4\\ months in the uterus, to have to stand here and \ndefend this child. What a sick, horrible perversion.\n\n  How could this be in this country? How could we possibly stand by in \nthis country and let this happen? But then, again, there is great \nprecedent for this, Mr. President, because we saw it in the Civil War, \nprior to the Civil War, a couple hundred years prior to the Civil War--\nalmost 300 years prior to the Civil War--well, 200 anyway. Slavery, \nwhich was a brutal act against our fellow mankind. We stood around for \na couple hundred years before we stopped that. But here we are.\n  What have we come to as a people? We stand here on the floor day \nafter day, month after month, year after year and talk about the great \nissues of the day--the deficit, the debt, whether or not we ought to \nsend troops to Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, nominations of Supreme Court \nJustices, great issues. We have had some great debates here. But what \nhave we come to, to be here on the floor, to have to try to stop \nsomething as barbaric as this? It should be stopped. It should not be \nhappening. We should not have to be here.\n  A little baby has a right to be born. In a partial-birth abortion, a \ndoctor who swore to the Hippocratic oath ``to do no harm'' does the \nworst possible harm to the youngest, most defenseless little patient \nthat he could ever have. No wonder the foremost expert practitioner of \nthis procedure, Dr. Martin Haskell, the man who admittedly performed a \nthousand of them, did not have the guts to accept Chairman Hatch's \ninvitation to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to defend \nhis procedure.\n  Mr. President, we spent hours on the floor of the Senate in the early \npart of November with my colleagues on the other side of this issue \ndemanding a hearing. ``We must have a hearing,'' I heard said. ``We \nmust have these people come in and tell us about this procedure, \nbecause we can defend it.'' But Dr. Haskell did not come.\n  In the November 20 issue of the American Medical Association's AMA \nNews, one of Dr. Haskell's fellow abortionists really told us why Dr. \nHaskell did not have the guts to appear at the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. Here is what he said, speaking of the procedure, and \nthis is Dr. Warren Hearn, author of ``Abortion Practice,'' the Nation's \nmost widely used textbook on abortion standards and procedures: ``You \ncan't defend it.'' He said, ``You can't defend it.''\n  That is why he did not show up. You cannot defend it.\n  Thankfully, however, Mr. President, a nurse who once witnessed one of \nDr. Haskell's partial-birth abortions, Brenda Pratt Shafer, did have \nthe guts to appear before the Judiciary Committee. This is how she \ndescribed what she saw:\n\n       I am Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse with 13 years \n     of experience. One day in September, 1993, my nursing agency \n     assigned me to work at a Dayton, Ohio, abortion clinic. I had \n     often expressed pro-choice views to my two teenage daughters, \n     so I thought this assignment would be no problem for me. But \n     I was wrong. I stood at a doctor's side as he performed the \n     partial-birth abortion procedure, and what I saw is branded \n     forever on my mind. The mother was 6 months pregnant. The \n     baby's heartbeat was visible, clearly, on the ultrasound. The \n     doctor went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and \n     pulled them down through the birth canal. Then he delivered \n     the baby's body and the arms, everything but the head. The \n     doctor kept the baby's head just inside the uterus. The \n     baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping and his \n     feet were swinging.\n       Then the doctor stuck the scissors through the back of his \n     head, and the baby's arms jerked out in a flinched, startled \n     reaction, like a baby does when he thinks he might fall. The \n     doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction \n     tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains out. Now, \n     the baby was completely limp.\n\n  Then, the last line--and I am going to end here and yield the floor \nto Senator Boxer--the last, most compelling line, ``I never went back \nto that clinic, but I am still haunted by the face of that little boy--\nit was the most perfect, angelic face I have ever seen.'' Brenda Pratt \nShafer. \n\n[[Page S 17887]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to take to the \nfloor this evening in a tough debate and one that I hope will lead the \nSenate to amend this bill.\n  This bill is flawed because it makes no exception, even for the life \nof the mother. It criminalizes a procedure, which means that doctors, \nby virtue of using it without having a chance to even explain it, will \nbe hauled into court, perhaps into jail. It sets us on a slippery slope \nthat greatly concerns me.\n  I speak as a mother. I speak as a grandmother. I speak as someone who \ncame here in part to protect people without a voice, the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  We hear similar arguments that my friend engaged in the last time \nthat this was brought to the floor, and the Senate wisely referred it \nto the Judiciary Committee. I want to thank my colleagues for voting \nwith us on that. We had to fight to get an agreement. This was going to \nbe rushed through, without hearing from the women who had a story to \ntell, without hearing from the doctors who think it is necessary, \nwithout hearing from the constitutional lawyers.\n  Very wisely, we took a deep breath and we sent this to the committee. \nIt was a good hearing. It was a balanced hearing. I hope Members will \nread the record very closely. Then I hope they will support amending \nthis bill.\n\n  I want to make a couple of comments before I go into a presentation \nthat I hope will pinpoint my arguments.\n  Mr. President, not every birth is a beautiful journey. We pray to God \nthat everyone we know and love--everyone, every woman, every family--\ncan experience the beautiful journey of birth without problem. I know a \nlot of women have had problems. It is not always easy. Not every fetus \nfinds a safe and warm womb. No, they do not. Some are born very early. \nSome develop terrible diseases and problems. Some women are diagnosed \nwith serious cancer, and they know they could lose their life if they \nproceed to term.\n  Life is not always, as somebody once said, a bowl of cherries. \nSometimes it is very hard.\n  Here we stand as Senators--not as doctors--outlawing a procedure, a \nmedical procedure. I daresay if you were at home and you had never \nheard anything about this before and you came back from, say, another \nplanet, and you turned on your TV and you were channel surfing and came \nto a station and were watching us, you would probably think this is a \nmedical school lecture. I watched the beginning of this debate on TV, \nand it was just like a medical lecture. There was talk about what \nanesthesia does. There was talk about what kind of instruments are \nused. There was talk about things that we have no knowledge of. We see \nmedical drawings--admittedly, done by physicians--medical drawings. \nWhat are we doing? This is not a medical school. This is not an ethical \npanel of a medicine school.\n  Senator Kennedy, I thought, had a very important sentence in his \nprepared remarks. He said some Senators could be accused of practicing \nmedicine without a license. That is not our job. I was not sent here to \nbe a physician, to judge medical procedures, or to be God. That is for \nsure.\n  I also take great exception to certain things that were said in this \ndebate. I want to put those right out there because this will be a \nlong-heated argument. I just want to go on record. It will not make a \nbit of difference that I am particularly offended, but I want to put it \non the record.\n\n  I want to say to my friends on the other side who are leading the \ncharge for criminalizing a medical procedure, that doctors who perform \nabortions are doctors. They are not abortionists. They are physicians. \nMany of them have saved women's lives. And you call them abortionists?\n  Abortion is legal in this country. They are doctors who perform \nabortions. They are being harassed. They are being threatened. This \nkind of rhetoric on this floor adds to the problem.\n  Case in point: My colleague said Dr. So-and-so confessed that he \nperformed abortions. He confessed. Notice the word. Who confesses? \nSomebody who is guilty of a crime. Abortion is not a crime in this \nNation.\n  Yes, there are those who want to make it a crime. They want to put \nthe women in jail. We will get to that another day, I assure you. If \nthey win this one, that is coming down the road.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of this issue, do not use \nthe term ``abortionist'' if you can help yourself. Say doctors who \nperform abortion. And do not say, he confessed. Then, my colleague \nsaid, He admitted.\n  Yes, you are right, this doctor did not come before the panel. Other \ndoctors did. They defended this procedure, said it was the safest \nprocedure, and said that other procedures were 14 times more dangerous \nfor the woman.\n  Maybe you do not care about the woman. We do not see on that chart \nthe face of the woman. Why is that? I say it is on purpose. It is a \nwoman carrying a baby. I say the word ``baby.'' It is a woman carrying \na baby who finds out in the late term some horrible thing she is faced \nwith, with her family.\n  So do not talk about confessing, and do not talk about admitting.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nDr. Haskell's attorney at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Center for Reproductive Law & Policy,\n                                                     New York, NY.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing on behalf of Martin \n     Haskell, M.D., whom I currently represent in litigation \n     challenging Ohio House Bill 135, which like H.R. 1833, bans \n     certain methods of abortion. Because of the pending \n     litigation, Dr. Haskell must decline your kind invitation to \n     testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, \n     November 17, 1995 about the federal ban on ``partial birth \n     abortions.'' Nevertheless, he asked me to convey you his \n     ardent opposition to the legislation, which will prevent him \n     from providing safe and appropriate medical services to his \n     patients needing second trimester abortions.\n       Unfortunately, over the last several years, Dr. Haskell has \n     been the object of unlawful violence and intimidation by \n     those who oppose abortion. In addition to physical harassment \n     at home and work, which have included blockages and threats \n     by abortion opponents, he has been the victim of a firebomb \n     that extensively damaged one of his clinics. As a result, Dr. \n     Haskell has recently refused public and media appearances \n     that my increase the risk of violence against him.\n       While Dr. Haskell is mindful that his appearance before \n     your Committee might clarify much of this misinformation \n     currently circulating about his medical practice and about \n     the purpose and effect of his legislation, he regrets that he \n     will be unable to attend. Please feel free to contact me if I \n     may be of further assistance to you.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Kathryn Kolbert,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In this, the attorney explains why the doctor did not \ncome and references the fact that this doctor, unfortunately, has been \nthe object of unlawful violence and intimidation by those who oppose \nabortion. In addition to physical harassment at home and at work, which \nhave included blockades and threats by abortion opponents, he has been \nthe victim of a firebomb that extensively damaged one of his clinics, \nand he has not made public appearances because there are some people \nwho happen to love him.\n  So, please choose your words carefully here. It could have an impact \nwell beyond your meaning.\n  I read the committee's hearing, the transcript, every word. I am very \nglad we had that hearing. It is not surprising, the doctors who \ntestified were split on the issue. Some said it is not a necessary \nprocedure. Others said it is quite necessary, it is the safest \nprocedure. Some said we need to have that procedure to save a woman's \nlife. Others said, ``We disagree.''\n  We do know one thing. The 35,000-member organization of the OB/GYN's, \nthe obstetricians and gynecologists, say no to this bill. The experts, \nthe legal experts are split on the constitutionality.\n  So, I say we need to look at the real-life people who have had this \nprocedure because they come to us with a real story, not some \nphilosophical point of view--and we all have them. As a matter of fact, \none of these women who came before us describes herself as a \nconservative Republican pro-life person. Imagine. And that testimony \ncannot be derided by anyone in this Chamber, regardless of his or her \nview. Those people told the truth about their lives, and they were \nbacked up by their families, and no one could contradict them. \n\n[[Page S 17888]]\nThat is the face that has been missing from this debate, the face that \nhas been missing, the mother's face.\n  I was very glad that we had the hearing because this mother came out \nand told her story. I am going to show you a photograph of this woman \nand her family: Coreen Costello, of Agoura, CA, she is 31, a full-time \nwife and mother of two. Her husband Jim is 33. He is a chiropractor. \nChildren: Chad 7, Carlin 5. She is now pregnant. She is in the third \nmonth of her pregnancy. I want you to keep that face in mind and the \nfaces of this family in mind. I want to tell you about her and her \nstory.\n  This is her statement. I am going to read it. It is brief. I want you \nto listen to the words and then I want you to think about what has been \nsaid here, the cruelty expressed toward the medical profession that \ntook a Hippocratic oath to help a family like this.\n\n       Ms. Costello. Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and members \n     of the committee, I would like to really thank you for \n     allowing me to speak to you today. My name is Coreen \n     Costello. I live in Agoura, California, with my husband, Jim; \n     my son, Chad; and my daughter, Carlin. Jim is a chiropractor \n     and I am a full-time wife and mother.\n       I am a registered Republican and very conservative. I do \n     not believe in abortion. Because of my deeply held Christian \n     beliefs, I knew that I would never have an abortion. Then on \n     March 24th of this year when I was 7 months pregnant, I was \n     having premature contractions and my husband and I rushed to \n     the hospital.\n       During an ultrasound, the physician became very silent. \n     Soon, more physicians came in. I knew in my heart that there \n     was something terribly wrong. I went into the bathroom and I \n     sobbed. I begged God to let my baby be okay. I prayed like I \n     have never prayed before in my life. My husband reassured me \n     that we could deal with whatever was wrong. We had talked \n     about raising a child with disabilities. We were willing to \n     take whatever God gave us. I had no problem with that.\n       My doctor arrived at 2:00 in the morning. He held my hand \n     and informed me that they did not expect our baby to live. \n     She was unable to absorb any amniotic fluid and it was \n     puddling into my uterus. That was causing my contractions. \n     This poor precious child had a lethal neurological disorder \n     and had been unable to move for almost 2 months. The \n     movements I had been feeling over the past months had been \n     nothing more than bubbles and fluid.\n       Her chest cavity had been unable to rise and fall to \n     stretch her lungs to prepare them for air. Therefore, they \n     were left severely underdeveloped, almost to the point of not \n     existing. Her vital organs were atrophying. Our darling \n     little girl was dying.\n\n  A peri--peri--a specialist recommended terminating the pregnancy. \nThis is not a medical school class, so I do not know the names of the \nspecialties.\n\n       A perinatologist recommended terminating the pregnancy. For \n     my husband and me, this was not an option. I chose to go into \n     labor naturally. I wanted her to come on God's time. I did \n     not want to interfere. It was so difficult to go home and be \n     pregnant and go on with life knowing my baby was dying. I \n     wanted to stay in bed. My husband looked at me and said, \n     Coreen, this baby is still with us; she is still alive; let's \n     be proud of her; let's make these last days of her life as \n     special as possible. I felt her life inside of me and somehow \n     I still glowed.\n       At this time, we chose our daughter's name. We named her \n     Katherine Grace, Katherine meaning pure, Grace representing \n     God's mercy. Then we had her baptized in utero. We went to \n     many more experts over the next 2 weeks. It was discovered \n     that Katherine's body was rigid and she was stuck in a \n     transverse position. Due to swelling, her head was already \n     larger than that of a full-term baby. Natural birth or \n     induced labor were not possible; they were impossible.\n       I considered a Cesarean section, but experts at Cedars-\n     Sinai Hospital were adamant that the risks to my health and \n     possibly my life were too great. There was no reason to risk \n     leaving my children motherless if there was no hope of saving \n     Katherine. The doctors all agreed that our only option was \n     the intact D procedure.\n\n  That is the procedure this bill will outlaw.\n\n     I was devastated. The thought of an abortion sent chills down \n     my spine. I remember patting my tummy, promising my little \n     girl that I would never let anyone hurt or devalue her.\n       After Dr. McMahon explained the procedure to us, I was so \n     comforted. He and his staff understood the pain and anguish \n     we were feeling. I realized I was in the right place. This \n     was the safest way for me to deliver. This left open the \n     possibility of more children, it greatly lowered the risk of \n     my death, and most important to me, it offered a peaceful, \n     painless passing for Katherine Grace.\n       When I was put under anesthesia, Katherine's heart stopped. \n     She was able to pass away peacefully inside my womb, which \n     was the most comfortable place for her to be. Even if regular \n     birth or a Cesarean had been medically possible, my daughter \n     would have died an agonizing death.\n       When I awoke a few hours later, she was brought in to us. \n     She was beautiful. She was not missing any part of her brain. \n     She had not been stabbed in the head with scissors. She \n     looked peaceful. My husband and I held her tight and sobbed. \n     We stayed with her for hours, praying and singing lullabies. \n     Giving her back was the hardest moment of my life.\n       Due to the safety of this procedure, I am again pregnant \n     now. Fortunately, most of you will never have to walk through \n     the valley we have walked. It deeply saddens me that you are \n     making a decision having never walked in our shoes.\n       When families like ours are given this kind of tragic news, \n     the last people we want to seek advice from are politicians.\n\n  I am going to read it again.\n\n       When families like ours are given this kind of tragic news, \n     the last people we want to seek advice from are \n     politicians. We talk to our doctors, lots of doctors. We \n     talk to our families and other loved ones, and we ponder \n     long and hard into the night with God.\n       What happened to our family is heart-breaking and it is \n     private, but we have chosen to share our story with you \n     because we hope it will help you act with wisdom and \n     compassion. I hope you can put aside your political \n     differences, your positions on abortion, and your party \n     affiliations and just try to remember us. We are the ones who \n     know. We are the families that ache to hold our babies, to \n     love them, to nurture them. We are the families who will \n     forever have a hole in our hearts. We are the families that \n     had to choose how our babies would die. Each one of you \n     should be grateful that you and your families have not had to \n     face such a choice. I pray that no one you love ever does.\n       Please put a stop to this terrible bill. Families like mine \n     are counting on you. Thank you very much.\n\n  I say we need to look at the real-life people who have had this \nprocedure. We have to put a mother's face on that drawing and into this \ndebate because we know what will happen.\n  Some doctors say that this procedure is absolutely necessary to save \na woman's life and protect her health. Others say no. What if the ones \nwho say it is necessary are right? You know who is going to pay the \nprice. Not the doctor, because he or she is going to stop doing this \nprocedure. There is no exception in this bill for the life and health \nof the mother. There is an affirmative defense. That means the doctor \nhas to go into court and defend himself or herself. The burden is on \nthe physician to prove that he was acting or she was acting to save the \nwoman's life and health. So the doctors will stop doing this procedure.\n  That is what this bill is all about. So who is left with fewer \noptions? The women. It is like telling women--we have seen this--they \nhad better not take a mammogram. We are going to say you do not really \nneed it until you are 50. We faced that debate. Well, that is the only \ntool we have to save her life. And we fought against that \nrecommendation, and we said to women who are 40 to go get those \nmammograms. Maybe we will only save 15 percent of you instead of a \nlarger number when you are 50. But that is the only tool we have.\n  So when we take a tool away, who will be hurt? Not the doctor. It \nwill be your wives. It will be your sisters. It will be your children \nand mine and their families.\n  We are over 90 percent men in this Senate. And I want to appeal to \nthose men in this Senate who talk about the beauty of the baby going \nthrough the birth canal as if they have ever experienced this \nthemselves. I take offense when you say you are the only ones who care \nabout babies and you denigrate people on the other side and say that we \nwill not talk about the babies. Well, I want to talk about the babies. \nAnd I want to talk about these babies who could have lost their mother, \na pro-life Republican woman who came here to testify.\n  So what I am going to do during this debate is concentrate on putting \na mother's face on the screen and putting her family's face on the \nscreen, and tell her story because it has been left out of this debate. \nI plan to talk about the chamber of horrors a doctor would have to go \nthrough if he did feel that this was the only option--and when he took \nhis Hippocratic oath, he said, to save the life of his patient--and if \nhe feels that is the only procedure; the chamber of horrors that he \nwould have to go through to protect a woman's health and even her life. \nI will lead you through what would happen to such a physician.\n  This is America. What are politicians doing in the hospital room? \nWhat are \n\n[[Page S 17889]]\npoliticians doing telling this religious woman how to lead her life and \nwhat to do? It is an outrage to me.\n  Roe v. Wade clearly says in late term the State shall regulate \nabortion, and here is a crowd who comes in here saying we are going to \nmake welfare be run by the State. Fine. Medicaid by the States--we are \ngoing to have medical savings accounts. We are going to let Medicare \n``wither on the vine,'' a well-known quote of Newt Gingrich. We do not \nneed a Federal Government. But now all the doctors in here--as far as I \nknow we only have one, and he was never an ob-gyn--are going to decide \nwhat procedure should be banned and what procedure should not be \nbanned.\n  So I am going to put the face of the mother on this debate. I have \nmany other stories we will tell in the course of time. I am going to \ntake you through what happens to a physician--physicians most of whom \nwho have brought thousands of babies into this world but may believe \nthat this is the safest procedure to use so that this beautiful mother \ncan get pregnant again and can stay alive for her husband and her \nchildren.\n  My colleagues, we have a lot of work to do. We do not even have a \nbudget, and they are talking over there in the House about shutting the \nGovernment down again. Why do we not do what we are supposed to do? Why \ndo we not stay out of things that are better left to the family? As she \nsaid, the last thing she wants is a politician involved in this \ntragedy. I think she wants us to do our job. Get a budget. Get a \nbudget. Sit down around the table. Let us negotiate. Let us decide if \nMedicare and Medicaid are important. Let us decide if environmental \nprotection and education are important. Let us decide how to balance \nthis budget in 7 years with a touch of humanity. So, yes, babies and \nkids can get health care and can get an education.\n  That is what we are supposed to do. But, no. We are here with medical \ndrawings. And do you want to know why people on the other side voted \noverwhelmingly for this bill? Because they never had a chance to amend \nit. We will give you that chance. We will give you the chance to show \nyour support for States rights. We will give you that chance to stand \nup for the life and health of the mother.\n  This is a different place than the House where the Speaker controls \nthe way things come to the floor. I know. I served there for 10 years. \nIt is real difficult.\n  We have a chance. We have a chance to think about these women and \ntheir families and craft a bill that will not put people like this at \nrisk.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this legislation \nthat I know is well intended. But I think it is wrong. Our colleague \nfrom California mentioned one witness. Let me read just a part of the \ntestimony of another witness, Mrs. Viki Wilson.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that her full statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Testimony of Viki Wilson to the Senate Judiciary Committee in \n           Opposition to H.R. 1833/S. 939, November 17, 1995\n\n       I'd like to thank the Judiciary committee for allowing me \n     to testify today. My name is Viki Wilson. I am a registered \n     nurse, with eighteen years experience, ten in pediatrics. My \n     husband Bill is an emergency room physician. We have three \n     beautiful children: Jon is 10, Katie is 8, and Abigail is in \n     heaven with God.\n       In the spring of 1994 I was pregnant and expecting my third \n     child on Mother's Day. The nursery was ready and we were \n     excited anticipating the arrival of our baby. Bill had \n     delivered our other two children, and he was going to deliver \n     Abigail. Jon was going to get to cut the cord and Katie was \n     going to be the first to hold her. She had already become a \n     very important part of our family.\n       At 36 weeks of pregnancy all of our dreams and happy \n     expectations came crashing down around us. My doctor ordered \n     an ultrasound that detected what all my previous prenatal \n     testing, including a chorionic villus sampling, an \n     alphafetoprotein and an earlier ultrasound had failed to \n     detect, an encephalocoele. Approximately 2/3 of my daughter's \n     brain had formed on the outside of her skull. I literally \n     fell to my knees from the shock. I immediately knew that she \n     would not be able to survive outside by womb. My doctor sent \n     me to a perinatologist, a pediatric radiologist and a \n     geneticist all desperately trying to find a way to save her. \n     My husband and I were praying that there would be some new \n     surgical technique to fix her brain. But all the experts \n     concurred. Abigail would not survive outside my womb. And she \n     could not survive the birthing process, because of the size \n     of her anomaly her head would be crushed and she would \n     suffocate. Because of the size of her anomaly, the doctors \n     also feared that my uterus would rupture in the birthing \n     process most likely rendering me sterile. It was also \n     discovered that what I thought were big healthy strong baby \n     movements were in fact seizures. They were being caused by \n     compression of the encephalocoele that continued to increase \n     as she continued to grow inside my womb. I asked, ``What \n     about a c-section?'' Sadly, my doctor told me ``Viki, we do \n     c-sections to save babies. We can't save her. A c-section is \n     dangerous for you and I can't justify those risks.\n       The biggest question for me and my husband was not ``Is she \n     going to die?'' A higher power had already decided that for \n     us. The question now was ``How is she going to die?'' We \n     wanted to help her leave this world as painlessly and \n     peacefully as possible, and in a way that protected my life \n     and health and allowed us to try again to have children. We \n     agonized over these options, and kept praying for a miracle. \n     After discussing our situation extensively, our doctors \n     referred us to Dr. McMahon. It was during our drive to Los \n     Angeles that we chose our daughter's name. We named her \n     Abigail, the name my grandmother had always wanted for a \n     grandchild. We decided that if she were named Abigail, her \n     great-grandma would be able to recognize her in heaven.\n       My husband grilled Dr. McMahon with all the same questions \n     that many of you probably have asked about the procedure. We \n     would never have let anything happen to our baby that was \n     cruel, or unnecessary . . . and Bill as my husband, loving \n     me, wanted to be sure it was safe for me.\n       Dr. McMahon and this procedure were our salvation. My \n     daughter died with dignity inside my womb. She was not \n     stabbed in the back of the head with scissors, no one dragged \n     her out half alive and then killed her, we would never have \n     allowed that to happen.\n       Losing Abigail was the hardest thing that's ever happened \n     to us in our life. After we went home, I went into the \n     nursery and sat there holding her baby clothes crying and \n     thinking she'll never get to hear me tell her that I love \n     her.\n       I've often wondered why this had happened to us, what we \n     had done to deserve such pain. I am a practicing Catholic, \n     and I couldn't help believing that God had to have some \n     reason for giving us such a burden. Then I found out about \n     this legislation, and I know then and there that Abigail's \n     life had a special meaning. God knew I would be strong enough \n     to come here and tell you our story, to try to stop this \n     legislation from passing and causing incredible devastation \n     for other families like ours. There will be families in the \n     future faced with this tragedy because pre-natal testing is \n     not infallible. I urge you, please don't take away the safest \n     procedure available.\n       I told the Monsignor at my parish that I was coming here, \n     and he supports me. He said, ``Viki, what happened to you \n     wasn't about choice. You didn't have a choice. What you did \n     was about preserving your life.'' I was grateful for his \n     words. This issue isn't about choice, it's about a medical \n     necessity. It's about life and health.\n       My kids attend a Catholic school where a playground was \n     built and named in Abigail's honor. I believe that God gave \n     me the intelligence to make my own decisions knowing I'm the \n     one that has to live with the consequences. My husband said \n     to me as I was getting on the plane to come to Washington \n     ``Viki, make sure this Congress realizes this is truly a \n     Cruelty to Families Act.''\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, here is what she said.\n\n       My name is Viki Wilson. I am a registered nurse with \n     eighteen years experience, ten in pediatrics. My husband Bill \n     is an emergency room physician. We have three beautiful \n     children. Jon is 10.

I literally fell to my knees from shock \n     [when told about this by the doctor]. I immediately knew that \n     she would not be able to survive outside my womb. . . . My \n     husband and I were praying that there would be some new \n     surgical technique to fix her brain. But all the experts \n     concurred. Abigail would NOT survive outside my womb.

And I said to him, what \ndo you think about that? He said, of course, it would be a terrible \nidea. And he followed through because he recognized the analogy that I \nwas making.\n  For the first time in the history of the United States, if this is \nadopted, we will be saying to physicians, this is what you have to do; \nthese are the procedures you have to follow.\n  I frankly have no ability to make that decision.\n  I wrote to the departments of obstetrics and gynecology of the \nmedical schools in Illinois and asked the people who were in charge \nwhat they thought of this legislation. I enclosed a copy of the \nlegislation, and I asked three questions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of these letters be printed in the \nRecord, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The University of Chicago, Department of Obstetrics and \n           Gynecology, the Chicago Lying-In Hospital,\n                                   Chicago, IL, November 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senator, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: Thank you very much for your letter of \n     November 9 regarding H.R. 1833, the ``Partial-Birth \n     Abortion'' bill. I shall address your questions in order.\n       1. The term ``partial birth abortion'' appears in the bill \n     to be a loosely defined entity and that makes interpretation \n     difficult. There is a procedure known as ``Dilatation and \n     Evacuation'' (D & E) which is done to interrupt late second \n     trimester pregnancies. Presumably this medically acceptable \n     procedure is not being addressed in the bill, but the \n     language is sufficiently vague that I cannot be certain. \n     Unquestionably, that procedure should never be outlawed. I \n     believe there have been rare instances in which some \n     physicians have done early third trimester interruption of \n     pregnancy, presumably for late-discovered lethal or serious \n     genetic defects, but I am not familiar with this procedure. \n     However, I assume these are done for medically appropriate \n     reasons.\n       2. I am strongly opposed and extremely concerned about the \n     Federal Government deciding the acceptability of medical \n     procedures in practice. These should be decided based on \n     medical information and not by a legislative process. It \n     appears ironic to me that the current emphasis in Washington \n     is to reduce the Federal Government's involvement in our \n     lives. The proposed legislation goes alarmingly in the \n     opposite direction.\n       3. A physician should obviously practice medicine ethically \n     and legally. I oppose the notion that criminal or civil \n     penalties be introduced into the practice of medicine in the \n     United States.\n       Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on these \n     issues. Please do not hesitate to contact me again, should \n     you desire.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Arthur L. Herbst, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Washington University School of Medicine at Washington \n           University Medical Center, Department of Obstetrics and \n           Gynecology,\n                                 St. Louis, MO, November 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: Thank you very much for your letter of \n     November 9, 1995, concerning the legislation H.R. 1833. I \n     will attempt to answer the questions as you have posed them.\n       One, I am familiar with the procedure, even though I have \n     never performed it myself. I do not agree with those who \n     support the bill. There are instances in which I think that \n     this procedure is appropriate. Two specific instances come to \n     mind. One would be when the life of the woman is in danger \n     and the most expeditious delivery of the fetus would be the \n     safest method for her. This method allows for that, since the \n     fetus can be delivered through a partially dilated cervix. \n     The other instance would be a fetus that is doomed to die \n     after delivery or has a series of severe malformations. \n     Examples of this would be fetuses that have no lungs or no \n     kidneys. Again, this technique of abortion can be safest for \n     the mother because it can be performed when the cervix is not \n     fully dilated. I believe it is cruel to force a woman to \n     carry a fetus to term when she knows that the baby will die \n     after delivery. One can imagine the psychological distress \n     that a woman would have when she is obviously pregnant and \n     people continuously inquire how she and the baby are doing. \n     Imagine having either to hide the problems of the fetus or to \n     not tell the inquiring person. Many times, the inquiries to \n     the pregnant woman are simply part of a normal conversation \n     between persons, but a woman who is carrying a fetus doomed \n     to die would find this a very stressful situation. The \n     instance in which this procedure would be useful is when the \n     discovery is made after 20-22 weeks of pregnancy. It can \n     become the safest procedure for the mother. I must also add \n     that I find it appropriate to perform this procedure when the \n     mother and fetus are both normal. I personally would never do \n     that, and I would have difficulty watching such a procedure \n     being performed on a normal fetus as an elective termination.\n       In answer to your second question, I have great worries \n     about the federal government having a say on what medical \n     procedures can and cannot be performed. This procedure is an \n     excellent example of why I think the federal government would \n     have problems directing the care of individual patients. \n     There are so many possibilities concerning threats to the \n     pregnant woman's life or fetal malformations that may or may \n     not lead to problems in the future. This also becomes even \n     more complicated because the state of medical art is \n     continually changing and what would be a threat to a woman's \n     life one year might cease to be one in future years, as \n     medical technologies improve. I believe that the federal \n     government is simply too cumbersome to micro-manage the care \n     of individual patients by individual physicians.\n       In answer to your third question, I have worries about the \n     imposition by Congress of criminal and civil penalties on \n     doctors performing certain medical procedures. It really is \n     tied to the answer to the second question, in that this is a \n     complex area and it is difficult to micro-manage from a \n     distance. I must say that I am very troubled by Section (e) \n     on page 3 of the bill. Physicians would find very little \n     comfort from the fact that ``it is an affirmative defense to \n     a prosecution or a civil action under this section, which \n     must be proved by a preponderance of evidence, that the \n     partial-birth abortion was performed by a physician who \n     reasonably believed the partial-birth abortion was necessary \n     to save the life of the mother; and no other procedure would \n     suffice for that purpose.'' Very few physicians would risk \n     prolonged civil or criminal proceedings, particularly in an \n     area that is so charged as abortion. The other problem with \n     this is that it is absolute in that no other procedure would \n     suffice for that purpose. It would be difficult in any \n     clinical situation to come to the conclusion the only one \n     procedure would suffice.\n       My greatest problem with this legislation is that we could \n     so frighten physicians that the best procedure for the \n     pregnant woman would be precluded by the legislation. We \n     physicians always wish to place the welfare of our patients \n     first, and bills such as this would make us weigh what we \n     believe to be best for patients against protection for \n     ourselves. I, as a physician, would like never to be put in \n     such a position. The welfare of the patient should always \n     come first.\n       I hope that my thoughts have been helpful to you, and I \n     appreciate it very much and am indeed honored that you would \n     seek my thoughts on this important and controversial issue. \n     If I can be of further help to you, please feel free to \n     contact me about this or any other medical issue concerned \n     with Obstetrics and Gyncelogy.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     James R.

Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: This letter is a response to your \n     inquiry of November 9, 1995, regarding Bill H.R. 1833 which \n     is to be discussed on November 17, 1995. You raised three \n     issues concerning the legislation and the procedure which I \n     will attempt to respond to.\n\n[[Page S 17891]]\n\n       Although I am not an obstetrician, I am somewhat familiar \n     with the procedure. The procedure that is performed is \n     generally done somewhat differently than described in the \n     Bill that was attached to your letter. The procedure \n     apparently is rarely done and is not done at all at this \n     institution. However, there are solid medical indications for \n     doing this procedure when it is deemed safer to perform this \n     than an operative procedure to remove the fetus either if it \n     is non-viable or the mother's life is in danger. Abortions \n     are not performed at this institution for a variety of \n     reasons. Therefore, the outcome of this legislation will have \n     very little impact at this level.\n       You did raise the question about how I feel about the \n     federal government having a say in what medical procedures \n     can and cannot be performed. I, as my colleagues do, feel \n     quite strongly that the role of the government should not \n     stray into the medical arena regarding what is appropriate or \n     nonappropriate therapy. As you know, all of the ramifications \n     from legislating at this level simply cannot be understood or \n     realized prior to the event and the results may be completely \n     different than those intended. Determining which medical \n     procedures should and should not be done should lie within \n     the confines of the institution performing these procedures. \n     This should be decided by sound medical judgement and where \n     appropriate, the ethical and moral considerations will be \n     discussed at a local level with the Ethics Committee.\n       In a similar vein, I feel that Congress imposing criminal \n     and civil penalties upon physicians performing medical \n     procedures borders on the ridiculous. If Congress begins to \n     legislate at this level, where can it possibly end?\n       I hope these comments are of help, and if I can be of any \n     further assistance, please do not hesitate to ask me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Donald E. McCanse, M.D.,\n     Vice-President, Medical Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Evanston Hospital Corp.,\n\n\n                      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,\n\n                                  Evanston, IL, November 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: In response to your letter of November \n     9th, I offer the following comments to your questions:\n       (1) Yes I am familiar with the procedure described in \n     legislation, HR 1833, but have not seen or done one. We do \n     not perform this procedure at this institution. In proper \n     hands (i.e. qualified physician) the procedure does have a \n     place in the armamentarium of termination procedures.\n       (2) The basic question is, does the federal government have \n     a place in deciding what medical procedures should or should \n     not be performed. I feel strongly not. This is a medical \n     decision.\n       (3) Similarly, Congress has no business imposing penalties \n     on physicians for performing a certain procedure. If any \n     government sanction would be appropriate, it might be at the \n     State Department of Professional Regulation.\n       The overall issue of freedom of choice in pregnancy \n     termination should not be clouded or interfered with by \n     dictation of how the termination is performed.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to provide input into this \n     important matter and thank you for asking for my opinion.\n           Respectfully,\n     David W. Cromer, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Department of \n           Obstetrics and Gynecology,\n                                   Chicago, IL, November 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: I am an Associate Professor of Clinical \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Illinois and \n     currently in active practice of Maternal Fetal Medicine or \n     ``high risk'' obstetrics at both Michael Reese Hospital and \n     the University of Illinois Hospital. Therefore, the issue at \n     hand has great importance to me and to the patients for whom \n     I provide care.\n       I would like to answer your questions by telling you that I \n     am unfamiliar with the term ``Partial Birth Abortion.'' After \n     reading about it from descriptions in the press, I do not \n     find that it results in an outcome that is any different from \n     other techniques of abortion and, therefore, since abortion \n     is a legal procedure, I have no objection to it. I feel very \n     strongly that the federal government should not have a say in \n     defining which medical procedures should be performed. I also \n     believe that the Congress should not impose criminal and \n     additional civil penalties on doctors because they perform \n     one medical procedure and not another to accomplish the same \n     outcome for their patient.\n       Prior to discussion of H.R. 1833, I was unaware of the term \n     ``Partial Birth Abortion.'' It is neither a term found in the \n     ICD-9 catalog of medical diagnoses or medical procedures \n     published by the American Medical Association nor can it be \n     found in any medical text book with which I am familiar. \n     After reviewing statements that have appeared in the press, I \n     understand that the term has been used to describe one of \n     several techniques that obstetric surgeons have used to \n     accomplish an abortion by enlargement of the opening of the \n     cervix or mouth of the womb (dilation) and removal of the \n     fetus (evacuation). Dilation and evacuation (D), the \n     accepted terminology, is used to perform an abortion after \n     the first thirteen weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. \n     While many physicians perform abortions and have been \n     required to be trained to do that procedure by the American \n     Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, only a few physicians \n     perform D for which they have received additional training.\n       I present the option for D when I find, through the use \n     of ultrasound and other prenatal diagnostic procedures, that \n     the patient is carrying a fetus with severe congenital or \n     chromosomal anomalies. These abnormalities would leave the \n     fetus with severe structural or intellectual deficits, often \n     being incompatible with life after birth. Since these \n     diagnoses cannot be made until after the first trimester \n     of gestation, the patients who have chosen to end their \n     pregnancy require termination either by D or by \n     induction of premature labor. The latter procedure \n     requires agents to soften the cervix of the womb and then \n     use of additional medication to cause uterine contractions \n     which expel the fetus.\n       There are only two physicians of whom I am aware in the \n     Chicago area who perform D on patients beyond 20 weeks \n     gestation. I do not know if they at times use the technique \n     of D referred to as ``Partial Birth Abortion.'' Most often \n     D results in destruction of the fetus; however, one \n     physician to whom I send patients is adept at surgically \n     removing a fetus of late gestation (24 weeks or less) either \n     intact or with only minimal distortion. This has great \n     benefit for the patient because we are able to perform an \n     autopsy on the fetus and confirm any of the suspected \n     abnormalities for which the patient was referred. This \n     information might have an influence on the patient's future \n     childbearing since genetic patterns of inheritance may be \n     identified. It also may provide the mother with an \n     opportunity to see and hold this fetus if she wishes. This \n     brief contact may help her with mourning and ease the burden \n     of losing a pregnancy.\n       You have asked if I ``share the sense of those who support \n     the bill that this procedure should not be allowed under any \n     circumstance?'' I read the bill and found the definition of a \n     ``Partial Birth Abortion'' contained within it extremely \n     vague. Since this is not a medical term with which I am \n     familiar and the description in the legislation lacks \n     exactness, I cannot give you an answer.\n       I have another sense of the issue from reading accounts of \n     the procedure in the press and understand that the term has \n     been used to describe a D whereby the cervix is partially \n     dilated and extraction of a fetus is performed by pulling \n     down on the legs until the fetal head is just above the open \n     cervix. Since the fetal head is larger that its chest, it \n     does not pass through. An instrument is then used to compress \n     the fetal head so that it can then be delivered without \n     further opening of the cervix. It is unlikely that \n     manipulation of the fetal skull takes place on a fetus that \n     is alive since the umbilical cord which is attached to the \n     fetal abdomen below the cervix and the placenta above has \n     been compressed between the tight cervix and the fetal head \n     resulting in fetal death prior to head decompression. It is \n     true that this entire procedure results in fetal death, but \n     how does this method differ from any of the other techniques \n     of abortion? If abortion is allowed, this technique should \n     not be singled out as being any different than any other \n     technique that achieves the same end.\n       In fact, D may be more desirable as an abortion procedure \n     in that it takes only about 30 minutes to perform; less time \n     to accomplish than the 9 to 12 hours required for induction \n     of labor. This is an advantage to the mother since there is \n     less chance for blood loss and infection. In the past, the \n     Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia found D to \n     be the safest technique for abortion after the first \n     trimester. With particular reference to a D where \n     compression of the fetal head is performed, one can \n     hypothesize that there is less trauma to the mother's cervix \n     from further opening which would be required to deliver the \n     fetal head without decompression. Greater trauma to the \n     cervix has been implicated as a cause of an ``incompetent \n     cervix'' which results in repeated pregnancy loss. I \n     mentioned above the advantages of retrieving an intact \n     specimen for pathologic diagnosis and also in some cases \n     the possibility of helping the mother with the process of \n     mourning.\n       I feel very strongly that the federal government should not \n     have a say in the type of medical procedures performed by a \n     physician. The advantages of one treatment plan, either \n     medical or surgical, must be left to the process of peer \n     review. It is only by this method that those procedures which \n     have the greatest benefit and carry the least risk to the \n     patient can be identified. Medicine is a discipline founded \n     upon scientific principles and these principles would be \n     superseded if government intervened.\n       I feel equally as strong about Congress imposing criminal \n     and additional civil penalties upon doctors because of a \n     certain procedure that he or she performs. If the goal of the \n     procedure is to accomplish an end that is within the law, how \n     can Congress possibly call one procedure legal and another \n     illegal? The value of the procedure must be determined by the \n     medical community who can best judge its merit by its risk \n     and benefit to the patient. If the procedure endangers the \n     patient, the medical community, through \n\n[[Page S 17892]]\n     the process of peer review, will prohibit that procedure from being \n     performed. Physicians who perform procedures outside of the \n     standard of care can and do face civil and, even at times, \n     criminal penalties; but, the issue does not have to do with \n     the procedure they perform, it concerns the adherence to the \n     standard of care.\n       I hope my response has been of help. As I have indicated, \n     the term ``Partial Birth Abortion'' is not a medical term \n     with which I am familiar. If abortion is legal, I favor the \n     technique that will accomplish the goal with the least risk \n     and the greatest benefit to the mother. I feel strongly that \n     the federal government cannot decide the scientific merit of \n     one medical procedure over another and, therefore, should not \n     have jurisdiction over which medical procedures should or \n     should not be performed. Congress certainly should not impose \n     civil or criminal penalties on a physician for performing one \n     or another procedure.\n       I am most grateful to have the opportunity to respond to \n     this issue.\n           Cordially,\n\n                                          Laurence I.

Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Simon: I regret to have been unable to answer your \n     recent letter sooner but I was away and only today on my \n     return in the office, I found your letter.\n       I am still responding to your request just in case in view \n     of a budget impasse, the hearings of your committee have been \n     held as yet. Thus, I hope that this letter may be helpful to \n     you and your committee.\n       As to the issues raised in your letter regarding ``Partial \n     Birth Abortion, yes I am familiar with the procedure. Such \n     procedures are used very rarely and its proposed prohibition \n     is a thinly disguised assault on the women's reproductive \n     freedom and the physician's freedom in his or her profession. \n     Such a proposed legislation would be injurious to women's \n     health.\n       I vividly recall a patient many years ago who presented \n     herself to the labor room in premature labor, infected, sick \n     with high fever, and with her premature fetus partially \n     expelled in the vagina through an incompletely dilated \n     cervix. After administration of antibiotics, the baby had to \n     be delivered as rapidly as possible of this clearly now \n     viable fetus. Thus, a head decompression measure such as the \n     one described in the partial-birth abortion bill was used. In \n     addition, the baby turned out to be hydrocephalic. If the \n     proposed legislation was in effect, not allowing this \n     procedure under any circumstances, the woman would have had \n     to be exposed to a Cesarean Section for a non-viable fetus. \n     The invasive operative objective abdominal delivery would \n     have increased significantly for risk of spreading infection, \n     affecting her future fertility and perhaps compromising her \n     life. The democratic system of this Country expressed through \n     our federal government in its three branches, has permitted \n     the realization of a society that, if certainly not perfect, \n     is clearly admired by most nations in the World. However, it \n     is clearly inappropriate and dangerous for the federal \n     government to try to regulate the practice of medicine. \n     Professionals must be permitted to use their judgment on what \n     is best in the care of the individual patients rather than \n     fitting everyone in a procrustean bed made in Washington! \n     Imposing criminal and civil penalties on doctors performing a \n     medical procedure would have clearly a chilling effect on the \n     performance of any procedure, even when ``the physician \n     reasonably believed that the procedure was necessary to save \n     the life of the mother and no other procedure would \n     suffice.'' The law would clearly expose the physician's \n     judgment to second guessing by others whose opinions may be \n     colored by ethical standards not universally shared. This \n     legislative approach has no place in a pluralistic society \n     such as ours and it may result in health damage to many women \n     among our citizens.\n       Again, I apologize for the lateness in my response and hope \n     that this letter is useful for you and the committee in which \n     you serve.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Antonio Scommegna, MD.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Cook County Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and \n           Gynecology\n                                   Chicago, IL, November 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Senator Paul Simon,\n     Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon:  Thank you very much for asking me to \n     comment on H.R. 1833, the bill which address vaginal delivery \n     of late abortions. I am sorry that I was out of the office \n     last week and could not answer your letter in an appropriate \n     time and hope that this will not deter you from asking my \n     thoughts on future issues.\n       To answer your specific questions:\n       1. Yes, as you can see I am familiar with the procedure. \n     The issue of the vaginal extraction of late second trimester \n     abortions is an important one, and an issue that cannot, \n     because of its social, religious, and philosophical \n     implications be considered solely on the basis of its medical \n     justification. If we were to only judge the procedure on its \n     medical merits and compared it to other methods of late \n     second trimester abortion, it would be judged the safest \n     method for the mother when carried out by an experienced \n     operator. It is not however, an esthetically ``clean'' \n     procedure, and not one that a caring physician would do \n     except in the most demanding medically indicated situation. I \n     do not agree with those who supported this bill that the \n     procedure should not be allowed under any circumstance.\n       2. How do I feel about the federal government having a say \n     in what medical procedure can and cannot be preformed? I feel \n     that they should not dictate medical care and should not \n     intervene between a person seeking medical care and the \n     practitioner prescribing that care. Intervention of this \n     type, in which a particular procedure is chosen to solve a \n     medical problem, can only escalate to other procedures and \n     situations that others find morally or religiously \n     objectionable. There are many in this country who find male \n     circumcision reprehensible, should we ban those also?\n       3. My thoughts on imposing criminal and additional civil \n     penalties on doctors performing a medical procedure? Doctors \n     performing procedures that are medically indicated, carried \n     out without complication, and to the satisfaction of the \n     patient and or their families, should not be subjected to \n     criminal or civil penalties. The tort system, although \n     decidedly not perfect, imposes strict penalties on physicians \n     performing legal procedures in less than a satisfactory \n     manner.\n       Senator Simon, you can see that I do feel strongly about \n     government intervention between patient and physician. It \n     simply should not occur. Thank you again for asking for my \n     opinions and thoughts regarding H.R. 1833.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         Donald M. Sherline, M.D.,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Let me read just a few paragraphs from some of the \nletters. Dr. Arthur Herbst, who is the chairman of the department at \nthe University of Chicago:\n\n       I am strongly opposed and extremely concerned about the \n     Federal Government deciding the acceptability of medical \n     procedures in practice. These should be decided based on \n     medical information and not by a legislative process. It \n     appears ironic to me that the current emphasis in Washington \n     is to reduce the Federal Government's involvement in our \n     lives. The proposed legislation goes alarmingly in the \n     opposite direction.\n\n  The chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at \nWashington University in St. Louis, just across the border from \nIllinois, Dr. James R. Schreiber:\n\n       In answer to your second question, I have great worries \n     about the federal government having a say on what medical \n     procedures can and cannot be performed. This procedure is an \n     excellent example of why I think the federal government would \n     have problems directing the care of individual patients. \n     There are so many possibilities concerning threats to the \n     woman's life . . .\n       My greatest problem with this legislation is that we could \n     so frighten physicians that the best procedure for the \n     pregnant woman would be precluded by the legislation.\n\n  The vice president for medical affairs of the Rockford Health System, \nwhich is affiliated with the University of Illinois Medical School, \nwrites:\n\n       You did raise the question about how I feel about the \n     federal government having a say in what medical procedures \n     can and cannot be performed. I, as my colleagues do, feel \n     quite strongly that the role of the government should not \n     stray into the medical arena regarding what is appropriate or \n     nonappropriate therapy. As you know, all of the ramifications \n     from legislating at this level simply cannot be understood or \n     realized prior to the event and the results may be completely \n     different from those intended.\n       . . . I feel that Congress imposing criminal and civil \n     penalties upon physicians performing medical procedures \n     borders on the ridiculous. If Congress begins to legislate at \n     this level, where can it possibly end?\n\n  Dr. David Cromer, of Evanston Hospital, which is affiliated with \nNorthwestern University's Medical School, writes:\n\n       The basic question is, does the federal government have a \n     place in deciding what medical procedures should or should \n     not be performed. I feel strongly not. This is a medical \n     decision.\n       Similarly, Congress has no business imposing penalties on \n     physicians for performing a certain procedure.\n\n  The head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Michael \nReese Hospital, which is affiliated with the University of Illinois \nCollege of Medicine, writes:\n\n       You have asked if I ``share the sense of those who support \n     the bill that this procedure should not be allowed under any \n     circumstance?'' I read the bill and found the definition of a \n     ``Partial Birth Abortion'' contained within it extremely \n     vague. Since this is not a medical term with which I am \n     familiar and the description in the legislation lacks \n     exactness, I cannot give you an answer.\n       . . . I feel very strongly that the federal government \n     should not have a say in the \n\n[[Page S 17893]]\n     type of medical procedures performed by a physician.\n       . . . I feel equally as strong about Congress imposing \n     criminal and additional civil penalties upon doctors because \n     of a certain procedure that he or she performs.\n\n  Dr. Antonio Scommegna heads the department of obstetrics and \ngynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago:\n\n       As to the issues raised in your letter regarding Partial \n     Birth Abortion, yes I am familiar with the procedure. Such \n     procedures are used very rarely and its proposed prohibition \n     is a thinly disguised assault on the women's reproductive \n     freedom and the physician's freedom in his or her \n     profession. Such a proposed legislation would be injurious \n     to women's health.\n\n  And a very similar letter from Dr. Donald M. Sherline, who heads that \ndepartment at Cook County Hospital, which is a huge hospital in \nChicago.\n  I think, Mr. President, that what we have here is something that is \nwell-intended. I do not question the motivation of my colleague from \nNew Hampshire. I would ask every Member of this body to read the \ntestimony of these two women who testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee. Anyone who reads that testimony and believes we should deny \nthese women their right to safe health and put the physicians who give \nthem their health and save their lives, put them in prison for 2 years, \nI think you have a hard heart indeed. At least I do not have the \ncourage to say to those families, ``We're not going to let you protect \nyourselves.''\n  I think this is an example of the Federal Government running amok. If \nthis passes--and I know politically maybe it is going to pass \ntomorrow--I trust that the President of the United States has the \ncourage to veto this legislation and that we will protect the families \nof America from this political interference.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address one aspect of the debate \nover the partial-birth abortion bill: the argument that the bill is \nunconstitutional.\n  Opponents of this bill raise arguments challenging its \nconstitutionality that, I believe, reflect a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of constitutional principles and of the Supreme \nCourt's abortion jurisprudence. This is not only my view, but the view \nof numerous respected constitutional scholars at our Nation's finest \nlaw schools, such as, just to name a few, Michael McConnell, the Graham \nprofessor of law at the University of Chicago, and Douglas Kmiec of the \nNotre Dame Law School, and of other authorities on constitutional law, \nsuch as William Barr, former Attorney General of the United States. I \nbelieve that H.R. 1833 is constitutional.\n  Because of the timing in the birth process in which these abortions \noccur, these fetuses may actually qualify as persons under the \nConstitution. As such, they are entitled to all of the protections of \nthe law that all other American citizens receive under the Bill of \nRights, particularly the 5th and the 14th amendments to the \nConstitution.\n  This bill only applies to fetuses which are partially delivered. As \nsuch these partially born fetuses do not fall under the framework of \nRoe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey, which apply only \nto the unborn.\n  Although State laws on homicide and infanticide generally protect \nonly fully born children, at least 36 States allow recovery under \nwrongful death statutes for postviability prenatal injuries that cause \nstillbirth, and another one-third of the States consider killing an \nunborn child, other than through an abortion, as some form of homicide.\n  Given these statutes, some States logically have promulgated laws \nthat protect children in the process of being born, such as Texas and \nCalifornia. In light of this existing law, as Professor Kmiec, a former \nAssistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, it is entirely appropriate for Congress \nto pass a statute protecting such partially born children to clarify \ntheir status under the Constitution.\n  Opponents of this bill would have us believe that 3 inches and 3 \nseconds can make all the difference. In other words, they would have us \nbelieve that a living infant, capable of life outside the mother's \nwomb, and actually in the process of birth, is not a person, entitled \nto the full panoply of constitutional protections and rights, because \nit is 3 inches and 3 seconds from birth. Would the Constitution fail to \nprotect a fetus 2 inches and 2 seconds from life? One second and one \ninch?\n  Even if one believes that these children qualify as unborn, the \nSupreme Court's jurisprudence on abortion, principally articulated in \nPlanned Parenthood versus Casey, fully permits Congress to pass this \nban on partial-birth abortion. In Casey, the Court, speaking through a \nthree-Justice plurality, Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, tossed \nout Roe versus Wade's trimester framework and articulated three \nprinciples to guide courts in abortion cases. First, the woman has a \nright to terminate her pregnancy before fetal viability.--Casey, 112 \nS.Ct. at 2804.\n  Second, the interest of the State in promoting prenatal life permits \nthe State to regulate, and even prohibit, abortions after fetal \nviability, subject to exceptions for the life or health of the mother.\n  Third, the State has legitimate interests throughout pregnancy in \nprotecting the health of the mother and the life of the fetus.\n  Under this framework, this bill is constitutional because it only \nprohibits the abortion of living, viable fetuses, and only by one \nabortion procedure.\n  The medical testimony we heard in the Judiciary Committee indicated \nthat about two-thirds of the fetuses aborted in this manner are alive, \nand that this procedure is generally used largely, if not exclusively, \nduring the period of viability.\n  Further, H.R. 1833 is limited only to abortions in which a living \nfetus is partially delivered and then killed. The Casey right to a an \nabortion before viability is not implicated in this bill, because the \nbill exempts the abortion of nonviable fetuses and applies only to \nabortions after viability.\n  Opponents of the bill reduce our great Constitution to trivialities \nif they argue that the Constitution guarantees a right to a specific \nabortion procedure.\n  Nor does this bill somehow impose an undue burden upon the right to \nabortion, the test adopted by the three-Justice plurality which, I \nmight add, is not the law of the Supreme Court until it receives a \nmajority.\n  As Prof. Michael McConnell has written in a November 29, 1995, letter \nto the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Since this bill would ban only one method of abortion--one \n     that, according to testimony by medical experts, is quite \n     rare--it seems evident that it meets this standard. It can \n     hardly be an ``undue burden'' to require abortionists to \n     conform to standard and accepted medical practice.\n\n  Although the undue burden standard is rather unclear, it is still \ndifficult, if not illogical, to conclude that prohibiting one method of \nabortion, infrequently used, will interpose a ``substantial obstacle in \nthe path of a woman seeking an abortion.''--112 S.Ct. at 2820.\n  Women seeking abortions previability still may resort to D and D \nprocedures, which account for most abortions in this country. And, of \ncourse, women will have available the other methods of postviability \nabortion, which our hearings have shown are safer and more widely used.\n  The Justice Department and the bill's opponents have espoused two \nmain criticisms of the bill.\n  First, they claim that the bill must have an explicit exception for \nabortions performed to preserve the health of the mother, which it \ncurrently does not have.\n  Second, they claim that the bill's provision for an exception for the \nlife of the mother is unconstitutional because it is structured only as \nan affirmative defense.\n  Both arguments are, in the words of former Attorney General William \nBarr, meritless.\n  I will respond to them in turn, but let me note that legal experts of \nthe highest reputation and credentials find these objections to be \nunconvincing and unsuccessful.\n  Let me take up the fist argument. In Casey, the Court rejected the \ntrimester framework in favor of a bifurcated approach based on fetal \nviability, while reaffirming the core holding of Roe.\n  According to the Supreme Court, after the fetus becomes viable, the \nGovernment can prohibit abortion except in cases where the life or \nhealth of the mother is threatened.\n\n[[Page S 17894]]\n\n  This bill does not threaten a woman's right to have an abortion, nor \ndoes it threaten a woman's life or safety, because it leaves open \nalternative methods of abortion both before and after viability--\nmethods which the top experts in the field have testified are safer \nthan Dr. Haskell's method.\n  By banning this rogue method, we actually enhance the woman's safety, \nnot injure it.\n  I think it is worth quoting the experts on this point, due to the \ngreat weight that opponents of this bill have placed on this weak \nargument.\n  As Professor Kmiec testified before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       The bill by its focussed, targeted structure implicitly \n     provides for the health of the mother by not banning all \n     abortion procedures at this later stage of the pregnancy, but \n     only the one seen as patently and inhumanely offensive.\n\n  As Professor McConnell of Chicago concludes:\n\n       In light of authoritative medical testimony that partial \n     birth abortions are not necessary for preservation of the \n     mother's health, the bill could not be invalidated on that \n     ground.\n\n  According to Former Attorney General Barr:\n\n       Congress could reasonably conclude from the record that the \n     partial-birth abortion procedure is not safer for a mother's \n     health than other available--and well-established--\n     alternatives. It would therefore be pointless to include a \n     health exception in H.R. 1833 because this exception could \n     not be legitimately invoked.\n\n  It seems clear that a written exception for the health of the mother \nneed be included only if Congress attempted to ban all postviability \nabortions, not just this single, rare, offensive method of killing \npartially born children.\n  The Supreme Court has recognized many legitimate interests that may \njustify abortion statutes such as the one before the Senate:\n  First, safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, and in \nprotecting potential life;\n  Second, protecting immature minors, promoting general health, \npromoting family integrity, and encouraging childbirth over abortion;\n  Third, protecting human life, protecting the dignity of human life, \npreventing both moral and legal confusion over the role of physicians \nin our society, and\n  Fourth, preventing cruel and inhumane treatment.\n  Clearly, this bill furthers these interests--recognized as \nconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\n  The Clinton administration argues that this bill would force an \nincreased medical risk on women, and hence would violate the \nConstitution.\n  The administration relies upon two cases, Thornburg versus American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Planned Parenthood \nversus Danforth, for the proposition that any State regulation of \nabortion that might increase the medical risk to the woman is \nunconstitutional.\n  First, the factual basis for this argument is absent because there is \nno evidence that partial-birth abortions are ever necessary to preserve \nthe life or health of the mother.\n  In fact, the evidence presented before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand before the House Judiciary Committee demonstrated that this \nprocedure is often more dangerous to the life or health of the mother \nthan the other procedures used for late-term abortions.\n  Second, it is unclear whether Thornburgh and Danforth are any longer \ngood law. Casey overruled much of the holdings of these cases, and \nscholarly commentary--not to mention pro-abortion activists--initially \nattacked Casey for overruling several such abortion cases.\n  Indeed, the very trimester framework employed by Thornburgh and \nDanforth was clearly overruled by Casey.\n  Third, the statutes in Thornburgh and Danforth were clearly and \nutterly different from the bill before us. The State law in Thornburgh \nrequired that a second physician be present during a postviability \nabortion and that a physician performing a postviability abortion had \nto attempt to preserve the life and health of the unborn child.\n  This bill does not place such an obligation upon the physician. \nIndeed, the physician is free to use any other abortion procedure he or \nshe sees fit to protect the life and health of the mother, aside from \nthe partial-birth method.\n  Indeed, should the life of the mother be threatened, this bill even \npermits the physician to employ partial-birth procedures.\n  In Danforth, the state law outlawed the safest and most common \nabortion procedure for first trimester abortions. The Court struck down \nthat statute because it constituted a barely veiled attempt to outlaw \nfirst-trimester abortions entirely.\n  Here, there is nothing of the sort. In fact, the bill permits the \ncontinued use of the more popular, and safe, methods of late-term \nabortions.\n  Turning to the second main criticism, the administration and other \nopponents claim that the bill is unconstitutional because it permits a \ndoctor to justify a partial-birth abortion only as an affirmative \ndefense to a prosecution.\n\n  The fact that the bill provides the exception required by the caselaw \nin an affirmative defense does not unduly burden the right to an \nabortion.\n  As I noted when I spoke about this bill last month, many of our \nconstitutional rights arise only as an affirmative defense. Many of the \nprotections of the Bill of Rights sometimes can only be raised as a \ndefense to a prosecution.\n  To claim that the right to an abortion is not protected by an \naffirmative defense demeans the explicit protections of the Bill of \nRights; and it raises abortion above any other right in the \nConstitution.\n  Again, top legal experts I have consulted agree that there is nothing \nunusual in having one's personal rights evaluated by means of an \naffirmative defense.\n  As Professor Kmiec testified before the Judiciary Committee, the \nSupreme Court has approved the common practice of States to place upon \ncriminal defendants the burden of proving affirmative defenses, such as \ninsanity or killing in self-defense.\n  In fact, as both Professor Kmiec and former Attorney General Barr \nnote, it makes sense for this burden to fall upon the doctor, for it is \nthe doctor who is uniquely well-positioned to establish that he or she \nreasonably believed both that the abortion was necessary to save the \nmother's life and that no other procedure would suffice.\n  Let me address two other minor arguments that have arisen.\n  First, there are those who argue that Congress lacks power under the \ninterstate commerce clause to regulate the practice of abortion.\n  It is incredible to me that those who were in favor of the Freedom of \nChoice Act and the Access to Clinics Act would raise such an argument. \nNonetheless, I will give it the swift dismissal that it deserves.\n  Whatever one might think about the expansion of Federal power under \nthe commerce clause, whether H.R. 1833 falls within this power ``poses \nan easy case under current interpretation,'' as Professor McConnell \nputs it.\n  We can all agree that the provision of medical services are \ncommercial activities and that abortions are medical services. Even \nafter the decision last Term in Lopez, the Court has been fairly clear \nthat Congress may regulate all commercial activities, because they \nfrequently involve an interstate market.\n  If Congress can regulate health care, which it does today in myriad \ndifferent ways, it can regulate abortions. And, if this bill is \nunconstitutional, then a whole host of other laws, starting with the \nAccess to Clinics Act, are unconstitutional as well.\n  Second, some argue that this bill will unfairly punish nonphysicians, \neven though only those performing the partial-birth abortion are \nsubject to its criminal penalties. They claim that Federal aiding-and-\nabetting laws or misprison laws will hold liable nurses, \nanesthesiologists, or even rape counselors.\n  This argument does not even qualify as makeweight. For example, to be \nguilty of a misprison of felony, one must not just fail to report a \ncrime; one must actually engage in an affirmative, overt act of \nconcealment of a felony.\n  As Professor Kmiec concludes, ``Logic, prosecutorial discretion under \nthe policies of the Department of Justice, and the strict scienter \nelement necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the underlying \noffense, all suggest that any possible criminal liability . . . under \nfreestanding conspiracy, \n\n[[Page S 17895]]\nmisprison, or aiding and abetting statutes is highly speculative, if \nnot farfetched.'' One cannot help but agree with him.\n  The weight of both evidence and logic lead us to the conclusion that \nconstitutional objections to this legislation are mere red herrings \ndesigned to throw the debate off of the real issue--whether or not this \nhorrible procedure is justified.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n1833, the partial-birth abortion ban bill. Mr. President, as you and \nthe Members of the Senate know, on November 8, after 2 days of very \nspirited debate, this Senate voted to commit this bill to the Judiciary \nCommittee for hearings. There were a number of concerns that had been \nraised on the Senate floor. A number of these concerns, quite frankly, \nwere addressed during the Judiciary Committee hearing that I attended. \nSo I would like for a moment to take the Members of the Senate back to \nthe debate that we had on the Senate floor in regard to several of the \npoints that were made by the opponents of this bill and see how the \npoints that were made on that date, November 8, were, in fact, answered \nby the testimony that our Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Hatch, \nheard, the testimony that we heard at that committee, how it relates to \nthe arguments made by the opponents.\n  Let me start, Mr. President, with Brenda Shafer. Brenda Shafer, as my \ncolleagues will recall, is the nurse from the Dayton area who has \ndescribed in great detail exactly what this procedure consists of. My \ncolleague, Senator Smith, has in great detail described that as well.\n  While we were debating this issue on the Senate floor the last time \nit was up, on November 8, Brenda Shafer's credibility was attacked, was \nattacked by the opponents of this bill. Let me say, Mr. President, \nafter having watched Brenda Shafer testify, I do not believe anyone \ncould have watched her testimony, could have listened to her testimony, \ncould have observed her demeanor, and not come away with the conclusion \nthat she was not only telling the truth, but that what she saw was \netched and will be etched in her memory for the rest of her life.\n  Like some other Members of this body, Mr. President, I have been \ninvolved as an attorney in lawsuits. I was a county prosecutor for 4 \nyears, assistant for 2\\1/2\\ years prior to that. I have seen hundreds, \nprobably thousands, of witnesses on the stand. I cannot recall a more \ncompelling witness than Brenda Shafer. If anyone doubts that, I would \ninvite them to go back--do not just read the transcript that is \navailable, but go back and get a video tape from C-SPAN of her \ntestimony.\n  Let me take a couple points where nurse Shafer was attacked on this \nfloor and talk about how those particular attacks were rebutted by her \ntestimony. Nurse Shafer said that the partial-birth abortion procedure \nwas performed past the 24th week of pregnancy. She was attacked on the \nSenate floor for saying that.\n  One Senator quoted from a letter from a supervising nurse at the \nclinic where Brenda Shafer worked to the effect that ``Dr. Haskell does \nnot perform abortions past 24 weeks of pregnancy.'' This is a document \nentitled ``Second Trimester Abortion: From Every Angle, Fall Risk \nManagement Seminar, September 13-14, 1992, Dallas, Texas.''\n  On page 27 of this transcript, there was a paper delivered by Dr. \nMartin Haskell, ``Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester \nAbortion, presented at the National Abortion Federation Risk Management \nSeminar, September 13, 1992.''\n  On page 28 of this document--this is Dr. Haskell's own words--this is \nwhat he said, the author--now remember this is the same person that \nBrenda Shafer observed performing the abortion. ``The author,'' Dr. \nHaskell, referring to himself, ``performs the procedure on selected \npatients 25 through 26 weeks LMP.''\n  So Dr. Haskell, in his own writing, confirms what nurse Shafer said.\n  Let me turn to another point. The nurse was attacked also for her \ncomments about ultrasound. On this floor from the same letter, a \nSenator quoted, ``Dr. Haskell does not use ultrasound.'' Again, in Dr. \nHaskell's own report, this is what he says: ``The surgical assistant \nplaces an ultrasound probe on the patient's abdomen * * *.'' Again, Dr. \nHaskell's own comments.\n  In conclusion, I would simply say that again I would invite my \ncolleagues to listen to her testimony. Her testimony is compelling. It \nis shocking. It is sickening. And it also is backed up by the doctor \nwho performed that abortion, that is, Dr. Haskell, in his own words.\n  Let me turn to another issue that was raised on this floor in the \nlast debate. Anesthesia. After the bill was introduced, bill opponents \nargued, without medical evidence, that the anesthesia that was \nadministered to the mother killed the baby, so the baby felt no pain. \nThat was the statement that was made. One U.S. Senator said the \nfollowing. Let me read directly from the Congressional Record. ``The \nfetus dies during the first dose of anesthesia.'' That is from the \nCongressional Record. That was said on this floor.\n  Further, Dr. Mary Campbell of Planned Parenthood in a fact sheet said \nthe following, in answer to a question, ``When does the fetus die?'' \n``The fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the mother \nintravenously.''\n  Further, Kate Michelman of NARAL, at a NARAL news conference, \nNovember 7, 1995, here is what she said. ``There has been expert \ntestimony by physicians who do this procedure stating that the \nanesthesia that is given to the pregnant women prior to the procedure \ncauses fetal demise, the death of the fetus, prior to the procedure.''\n  Now, Mr. President, in spite of these three comments, in spite of the \nthree assertions that were made on this floor, the facts are directly \ncontrary to this.\n  This was brought out very clearly--very clearly--in the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. Again, I invite my colleagues to examine the record.\n  The confusion raised by these statements was so great in fact, Mr. \nPresident, that the American society came forward to set the record \nstraight, a society of people who do this every day, who administer \nanesthesia.\n  Mr. Norwig Ellison, president of ASA, came forward and testified at \nthe Judiciary Committee hearing. This is his written statement that was \npresented that day, and then he gave an oral statement where he stated \nit again. This is what he had to say:\n\n       The widespread publicity given to this view may cause \n     pregnant women to delay necessary and perhaps lifesaving \n     medical procedures.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       Pregnant women are routinely heavily sedated during the \n     second and third trimester for the performance of a variety \n     of necessary medical procedures with absolutely no adverse \n     effect on the fetus, let alone death or brain death.\n\n  Also at the hearing, when confronted with this fact, Dr. Campbell, \nwho I quoted earlier, changed her position. At the hearing, Senator \nSpence Abraham from Michigan asked her about the position, referring to \nthe fact sheet that the fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia. \nSenator Abraham said, ``This is no longer your position?''\n  Dr. Campbell replied: ``I believe that is true.''\n  In other words, she no longer holds the position that the fetus dies \nfrom anesthesia.\n  Further, Dr. Haskell, who performed this procedure on numerous \noccasions, himself had no doubts on this issue. The American Medical \nNews asked Dr. Haskell the following question: ``Let's talk first about \nwhether or not the fetus is dead beforehand.''\n  Dr. Haskell responded: ``No, no it's not. No, it's really not. A \npercentage are for various number of reasons and probably the other \ntwo-thirds are not.''\n  Again, one of the allegations that was made on this floor that the \nhearings clearly showed was wrong.\n  Some of the opponents of the bill would have the Members of this \nSenate and the American people believe that this debate is about \nwhether we ban all abortions. It is sad that this bill is really not \nabout partial-birth abortions, that what it really is is a covert \nassault on the decision in Roe versus Wade. This is totally false. Look \nat some of the people lining up behind this legislation: Congressman \nDave Bonior, Susan Molinari, Patrick Kennedy, Dick Gephardt. These \nindividuals are pro-choice. No one has questioned their pro-choice \ncredentials. \n\n[[Page S 17896]]\n They voted for this bill because they believe this is, in fact, a \nlegitimate public policy issue.\n  Mr. President, this is a legitimate public policy issue. This \nprocedure is especially cruel, it is unusual, it is inhumane, and it \nshould be abolished.\n  It is perfectly possible and intellectually consistent and coherent \nto endorse this legislation and simultaneously support the Supreme \nCourt decision in Roe versus Wade. This bill is not a ban on abortions. \nIt is not even a restriction on when an abortion may be performed. \nRestrictions of that kind were actually envisioned by Roe versus Wade, \nbased as it was on the differences of three trimesters of a pregnancy, \nbut this bill does not do that.\n\n  Even so, even though Roe v. Wade allowed for that kind of \nrestriction, this bill does not restrict the timeframe for a woman \ncontemplating an abortion. All this bill does is abolish one particular \nprocedure.\n  By now, we have all heard this procedure described in considerable \ndetail. I hope that we can agree that this procedure is especially \ncruel, unusual, and inhumane. This debate is about a very, very, very \nlimited number of abortions. It is a narrow, and should be narrowly \nstructured, debate. To my friends on the other side who argue that we \nsimply have to continue to allow this particular procedure to exist I \nsimply say, is there not any limit to what we as a society will \ntolerate, what we as a society will accept? How close to an actual \nbirth do we have to get in seconds, in inches, before we say, no?\n  Mr. President, the two witnesses who testified in front of our \ncommittee--my colleague from Illinois and my colleague from California \nhave referenced them--gave some very heart-wrenching testimony. No one \ncould have sat through that hearing without being moved, touched--\nreally those terms are not adequate for how anyone would feel, \ncertainly as I felt as I listened to the testimony.\n  I think, though, that what we need to remember is that neither of \nthese two tragic situations would have been affected by the bill we are \ndebating. H.R. 1833 covers only living fetuses, not fetuses that have \ndied in the womb. In both the cases, in both the tragedies that were \nrelated by the witnesses, their babies had died prior to birth. Their \nbabies had died in the womb. So this bill simply would not cover them.\n  We will continue to hear, I am sure, on this floor the argument made \nthat we should look at these two heart-wrenching situations. I simply \nremind my colleagues, whether in the Chamber or back in their office \nlistening to this debate, that we all agree these are just heart-\nwrenching situations. But we also should understand, and I ask my \ncolleagues to keep in mind, that these two situations are simply not \ncovered by this bill, and so it is really a bogus argument.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. The Senator from Ohio raises a \nvery important question--and I am paraphrasing it and if I do not do it \nright, he will let me know--when he asked this rhetorical question: How \nclose do you get to a birth before you just say no to abortion?\n  I think, clearly, that is a crucial question to be raised. That was \nthe question raised in Roe versus Wade when, in 1973, the Supreme Court \nlooked at the entire issue and tried to answer that question. What they \nbasically said was that in the first 3 months of a woman's pregnancy, \nshe is going to have the right to choose and she is going to make that \ndecision with her God. Government is going to stay out of that \ndecision. That is between her and her God. And as the pregnancy \ndevelops, the State has an interest. Clearly, States may regulate later \nin the pregnancy, and they do. But always under Roe versus Wade, the \nlife and health of the mother is paramount.\n  When my friend from Ohio says the most compelling testimony was from \na nurse, it shows his point of view here because I have heard back from \nmembers of that Judiciary Committee, even on the other side of the \nissue, who said they were riveted to Coreen Costello and to Viki \nWilson. They were riveted to hear a story from a pro-life Republican \nabout how she faced this and had to choose this procedure for her life \nand her health and because of her deep and abiding love, not only \nbecause she wanted to live on this planet but for her beautiful \nchildren.\n  So I guess, to me, what is more compelling than someone who served in \nthe clinic for 3 days and comes away and talks about it--I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time a letter \nfrom Nurse Shafer's supervisor, Christie Gallivan, an R.N.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Women's Med+Center,\n\n                                    Cincinnati, OH, July 17, 1995.\n       Dear Congresswoman Schroeder: I am a registered nurse and \n     have worked since July, 1993, in the Dayton office of Dr. \n     Martin Haskell. In this capacity, I was the nurse that \n     supervised the training of Brenda Pratt during her brief \n     temporary employment at the Women's Medical Center of Dayton. \n     As you know, we initially conducted a search of our \n     employment records under the name ``Brenda Shafer,'' as this \n     was the name she signed to the letter which was given to us. \n     When provided with the correct last name, we did in fact find \n     the record of her three-day employment at our Dayton \n     facility.\n       The information provided by Ms. Pratt as to our practices \n     at the Women's Medical Center of Dayton is largely \n     inaccurate. First, she describes Dr. Haskell performing one \n     25-week and one 26-week abortion procedure. Dr. Haskell does \n     not perform abortions past 24 weeks of pregnancy. This is a \n     self-imposed limit to which he has scrupulously adhered \n     throughout the time I have worked for him.\n       Second, Dr. Haskell does not use ultrasound in the \n     performance of second-trimester procedures. We use ultrasound \n     only to determine the pregnancy's gestation. Therefore, her \n     entire description of her experience when viewing a second-\n     trimester abortion, which includes Dr. Haskell's using the \n     ultrasound while doing the procedure, is clearly \n     questionable.\n       Finally, at no point during a dilatation and extraction or \n     intact D is there any fetal movement or response that would \n     indicate awareness, pain or struggle. Ms. Pratt absolutely \n     could not have witnessed fetal movement as she describes. We \n     do not train temporary nurses in second trimester dilatation \n     and extraction, since it is a highly technical procedure and \n     would not be performed by someone in a temporary capacity. \n     If, indeed, Ms. Pratt entered the operating room at any point \n     during a D procedure, she clearly either is misrepresenting \n     what she saw or remembers it incorrectly.\n       If you have any further questions, please feel free to \n     contact our office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Christie Gallivan, RN.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. In this letter, Nurse Gallivan says:\n\n       We do not train temporary nurses in second trimester \n     dilatation and extraction, since it is a highly technical \n     procedure and would not be performed by someone in a \n     temporary capacity. If, indeed, Ms. Pratt entered the \n     operating room at any point . . . she clearly either is \n     misrepresenting what she saw or remembers it incorrectly.\n\n  Since we are talking about compelling testimony from a nurse, I think \nit is very compelling that the American Nurses Association has written \nas follows:\n\n       I am writing to express the opposition of the American \n     Nurses Association to H.R. 1833 . . . which is scheduled to \n     be considered by the Senate this week. The legislation would \n     impose Federal criminal penalties and provide for civil \n     actions against health care providers who perform certain \n     late-term abortions.\n       In the view of the American Nurses Association this \n     proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the \n     Federal Government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care \n     provider.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This legislation would impose a significant barrier to \n     these principles.\n       . . . The American Nurses Association is the only full-time \n     professional organization representing the nation's 2.2 \n     million Registered Nurses through its 53 constituent \n     associations.\n\n  They respectfully urge us to vote against this bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to express the opposition \n     of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1833, the \n     ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995'', which is \n     scheduled to be considered by the Senate this week. This \n     legislation would impose Federal criminal penalties and \n     provide for civil actions against health care providers who \n     perform certain late-term abortions.\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an \n\n[[Page S 17897]]\n     inappropriate intrusion of the federal government into a therapeutic \n     decision that should be left in the hands of a pregnant woman \n     and her health care provider. ANA has long supported freedom \n     of choice and equitable access of all women to basic health \n     services, including services related to reproductive health. \n     This legislation would impose a significant barrier to those \n     principles.\n       Furthermore, very few of those late-term abortions are \n     performed each year and they are usually necessary either to \n     protect the life of the mother or because of severe fetal \n     abnormalities. It is inappropriate for Congress to mandate a \n     course of action for a woman who is already faced with an \n     intensely personal and difficult decision. This procedure can \n     mean the difference between life and death for a woman.\n       The American Nurses Association is the only full-service \n     professional organization representing the nation's 2.2 \n     million Registered Nurses through its 53 constituent \n     associations. ANA advances the nursing profession by \n     fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting the \n     economic and general welfare of nurses in the workplace, \n     projecting a positive and realistic view of nursing, and by \n     lobbying the Congress and regulatory agencies on health care \n     issues affecting nurses and the public.\n       The American Nurses Association respectfully urges you to \n     vote against H.R. 1833 when it is brought before the Senate.\n                                            Geri Marullo, MSN, RN,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. When we look at people who nurture, who bring their love \ninto medicine, who bring their compassion into medicine, who have been \nknown to place themselves at risk in the work that they do to save \nlives, I think it is very important to note that the American Nurses \nAssociation strongly opposes this bill.\n  We know that Viki Wilson, whose testimony was read so eloquently by \nSenator Simon, is a pediatric nurse, and she found herself in this \ncircumstance. So if we want to talk about compelling testimony, I guess \nthere was a lot of compelling testimony.\n  The reason I am keeping this family portrait up here is because I \nwant to keep this family's face right up here. Because with all the \ntalk about medicine and all the charts of drawings of medical \nprocedures, as if we were a medical school here, this has been \nforgotten. I will not allow these families to be forgotten in this \ndebate. This mother, this wife, this husband and father, and these \nchildren, who could have lost this extraordinary woman, who happens to \nbe a pro-life Republican, and who, by the way, wrote in her Op-Ed to \nthe New York Times--that is why I was grateful that we had the hearing, \nbecause more attention was paid to this. She said, ``Those who want \nCongress to ban the controversial late-term abortion technique might \nthink I would be an ally. I was raised in a conservative, religious \nfamily. My parents are Rush Limbaugh fans. I am a Republican that \nalways believed that abortion was wrong. Then I had one.'' Then she \ngoes into the pain of this late-term abortion, which was her only \noption. So, yes, I am leaving her face up here through this debate.\n  For those people who do not support a woman's right to choose, who \nsay that this bill is consistent with Roe versus Wade, I remind you \nthat Roe is very clear. Always the life and health of the woman is \nparamount--always, even when a State can in fact regulate abortion, \nwhich Roe says they can do under certain circumstances. There is a \nState interest. The woman's life and her health must always be \nprotected, always be protected. Yes, we had physicians who said this \nprocedure is not necessary to do, but we had others who said, clearly, \nthat it is quite necessary.\n  As a matter of fact, Coreen Costello, age 31, pregnant now with her \nthird child, her doctor said a cesarean section or induction of labor \ncould well have cost her life.\n  Well, Mr. President, we are going to have a long time more to debate \nthis. I am not going to go on too long this evening. My friend has been \npatient and has a lot more to say.\n  There is no such thing as a partial-birth abortion. There is no such \nterminology. There is no such thing. There is such a thing as a late-\nterm abortion, and it is always tragic and always undertaken because it \nis an emergency procedure. The life of mothers like Coreen may well be \nat stake, or serious adverse health consequences may arise from severe \nfetal abnormalities, such as organs growing outside the body. These \nlate-term abortions are not births or partial births. They are the most \ntragic emergency medical procedures.\n  So I ask again, why is the Senate taking this up--a ban on a \nparticular procedure used in these tragic operations? Is it because \nnobody is regulating these abortions? No. I explained that in Roe \nversus Wade clearly the State has the right to, and States do, regulate \nlate-term abortions. Is it because there is a surge in late-term \nabortions? No. That is not the case.\n  My colleagues will say that they are doing this because this is a \nterrible procedure. They throw away the arguments by physicians who say \nit is a necessary life-saving procedure and only quote those doctors \nwho say it is not. I thought you people were conservative. You should \ntake the conservative position. If even a handful of doctors think a \nwoman is more likely to die--14 times more likely if she undergoes \ncesarean section--then take the conservative approach and give the \nphysician every tool he or she can have, so that it can be a safe \nemergency procedure, so women like Coreen Costello and Viki Wilson, and \nthe others we will talk about in debate later, will live.\n  Well, I think I know what the real agenda is. I do not think it is a \nsurprise. It is not going to shatter anybody's mind when I say this. I \nthink there is a group of Senators who want to make abortion illegal in \nthis country. They ran on that platform. They are committed to doing \nit. They feel a woman should not have a right to choose.\n  If it was up to them, they would criminalize this procedure. They \nwould put the woman in jail. They would put the doctor in jail. They do \nnot have the votes, folks. They do not have the votes to outlaw \nabortion. They wish they did.\n  Now, with this Republican Congress they have more votes than they \nhave ever had before, and I hope people in this country understand \nthat. But they still do not have the votes to outlaw abortion straight \nout.\n  Just like those who came here to destroy environmental protection, \nthey do not have the votes to outlaw the Clean Air Act or the Clean \nWater Act. So what do you do? Cut the Environmental Protection Agency \nby a third; cut enforcement by two-thirds. This way you do not have to \ngo just right at it and repeal the laws.\n  The same thing here, but another issue. They do not have the votes to \noutlaw abortion. The Supreme Court, much to their dismay, upheld Roe. \nThey have said abortion is a constitutional right. So these Senators \nare trying to outlaw abortion not directly but indirectly and they will \ntake every chance to do it. That is what this is about.\n  Already, we have seen an erosion of a woman's right to choose. No \nabortion in military hospitals. Imagine, it is your daughter, she is \nstationed in Saudi Arabia, she cannot go to a military hospital. God \nknows where she will go.\n  As Senator Simpson said, and I read every word he said, when abortion \nwas illegal in this country, women obtained abortion. A woman risked \nher freedom to try and get an abortion. Doctors did the same.\n  I lived through those days. Women died. They died in back alleys. \nThey lost their fertility. We are not going back to those days. But \nthere are those in the Senate who want to take us back. That is what \nthis is about.\n  They may say it is nothing, you could be pro-choice and support this. \nThat is fine. They can say it. But if you read behind the lines, you \nknow that is the plan. That is the plan of the far right in this \ncountry. Take the victories where you get them. Force the President to \nsign the defense bill. Ipso facto outlaw abortion in military \nhospitals.\n  Now, if you are a Federal employee and happen to be a woman, you \ncannot use your own insurance for which you pay a good portion of the \npremium, you cannot use it to get an abortion. OK, that is gone.\n  How about this: one of the reasons the Health and Human Services bill \nhas not been brought up here is there are those in this Senate who want \nto stop training ob-gyn's to perform abortion. Folks, listen: It does \nnot say stop training them in this procedure. It says stop training \nmedical students so that no one will know how to do a safe and legal \nabortion in this country.\n  I stood here on this floor and I objected to bringing that bill \nforward because I knew that would be offered. \n\n[[Page S 17898]]\n How does that help a woman in this country, when she has to go back to \nthe back alleys, and the men in this Chamber stand up and talk about \nthe joy of giving birth?\n  I had the joy. Do not lecture me about that. And do not tell my \nchildren and my grandchildren that you know better for them than their \nGod and their daughter and their husbands and their wives. Do not do \nthat.\n  That is not what this Republican revolution was supposed to be about; \nif anything, it was supposed to be about getting Government out of our \nlives. Now they are putting it in the hospital room, in the medical \nschool.\n  We said when this came up, we should have a hearing. We want to put a \nwoman's face on it. We see these drawings. Time after time, day after \nday--where is the face of the mother? Where is the face of her husband? \nWhere is the face of her children?\n  No, we did not see that face, but we got that face. We had the time \nto get that face into those hearings. I am so glad colleagues stuck \nwith us on that one. It was going to be a close vote.\n  Yes, I hope our colleagues will read the testimony--all sides--and \nthey will find that the medical community is split. The lawyers are \nsplit. We already know the Nurses Association is strongly against this \nbill. Yes, we had one nurse who is for it who worked 3 days as a \ntemporary employee. That is if we believe the veracity of her \ntestimony. Yes, we have some doctors who say the procedure is not \nnecessary. But the ob-gyn organization says this bill is bad.\n  But no one can dispute Coreen Costello or Viki Wilson or John and Kim \nLeonetti, who I will talk about later in this debate, or the many \nothers who had the courage to come forward and tell their story. They \nare religious women. They are God-loving mothers. No one on the other \nside of this would dare stand up and say what they said was not \naccurate. They lived it.\n  That is what this is about. This is what is going to happen if this \nbill passes and it is signed into law without exception. People like \nthis do not have a chance.\n  We have a lot of work to do, as I said, in this Senate. We have a lot \nof appropriations bills we have to pass. We have to have a pass on \nBosnia. We cannot even agree on a budget, can barely agree on the size \nof the table that we are going to sit around. We have work to do.\n  I say people sent us here to fight about those priorities. I want \nthat debate. I want to know how Medicare survives after you cut $270 \nbillion out of it. I want to know how Medicaid survives when you cut \n$182 billion out of it. I want to know how senior citizens are better \noff when you repeal nursing home standards and go back.\n  You want to talk about compelling? Why do you not read what it was \nlike in the 1980's before we had nursing home standards from the \nFederal Government. It was pretty compelling. Grandmothers and \ngrandfathers were sexually abused, mistreated, scalded in the bathtub.\n  We have a lot of work to do. We should not get into what medical \nprocedure is appropriate and what medical procedure is not.\n  I will say this to my colleagues. If this bill becomes law as it is \nnow written--I believe the chances of that are nil; there is not even \nan exception for life or health of the mother, but say it did--and \nsomeone's wife dies, someone in this Nation loses a wife and a loving \npartner because of the action of this body, I tell that person, even \nthough their case could get kicked out of court, I would tell them to \nsue the pants off every U.S. Senator in this place who voted to outlaw \na life-saving procedure. I would make that case that we have no \nbusiness getting in the middle of a tragic family decision, playing \nGod, playing doctor without the foggiest notion about what it means to \nmake that tragic choice.\n  We talk about the joy of birth. God has blessed those people who have \nnever known such a tragedy as these families have known. You are \nblessed that you never knew such a tragedy. But do not stand up here \nand say in every single case it is all beautiful. How you can even say \nthat, in light of this testimony, is beyond belief.\n  One of the reasons we were so strong on having this testimony is \nbecause of what we heard here on this floor about how every birth is \njoyful, and there are no problems, and you do not need this procedure. \nI would have hoped we put that to rest, but it is back here again on \nthe floor, calling doctors names, vicious names, because they helped a \nfamily like this. I say to you, if that doctor did not help this woman, \nthat doctor would be violating the Hippocratic Oath.\n  So, I just hope we amend this bill. Abortion is a legal right in this \ncountry. If you want to take it on, if you want to have a bill \nintroduced to make it illegal, to put women in jail, go ahead. Let us \nhave that debate. But I really feel to set ourselves up as a special \ncommittee, like one of a hospital that delivers babies, to stand around \nhere and talk about what procedure should be done and what should not \nbe done, I just think we are off the mark as to what our responsibility \nis here.\n  This is going to be a very difficult debate. This is just a preview \nof it. I know my colleagues and I disagree. We try very hard not to be \ndisagreeable with one another. I certainly do not feel disagreeable to \nmy colleagues who take the other view.\n  I do feel, however, that they are looking at this in a way that \nignores women like this, men like this, kids like this, families like \nthis. So I will be bringing us back to these families, these \ncircumstances.\n  When you legislate, you do not legislate for the majority of people. \nThat is easy. Most times you do not even need to think about this \nsubject.\n  Of course, we cannot close our eyes and say it is a beautiful, \nbeautiful process, this process of birth. Nothing ever goes wrong, so \ntherefore we are going to say any and all procedures that may have to \nbe used in emergency, let us outlaw them, because maybe if we did, we \nwould not need them.\n  That is not the way to legislate. You legislate in a conservative \nfashion. You give the most leeway to people who may need every option \nat their disposal to save a woman like this and spare her family.\n  So, yes, we will come back to this. We will debate it. We are going \nto try to amend this bill. It is a tough one, and I look forward to the \nremainder of the debate.\n  I again thank my friend from New Hampshire for his courtesy, for \nallowing me to continue and complete my remarks, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I heard during the course of the debate \nfrom the Senator from California that we should look in the eyes of a \nmother. She used her example of a woman who went through this very \ndifficult decision, which I understand.\n  Here we can look into the eyes of a mother, Brenda Shafer. She has \ntwo children. She was horrified by what she saw, so horrified that she \nquit her job at that clinic.\n  We also heard the Senator from California make great mention of the \nlife-of-the-mother exception. Of course, there is a life-of-the-mother \nexception in the bill, but it is easier to say it is not in there, so \nwe can continue this debate, I guess; so we have something to say. But \nI guess my question would be something along these lines. If this is a \nlife-of-the-mother threat that Brenda Shafer witnessed, why was it done \nin an abortion clinic? Why was it not done in a hospital? If the \nmother's life is under threat, then I would certainly think it would be \ndone in a hospital where we could get the maximum medical attention, \nnot in a clinic, whose specific and only purpose is to perform \nabortions. So, you see that is another falsehood that is being \nperpetrated in the debate here.\n  Also, another falsehood is we are somehow part of the radical right \nbecause we oppose this procedure. The radical right, we were called. In \nthe House, Patrick Kennedy, son of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, voted for this. So he is in the radical right. I guess I \nmust have missed something in the newspapers somewhere. I missed it, I \nguess. The minority leader, former majority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives, Dick Gephardt, is a member of the radical right. And \nso many others who were pro-choice who voted for this bill.\n  You see, the reason they voted for it is because those on the other \nside are the radical ones. Nurse Shafer was so horrified by this, to \nher everlasting \n\n[[Page S 17899]]\ncredit, she stood up and exposed this for what it is. It is not done to \nsave the life of the mother. We have a life-of-the-mother exception, \nbut this is not done to save the life of the mother. As I said, if it \nis to save the life of the mother, then get the mother to the hospital, \nnot to an abortion clinic.\n  Nurse Shafer told the Judiciary Committee at its November 17 hearing \non this bill that this partial-birth abortion that she witnessed was \ncarried out--this is very important, I say to my colleagues--was \ncarried out because the little boy involved, the one with the angelic \nface that she describes right here: ``I never went back to that clinic, \nbut I am still haunted by the face of that little boy--it was the most \nperfect, angelic face I have ever seen.'' Do you know what that little \nboy was diagnosed with? Do you know why he was aborted? He was \ndiagnosed with Down's syndrome.\n  I have heard a lot today on the floor, from the Senator from \nCalifornia and from the Senator from Illinois and others, that somehow \nI am in the business of playing God here. When a woman electively, \nselectively makes a decision to abort a child because it has Down's \nsyndrome, that is the only reason, that is the little angelic face--\nbecause of that, only, that is what we are talking about here in this \nparticular case--is that not playing God? Somehow there is a twisted \nsense of logic here.\n  I guess I have to wonder where we draw the line. Is it a missing \nfoot, a deformed foot? Does that qualify for that decision? A cleft \npalate, does that qualify? I am having trouble understanding just where \nit comes down. Where does it come down? God? Playing God? Who is \nplaying God here?\n  Think about it: Down's syndrome. Do you know, we see Down's syndrome \npeople acting on television everyday. There is a television series \ninvolving a young man with Down's syndrome. This little baby boy was \nkilled with a catheter to the back of his head because he had Down's \nsyndrome, in the United States of America. He did nothing else. He did \nnot do anything wrong. He did not commit any crimes.\n  Even killers on death row who are executed are done so more humanely \nthan this little boy died because he had Down's syndrome. Where are we, \nin China? What is the next election, female child? Is that all right? \nMale child, twins, cannot handle that?\n  This little baby boy, described by Nurse Shafer, with scissors jammed \ninto the back of his head and the catheter sucking his brains out, his \ncrime was that he had Down's syndrome.\n  This little boy, as nurse Shafer said, was executed by Dr. Haskell \nbecause he had Down's syndrome. You know, it is no small irony, Mr. \nPresident, if I do say so myself, that we now see the sad spectacle--\nand it is a sad spectacle--of some of the Senate's most respected and \nvigorous liberal advocates of the rights of disabled persons in our \nsociety coming to the Senate floor to defend an abortion procedure that \noften targets disabled children, targets them for destruction for one \nreason--they have a disability.\n  That is what the Senator from California is talking about. No, I am \nnot playing God, Mr. President. I am not. I am trying to prevent other \npeople from playing God. I am not playing God when I am trying to \nprotect those under the Constitution of the United States any more than \nI am playing God when I say that a person in this country has the right \nto the protection of life under the Constitution.\n  Later on in this debate we may see an amendment. Who knows, somebody \nmay offer an amendment, offered by one or more of those so-called \ndisabled rights advocates, seeking to exempt the disabled from this \nbill who are disabled through no fault of their own, through some \ngenetic abnormality. How can they claim to be defenders of the rights \nof the disabled and turn around and single out to target, to execute, \nout of the womb--not in the womb; out of the womb--disabled babies? \nDisabled babies.\n  I would like to see an opportunity where one of these disabled young \nAmericans today, perhaps a young man or woman with Down's syndrome, or \nperhaps someone with a cleft palate or perhaps someone with a foot or \nan arm missing due to some horrible birth defect, I would like to see \nthat person come face to face with some of these U.S. Senators and look \nthem in the eye and say, ``You know what? No, I don't have the same \nprivileges you had in terms of health, but I am trying to make \nsomething of myself, I'm trying to contribute to society. And I'm doing \nit. And thank you, I don't appreciate it when you say you want to take \nmy life because of what I was dealt.''\n  That is what this debate is about. That is what it is about, Mr. \nPresident--make no mistake about it--killing disabled children. One of \nthe primary debating tactics that the defenders of the partial-birth \nabortions employ is to argue--they argue that this brutal, grizzly \nprocedure is utilized only in the hard cases, only in medical \nemergencies, only in medical emergencies threatening the life of the \nmother or in the case of severe congenital abnormalities.\n  But the words, Mr. President, of the only living doctor in America \nwho has publicly--I will strike the word ``confess''--admitted, \npublicly admitted that he does partial-birth abortions, Dr. Martin \nHaskell of Dayton, OH, has given the lie to this deceptive debating \ntactic. Haskell told the AMA News that the overwhelming majority--this \nis Haskell himself. This is not Smith, this is not the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio sitting in the Chair, this is not somebody from the \npro-life movement; this is Dr. Haskell himself. And in the AMA News he \nsaid the overwhelming majority of the partial-birth abortions that he \ndoes are for elective reasons--elective reasons.\n  Haskell performed 1,000 of them. So 800 babies, 800 babies --who \nknows what those 800 babies may have been--doctors, lawyers, maybe \nsomebody who came up with a cure for cancer, the first woman President, \nthe first black President? Who knows. We will never know. They never \nhad a chance.\n  In the United States of America this is going on. And people come \ndown here on the floor, time and time again, every time we debate this \nissue, and accuse me and others of playing God. Haskell said, ``Most of \nmy abortions are elective in that 20- to 24-week range, and probably 20 \npercent, 20 percent, 200 out of the 1,000 are for genetic reasons.''\n\n  So let us call it like it is and stop distorting the record and \nsaying things that are not accurate down here. Let us call it like it \nis--1,000 abortions, partial-birth abortions in the birth canal, \neverything but the head; 800 elective, 200 for genetic reasons.\n  Haskell later tried to claim he had been misquoted. It turns out, \nhowever, that the AMA News tape recorded the interview. They tape \nrecorded it. They prepared a transcript. There was not any misquoting \nin there. Dr. Haskell was quoted accurately.\n  Like I said earlier, Mr. President, no wonder he did not have the \nguts to appear before the Judiciary Committee and try to defend his \nemployment of this, because you cannot defend it. They have a bit of a \nproblem with Dr. Haskell's confession that he performs partial-birth \nabortions on perfectly healthy women with perfectly healthy babies.\n  We did not hear about that from the Senator from California. We did \nnot hear anything about the perfectly healthy babies. We did not hear \nthe Senator from California stand up on the floor and say, ``I support \nthat healthy baby having the right to live and not die at the hands of \nan abortionist with a catheter and a pair of scissors to the back of \nthe head.'' No, we did not hear about that.\n  They tried to claim that somehow the word ``elective'' includes \n``hard cases,'' quote unquote. Well, Mr. President, that is another \nblatant and deliberate deception. And as we debate this bill, there is \nlitigation going on in the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Ohio, which I am sure the Senator in the chair is aware of, \nin which Dr. Haskell is challenging the constitutionality of Ohio's new \nState law banning partial-birth abortions. He is an advocate. I give \nhim credit. He does not see anything wrong with it.\n  During the course of the proceedings in that case, Dr. Harlan Giles \nhas testified about what ``elective'' means. Dr. Giles is an \nobstetrician-gynecologist at the Medical College of Pennsylvania and \nAllegheny General Hospital who has a subspecialty in the field of \nperinatology, which includes maternal fetal medicine, high-risk \npregnancy, ultrasound and genetics.\n  During his testimony before the U.S. district court in Ohio, Dr. \nGiles was \n\n[[Page S 17900]]\nasked to tell the court what an elective abortion is. What is it? Here \nis what Dr. Giles said:\n\n       An elective abortion is a procedure carried out for a \n     patient for whom there is no identifiable maternal or fetal \n     indication. That is to say, the patient feels it would be in \n     her best interest to terminate the pregnancy either on social \n     grounds, emotional grounds, financial grounds, etc. If there \n     are no medical indications from either a fetal or maternal \n     standpoint, we refer to the termination as elective.\n\n  There we have it, Mr. President, 8\\1/2\\ months, bring the child 80 \npercent into the world, making sure you bring it out feet first so that \nit cannot breathe first, and kill it. That is exactly what we are \ndoing. That is what an elective abortion is, not for medical reasons. \nOnce in a while that is done. But that is not what we are talking about \nhere in 80 percent of the cases.\n  To sum up what he said is an elective abortion, it is one that is \ndone on a perfectly healthy mother with a perfectly healthy baby--not \nalways. Therefore, what Dr. Haskell told the AMA News is that 80 \npercent of partial-birth abortions he does are done on perfectly \nhealthy mothers with perfectly healthy babies. But we did not hear \nabout that today--nothing. We did not hear about that at all. That is \nthe truth.\n  I said during the outset of my remarks, Mr. President, that I would \noffer my colleagues a detailed assessment of the November 17 hearing \nthat the Judiciary Committee held on this bill. I would like to focus a \nfew remarks on that at the outset of this November 17 hearing. My \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, described H.R. 1833 as ``extremist \nlegislation at its worst.'' I found that somewhat puzzling that Senator \nKennedy would say this because his own son, Congressman Patrick Kennedy \nof Rhode Island, voted for the bill in the House, in the exact form \nthat it is here before us in the Senate.\n  So I assume from that that he means his son is an extremist, and he \nmay very well feel that way. I do not know. We already mentioned Mr. \nGephardt and Mr. Bonior. I guess they are extremists.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kennedy got it wrong, with all due respect to \nmy colleague. The real extremists are those who believe that partial-\nbirth abortions should be legal through all 9 months of pregnancy. We \nare talking about in the latter months of pregnancy, the latter days in \nsome cases. Those are the extremists; they think it is legal for \nHaskell to use this method to kill a little Down's syndrome baby. They \nare the extremists. That is who the extremists are.\n  Frankly, I initially opposed sending the bill to the committee for a \nhearing because I did not think it was necessary. But I am glad we had \na hearing. As you know, I agreed to have it and allowed the vote to go \nthat way, did not object, because I think that hearing transcript, \nwhich the distinguished Senator from Ohio had the opportunity to be a \npart of, is now available, and I invite my colleagues to review it in \ndetail. Before you vote, read it. It demonstrates just how bankrupt the \narguments are on this issue.\n  When this bill first came to the Senate floor on November 7 and 8, we \nheard the opposition floor manager, Senator Boxer, repeatedly assert \nthat partial-birth abortions are emergency operations. Senator Boxer \nsaid it again today, undertaken to save women's lives. During the \nNovember 7 floor debate on this bill, for example, Senator Boxer \nreferred to partial-birth abortion as ``an emergency medical procedure \nthat must be performed on certain pregnant women lest families lose \nthat mother forever.''\n  You heard it again today. During her appearance on ``Nightline'' with \nme on November 7, she claimed that partial-birth abortions are \nemergency medical procedures and asserted that H.R. 1833 would ``outlaw \nan emergency medical procedure.''\n  The next day, on November 8, Senator Boxer helped lead the charge on \nthe Senate floor for a hearing on H.R. 1833. And when the Senate agreed \nto refer the bill to the Judiciary Committee for the hearing, it was \nincumbent upon Senator Boxer and allies on the committee to produce \ntestimony to support her repeated assertions that a partial-birth \nabortion is an emergency medical procedure.\n  Well, they had plenty of time to prove it, but they failed to do so. \nYou were there, Mr. President. The lead witness that the opponents of \nthis bill presented was Dr. Nancy Campbell, who is the Medical Director \nfor Planned Parenthood here in Washington. Far from claiming that any \npartial-birth abortions are undertaken as emergency procedures to save \nthe lives of women, Dr. Campbell asserted that the vast majority of \nthese procedures are done because of severe fetal malformations. So Dr. \nCampbell's testimony failed to support Senator Boxer's claims. A \npartial-birth abortion that is undertaken to destroy a baby because the \nbaby has a disability is not necessarily an emergency abortion done to \nsave the life of a mother. So it is not true what is being said here.\n  At some point in the debate, perhaps tomorrow when we go back to this \ndebate--as the Chair knows, we are going to break at 7:30 and recess \nthe Senate until tomorrow, but at the appropriate time I am going to \nread into the Record comments in a large number of letters from ob-\ngyn's who take a very interesting view of this bill. They support the \nbill, and they say the process of partial-birth abortions is simply not \nnecessary to save the life of a mother.\n\n  In fact, regarding Dr. Campbell's assertion that the vast majority of \npartial-birth abortions are done because of severe fetal malformations, \nthat is also unsupportable. Campbell cited no academic studies, no \nmedical journal articles, no government or private statistics, \nnothing--nothing. Just stated it, no support. In fact, her statement to \nthat effect appears only in the transcript of her oral argument, not in \nher written statement.\n  So as I pointed out earlier, the only reliable testimony that we have \non this point comes from the only living doctor who is willing to admit \npublicly that he does these, Dr. Martin Haskell. Haskell told the \nAmerican Medical Association News that 80 percent of the partial-birth \nabortions he does are purely for elective reasons. It is entirely \nreliable because he does them. The man knows what he is talking about. \nGive him credit for admitting it. He is telling the truth. He is not \ntrying to hide it.\n  Campbell's assertion, on the other hand, is completely unreliable \nbecause she does not do partial-birth abortions and cited no other \nevidence to support her completely unsupported claim. It is interesting \nthat they had Dr. Campbell testify and she does not do partial-birth \nabortions and the guy who does do it, Haskell, he does not testify. He \ncannot be here.\n  The only other medical witness on the other side was Dr. Courtland \nRobinson, who is a medical professor at Johns Hopkins, and during his \ntestimony Robinson managed to contradict both Senator Boxer's claim \nthat partial-birth abortions are done for emergency reasons to save \nwomen's lives and Dr. Campbell's assertion that the vast majority of \nthem are done because of severe fetal abnormalities. On the other hand, \nthough, Robinson's testimony supports Dr. Haskell's statement to the \nAMA News that the overwhelming majority, 80 percent of these abortions \nare done for purely elective reasons.\n  We have all heard the debate on abortion, about whether or not a \nwoman has the right to choose in the first month, second month, third \nmonth. That is a debate that we have had on the Senate floor, and \neveryone knows where I come from on it. That is not the debate we are \nhaving on the Senate floor right now. We are having a debate on the \nSenate floor now as to whether or not we approve of this procedure that \nI have earlier described of allowing a child to be brought out through \nthe birth canal with the exception of the head and killed with scissors \nand a catheter with no anesthetic. And as I said then, would you kill a \npet, would you euthanize your pet in that way? Yet we do it to \nchildren.\n\n  During his oral testimony before the committee, Robinson said that \n``women present to us for later abortions for a number of reasons. I am \na doctor,'' Robinson continued, ``and it is not my place to judge my \npatient's reasons for ending a pregnancy or to punish her because \ncircumstances prevented her from obtaining an abortion earlier. It is \nmy place to treat my patient, a woman with a pregnancy she feels she \ncannot continue. \n\n[[Page S 17901]]\n\n  But bear in mind the timeframe we are talking about--5th through 9th \nmonth. I again give the doctor credit for his candor. In seeking to \njustify the use of the brutal and shockingly inhumane partial-birth \nprocedure, Robinson did claim, as Senator Boxer does, that these are \nemergency medical procedures.\n  Neither did Robinson assert, as did Campbell, that the vast majority \nof such abortions are undertaken because of severe fetal malformations. \nNo. Dr. Robinson told the truth. He corroborated what Dr. Haskell \nsaid--80 percent of the partial-birth abortions are purely elective.\n  So, in conclusion on that point, there are only two witnesses, \nmedical witnesses, that the supporters of partial-birth abortions \noffered at the 17th of November Judiciary hearing--Campbell and \nRobinson. Neither one had ever performed a partial-birth abortion, and \nthey flatly contradicted each other about why partial-birth abortions \nare performed, Campbell claiming the vast majority are because of \nsevere fetal abnormalities, and Robinson said they are done for \nelective reasons--in other words, on demand. No consistency whatsoever.\n  Now, the next two witnesses that the supporters of partial-birth \nabortion presented--and this is the interesting part--were two women \nwho had late-term abortions. Interestingly enough, however--and this \nwas not brought out by the Senator from California--neither one of them \nhad a partial-birth abortion. The Senator from Ohio pointed it out when \nhe was speaking, that neither one of the women had a partial-birth \nabortion.\n  The stories they told before the committee were very compelling and \nvery emotional, and I respect that. I understand it. But they were not \npartial-birth abortions. The first woman was Miss Coreen Costello of \nAgoura, CA. She explained to the committee that she sought a late-term \nabortion because her baby had severe deformities and was not expected \nto survive. She then described her abortion, and what she described was \nnot a partial-birth abortion. It was not a partial-birth abortion.\n  She said her baby died in the womb before any part of her was \nremoved. She said the baby was not stabbed in the head with scissors. \nThird, Miss Costello said no part of her brain was missing. Of course \nnot. It was not a partial-birth abortion. The baby died in the womb. \nThat is different.\n  Clearly, what Ms. Costello described is something else. I do not \nintend, Mr. President, to make light of the agony that Ms. Costello's \nanguish caused her over her baby's condition and her abortion. The only \nthing I want to point out is that this debate is about partial-birth \nabortions. They could not find anybody to testify who had a partial-\nbirth abortion because the life of the mother was threatened. They \ncould not find anybody to do it. That is my point. That is why we are \nhere, to stop a brutal practice.\n  To be honest, Ms. Costello's testimony, although very emotional and \nvery personal, is not relevant to the debate we are having today.\n  The second and last witness who had received a late-term abortion to \nsupport partial-birth abortions presented at the November 17 hearing \nwas Viki Wilson. The Senator from Ohio mentioned her.\n  Ms. Wilson, like Ms. Costello, told the committee about her child's \ncondition and why she had decided to have a late-term abortion. Like \nMs. Costello, Ms. Wilson proceeded to describe an abortion that very \nclearly was not a partial-birth abortion.\n  She said her little girl died inside the womb. ``My daughter died \nwith dignity inside my womb,'' Ms. Wilson testified. ``She was not \nstabbed in the back of the head with scissors, no one dragged her out \nhalf alive and killed her. We never would have allowed that.''\n  That is interesting, she never would have allowed that, but we are \nallowing it here. It is going on. Maybe she would not, and I give Ms. \nWilson credit for saying she would not allow it, but others do and it \nis happening. One thousand Dr. Haskell performed. The estimates are one \nor two a day.\n  So not only did Ms. Wilson, like Ms. Costello, not have a partial-\nbirth abortion, she also told the committee she never would have \nconsented to it. Very interesting. Their witness.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the supporters of partial-birth abortions \nwere not able to produce at the November 17 hearing a single doctor who \nhad ever performed a partial-birth abortion. The only doctor who has \npublicly confessed to performing them refused to appear, and all they \ndid produce was two doctors who had never done partial-birth abortions, \nbut nonetheless speculated, and in the process contradicted one another \nabout why partial-birth abortions are done.\n  In short, the supporters of partial-birth abortion produced not a \nsingle doctor who cast any doubt whatsoever on the one who has done \nthem, Dr. Haskell. In his own unrefuted statement to the AMA News, 80 \npercent of partial-birth abortions he does are purely elective. Nobody \nrefuted it.\n  The supporters of partial-birth abortion were not able to produce as \na witness a single woman who had ever undergone a partial-birth \nabortion. Of course, they are out there, but they did not produce any.\n  Senator Boxer says that partial-birth abortions are an emergency, and \nyet she could not find anybody to say that. Other supporters of \npartial-birth abortions talk about how the procedure is done to \neliminate children with severe abnormalities, yet they could not \nproduce a witness who had a partial-birth abortion for that reason.\n  There you have it, the supporters of partial-birth abortion demanded \na hearing to tell their side of the story, and what did they produce? \nTwo doctors who had not done any and two women who had not had any. \nThere is their hearing. They fought hard for it. They wanted it. They \ngot it.\n\n  The last witness produced by the supporters of partial-birth abortion \nat the hearing was a constitutional law professor by the name of Louis \nMichael Seidman of Georgetown University Law Center. Frankly, as a \nCatholic myself, I am a little surprised that a Catholic university has \non its payroll such a highly partisan, indeed enthusiastic, supporter \nof abortion on demand through all 9 months of pregnancy for any reason. \nBut to each his own.\n  Predictably, given Professor Seidman's undisguised enthusiasm for a \nright to an abortion, that is, Roe versus Wade, it is not surprising he \nconfidently predicted that the Court would strike H.R. 1833 if it were \nto be enacted.\n  The other constitutional law expert on the panel was Dr. Kmiec, who \nserved as Assistant Attorney General of the United States at the \nJustice Department under President Reagan and who now is a professor of \nlaw at Notre Dame. He strongly disagreed with Professor Seidman, and I \nbelieve Professor Kmiec made, by far, the better case.\n  Much to my disappointment, though, the Supreme Court in 1992, by a \nvote of 5 to 4 in the case of Planned Parenthood versus Casey, \nreaffirmed the basic holding of Roe versus Wade. But the Court did not \naddress in that case, which involved a Pennsylvania State law, a \ncongressional statute like H.R. 1833 that aims to protect babies who \nhave emerged into the birth canal from being brutally killed. Kmiec has \nno doubt this will be held constitutional if this law passes.\n  A born child is a constitutional person. Why is a little baby whose \nwhole body beneath her head has already entered the birth canal and \nentered outside the birth canal be less of a person than one whose head \nremains inside the birth canal? Can someone please answer that question \nfor me? Why is it any less a person? Three inches, three seconds; three \ninches, three seconds. If you do not stop the baby from being born, in \n3 seconds it is out; it is a living child, 3 inches or 4. What is the \ndifference? If somebody can tell me what the difference is, I sure \nwould like to hear it.\n  Where in the Constitution does it say that the Congress is powerless \nto protect such a child from Dr. Haskell's scissors and catheter? Where \nin the Constitution, where in the Constitution does it say that?\n  The God-given right to life, of which Thomas Jefferson wrote in the \nmagnificent Declaration of Independence, protects the right to life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness of each and every child who falls \nvictim to Haskell's scissors and his suction catheter, and our great \nConstitution which guarantees the right of each and every person to \n\n[[Page S 17902]]\nequal protection under the law protects these defenseless, partially \nborn babies from being attacked by Dr. Haskell and other abortionists \nlike him. The American people know it, and the people sitting in this \nChamber now, members of the staff, they know it, my colleagues know \nit--we all know it. You ought to witness one of these things if you \nhave any doubts. See if you can come away like Nurse Shafer and not be \naffected.\n  I am going to have a lot more to say on this tomorrow, but I know we \nhave a gentleman's agreement to get this place closed down, because we \ndo not have anybody else to relieve the Chair.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to, \nvery briefly, respond to the comments my colleague from California made \na few moments ago. I will try to be brief because I realize that we \nwill be debating this bill on other days.\n  My colleague from California placed in the Record a letter, which I \nmight point out had already been placed in the Record in the previous \ndays of debate. That was a letter from Nurse Shafer's supervisor. That \nletter calls into question some of the things that Nurse Shafer said, \nor in the words of my colleague from California, the supervisor doubts \nthe veracity of the nurse.\n  Mr. President, let me again talk about the testimony that we heard in \nthe Judiciary Committee that refutes the attacks on Nurse Shafer and \nthat refutes this specific letter by the purported supervisor of Nurse \nShafer. First, the issue of how far along, how many weeks along Dr. \nHaskell would continue to do abortions. Let me quote from the letter. \n``Dr. Haskell does not perform abortions past 24 weeks of pregnancy.''\n  Wrong. Dr. Haskell does. Dr. Haskell says so himself. We have already \nput that into the Record in Dr. Haskell's own words.\n  Second, ``Dr. Haskell does not use ultrasound.'' Wrong. The record \nclearly shows he does. How do we know that? Because he says he does.\n  Third. ``At no point is there any fetal movement or response that \nwould indicate awareness, pain, or struggle.'' Wrong. The testimony \nthat we heard would indicate contrary to that.\n  So I do not think we should spend this entire debate talking about \nthe veracity of Nurse Shafer. But, again, I would go back to what I \nsaid an hour ago and, that is, if anyone doubts her veracity, take the \nfacts, compare them with what Dr. Haskell says, the man who performs \nthe abortions. What you will find is that Nurse Shafer's description \nfits identically with what Dr. Haskell says he does himself.\n  So this is a red herring. This is a side issue. This is the old \ntactic that is always used in court or in a debate: When you do not \nhave the facts, talk about something else. Attack somebody whose \ntestimony you do not like. Let us continue, if we can, to try to focus \non what this debate is all about. I will come back to that in a moment. \nSenator Boxer has quoted Ms. Costello and Ms. Wilson, who gave very \ncompelling testimony. Yes, it was. I thought that in my previous \nstatement I stated that.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I do not see how anyone could have \nlistened to their testimony and not have teared up. I did. Nobody who \nis a parent and nobody who has lost a child could listen to that and \nnot become emotional. The hearts of everybody in that room went out to \nthose two women. But let me again say, Mr. President, that their \ntestimony was not relevant. Let us confine ourselves to the terms of \nthis debate and to the terms of this bill. No matter how compelling or \nhow emotional their testimony was, or how much our hearts go out to \nthem, it does not alter the simple fact that this bill does not apply \nto their situations. And so, again, the opponents of this bill want to \ntalk about everything in the world but the bill.\n\n  With all due respect, I believe that the attack on this bill that we \nhave heard this afternoon, 90 percent--and that is a conservative \nestimate--of what was said in opposition to this bill is totally \nirrelevant. You may believe it, disbelieve it, agree with it, disagree \nwith it, but it is irrelevant. This bill, I submit, Mr. President, has \nnothing to do with nursing home standards. It has nothing to do with \nthe EPA. It has nothing to do with the environment. We can and will \nargue these issues on this floor. But let us, please, try to keep this \ndebate to what the issues are in front of us.\n  Maybe on a note of personal privilege, if I could, Mr. President, my \nfriend from California talks about the ``joy of giving birth.'' She \nused that phrase four or five times. I guess she was inferring that \nthose of us who favor this bill use this term to in some way denigrate \nwomen and say that it is just an easy thing. Well, let me tell you, Mr. \nPresident, and let me assure my colleague from California, as the \nfather of eight--but much more importantly, as the husband of the \nmother of eight, you are never going to catch this U.S. Senator in any \nway denigrating or in any way making light of birth. You are not going \nto find me minimizing the pain or the great accomplishment of the \nmother or the seriousness of the delivery.\n  Again, Mr. President, let us try to stay on the debate and try to \nstay on what is relevant. The opponents of this bill talk about \nprotecting the life of the mother. I would, again, call to my \ncolleagues' attention the affirmative defense that was in this bill \nwhen it was passed in the House. When many pro-choice Members of the \nHouse voted for this bill, that affirmative defense was in there. I \nalso, though, refer my colleagues in the Senate to the evidence that \ncame at the hearing. Again, this is the hearing that the opponents of \nthis bill wanted. It was a good hearing, and we learned things. The \nevidence at the hearing clearly showed that this is a procedure that \nyou would not use--that a doctor would not use to save the life of a \nmother. I point out that the testimony clearly showed that this \nprocedure takes 3 days, from the time the woman comes in and you begin \nto treat the woman until the actual final act takes place. The \ntestimony at the hearing was very clear. If the life of the mother was \nat stake, a doctor would not do this method, would not do this 3-day \nprocedure. This procedure is not the ``standard of care'' in these \ncases.\n  So, again, we can talk about saving the life of the mother. But I \nmaintain that it is outside the scope of this debate. We have the \naffirmative defense built into the law, built into this proposed law, \nand you also have testimony--medical testimony--that this is not the \nprocedure you would use anyway.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith of Chicago's Mt. Sinai Medical Center testified that \nmedical texts prescribe at least three other techniques, but not this \none. I will not take the time of the Senate to go into all the medical \ndetails, but the testimony is clearly there.\n\n  I also point out that no one at the hearing--no one at the hearing--\ndisputed Dr. Smith's testimony. That is the state of the record. We \nsimply do not do this procedure. Again, confine ourselves to this \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, the debate will go on. We will hear again from both \nsides, but we should try to narrow it and talk about what is at stake. \nIt is not a question of, do we do away with Roe versus Wade? It is not \na question about Republicans or Democrats or conservatives or liberals, \nor trends, or Republican Congresses or Democrat Congresses. It is about \na very, very, very limited number of abortions that are performed each \nyear. But they are performed. They are, I maintain, wrong.\n  I think the evidence is abundantly clear. My colleague who is in the \nchair and who has shown the pictures and who has talked about it in \ngraphic detail has described exactly what this procedure consists of. \nSo it is a public policy debate, of very limited scope, but of an \nimportant area. We define in this debate, as we do in many debates, \nwhat kind of a people we are.\n  To my friends who are pro-choice--and, again, I say being pro-choice, \nbeing for Roe versus Wade, is not inconsistent for being with this \nbill; in fact, you can be consistent and do that--I say to them and I \nsay to my \n\n[[Page S 17903]]\nfriend from California and others who oppose this bill, is there not \nsome limit, some limit, to what a civilized society will tolerate, to \nwhat a good and decent people will allow?\n  I think, Mr. President, in this bill we are saying, yes, there is a \nlimit, however narrow that may be drawn, but there is a limit. So in \nthis bill, in this public debate, as in many debates, we define and \nredefine and redefine what kind of a people we are and what we hold \ndear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17881-6", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17903-S17923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n               SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1995\n\n  The text of the bill (S. 1316) to reauthorize and amend title XIV of \nthe Public Health Service Act (commonly known as the ``Safe Drinking \nWater Act''), and for other purposes, as passed by the Senate on \nNovember 29, 1995, is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1316\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) safe drinking water is essential to the protection of \n     public health;\n       (2) because the requirements of title XIV of the Public \n     Health Service Act (commonly known as the ``Safe Drinking \n     Water Act'') (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) now exceed the \n     financial and technical capacity of some public water \n     systems, especially many small public water systems, the \n     Federal Government needs to provide assistance to communities \n     to help the communities meet Federal drinking water \n     requirements;\n       (3) the Federal Government commits to take steps to foster \n     and maintain a genuine partnership with the States in the \n     administration and implementation of the Safe Drinking Water \n     Act;\n       (4) States play a central role in the implementation of \n     safe drinking water programs, and States need increased \n     financial resources and appropriate flexibility to ensure the \n     prompt and effective development and implementation of \n     drinking water programs;\n       (5) the existing process for the assessment and regulation \n     of additional drinking water contaminants needs to be revised \n     and improved to ensure that there is a sound scientific basis \n     for drinking water regulations and that the standards \n     established address the health risks posed by contaminants;\n       (6) procedures for assessing the health effects of \n     contaminants and establishing drinking water standards should \n     be revised to provide greater opportunity for public \n     education and participation;\n       (7) in setting priorities with respect to the health risks \n     from drinking water to be addressed and in selecting the \n     appropriate level of regulation for contaminants in drinking \n     water, risk assessment and benefit-cost analysis are \n     important and useful tools for improving the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of drinking water regulations to protect human \n     health;\n       (8) more effective protection of public health requires--\n       (A) a Federal commitment to set priorities that will allow \n     scarce Federal, State, and local resources to be targeted \n     toward the drinking water problems of greatest public health \n     concern; and\n       (B) maximizing the value of the different and complementary \n     strengths and responsibilities of the Federal and State \n     governments in those States that have primary enforcement \n     responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act; and\n       (9) compliance with the requirements of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act continues to be a concern at public water systems \n     experiencing technical and financial limitations, and \n     Federal, State, and local governments need more resources and \n     more effective authority to attain the objectives of the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to award a grant for the establishment of the National Center \nfor Sickle Cell Disease Research, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\nthe national center for sickle cell disease research establishment act \n                                of 1995\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nsupport research for a disease which disproportionately affects \nAfrican-Americans and other minority groups. Sickle cell disease is a \npainful, life-threatening, genetic disease. Approximately 1 of every 12 \nAfrican-Americans is born with the sickle cell genetic trait, and about \n1 in every 600 is afflicted with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell \nconditions are also found, although less frequently, in other United \nStates populations, including those of Puerto Rican, Cuban, and \nsouthern Italian ancestry. The disease has also recently been found in \nsome Caucasians.\n  Sickle cell disease is based in the circulatory system and is a \npainful and disabling disorder for which there is currently no cure. In \na healthy body, red blood cells contain the substance hemoglobin which \ncarries oxygen from the lungs to various organs and tissues. This role \nof hemoglobin is essential to life because all body components require \noxygen to live and carry out their functions. Diseased bodies have an \nabnormal type of hemoglobin which interrupts the flow of oxygen to \nthese vital organs.\n  Red blood cells that contain normal hemoglobin remain round when they \nrelease oxygen. Cells with abnormal or sickle hemoglobin, upon \nreleasing oxygen, become distorted into the shape of a sickle causing a \nchronic and painful anemia. Distorted, or sickled cells cannot traverse \ncapillaries, further limiting oxygen supply to the body's tissues.\n  Mr. President, the minority population in the State of Louisiana is \nabout 1.29 million people. Of this number roughly 3,250 people are \nsuspected of having the disease, and of this number, 25 percent will \nhave the most acute and serious form, which is often fatal. Alarmingly, \nabout 130,000 Louisianians carry the genetic trait for this illness.\n  Mr. President, despite the fact that the cause of the sickle cell \ndisease has been known for many years, progress has not been made in \nfinding suitable treatment. Currently, the most common treatment for \nthe illness is pain relief medication, treating only the immediate \nsymptoms. Treating only the symptoms results in tissue damage, often to \nmajor organs, with each successive episode of oxygen deprivation. \nConsequently, many of those afflicted with severe forms of the disease \noften do not even live to see adulthood.\n  Concerned with finding a cure for a disease that has such a \ndevastating effect on the Nation's minority populations, Southern \nUniversity in Baton Rouge, LA, the largest predominately African-\nAmerican university in the United States, has committed itself to the \ncreation of a center for sickle cell disease research.\n  With a single purpose, this center will conduct multidisciplinary \nresearch to lead to the discovery of a cure for sickle cell disease. \nThe center will conduct basic biomedical research to determine the \ntypes of drugs that can prevent, inhibit, or reverse the sickling \nprocess, along with clinical research and joint studies to \nconduct clinical trials on antisickling agents. In addition, the center \nwill work with other institutions to promote and enhance scholarship \nand teaching knowledge in order to disseminate newly gained knowledge \non the disease.\n\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that the Louisiana State \nLegislature in recognition of the importance of such a center, and even \nin these exceedingly hard economic times, has committed $7 million to \nthis project. To complete the center, and to be able to provide this \nvaluable public health research, Southern University needs Federal \nassistance. To provide this assistance, I offer a bill to authorize the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to award a grant for the \ncreation of this center. This legislation will direct the Secretary to \nprovide a grant to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals for \nthe establishment and construction of the National Center for Sickle \nCell Disease Research at Southern University in Baton Rouge.\n  Mr. President, sickle cell disease is a vital public health problem \nwhich this bill would assist in overcoming. Such funding can only aid \nin the development of this Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Sickle Cell Disease is a serious illness that \n     disproportionately affects African-Americans.\n       (2) Approximately 1 out of every 12 African-Americans is \n     born with the sickle cell trait, and about 1 out of every 600 \n     is afflicted with Sickle cell Disease.\n       (3) Sickle Cell conditions also occur in other United \n     States populations, primarily those of Puerto Rican, Cuban, \n     southern Italian ancestry and more recently sickle cell has \n     been found in some Caucasian individuals.\n       (4) Sickle Cell Disease is a painful and disabling disorder \n     which can lead to untimely death and is cause by inadequate \n     transportation of oxygen due to an abnormal type of \n     hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cells.\n       (5) Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited disease which can \n     be transmitted to offspring, particularly if both parents \n     carry the genetic trait.\n       (6) The sickle cell trait carriers show no sign of the \n     disease, but statistically, 1 in 4 of their children will be \n     afflicted with the disease.\n       (7) There is no national research center devoted to Sickle \n     Cell Disease in the United States.\n       (8) There is no known cure for Sickle Cell Disease at this \n     time and there is a need for prioritized and specialized \n     research to find such a cure for this severely disabling \n     disease.\n       (9) Louisiana's minority population is 1,299,281.\n       (10) Of this number, a suspected 3,248 individuals will \n     have the disease and of those individuals, 25 percent (812 \n     individuals) will have the most acute and serious stage of \n     Sickle Cell Disease, a stage that is usually fatal.\n       (11) Some 129,928 individuals in Louisiana will carry the \n     sickle cell trait.\n       (12) Southern University, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana \n     is the largest predominately African-American university in \n     the United States.\n       (13) Approximately 16,700 students attend this 112 year old \n     school and Southern graduates are located throughout the \n     United States and the world.\n       (14) The State of Louisiana through the Louisiana \n     Legislature and Southern University, has shown great \n     leadership and committed significant financial and personnel \n\n[[Page S 17925]]\n     resources towards the development of a National Center for Sickle Cell \n     Disease Research.\n       (15) Because Southern University has committed its \n     resources and personnel to seeing this project through to its \n     ultimate goal, finding a cure for Sickle Cell Disease, and \n     because of Southern University's large minority population it \n     is appropriate to locate the National Center for Sickle \n     Cell Disease Research at Southern University in Baton \n     Rouge.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \n     National Center for Sickle Cell Disease at Southern \n     University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that will have the \n     following objectives--\n       (1) to conduct biomedical research and clinical \n     investigations designed to find a cure for Sickle Cell \n     Disease;\n       (2) to conduct a wide variety of human behavioral studies \n     designed to provide new knowledge about such issues as the \n     effectiveness of various counseling and education methods, \n     and techniques to improve coping skills on the part of \n     patients and their families;\n       (3) to establish collaborative arrangements and joint \n     research programs and projects with other Louisiana \n     institutions of higher education, such as Louisiana State \n     University Medical Centers at New Orleans and Shreveport and \n     Tulane University Medical Center to conduct clinical trials \n     on anti-sickling agents;\n       (4) to provide expanded opportunities for faculty members \n     at the institutions described in paragraph (3) to publish in \n     the three broad areas of basic biomedical research, \n     psychosocial research and clinical research;\n       (5) to become a laboratory for training both graduate and \n     undergraduate students in research methods and techniques \n     concerning Sickle Cell Disease; and\n       (6) to develop, promote and implement joint research \n     projects with other public and private higher education \n     institutions including teaching hospitals on Sickle Cell \n     Disease.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL CENTER FOR SICKLE CELL DISEASE RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Grant.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall award a grant to the Louisiana Department of Health and \n     Hospitals for the establishment and construction of the \n     National Center for Sickle Cell Disease Research at Southern \n     University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and for related \n     facilities and equipment at such Center. Prior to the \n     awarding of such grant, the State of Louisiana shall certify \n     to the Secretary--\n       (1) that the State of Louisiana has provided not less than \n     $7,000,000 to support and operate such Center; and\n       (2) that the State of Louisiana has developed a plan to \n     provide funds for the continued operation and support of such \n     center.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated $21,000,000 to carry out the purposes of \n     this Act. \n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n\n  S. 1443. A bill to designate the United States Post Office building \nlocated at 102 South McLean, Lincoln, IL, as the ``Edward Madigan Post \nOffice Building,'' and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n    THE EDWARD MADIGAN POST OFFICE BUILDING DESIGNATION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith Senator Moseley-Braun, a bill to designate the post office of \nLincoln, IL, as the Edward Madigan Post Office Building.\n  I served with Ed Madigan in the Illinois Legislature, where we worked \non a variety of things together, and then I served with him in the \nHouse here in Washington.\n  He was one of those people who had common sense and a graciousness \nabout him that was infectious.\n  He knew how to disagree without creating hostility. He was a \nremarkable person.\n  When we had a vacancy in the office of Secretary of Agriculture, I \ncalled him and said I wanted to call President Bush's chief of staff in \nEd Madigan's behalf unless he had an objection. He had none, and I was \npleased to call John Sununu and tell him that if they wanted someone \nwho could get along with Democrats and Republicans and still do a very \ngood job, they could not do better than Ed Madigan.\n  I am sure a great many people with much more influence than Paul \nSimon conveyed the same message.\n  It was typical of Ed Madigan that I called him, rather than the other \nway around.\n  He was a great public servant, but even more important than that, he \nwas just a genuinely fine human being.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation. My only regret is that Ed \nMadigan is not around to see this building designated for him. He was \nproud of his hometown of Lincoln, and I know the people in Lincoln are \nproud of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17924-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 704\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch] was added as a cosponsor of S. 704, a bill to establish the \nGambling Impact Study Commission.\n\n\n                                 S. 907\n\n  At the request of Mr. Murkowski, the names of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Kempthorne] and the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 907, a bill to amend the National Forest Ski Area \nPermit Act of 1986 to clarify the authorities and duties of the \nSecretary of Agriculture in issuing ski area permits on National Forest \nSystem lands and to withdraw lands within ski area permit boundaries \nfrom the operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws.\n\n\n                                S. 1074\n\n  At the request of Ms. Moseley-Braun, the name of the Senator from \nMaryland [Ms. Mikulski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1074, a bill to \namend the Public Health Service Act to provide for expanding and \nintensifying activities of the National Institute of Arthritis and \nMusculoskeletal and Skin Diseases with respect to lupus.\n\n\n                                S. 1271\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1271, a bill to amend the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n\n\n                                S. 1279\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1279, a bill to provide for appropriate remedies for prison condition \nlawsuits, to discourage frivolous and abusive prison lawsuits, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1344\n\n  At the request of Mr. Heflin, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Bumpers] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1344, a bill to repeal the \nrequirement relating to specific statutory authorization for increases \nin judicial salaries, to provide for automatic annual increases for \njudicial salaries, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1423\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the name of the Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1423, a bill to amend the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to make modifications to \ncertain provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1429\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 1429, a bill to provide clarification in the reimbursement to States \nfor federally funded employees carrying out Federal programs during the \nlapse in appropriations between November 14, 1995, through November 19, \n1995.\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1429, supra.\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1429, supra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17925-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17925-S17926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, Maurice Rosenberg, who passed away \nlate last summer, was a well-known advocate for judicial reform on the \nState and Federal levels of government. He was a professor at Columbia \nUniversity's School of Law. I had the great pleasure of working with \nhim extensively over the years on the issues of court reform and \njudicial administration. He had a keen legal mind that led him to \ncontribute enormously to our system of jurisprudence.\n  During his 39-year tenure as a professor at Columbia, Dr. Rosenberg \nwrote and lectured extensively on the legal system, particularly on \nissues of procedure and access to the courts. He had an intense dislike \nfor the staggering increase in cases which clog the courts and proposed \nmeasures to help ease the burden. One of his recommendations was to \nreplace juries in small-claims cases with arbitrators. During a 1977 \ninterview, he questioned the effect on society as a whole of people \nbeing so quick to sue each other in court.\n  Between 1971 and 1975, Dr. Rosenberg headed the Advisory Council on \nAppellate Justice and was later on the Council on the Role of the \nCourts. In 1979, President Carter appointed him Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in charge of the Office for Improvements in the Administration \nof Justice. Previously, he had served on the mayor's committee on the \njudiciary in New York City. In 1980, he was appointed by Chief Justice \nWarren Burger to the Federal Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil \nProcedure, on which he served until 1987. A graduate of Syracuse \nUniversity, he received his law degree from Columbia.\n  Dr. Rosenberg was an outstanding court scholar, professor, and lawyer \nwho early on foresaw what is now called the litigation explosion. He \nacknowledged that part of the increase in litigation and in the law's \ncomplexity was due to greater public awareness of rights and a \nwillingness to try them out in court. He once said, ``That is certainly \npreferable to having them tested in the streets.'' But he also felt \nthat law schools should do more to sensitize students to possibilities \nother \n\n[[Page S 17927]]\nthan simply adopting an adversarial frame of mind.\n  Maurice Rosenberg will long be remembered as one of this century's \nlegal giants. His contributions to the field of jurisprudence will be \nlasting and will guide scholarly thought for decades to come. I extend \nmy sincerest condolences to his family in the wake of their tremendous \nloss.\n  (At the request of Mr. DASCHLE, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17926-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CANADIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE CHAMPION BALTIMORE STALLIONS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my hometown of Baltimore has always been \na great sports city. We have a tradition of excellence in baseball with \nthe Orioles, and last summer we celebrated the magical endurance streak \nof Cal Ripken, Jr.\n  I am proud to say that a new chapter in our tradition of sports \nexcellence was written on November 19, 1995. The Baltimore Stallions \ndefeated the Calgary Stampeders for the Canadian Football League's \nchampionship, the Grey Cup. The Grey Cup is the ultimate achievement in \nthe CFL, and it will now reside in the United States for the first time \nin the 106-year history of the league.\n  To win the Grey Cup, a team must combine tremendous athletic ability \nwith leadership, and come together as a team. Last year the Stallions \ngave the fans their best effort, but came up short for the CFL \nchampionship. This year was going to be different. The Stallions came \nback with renewed intensity and desire. Their goal was to bring the \nGrey Cup to Baltimore, and they worked until their dream became a \nreality.\n  The Stallions' victory gives Baltimore three championships in three \nprofessional football leagues. The Stallions join the National Football \nLeague's Colts and the U.S. Football League's Stars as Baltimore \nchampions.\n  I want to extend my congratulations to the owner of the Stallions, \nJim Speros, and his dedicated players and coaches. They truly deserve \nthis championship, and they have made Baltimore proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17927-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IRONY ABOUNDS AS RETIRED OHIO SENATOR BEMOANS BROWNS' FATE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there is no one with whom I have \nserved in my years in Congress for whom I have greater respect than \nSenator Howard Metzenbaum, our former colleague from Ohio.\n  One of the few issues where we differed was on the antitrust \nexemption for professional baseball.\n  The recent moves of professional football teams, particularly the \nmovement of the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, suggests that the \nantitrust exemption for baseball may be a very good thing for \nprofessional sports, as well as the communities involved.\n  Recently, a veteran sports writer for the Chicago Tribune, Jerome \nHoltzman, had a column about movement of the Browns and its \nrelationship to antitrust baseball. I ask that this be printed in the \nRecord. In fairness, I should add that the Chicago Tribune owns the \nChicago Cubs, but I have no reason to believe that Jerome Holtzman is \nnot writing from conviction.\n  The column follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 21, 1995]\n\n       Irony Abounds as Retired Ohio Senator Bemoans Browns' Fate\n\n                          (By Jerome Holtzman)\n\n       Put in a call Howard Metzenbaum, the recently retired \n     Democratic senator from Ohio, and had only one simple \n     question.\n       After years of attempting to rid baseball of its antitrust \n     exemption, what were his thoughts about his beloved Cleveland \n     Browns moving to Baltimore?\n       ``It's horrible,'' Mentzenbaum said from his office in \n     Pompano Beach, Fla. ``It's a travesty. No community was more \n     supportive of its team than the fans in Cleveland. I was back \n     in Cleveland for one day and the feeling of outrage is \n     unbelievable. And I've lived in Cleveland all my life--78 \n     years.''\n       Certainly, he understood the Browns are able to pick up and \n     hotfoot it to Baltimore because the National Football League \n     does not have an antitrust exemption.\n       ``That argument can be made,'' he conceded.\n       Yet, as the chairman of the Antitrust Committee of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, he helped introduce legislation \n     that sought to repeal baseball's exemption.\n       Doesn't he see the irony?\n       He is losing his hometown football team and if baseball \n     didn't have antitrust protection, Cleveland also would have \n     lost its baseball team. The Indians would have flown the coop \n     years ago.\n       ``I can't argue that,'' he replied. ``They could have been \n     moved.''\n       He launched into a meaningless panegyric about the \n     difference in ownership today compared with years ago:\n       ``There are not the same kind of owners that were in the \n     field yesteryear. Now, you're talking about multimillionaires \n     who have a plaything. Before, it wasn't a question of making \n     money. It was the pride of having a team in your community. \n     Much of that doesn't exist anymore.''\n       It certainly seems that way. But the senator is naive. If \n     he had read up on baseball history he would discover most \n     owners have been motivated by money, beginning with the \n     1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, baseball's first \n     professional team. To increase attendance, the owner \n     encouraged the players to open with a song:\n\n     ``We are a band of baseball players\n     From Cincinnati City;\n     We come to toss the ball around\n     And sing to you our ditty;\n     And if you listen to the song\n     We are about to sing,\n     We'll tell you all about baseball\n     And make the welkin ring.\n     The ladies want to know\n     Who are those gallant men in\n     Stocking red, they'd like to know.''\n\n       The only owner in my time who appeared mostly to be a \n     gentleman sportsman was the late Philip K. Wrigley, the \n     longtime caretaker of the Cubs. He didn't need the money \n     because the gum business kept him and his family in vittles.\n       Metzenbaum was asked if, in his opinion, anything could be \n     done to prevent the Browns from moving to Baltimore?\n       ``The league won't do much,'' he acknowledged. ``If push \n     comes to shove they'll probably be able to move the team.''\n       But if professional football had the exemption, the \n     carpetbaggers couldn't move their franchises at will. They \n     couldn't transplant without the approval of a majority of \n     their fellow owners. And so the owners jump around like \n     flies, forever devouring the sweetest fruit, a movable feast.\n       In the last 13 years, the Oakland Raiders have navigated a \n     round trip--to Los Angeles and back to Oakland. The Los \n     Angeles Rams are now in St. Louis. The Baltimore Colts are in \n     Indianapolis. The Phoenix Cardinals were previously based in \n     St. Louis. The Houston Oilers are enroute to Nashville. And \n     the shameless Mike McCaskey, president of our Bears, is \n     threatening to relocate to Gary.\n       I can't resist mentioning all the baseball bashing since \n     the players' 1994 strike that forced cancellation of the \n     World Series. But which is preferable? A temporary baseball \n     shutdown, with replacements on the field, or no team at all?\n       Because of its exemption, the baseball map is unchanged \n     since 1972 when the Washington Senators were allowed to move \n     to Texas. In the 23 years since, the San Francisco Giants \n     were denied a ticket to St. Petersburg, Fla. Minnesota's jump \n     to Tampa was aborted, as was the White Sox to Denver, \n     Oakland to Denver and Seattle to St. Petersburg.\n       The Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians, when both \n     were in poverty--the Pirates have yet to escape from the \n     poor-house--repeatedly have sought greener fields. But they \n     were ordered to stay put and could be sold only to local \n     ownership groups. The Houston Astros now are threatening to \n     move to somewhere in Virginia. Will they get permission? I \n     doubt it.\n       ``Fortunately, because of the events of the last four \n     months everyone seems to better appreciate our position,'' \n     said acting commissioner Bud Selig. ``In all the times I have \n     testified in Washington, and especially before Sen. \n     Metzenbaum, I emphasized the exemption has been good for our \n     fans. It has enabled us to stabilize our franchises.''\n       I mentioned that I was planning to speak to Metzenbaum, \n     formerly baseball's No. 1 congressional nemesis.\n       ``Oh,'' said Selig, ``send him my best regards. And be sure \n     to tell him that in the 26 years I've been in baseball the \n     Indians tried to move out of Cleveland at least four \n     times.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17927-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17927-S17928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHARLES GOMILLION\n\n Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Charles Goode Gomillion, who passed \naway on October 4 at the age of 95, will go down in history as the \nleader of the struggle to bring political power to the black majority \nof citizens in Tuskegee, AL. The case Gomillion versus Lightfoot \nultimately yielded a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on the issue \nof redistricting. The decision in the case is also recognized by legal \nscholars as a major step forward in the dual causes of civil and voting \nrights.\n  Charles Gomillion will long be remembered as a pioneer who took a \nfirm stand on principle and by so doing paved the way for major \nadvances in the cause of equality. His legacy is \n\n[[Page S 17928]]\nthat of social progress; his political moderation and temperament \npresent an outstanding example of how to work within the constitutional \nsystem to effect positive change. I extend my condolences to his \nfamily.\n  I ask that a New York Times article on the landmark remapping case be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n       Charles Gomillion, 95, Figure in Landmark Remap Case, Dies\n\n                      (By Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.)\n\n       Charles G. Gomillion, who led the fight that brought \n     political power to the black majority in Tuskegee, Ala, with \n     the assistance of a landmark Supreme Court case that bears \n     his name, died on Oct. 4 at a hospital in Montgomery, Ala. He \n     was 95 and until his recent return to Tuskegee had lived the \n     last 25 years in Washington and Roebling, N.J.\n       Mr. Gomillion, a native of Edgefield, S.C., had a long and \n     distinguished career as a sociology professor and dean at \n     Tuskegee University, but it was his role as a civic leader \n     that made Charles Goode Gomillion a footnote to \n     constitutional legal history in 1960.\n       As the president of the Tuskegee Civic Association, an \n     organization he had helped found in 1941, he was the lead \n     plaintiff in a suit that successfully challenged a blatant \n     act of gerrymandering designed to exclude all but a handful \n     of black voters from municipal elections.\n       Alarmed by a voter registration drive led by Mr. \n     Gomillion's organization, the Alabama Legislature redrew the \n     town's boundries in 1957, leaving Tuskegee University and all \n     but a handful of black families outside the city limits.\n       What had been a perfect square was now a 28-sided figure \n     that some likened to a snake and others to a sea dragon. \n     Whatever the trope, the lines had been so skillfully drawn \n     that although as many as 12 black voters remained inside a \n     city that once had 5,400 black residents, not a single one of \n     the city's 1,310 white residents had been excluded.\n       Mr. Gomillion and 11 other association members filed \n     Federal suit seeking to bar Mayor Philip M. Lightfoot and \n     other city officials from enforcing the state statute on the \n     ground that it was a transparent effort to circumvent the \n     15th Amendment's voting guarantees. Two lower courts, citing \n     a 1946 Supreme Court opinion by Justice Felix Frankfurter, \n     ruled that such state action was beyond judicial review.\n       When the case, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, came before the \n     Supreme Court in 1960. Justice Frankfurter, describing the \n     new configuration as ``an uncouth 28-sided figure,'' found \n     otherwise and so did all eight of his colleagues.\n       Deftly distinguishing Gomillion, from the 1946 case, which \n     involved Congressional districts of unequal population in \n     Illinois, Justice Frankfurter said the Tuskegee case involved \n     ``affirmative action'' by legislature that ``singled out a \n     readily isolated segment of a racial minority for special \n     discriminatory treatment.''\n       He and seven other justices said that a statute that had \n     the effect of disenfranchising black voters would be a \n     violation of the 15th Amendment. Justice Charles E. \n     Whittaker, suggesting that there would be no \n     disenfranchisement since the excluded former Tuskegee \n     residents could vote in county elections said it would \n     instead be a violation of the 14th Amendment.\n       The case was sent back to District Court and the next year \n     Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr. declared the statute was indeed \n     unconstitutional.\n       The former city limits were restored and within years the \n     black majority has taken over both the city and county \n     governments, much to the consternation of Mr. Comillion, who \n     served for a while on the school board.\n       A soft-spoken moderate who had worked quietly to enlist the \n     support of liberal-minded white allies in Tuskegee, he was \n     dismayed when a plan to integrate local schools was sabotaged \n     by Gov. George C. Wallace. The Governor ordered the schools \n     closed, creating such rancor that white residents created a \n     private school, black radicals swept Mr. Gomillion and other \n     moderates aside and in turn white families fled. Today, only \n     a handful of white families remain in Tuskegee.\n       As his dream of a truly integrated community, with black \n     and white leaders working together for the common good, died, \n     Mr. Gomillion, who retired from Tuskegee in 1970, left, too.\n       Although his moderate approach was rejected by a majority \n     of the black voters, at least one of the former radicals now \n     regrets it.\n       ``The man was right,'' Otis Pinkard said yesterday, \n     recalling that he had once led the faction that opposed the \n     Gomillion approach, ``We should not have run all the white \n     families out of town.''\n       Mr. Gomillion is survived by a daughter, Gwendolyn Chaires \n     of Roebling; three grandchildren; three great-grandchildren, \n     and one great-great-grandchild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17927-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ON THE RETIREMENT OF LAUREN F. OTIS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to wish great \ncongratulations to Lauren F. Otis, who retired Thursday, November 30, \n1995, after 28 years of dedicated service to the city of New York's \ndepartment of city planning.\n  Mr. Otis has been with the department of city planning since 1967, \nthe last 11 as chief urban designer. In this capacity, he has acted as \na consultant to the chairman and the city planning commission on a \nvariety of urban matters while developing comprehensive studies of the \nfive boroughs of New York City as an overall framework for individual \nprojects. Prior to becoming the chief urban designer, Mr. Otis was a \nkey member of a team of architectural professionals who developed new \nzoning and regulatory approaches for the development of Midtown \nManhattan and the Wall Street area. Some of his individual urban design \nhighlights include Times Square, the Citicorp Center and the Sliver \nBuilding zoning amendment.\n  A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard University School of \nDesign, Mr. Otis served in the U.S. Navy Civil Engineer Corps from \n1955-58 before moving to architectural design, working as a staff \narchitect for I.M. Pei & Partners before joining the city of New York.\n  In addition to Mr. Otis' work in the department of city planning, his \npatronage of New York City's cultural spirit as mayor's representative \nto the New York City Art Commission between 1982 and 1992, the last 7 \nyears as vice president, and as a representative to the New York City \nHistoric Properties Fund deserves recognition.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing him the \nbest of luck in his much deserved retirement.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17928-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY WAITING PERIOD\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to make my \ncolleagues aware of a very unfortunate situation involving Social \nSecurity disability benefits.\n  In our law, there is a 6-month waiting period before a Social \nSecurity disability applicant can receive payments. If a person is \ndiagnosed with a deadly disease, and is eligible to receive Social \nSecurity disability, that person must wait 6 months before the payments \narrive. This waiting period often comes at a time in a person's life \nwhen treatment must begin immediately. Many of these people simply \ncannot afford to wait. Far too often, the results of this forced \nwaiting period are financial devastation for families.\n  One of my Maryland constituents, Mitchell Berman, was stricken by a \nterrible illness which required full-time care in a nursing home. Mr. \nBerman and his wife, Marjorie, were forced to sell nearly everything \nthey owned to cover the health care costs. By the time Mr. Berman's \npayments began to arrive, it was too late; they had spent much of their \nlife's savings. Mr. Berman's disease was not curable, and I am very \nsorry to say that he has died.\n  To honor the memory of her husband, Marjorie Berman has started her \nown crusade to make lawmakers and families aware of the financial \neffect the waiting period can have. I salute Marjorie Berman for her \ncourage and her steadfast devotion to her husband.\n  Earlier this year, I encouraged the Senate Finance Committee to \nexplore this issue. In today's political climate, I know that funding \nfor many programs is being cut back and eligibility for some programs \nis being tightened.\n  But I encourage my colleagues to take a close look at this issue and \nask if the Social Security disability waiting period is serving a \nuseful Government purpose and responding to the needs of people. I also \nask my colleagues to listen to the stories of their own constituents \nwho have been affected by this waiting period and have not been able to \nget the help when they need it. I think my colleagues will find that \nthe waiting period does not serve the needs of people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17928-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17928-S17929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PROS KNOW WHY PRISON FAILS\n\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to an op-ed written by Coleman McCarthy in the \nSeptember 9, 1995, Washington Post.\n  In discussing prison policies, Mr. McCarthy draws an important \ndistinction between professional and amateur \n\n[[Page S 17929]]\nopinions. No matter how we like to flatter ourselves, Members of \nCongress are amateurs when it comes to understanding what works to \nreduce crime. The professionals are the people who work in prisons and \nthe criminal justice system every day. Unfortunately, it is the \namateurs who get to set policy, and, according to the professionals, we \nare doing a lousy job.\n  One year ago, I sponsored a survey of prison wardens asking for their \nviews on our criminal justice and prison policies. Eight-five percent \nof the wardens said that most politicians are not offering effective \nsolutions to crime. Instead of building more prisons and passing \nmandatory minimum sentencing laws, the wardens overwhelmingly favored \nproviding vocational--92 percent--and literacy--93 percent--training to \nprisons, and 89 percent support drug treatment programs in prisons. \nCongress has been quick to defund these programs, and pour scarce \nresources into prison construction, in the rush to be tough on crime.\n  The reality is that most prisoners will at some point be released, \nand our goal should be to ensure that those released from prison do not \nreturn to a criminal lifestyle. The Huron House in Michigan, a \ncommunity-based alternative sentencing program which Mr. McCarthy \nrefers to his in his piece, costs less and is more effective at \nreducing recidivism than prisons.\n  In setting prison policies, we need to be more focused on what works. \nThe best way to find out is to consult the professionals.\n  I ask that the full text of the op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                     The Pros Know Why Prisons Fail\n\n                         (By Coleman McCarthy)\n\n       Port Huron, Mich.--Robert Diehl, who works with prisoners, \n     believes it's time to get tough on crime. How? To begin with, \n     not by longer sentences, not by building more prisons and not \n     by agreeing with California Gov. Pete Wilson, who announced \n     his presidential candidacy with the preachment that he'll \n     ``appoint judges who know that it's better to have thugs \n     overcrowding our jails than overcrowding your neighborhood.''\n       Diehl's philosophy of toughness involves the arduous and \n     complex work of rescuing people with messed-up lives. He is \n     the director of Huron House, a nonprofit, community-based \n     alternative sentencing program for felony offenders. The \n     three-story, 30-bed facility--located on a residential street \n     in this small lakeshore community 60 miles north of Detroit--\n     provides intensive 24-hour supervision and comprehensive \n     services ranging from job training and job placement to \n     mental health and drug counseling.\n       It isn't blind faith, much less addled thinking, that keeps \n     Diehl going. In the 15 years he's been with Huron House, \n     which opened in 1979, fewer than one in five men and women in \n     the program has committed a new crime. The recidivism rate \n     for the imprisoned is two out of three. It's $50 a day to \n     cage a person in a Michigan prison, as against $35 a day to \n     supervise a resident at Huron House.\n       In his office last week, Diehl, 53, described the futility \n     of the current panic-button solutions to crime mouthed by one \n     Pete Wilson or another: ``Michigan has been trying to build \n     its way out of the crime problem for the past 12 years. We \n     now have three times as many people in our prisons as 12 \n     years ago. It doesn't work. There's been no reduction of \n     crime, and there's no more perception of safety among our \n     citizens. And prisoners' lives are not being changed for the \n     better.''\n       The public faces a choice: Does it want to follow the \n     counsel of such corrections officials as Diehl or place its \n     trust in politicians who advocate spending money on chain \n     gangs, boot camps, three strikes, death rows, mandatory \n     sentencing--and investing less or no money in inmate \n     education or job programs.\n       The choice was rarely more stark than a few weeks ago, when \n     two groups met--one in Cincinnati, the other in Washington--\n     to offer prescriptions for fighting crime. One group was the \n     professionals, the other amateurs.\n       The pros were people who run the nation's prisons and jails \n     and who belong to the 20,000-member American Correctional \n     Association (ACA). The amateurs were such members of the \n     Senate as Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, testifying \n     before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on prison reform.\n       At the ACA conference in Cincinnati, those who toil behind \n     the walls told of the frustration of doing politicians' dirty \n     work and knowing all the time that longer sentences and \n     meaner bastilles are counter-productive.\n       They listened to corrections officials who detailed the \n     facts on how recidivism is reduced through community programs \n     like Huron House and how the payoffs for public safety are in \n     combinations of education, employment, drug treatment and \n     punishment--not punishment alone.\n       Few people are wearier of quick-fix politicians than \n     corrections professionals. Bobbie L. Huskey, the ACA \n     president, states categorically that an ``overwhelming \n     consensus'' exists among wardens that ``incarceration, in and \n     of itself, does little to reduce crime or have a positive \n     impact on recidivism.'' Huskey cites a poll conducted by the \n     Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution in which 85 \n     percent of the wardens surveyed said that most politicians \n     are not offering effective solutions to crime. Ninety-three \n     percent favor literacy and other educational programs, 92 \n     percent vocational training and 89 percent are for drug \n     treatment.\n       While the professionals who know struggle on, the amateurs \n     who don't keep popping off. At the Judiciary Committee \n     hearings in late July, Sen. Hutchison accused federal courts \n     of creating ``comfort and convenience'' for criminals in \n     prisons. That was news to the wardens.\n       In addition to criminal recidivists, it appears that we now \n     have politician recidivists: the Wilsons and Hutchisons who \n     lapse, relapse and relapse again into deadend thinking. Maybe \n     they need a brief stretch at Huron House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17928-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17929-S17930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEGALIZED GAMBLING\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to inform my Senate colleagues on the progress of important \nlegislation moving through Congress that addresses the issue of \nlegalized gambling in America.\n  Legalized gambling today is proliferating at breathtaking speed, \ntouching the lives of millions of Americans. Communities across the \ncountry are considering casinos, riverboat gambling, pari-mutuel \nracing, off-track betting, and other forms of wagering. Whereas only 2 \nStates offered casino gambling in 1988, today 23 States have authorized \ncasinos to operate. Overall, 48 States now permit some form of \nlegalized gambling.\n  A steady stream of news accounts have chronicled the recent growth \nand expansion of gambling activities in America. Many of these stories \ndescribe the enormous profits generated almost overnight by gambling \nenterprises. Questions are being asked about decisions by State and \nlocal leaders to legalize gambling. People are concerned not only about \nthe economic costs of these decisions, but of the human costs as well.\n  The Wall Street Journal, recently reported that some New Orleans \npublic officials, retailers, and citizens are having second thoughts \nabout the economic impacts of bringing riverboats, casinos, and video \npoker machines to Louisiana. The New York Times related the personal \nexperiences of local residents in cities and towns across America who \nvisit a casino instead of a restaurant or ballpark, who spend their \ngrocery money on a nearby instant-play video lottery game, or who \nexhaust their personal or family savings at the casino tables.\n  In the face of this explosive growth, I joined Senator Simon last \nApril in support of legislation to establish a national commission to \nconduct an 18-month study on the effects of gambling. This measure, S. \n704, would provide State and local governments with an objective, \nauthoritative resource to use as a basis for making informed choices \nabout gambling. S. 704 does not propose to further regulate gambling \nactivities or to increase taxation of gambling revenues. The bill has \nbeen endorsed by the President and enjoys bipartisan support in the \nSenate with a total of 11 cosponsors, including Senators Gorton, Kyl, \nLieberman, Grassley, Warner, Feinstein, Hatfield, Kassebaum, Hatch, and \nCoats.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee on November 2 conducted a hearing \non S. 704. Senator Simon and I testified before the committee along \nwith several other Members of Congress and outside experts concerned \nabout this important issue. I am hopeful the committee will approve \nthis important legislation before the conclusion of this session.\n  Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives \nby Congressman Wolf of Virginia. The House Judiciary Committee held \nhearings on Representative Wolf's bill, H.R. 497, and approved the \nmeasure by voice vote on November 8. Prospects are good for passage by \nthe full House during the 104th Congress.\n  The Washington Post, in a September 22, 1995, endorsement of the \ngambling study commission proposal, stated that,\n\n       Those pushing casinos into communities make large claims \n     about their economic benefits, but the jobs and investment \n     casinos create are rarely stacked up against the jobs \n\n[[Page S 17930]]\n     lost and the investment and spending forgone in other parts of a local \n     economy. The commission's study could be of great use to \n     communities pondering whether to wager their futures on \n     roulette, slot machines and blackjack.\n\n  As evidence of the desirability for a comprehensive study of the \ngambling issue, I ask that the following Chicago Tribune article from \nNovember 29, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 29, 1995]\n\nRisky Business: Can Gaming Win in Cities?--Chicago May Get Tip From New \n                                Orleans\n\n                           (By Ken Armstrong)\n\n       The way casinos have flopped in New Orleans may drive other \n     cities to flip in their views toward gaming, but Chicago \n     still looks like a viable gambling market, according to \n     financial analysts.\n       As the country's first major city to introduce large-scale \n     gaming, New Orleans was to be a model demonstration of \n     casinos creating tax dollars and jobs. What transpired \n     instead were budget shortfalls, unrealized promises and the \n     threat of municipal layoffs.\n       ``I think there were many municipalities watching this \n     project as an experiment in urban gaming,'' said Jason Ader, \n     a gaming analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. in New York. ``And \n     the fact that it has effectively failed casts a dark cloud \n     over other urban markets considering gaming as an economic \n     engine.''\n       Harrah's Jazz Co. shut its temporary casino in New Orleans \n     last week and declared bankruptcy. Harrah's Jazz also \n     suspended construction on its permanent casino, which was \n     slated to open in New Orleans next summer.\n       No longer able to count on lease and tax payments from the \n     casino, New Orleans faces a budget shortfall and has \n     postponed the sale of $15.8 million in general obligation \n     bonds. Mayor Marc Morial said he may have to lay off as many \n     as 1,000 city employees.\n       Gaming opponents have latched on to the debacle, using it \n     to argue that other cities pursuing casinos would be wise to \n     give up the chase.\n       Tom Grey, a Galena, Ill., minister spearheading the anti-\n     gambling movement nationwide, said there's reason to believe \n     that what happened in New Orleans would be replayed in \n     Chicago, where Mayor Richard Daley has pushed hard for \n     casinos.\n       But several financial analysts who specialize in gaming say \n     it isn't necessarily so.\n       ``Everybody in the industry knows Chicago and New York \n     would be layups if they had casinos there,'' said Steve \n     Schneider, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St. \n     Louis.\n       He estimated that casinos in Chicago could generate $800 \n     million to $1 billion in gross profits without cutting \n     heavily into the revenues of nearby riverboat casinos.\n       Daley spokesman Jim Williams said the mayor still views \n     casinos as a good way to attract convention-goers and \n     increase tax revenue for the city and state.\n       But he added: ``The mayor has never seen gaming as a \n     panacea. He's been steadfast in his belief that it should \n     never be seen as a primary source of income.''\n       What happened in New Orleans would more likely give pause \n     to marginal markets for gaming such as Milwaukee or \n     Cleveland, Schneider said. The poor performance of the New \n     Orleans casinos also will make it more difficult for gaming \n     companies to secure project financing for future \n     developments, he said.\n       Brian Ford, director of gaming industry services at Ernst & \n     Young in Philadelphia, said New Orleans hardly proves that \n     casinos can't flourish.\n       With video-poker machines in truckstops, casinos on \n     riverboats and what would have been one of the world's \n     largest land-based casinos, Louisiana tried to do too much \n     with too small a population base, Ford said.\n       The shutdown of Harrah's Jazz was New Orleans' second \n     losing hand.\n       Another project with two riverboat casinos--the $223 \n     million River City complex--closed in June after opening just \n     nine weeks before. Analysts blamed its failure, like that of \n     Harrah's temporary casino, largely on its location.\n       The riverboat complex was built in an industrial area where \n     its neighbor is Glazer Steel & Aluminum--hardly a tourist \n     draw. A thousand feet of head-high weeds, tractor trailers, \n     piles of gravel and an abandoned Chevette with smashed-in \n     windows separate the complex from the edge of the city's \n     downtown area.\n       David Anders, a gaming analyst with Raymond James & \n     Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said New Orleans shows \n     that while state and municipal governments should rightfully \n     profit from a casino, they shouldn't make the casino's \n     financial burden so great it can't survive.\n       Harrah's Jazz paid $125 million up front as a franchise fee \n     for the state's only land-based casino and promised payments \n     of at least $100 million a year to the state, regardless of \n     financial performance.\n       The company's principal partner is Memphis-based Harrah's \n     Entertainment Inc., which grew from a bingo parlor in Reno \n     during the Depression to an industry giant with casinos in \n     all of the country's major gaming markets.\n       Ralph Berry, a Harrah's Entertainment spokesman, said \n     Harrah's Jazz still wants to open the permanent casino and \n     will try to renegotiate the casino agreement with the state, \n     city and lenders. Critics have accused Harrah's Jazz of using \n     the bankruptcy filing as leverage for more attractive \n     terms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17929-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17930-S17931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NATIONAL VETERANS DAY AND ADDRESS BY ADM. LEIGHTON W. SMITH, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Birmingham, AL has always conducted \noutstanding Veterans Day events. Each year, the ceremonies commence on \nthe night of November 10, the day before Veterans Day, when a banquet \nis held to remember our veterans and to formally honor the National \nVeterans Award recipients.\n  This year, National Veterans Day in Birmingham sponsors, which \ninclude 16 of the national veterans organizations, decided to present \nthe award to 5 World War II Congressional Medal of Honor winners. They \nwere Adm. Eugene Fluckey of the U.S. Navy; Capt. Maurice Britt, U.S. \nArmy; and PFC Jack Lucas, U.S. Marine Corps. There were two members \nhonored from the Air Force, which during World War II was still the old \nArmy Air Corps. They were Col. William T. Lawley and M.Sgt. Henry \nEugene Erwin, both Alabama natives. There are a total of five surviving \nWorld War II veterans who served in the Army Air Corps and who are \nCongressional Medal of Honor winners, and we are proud that two of them \nhail from Alabama. Douglas Albert Monroe, signalman first class in the \nU.S. Coast Guard was honored posthumously.\n  On Veterans Day itself, Birmingham hosts the World Peace Luncheon, \nwhich this year featured Adm. Leighton W. Smith, Jr., of the U.S. Navy \nas its distinguished guest speaker. Born in Mobile, Admiral Smith is \nthe commander, U.S. Naval Forces in Europe and commander in chief, \nAllied Forces in Southern Europe. He was appointed to these posts in \nApril 1994.\n  He was promoted to vice admiral in June 1991, and served for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears as deputy chief of naval operations for plans, policy, and \noperations. He was a major contributor to Navy staff reorganization and \nthe development of From the Sea, the Navy's strategy for the 21st \ncentury.\n  I ask that a copy of Admiral Leighton's outstanding address delivered \nat the World Peace Luncheon be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n   Address by Adm. Leighton W. Smith, USN, Commander in Chief Allied \n  Forces Southern Europe, Commander in Chief U.S. Naval Forces Europe\n\n       Senator, Congressman, distinguished veterans, those of you \n     who have worked so hard to put on this celebration, good \n     morning.\n       No one knows better than I the value of and the sacrifices \n     made by those we left behind.\n       I am distinctly honored to add my thoughts to those of the \n     many distinguished speakers who have appeared here in \n     previous years.\n       I doubt I can adequately express my gratitude for having \n     been invited to join fellow Alabamians to pay tribute to our \n     veterans--both those that have joined us here today and those \n     who have gone before us.\n       It is absolutely right that we pause to reflect on what \n     this day means--what it signifies--what it cost--and why, as \n     Senator Heflin said last night, ``The Strength of our Nation \n     Must Never Be Allowed to Atrophy''.\n       Few gathered here today can recall the first Armistice Day \n     or the terribleness of the war it commemorated. Time has \n     distanced us from the horror of that conflict.\n       It was the war to end all wars--but history reminds us that \n     it really wasn't.\n       Other wars, conflicts and crises have followed, all \n     evidencing the common denominators of destruction and death, \n     but also individuals whose commitment, courage and personal \n     sacrifices have continued to inspire us all.\n       Senator John Kerry, in speaking at the retirement of our \n     Navy's Vietnam era swift boats, said:\n       ``We were all bound together in the great and noble effort \n     of giving ourselves to something bigger than each and every \n     one of us individually, and doing so at risk of life and \n     limb. Let no one ever doubt the quality and nobility of that \n     commitment.''\n       Those words could have been spoken about our veterans who \n     served in the trenches of France, at Pearl Harbor and Bataan, \n     at Midway, Normandy and Iwo Jima.\n       They would have been true at Inchon and the Frozen Chosin, \n     in the jungles and skies of Vietnam, the deserts of Kuwait \n     and Iraq and in other unnamed places where ordinary people do \n     extraordinary things and in so doing, honor their country \n     while preserving the ideals and values for which it stands.\n       Last year I attended commemorative ceremonies at Normandy.\n       As I sat waiting for the program to begin, I spotted an \n     usher, a young soldier no more than 18 years old, my he \n     looked so young.\n\n[[Page S 17931]]\n\n       It suddenly dawned on me that this boy was the very same \n     age as many of the men who, 50 years ago, had crawled across \n     those bloody beaches and clawed their way up those terrible \n     cliffs, each staring death square in the face.\n       Some survived, all were heros, but tragically so many were \n     mown down in the springtime of their youth, their lives ended \n     before they had really begun.\n       I was awed. What tragedy; what tragedy to rob a nation of \n     its youth, to take a son or daughter from a father, mother, a \n     sister or brother, a husband or wife. What tragedy to deny \n     one so young the joys and excitement of life; the warmth of \n     love, the thrill of watching one's children grow.\n       But then I thought, what if they had not?\n       Somehow seeing that young soldier made all those grave \n     markers in that cemetery even more real, more alive. It \n     literally slammed home in me the utter cruelty of war, the \n     awfulness of what man can do to man, and equally as \n     important, the enormous gift that all of those who \n     experienced the terribleness of that war gave to us.\n       I am told that somewhere in Burma there is a marker \n     inscribed with the message: ``We gave our todays so you could \n     enjoy your tomorrows.''\n       Those of us gathered here today, and in other places around \n     our country, honor the veterans whose legacy of honor, \n     courage and commitment should not, and shall not, ever be \n     forgotten.\n       Let me tell you that the actions of the young men and women \n     of your Armed Forces tell me that they are, as Colin Powell \n     said in an address here a few years back: ``worthy successors \n     to what you their predecessors have passed on to them.''\n       You may all have heard of Capt. Scott O'Grady. He was shot \n     down over Bosnia on 2 June.\n       On the night of 7 June his squadron mate went on a \n     ``fishing expedition'' to try to contact Scott.\n       At 0200 he got contact with Scott O'Grady. I immediately \n     called the amphibious commander, Jerry Schill and the Marine \n     commander Marty Berndt. Both were on the U.S.S. Kearsarge in \n     the Adriatic.\n       I told them to close the coast/call away your tactical \n     recovery of aircrew and personnel team.\n       Didn't ask if--just when.\n       We discussed risks and the possibility of a trap being set.\n       I told Colonel Berndt you're in charge, look around, if you \n     don't like what you see, come out.\n       These were educated risks, and we were operating on the \n     edge of the envelope.\n       Four hours and thirty seven minutes--I got a call, one \n     word--``pickup''.\n       Not many understand all that occurred.\n       We had 60 fixed wing aircraft, special operations backup \n     rescue, Marines backup to that.\n       Went next day to visit, Aviano, Vicenza, U.S.S. Kearsarge:\n       There were no complaints, in spite of the mission being \n     early morning, complex, risky.\n       They thanked me for letting them go.\n       Says a lot about courage, honor, commitment.\n       The same characteristics were demonstrated in attempts to \n     locate and rescue the French pilots shot down 30 August.\n       Plan was developed to recce area of shootdown.\n       At 0130 I got a call from Mike Ryan.\n       Same coordination and complexity as the O'Grady rescue.\n       We tried three successive nights.\n       All three attempts experienced bad weather, all were shot \n     at.\n       That this rescue was not consummated in no way detracts \n     from the courage and commitment of those who tried.\n       These are wonderful stories, and I relive the excitement of \n     those moments each time I tell them.\n       But the important thing here is that these are real stories \n     about real people who demonstrate, every single time they are \n     asked, the legacy of their predecessors and the strength of \n     our great nation.\n       There are, in fact, two kinds of strengths.\n       One is capability, and one is character.\n       Capability is the mechanics, it is the equipment. The \n     machines, the steel, the weapons, the computers, the number \n     of battalions that can be fielded, capability is what we \n     think of when we think of the force.\n       Character, on the other hand, comes from the commitment of \n     the people. It is the moral fabric that binds a nation \n     together, that gives it purpose and defines its identity.\n       Yet as different as capability and character seem, it is \n     their combination that makes a nation strong, that empowers \n     it to greatness, that enables it to lead.\n       I would argue that a nation's strength and greatness is not \n     fully tested until severely stressed, ours has, and we have \n     never been found wanting.\n       Our veterans defined our strength for us and the memory of \n     what they did gives us strength today.\n       Joseph Conrad said:\n       ``And now the old ships and their men are gone; the new \n     ships and men have taken their watch on the stern and \n     impatient sea which offers no opportunities but to those who \n     know how to grasp them with a ready hand and an undaunted \n     heart.''\n       While we thank God for what the old ships and men gave us.\n       I offer to you, our honored veterans that your worthy \n     successors, the veterans of tomorrow, possess ready hands and \n     undaunted hearts.\n       They have learned well from your deeds.\n       We owe you, we owe you a lot. We owe you our thanks, our \n     admiration, and our respect, and we owe you the promise that \n     we shall never allow to be forgotten the deeds performed, nor \n     what you preserved for us.\n       Your legacy of courage, honor and commitment has been \n     received and will be passed on to future generations.\n       This has been a singular honor for me and I am grateful to \n     you all for allowing me to join you on this very special \n     occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/04/senate-section/article/S17930-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1977\n\n Mr. MACK. I would like to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. Activities funded under the \nDepartment of Energy's Codes and Standards Program are primarily \nconcentrated in two sub-programs known as Lighting and Appliances and \nBuilding Standards and Guidelines. However, as is clear in the \nDepartment of Energy's budget, its activities within these two programs \nextend to areas outside of that which might be assumed under their \ntitles. This would include setting standards for commercial equipment \nelectric motors, as well as the advocacy of minimum energy codes for \nresidential buildings. Therefore, it was my understanding that the \nintent of the amendment to H.R. 1977 that placed a 1-year time-out on \nDepartment of Energy's use of funds to propose, issue, or prescribe any \nnew or amended standard would extend to Department of Energy's \nactivities in advocating changes to minimum codes for residential \nenergy use.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My colleague is correct. While not specifically \nspelled out in the statutory language of H.R. 1977, it was my intent \nthat this 1-year time-out extended to the entire program as it related \nto the establishment of minimum standards and codes. I had hoped that \nthis clarification would be made in the conference report, but since \nthere is no report language addressing this issue, I feel it necessary \nto clarify it here for the record. Indeed, product manufacturers have \nraised concerns over the methodology and assumptions in Department of \nEnergy's current cost benefit analysis. Similarly, builders have raised \nconcerns over the minimum mandatory standards found in codes enacted by \nlocal municipalities or States that use the voluntary products of code \nand standard organizations over which Department of Energy has \nsignificant influence. Builders have told me that these standards are \noften not responsive to technological innovation, customer needs, or \neconomic consideration of affordability or payback. Therefore, just as \nthere needs to be a time out to review standards-setting activities \nconducted by the Department of Energy, the same review should apply to \nits activities relating to residential building codes.\n  Mr. MACK. I appreciate this clarification. Indeed, considering that \nthe House language eliminated funding for the entire Codes and \nStandards program, the intent is clear that the House aimed to \ninstitute this 1-year time out on Department of Energy's activities in \nthe standards arena as well as in standards which are part of the codes \nas well as the standards arena. I think it is important that, since the \nHouse agreed to recede to Senate language on this issue, which restored \nthe funds cut by the House, that the Senate ensure that the spirit of \nthe House language be carried out.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would also point out that as means of reaching \nagreement on Senate language, I was asked to include a caveat stating \nthat the Federal Government was not precluded from promulgating rules \nconcerning energy efficiency standards for the construction of new \nfederally owned commercial and residential buildings.
