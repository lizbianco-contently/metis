The clerk will report the pending \nbusiness.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 735) to prevent and punish acts of terrorism, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Hatch amendment No. 1199, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished President pro tempore.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition this morning to comment on \nthe pending legislation, which is obviously a bill of tremendous \nimportance in light of the recent bombing of the Federal building in \nOklahoma City on April 19 and before that the bombing of the World \nTrade Center some 2 years ago.\n  Terrorism has been an enormous problem internationally for decades, \nand now terrorism has struck on the shores and in the heartland of the \nUnited States. In considering legislation to deal with this very \ncritical problem, Mr. President, we should ever be mindful that an \nappropriate balance has to be struck between public safety and the \nconstitutional rights of the citizens under the Bill of Rights which \nhas served our country so well since its adoption in 1791.\n  The pending legislation has appended to it the habeas corpus reform \nbill which has been introduced by the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Hatch, and myself under the caption of the Specter-\nHatch bill, S. 623, and it is legislation which is long overdue to make \nthe death penalty a meaningful deterrent.\n  Last year, with the passage of the crime bill, Federal legislation \nwas enacted which provides for the death penalty for those responsible \nfor the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. The addition \nto this legislation of habeas corpus reform is important because some \ncases have been pending for as long as 20 years. Such delays really \nmakes a virtual nullity of the death penalty because, in order to be an \neffective deterrent, the punishment must be swift and the punishment \nmust be certain. In most of the [[Page S7586]] cases where these long \ndelays have eventuated, the prosecutions characteristically arise in \nthe State courts and go through with the judgment of sentence of death \nultimately affirmed by the highest State court and then habeas corpus \nproceedings in the Federal court.\n  The conduct in Oklahoma City, the bombing of the building and the \nmurder of the innocent children, women, and men, is prosecutable under \nboth Federal and State laws, and there is a slightly different habeas \ncorpus procedure with respect to cases that originate under Federal \njurisdiction. The Specter-Hatch language addresses both types of cases, \nand I think it is very, very important to have it contained in this \nbill.\n  There are other measures in the pending legislation, Mr. President, \nwhich I think require our very calm and deliberate consideration, such \nas the provision which provides for secret proceedings to deport alien \nterrorists. While deportation proceedings are characteristically \ndescribed as a civil proceeding, under the due process clause of law \nhas been held to apply, and the due process clause of the 14th \namendment characteristically incorporates most of the specific \nprovisions of the Bill of Rights including the right of confrontation.\n  I have grave reservations that any kind of a secret proceeding can \npass constitutional muster. It is my thought that we may be able to \nsolve the problem by deporting people suspected of being terrorists or \nknown terrorists because they are in this country illegally. We all \nknow that there are many aliens in the United States illegally, but \nthere are not sufficient resources to deport all of them. It would be \nentirely possible for us to seek to deport aliens who are here \nillegally where there was cause to believe that they are terrorists but \nto deport them not through secret proceedings because they are \nterrorists but because they are in the United States illegally.\n  Toward that end, I think we can abbreviate the procedures for \ndeportation, including limiting appellate review. I think it is \nentirely possible to have, constitutionally, a definite period of \npreventive detention, and if there are defenses such as asylum, they \ncan be litigated in relatively short order so that deportation of \nillegal aliens may be achieved without a conflict with the \nconstitutional right of confrontation.\n  Similarly, Mr. President, I am concerned--and I have expressed this \nbefore in the hearings held in the terrorism subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee, which I chair--about the provisions which would \nenable the Attorney General of the United States to classify an \norganization as engaged in terrorist activities and then deprive that \norganization of rights which are characteristically protected under the \nfirst amendment's freedom of association. While the bill provides for \nde novo review by the court, here again there are provisions for secret \nproceedings which I believe may run afoul of the U.S. Constitution.\n  With respect to any wiretapping provisions which may be added to the \nbill, I think they will require our very, very close scrutiny to be \nsure we are preserving the constitutionally protected rights of those \nwho are subject to the wiretapping.\n  Mr. President, I will also take this opportunity to make some \ncomments on the incidents at Ruby Ridge, ID, and Waco. With the Senate \nbeing fully occupied for the last several days on the budget, I did not \nhave an opportunity to do so before, but it fits right in at this \njuncture, and I shall be relatively brief in summarizing some of the \npreliminary findings which I have come to.\n  As the Congressional Record will show--and my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is in the Chamber--\nit has been my view that we ought to hold hearings on Waco and Ruby \nRidge promptly. And by that I mean on or before August 4. I am well \naware of the consideration of not impeding the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's inquiries into Oklahoma City. But as I said some time \nago, in conversations with the Director of the FBI, he thought that a \nperiod by mid-August, 8 to 10 weeks from the time of our conversation \nas I reported it on the Senate floor, would allow ample time for the \nFBI to complete its Oklahoma City investigation without having any \nproblems created by a Senate inquiry of the full Judiciary Committee.\n  But in the absence of that full inquiry and in the absence of the \nsetting of a date, I had said that I was going to make a preliminary \ninquiry myself. I did have occasion to report very briefly on these \nmatters last week, but I want to comment a little more extensively this \nmorning on my preliminary findings.\n  With respect to the incident at Ruby Ridge, ID, which came to a head \nback on August 21, 1992, I have had occasion to talk to a number of the \npeople who have knowledge of that matter, including FBI Director Louis \nFreeh; FBI Deputy Director Larry Potts; the Director of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, John Magaw; Jerry Spence, the attorney \nfor Mr. Weaver; Mr. Weaver, whom I talked to when I was in Des Moines \nearlier this month in the presence of his attorney, Michael Mooma, Esq. \nI have also talked to Randy Day, Esq., the Boundary County attorney in \nIdaho who was considering possible State prosecutions arising out of \nthat incident. During the course of my conversations with Mr. Weaver, \nhis daughters Sarah, Rachel, and Alicia, ages 19, 13, and 3, were also \npresent.\n  One of the critical aspects of the matter involving Mr. Weaver \nconcerns the issue as to how the entire incident arose. In my meeting \nwith Mr. Weaver, he described the incident as starting out when an \nundercover agent associated, as Mr. Weaver thought, with the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, came to purchase sawed-off shotguns from \nMr. Weaver. As Mr. Weaver himself recounted the incident, he did \nprovide two sawed-off shotguns to the ATF undercover agent.\n  In my later conversations with the Director of the Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms unit, John Magaw, he said that, during the course of the \ntrial, there was an acquittal of Mr. Weaver on grounds of entrapment. \nMr. Magaw described it as borderline entrapment, but it raises a \nfundamental question as to the appropriate course of conduct of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on initiating such a matter \nthrough an undercover agent, a confidential informant, where the \nincident has all the preliminary earmarks of entrapment. And that, in \nfact, was the conclusion of the court, and that is the concession made \nby the director of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unit.\n  Mr. President, a more critical aspect of what happened at Ruby Ridge, \nID, of the tragedy which occurred there--including the killing of a \ndeputy U.S. marshal, the killing of Mr. Weaver's son, Sam Weaver, the \nkilling of Mr. Weaver's wife, Vicky--is the issue of the change in the \nFBI's rules of engagement from the standard shooting policy. On that \nissue, there is a direct conflict between representations made by Mr. \nEugene F. Glenn, who is now the special agent in charge at the Salt \nLake City office of the FBI and Deputy Director Larry Potts of the FBI.\n  In my conversation with Mr. Potts on May 17 of this year, Mr. Potts \nadvised me that there were never any changes in the rules of engagement \nand that he, Mr. Potts, had no authorization to change the deadly force \npolicy.\n  We do know, in the course of the incidents there, that Mrs. Weaver \nwas killed by the bullet of an FBI sharpshooter. The contention has \nbeen made by officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that that \nwas a matter which was necessary to defend other agents who were \ninvolved in the effort to take Mr. Weaver into custody.\n  There is a very significant question as to the circumstances of that \nshooting with respect to a Bureau representation that Mrs. Weaver was \nshot through a door, which raises the inference and suggestion that the \nshooter might not have been able to see Mrs. Weaver, contrasted with \nthe representation of others that the door had a glass pane so that, in \nfact, the shooter may have been able to see Mrs. Weaver. That is not \nascertainable based upon what I know of the facts, because there is a \npossibility of glare, there is a possibility of some obstruction of \nvision even with a pane of glass, but that is certainly something which \nrequires inquiry.\n  Focusing in specifically on the conflict or at least apparent \nconflict between Mr. Potts and Mr. Glenn--as I have said, Deputy \nDirector Potts told me that there were never any changes \n[[Page S7587]] in the rules of engagement and that he had no \nauthorization to change the deadly force policy of the FBI.\n  In a letter from Special Agent Glenn to Michael A. Shaheen, the \nDirector of the Office of Professional Responsibility at the Department \nof Justice, seeking an investigation into what occurred, Mr. Glenn \nrefers specifically to adjustments to the Bureau's standard shooting \npolicy at Ruby Ridge, and he attributes those to Deputy Director Potts.\n  This statement appears at page 6 of the letter from Mr. Glenn to Mr. \nShaheen:\n\n       On August 22, 1992, then Assistant Director Potts advised \n     during a telephonic conversation with SAC\n\n  That means special agent in charge Glenn.\n\n     that he had approved the rules of engagement, and he \n     articulated his reasons for his adjustments to the Bureau's \n     standard shooting policy. During the ten days of the Ruby \n     Ridge stand-off, there were several occasions when SAC Glenn \n     and AD Potts telephonically communicated with one another, \n     and during these conversations they mutually agreed that the \n     rules of engagement should continue to exist. On Wednesday, \n     August 26, 1992, AD Potts approved the FBI returning to the \n     standard shooting policy. This is reflected in the SIOC Log, \n     page 13, item 7.\n\n  Then it follows to have the specification as to what occurred there.\n  When Mr. Glenn requested this special investigation, he draws this \nconclusion at page 1 of the letter:\n\n       * * * investigative deficiencies reveal a purpose to create \n     scapegoats and false impressions, rather than uncovering or \n     reinforcing the reality of what happened at Ruby Ridge.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nletter from Mr. Glenn to Mr. Shaheen be printed at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I shall abbreviate these comments because \nwe are in the middle of the consideration of the broader terrorism \nbill, but these comments are directly relevant to this bill. I know, \nhowever, that others are waiting to speak. While I will have more to \nsay about this at a later time, I will condense these comments at this \ntime.\n  Relating to the incident at Ruby Ridge, there are questions which \nhave already been raised by many as to why Mr. Potts was made the \nDeputy Director of the FBI while this matter was pending and certainly \nbefore there was a congressional inquiry by the U.S. Senate or the \nHouse of Representatives. Those are among my reasons for thinking that \na congressional inquiry into Ruby Ridge should have been held a long \ntime ago, but at least ought to be held as promptly as possible.\n  Mr. President, turning for a few moments to the incident at Waco, TX, \nwhich reached its conclusion on April 19, 1993, let me say at the \noutset as emphatically as I can that whatever happened at Waco, TX, \nwhatever happened at Ruby Ridge, ID, there is absolutely no \njustification for what happened at the Oklahoma City bombing on April \n19 of this year.\n  But I do believe that it is more than coincidence that the incident \nat Waco occurred on April 19 and the incident at Oklahoma City occurred \non the same day 2 years later. I believe it is vital in our democracy \nthat accountability be present at the highest levels of our Government. \nIt has always been my view that there should be a Senate inquiry on \nWaco, and I expressed that view back in the middle of the summer of \n1993 shortly after the Waco incident occurred. My comments were \ncorroborated on the floor of the Senate by the then-chairman, Senator \nBiden, who confirmed that I had been pressing for an inquiry into Waco \nat that time.\n  We live in the greatest democracy in the history of the world, but we \nhave to remember, especially those of us in Washington, DC, and within \nthe beltway, that we govern by the consent of the governed and that the \nright of the Government to govern depends upon the Government's \nrecognizing the rights of individual citizens.\n  There is no mere coincidence between the existence of the Bill of \nRights and the stability of the American Government. The items in the \nBill of Rights have to be very, very carefully safeguarded in every \nrespect. It is a fundamental constitutional duty of the Congress to \nhave oversight. That oversight has not been held with respect either to \nWaco or to Ruby Ridge, and I believe that these matters are directly \nrelated to the pending legislation which we are considering.\n  In just a few minutes, I think the briefest way to set some of the \nquestions on the record which require answering by our congressional \nhearing would be to refer to the report and recommendations filed by \nProf. Alan Stone of Harvard with other recommendations submitted to the \nthen-Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Philip Heymann.\n  Professor Stone was one of a group of panelists who was requested by \nthe FBI to prepare a forward-looking report suggesting possible changes \nin Federal law enforcement in light of what happened at Waco. These are \na few of the comments from Professor Stone.\n  At page 1 of his report, he says:\n\n       . . . Neither the official investigation nor the Dennis \n     evaluation has provided a clear and probing account of the \n     FBI tactics during the stand-off and their possible \n     relationship to the tragic outcome at Waco.\n\n  Then going on a few sentences later:\n\n       I have concluded that the FBI command failed to give \n     adequate consideration to their own behavioral science and \n     negotiation experts. They also failed to make use of the \n     agency's own prior successful experience in similar \n     circumstances. They embarked on a misguided and punishing law \n     enforcement strategy that contributed to the tragic ending at \n     Waco.\n       As a physician, I have concluded that there are serious \n     unanswered questions about the basis for the decision to \n     deploy toxic CS gas in a closed space where there were 25 \n     children, many of them toddlers and infants.\n\n  Skipping ahead to page 24, Professor Stone goes on to say:\n\n       One might think that the highest priority after a tragedy \n     like Waco would be for everyone involved to consider what \n     went wrong and what would they now do differently. I must \n     confess that it has been a frustrating and disappointing \n     experience to discover that the Justice Department's \n     investigation has produced so little in this regard.\n\n  Moving ahead now to page 30 briefly:\n\n       The FBI needs a better knowledge base about the medical \n     consequences of CS gas.\n       It is my opinion that the AG--\n\n  The Attorney General.\n\n     --was not properly informed of the risks to infants and small \n     children posed by CS gas.\n\n  Continuing a few sentences later:\n\n       The FBI, the Justice Department, and all of law enforcement \n     that uses CS gas ought to have as clear an understanding of \n     its medical consequences as possible.\n\n  Then on his final page, page 31, under a caption ``Final Word,'' \nthere is this statement:\n\n       There is a view within the FBI and in the official reports \n     that suggests the tragedy was unavoidable. This report is a \n     dissenting opinion from that view.\n\n  Then a final sentence:\n\n       It is my considered opinion that the failings of the FBI at \n     Waco involved no intentional misconduct.\n\n  Mr. President, in order to save time, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text of this report by Professor Stone be printed at the end \nof my statement this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the citations which I refer to and in \nthe full text of what Professor Stone has raised, which will be \napparent to those who will see it in the Congressional Record, there \nare many unanswered questions as to what happened at Waco, just as \nthere are many unanswered questions as to what happened at Ruby Ridge. \nIt is my hope that we will have a Senate inquiry just as promptly as \npossible.\n  I think it is vital that there be accountability at the highest \nlevels of Government and that the public will be assured that the \nCongress will fully carry out its responsibilities for oversight under \nour constitutional responsibility.\n  Yesterday, we had scheduled a hearing involving the militia movement \nin the subcommittee of Judiciary which I chair. That hearing, \nregrettably, had to be postponed because we were voting continuously \nall day long. But yesterday afternoon, I put into the Record the \nprepared statements of some witnesses that came from the militia \nmovement. In brief conversation I had with those individuals, they \nexpressed their concern about what the Government had done and their \ngratification [[Page S7588]] that at least the subcommittee was making \nan inquiry into what had gone on. If we discharge our duties, Mr. \nPresident, we can provide a safety valve to let the citizens of America \nknow that their constitutional rights are being respected and that \nthere will be congressional oversight no matter where the blame may lie \nat the highest level of the Federal Government, if there is any blame.\n  I do not prejudge what went on at Ruby Ridge or at Waco, but I am \nabsolutely convinced that there are many, very, very serious questions \nas to the governmental action at Ruby Ridge and Waco, and I am \nconvinced that the safety valve and venting possible through a Senate \nfull inquiry is very vital as we consider these problems of terrorism \nand move ahead to provide better protection to the American people from \ndomestic terrorism and at the same time guarantee that the \nconstitutional rights are preserved.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                  Salt Lake City, UT, May 3, 1995.\n     Michael E. Shaheen,\n     Office of Professional Responsibility,\n     U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Shaheen: The purpose of this letter is to request \n     the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) conduct an \n     investigation into the conduct of FBI Associate Special Agent \n     in Charge (A-SAC) Charles Mathews, III and possibly others \n     during the period A-SAC Mathews served on special assignment \n     in Washington, D.C. from October through December, 1994, \n     preparing the Administrative Summary Report regarding the \n     conduct of FBI personnel involved in the Ruby Ridge matter.\n       As a key participant in the events of Ruby Ridge, I believe \n     I was not adequately or fully interviewed, yet the \n     investigative report was relied upon in proposing discipline \n     against me and other FBI Agents. As is explained below, this \n     and other investigative deficiencies reveal a purpose to \n     create scapegoats and false impressions, rather than \n     uncovering or reinforcing the reality of what happened at \n     Ruby Ridge.\n       A-SAC Mathews was provided with the 1994 Ruby Ridge report \n     of Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney Barbara Berman, along \n     with sixteen issues raised by the DOJ during their review of \n     the Berman Report. These issues concern alleged misconduct by \n     FBI employees. His assignment as preparer of the \n     Administrative Summary Report was: evaluate existing \n     documentation contained in the Berman report for evidence of \n     misconduct, review additional documentation within the FBI \n     that was not a part of the Berman report, and conduct or have \n     conducted appropriate investigation to either substantiate or \n     refute each allegation.\n                 investigative procedural requirements\n\n       As is clearly documented in subsequent portions of this \n     letter, A-SAC Mathews conducted his administrative review \n     with little regard to FBI policy and procedure, and as such \n     his Administrative Summary Report is critically flawed.\n       For example, A-SAC Mathews did not follow the FBI Manual Of \n     Administrative Operations and Procedures (MAOP) as it \n     pertains to interviews of employees under criminal or \n     administrative inquiry. Section 13-4 of the MAOP is \n     particularly relevant as follows:\n       ``13-4 Interviews of Employees Involved\n       ``(1) Interviews of employees involved in allegations of \n     criminality or serious misconduct should be conducted at the \n     earliest logical time and in a forthright manner. There \n     should be no evasiveness on the part of the Bureau official \n     conducting the interview.\n       ``(2) The employee should be fully and specifically advised \n     of the allegations which have been made against him/her in \n     order that he/she may have an opportunity to fully answer and \n     respond to them. . . .\n       ``(3) Such interviews must be complete and thorough with \n     all pertinent information obtained and recorded so that all \n     phases of the allegations may be resolved. . . .\n       ``(4) The inquiry shall not be complete until the specific \n     allegations that may justify disciplinary action are made \n     known to the employee who may be disciplined and the employee \n     is afforded reasonable time to answer the specific \n     allegations. The employee's answers, explanations, defenses, \n     etc., should be recorded in the form of a signed, sworn \n     statement which should specifically include the allegations \n     made against the employee in an introductory paragraph. The \n     statement is to be prepared following an in-depth interview \n     of the employee by the division head or designated\n      supervisory representative. The employee is not merely to be \n     asked to give a written response to the allegations, but \n     is to be interviewed in an interrogatory fashion, and a \n     signed, sworn statement prepared from the results by the \n     interviewing official. . . .''\n\n\n                            mathews actions\n\n       I have enclosed and request your review of the following: \n     (1) the form ``Warning and Assurance to Employee Required to \n     Provide Information'' (FD-645) which states, ``This inquiry \n     pertains to Allegations of misconduct relating to the Rules \n     of Engagement established for the Ruby Ridge critical \n     incident and whether the FBI fully and adequately \n     participated in the investigation/prosecution of Weaver/\n     Harris,'' and (2) the compelled signed statement of Eugene F. \n     Glenn dated December 8, 1994, provided by A-SAC Mathews and \n     Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) Jerry R. Donahoe, in which \n     paragraph two reads, ``I have been informed that this inquiry \n     pertains to allegations of misconduct relating to the Rules \n     of Engagement (ROE) established for the Ruby Ridge critical \n     incident and whether the FBI fully and adequately \n     participated in the investigation/prosecution of Weaver/\n     Harris.''\n       It should be noted that my ten-page signed statement dated \n     December 8, 1994, details liaison issues concerning the FBI, \n     Salt Lake City and the United States Attorney's (USA's) \n     Office, Boise, Idaho, for a period of time prior to the Ruby \n     Ridge incident and extending through the Harris/Weaver trial. \n     No questions were asked regarding ``rules of engagement.'' \n     Specifically, I was not asked why I had allegedly approved \n     the rules of engagement or more basically who had approved \n     the rules of engagement. I was never informed that I faced \n     possible disciplinary action for my alleged approval of the \n     rules of engagement. And although contrary to the printed \n     purpose of the inquiry as set forth on the FD-645, supra, A-\n     SAC Mathews stated during the beginning of this interview, \n     ``The rules of engagement are considered unconstitutional; \n     therefore, there is no need to further discuss them.'' This \n     is clearly in conflict with the MAOP citation 13-4(2)&(4) \n     above.\n\n\n                      department of justice report\n\n       I direct your attention to an excerpt from an article that \n     appeared in ``Legal Times,'' on March 6, 1995, captioned, \n     ``DOJ Report May halt FBI Official's Rise.'' This article is \n     based on a review of the DOJ Ruby Ridge report prepared by \n     Barbara Berman. Apparently this report was leaked to the \n     media during late February, 1995. The ``Legal Times'' article \n     states:\n       ``In the Reno inquiry, Potts had told investigators that he \n     never approved the final rules of engagement, the guidelines \n     governing a particular operation. Reno has refused to release \n     the 542-page report, saying that she would wait until the \n     local district attorney in Boundary County, Idaho, completes \n     an investigation into whether agents should be charged with \n     murder.\n       ``But according to testimony contained in the report, which \n     was obtained by Legal Times, Potts did approve the shoot-on-\n     sight rule.\n       ``The task force found that FBI operatives on the ground in \n     Idaho faxed an operational plan, including the proposed rules \n     of engagement, to headquarters for approval by Potts and his \n     then deputy, Danny Coulson. But according to Freeh, Coulson \n     had questions about other facets of the operation discussed \n     and did not notice, let alone read, the rules of engagement. \n     Potts, who had been working on the matter for 36 straight \n     hours, was not on duty at the time and, hence, did not see \n     the written rules.\n       ``But Eugene Glenn, the on-site commander of the FBI \n     operation, says in a January 1994 declaration that he \n     believes he had already obtained Potts' approval by telephone \n     before the shooting.\n       ``The Reno task force also seemed to give credence to \n     Glenn's account. `(I)t is inconceivable to us that FBI \n     Headquarters remained ignorant of the exact wording of the \n     Rules of Engagement during the entire period,' the report \n     says.\n       ``But FBI officials dispute Glenn's account and criticize \n     the Justice Department's report as flawed.\n       ```When you piece together the evidence as best as possible \n     after the fact, we reached our best judgment, and that's \n     reflected in the discipline that the director announced or \n     proposed,' says FBI General Counsel Howard Shapiro, who was \n     directly involved in the FBI's inquiry.\n       ``Freeh and Potts both declined comment.\n       ```I can't speak for the director personally,' Shapiro \n     says, `but a lot turned on the fact that Potts had not \n     approved the final form of the rules of engagement, which are \n     admittedly problematic. Had we found otherwise, it surely \n     would have been grounds for further sanction,' the general \n     counsel adds.\n       ``Shapiro declined to elaborate, saying that the FBI's \n     conclusions about what happened are based on information that \n     Reno has said the bureau must not release pending the outcome \n     of the local investigation.''\n       I have never been interviewed/interrogated regarding the \n     rules of engagement. I was not made aware of the charge that \n     I had approved the rules of engagement. Additionally, HRT \n     Commander Dick Rogers, SAC Bill Gore, and SAC Robin \n     Montgomery were not interviewed/interrogated regarding the \n     rules of engagement during A-SAC Mathews' preparation of the \n     Administrative Summary Report.\n\n\n                 fbihq approval of rules of engagement\n\n       I had been interviewed previously on two occasions: during \n     September, 1992 as part of the Shooting Incident Report, and \n     again on January 12, 1994, as part of the Berman DOJ inquiry. \n     It is specifically detailed in the Shooting Incident Report \n     that the rules of engagement were approved at FBI \n     Headquarters. I call your attention to the following pages: \n     Administrative Section, Cover Page #, Paragraph 1; Report \n     Synopsis, Page 2, Lines 3 through 7; the body of the report, \n     Page 3, Paragraph 2; Dick Rogers signed statement, Page 2, \n     Paragraph 2 through Page 3, Paragraph 2; and signed statement \n     of Eugene F. Glenn, Page 5, Paragraph 2 through \n     [[Page S7589]] Page 6, Paragraph 1; and also to then \n     Assistant Director Potts' signed statement where he \n     articulates as part of this report that he approved the rules \n     of engagement. The DOJ inquiry covered a broad period of time \n     and touched only briefly on rules of engagement. Questioning \n     concerning who approved the rules of engagement was not \n     addressed in detail by interviewing officials during the \n     preparation of my signed statement. Questions concerning who \n     approved the rules of engagement did not appear to be a \n     critical issue to be developed at the time of the Berman \n     report.\n       It should be noted that on September 30, 1992, the date of \n     the Shooting Report, there was no discussion regarding who \n     approved the rules of engagement. The report simply states \n     that\n      the rules of engagement were approved at FBI Headquarters. \n     It is also noted that the Shooting Review Committee \n     Report, dated November 9, 1992, once again concurred that \n     FBI Headquarters approved the rules of engagement. \n     According to the ``Legal Times'' article dated March 6, \n     1995, the DOJ findings were, ``(I)t is inconceivable to us \n     that FBI Headquarters remained ignorant of the exact \n     wording of the Rules of Engagement during the entire \n     period.''\n       There was no indication that the rules of engagement \n     presented to field command at Ruby Ridge on Saturday, August \n     22, 1992, differed in any way from the rules of engagement \n     Larry Potts advised he approved during his signed, sworn \n     statement taken during the creation of the Shooting Review \n     Report. It was only after the interviewing began that \n     pertained to the DOJ inquiry headed up by Barbara Berman \n     (over one year after the incident) that statements began to \n     waiver with regard to responsibility for approval of the \n     rules of engagement.\n       In the absence of approved and recognized investigative \n     methods and techniques, A-SAC Mathews managed to take a \n     quantum leap from the factual basis documented in three \n     previous reports to a position of placing the blame for \n     approval of the rules of engagement on SAC Eugene F. Glenn. \n     It should be noted that this remarkable conclusionary quantum \n     leap by A-SAC Mathews was accomplished without the benefit of \n     any additional pertinent interviews of the logical parties \n     who were aware of the rules of engagement approval process.\n       With regard to then Assistant Director Potts, his signed \n     statement taken on September 24, 1992, (a part of the \n     Shooting Review Report), advised that he jointly prepared the \n     rules of engagement with HRT Commander Dick Rogers while \n     Rogers was flying from Washington, D.C. to Northern Idaho to \n     carry out his assigned task as HRT Commander on-scene during \n     Ruby Ridge. On Saturday morning, August 22, 1992, HRT \n     Commander Rogers presented SACs Glenn and Gore with the OPS \n     Plan that included the rules of engagement; he advised how \n     these rules had been prepared during the flight from \n     Washington, D.C. to Northern Idaho and that then Assistant \n     Director Potts was involved in the preparation of these rules \n     of engagement and that Potts had approved them. On August 22, \n     1992, then Assistant Director Potts advised during a \n     telephonic conversation with SAC Glenn that he had approved \n     the rules of engagement, and he articulated his reasons for \n     these adjustments to the Bureau's standard shooting policy. \n     During the ten days of the Ruby Ridge stand-off there were \n     several occasions when SAC Glenn and AD Potts telephonically \n     communicated with one another, and during these conversations \n     they mutually agreed that the rules of engagement should \n     continue to exist. On Wednesday, August 26, 1992, AD Potts \n     approved the\n      FBI returning to the standard shooting policy. This is \n     reflected in the SIOC Log, page 31, item 7, as follows: \n     ``7) AD Potts and SAC Glenn agreed effective 1:00 p.m. \n     EDT, 8/26/92, that the rules of engagement have changed \n     and that they are now that we should fire only in \n     accordance with current FBI shooting policy. . . .''\n\n\n                  fbihq oversight of crisis situations\n\n       During the January 6, 1995, press conference given by \n     Director Freeh concerning discipline of FBI Agents involved \n     in Ruby Ridge, the Director stated that Deputy Assistant \n     Director (DAD) Coulson had not read the rules of engagement. \n     If this, in fact, were true, I do not understand how such a \n     dereliction could be accepted from an individual whose sole \n     purpose for being in SIOC during this crisis was to be in \n     command of FBI operations at Ruby Ridge. It is a long-\n     standing FBI procedure that any time SIOC is in operation, \n     all investigative plans, operations plans, and tactical \n     initiatives are approved by the individual in charge of SIOC. \n     This point can be testified to by any SAC present or former \n     who has ever served during a crisis with SIOC in operation. \n     Additionally, it can be testified to by any local, state, or \n     county law enforcement officer who has worked jointly with \n     the FBI during a crisis incident with SIOC in operation. I \n     have had several local and state officers come forward who \n     will testify that they witnessed this above-described \n     procedure during the Singer-Swapp crisis in Utah in 1988. \n     Additionally, officials of the U.S. Marshal's Service (USMS) \n     were present at Ruby Ridge in 1992 and witnessed the \n     procedure when the operations plan, which on page two \n     contained the rules of engagement, was sent via facsimile to \n     FBI Headquarters on Saturday, August 22, 1992, at 12:15 PM \n     PST, and to the USMS Headquarters simultaneously. At 12:30 \n     PM, PST, the USMS Headquarters responded they had no \n     objections to the operations plan. Bureau approval was not \n     obtained for the operations plan until the negotiation annex \n     was faxed back to FBI Headquarters. At that time DAD Coulson \n     advised he approved the operations plan.\n       DAD Coulson relieved AD Potts on Saturday, August 22, 1992. \n     It is reasonable to assume that AD Potts fully briefed DAD \n     Coulson regarding the activities surrounding the Ruby Ridge \n     matter, including rules of engagement, prior to turning over \n     command responsibilities to him. I call your attention to the \n     SIOC Log, page 8, time 18:04, which reads as follows: ``DAD \n     Coulson sent a facsimile to SAC Glenn re questions regarding \n     the Operations Plan submitted by SAC Salt Lake. 1. No mention \n     is made of Sniper Observer deployment as of 5:30 p.m. EST--\n     (2:30 PST)\n      2. What intelligence has been gathered from the crisis \n     point? 3. There is no mention of a Negotiation Strategy to \n     secure release of individuals at the crisis point. 4. \n     There is no mention of any attempt to negotiate at all. 5. \n     SAC Salt Lake is requested to consider negotiation \n     strategy and advise FBIHQ. FBIHQ is not prepared to \n     approve the plan as submitted at this time.''\n\n\n                    fbihq actions on operations plan\n\n       When DAD Coulson received the operations plan on Saturday, \n     August 22, 1992, he telephonically advised SAC Glenn he could \n     not approve the operations plan because it contained nothing \n     about negotiation strategy. DAD Coulson and SAC Glenn had a \n     lengthy telephone conversation concerning the points 1 \n     through 5 set forth in the previous paragraph. Item 1 which \n     deals with sniper observer deployment was discussed at \n     length. It should be noted there were over 200 members of \n     HRT, FBI SWAT team members, and other tactical and \n     investigative units who were all held in camp and were not \n     deployed, including sniper observers, until after DAD Coulson \n     had received the crisis negotiation annex to the operations \n     plan and at that time the field command was free to move \n     sniper observer teams into forward positions. The sniper log \n     verifies that snipers were in position at 5:07 PM, Pacific \n     Daylight Time (8:07 PM, Eastern Daylight Time), which is \n     after DAD Coulson had approved the operations plan containing \n     the rules of engagement. There is no logic to the assumption \n     that FBI leadership responsible for field command at Ruby \n     Ridge would fax the operations plan containing the rules of \n     engagement to FBI Headquarters and USMS Headquarters \n     (receiving approval from the latter) and then deploy FBI \n     resources prior to receiving approval from SIOC, FBI \n     Headquarters. Is it logical to conclude that the two FBI SACs \n     and the FBI HRT Commander on the scene would have mutually \n     concurred to deploy FBI resources absent prior SIOC approval?\n       The question must asked how did DAD Coulson avoid reviewing \n     the rules of engagement which are located on page 2 of the \n     Operation Plan inasmuch as he obviously had reviewed the \n     Operations Plan to come up with the questions as set forth in \n     the SIOC Log, supra.\n       Page 8 of the SIOC Log at 18;30 reads as follows: ``SAC \n     Glenn advised DAD Coulson that Portland SWAT team had contact \n     with who they believe was subject approximately \\1/4\\ mile \n     `up canyon' from home. He used profanity and told them to get \n     off property. SAC was reminded of rules of engagement and to \n     treat subject as threat if confronted outside home. SAC is \n     working on negotiation plan.''\n       It is noted that DAD Coulson's reminder to SAC Glenn \n     regarding how to handle Weaver if confronted outside his home \n     is in keeping with the rules of engagement that appeared in \n     the Operations Plan and is not in keeping with the standard \n     Bureau shooting policy.\n       Additionally, there exist two witnesses--one an individual \n     who had a high-level position in SIOC during the operation \n     who advised it was common knowledge that FBI Headquarters \n     approved the rules of engagement; and the second witness is a \n     Bureau Supervisor who served in SIOC on Saturday with DAD \n     Coulson and overheard him discussing the rules of engagement \n     with Bureau Supervisor Tony Betz.\n\n\n               conflicts on rules of engagement approval\n\n       I am aware that there exist conflicting statements \n     regarding approval of the rules of engagement. Had A-SAC \n     Mathews conducted his administrative review with the ethical \n     standards and integrity normally associated with any FBI \n     Agent, each of the individuals involved (Potts, Coulson, \n     Rogers, Glenn, Gore, and Montgomery) would have been \n     interrogated to resolve any conflicts that appear in their \n     statements regarding rules of engagement. Had interrogation \n     not resolved these conflicts, polygraph examinations should \n     have been mandated as the next logical step. This type of in-\n     depth investigation should have been mandated by A-SAC \n     Mathews prior to any conclusions being drawn concerning who \n     approved the rules of engagement.\n\n\n           deficiencies on u.s. attorney liaison conclusions\n\n       Instead of being interrogated concerning charges placed \n     against me, I was afforded a telephonic ``soft'' fact-finding \n     chronology-type review interview concerning liaison with the \n     USA's Office in Boise, Idaho. I was never confronted with the \n     allegations made by former U.S. Attorney Maurice Ellsworth \n     and/or others. Individuals I suggested to A-SAC Mathews that \n     should be contacted to provide additional insight regarding \n     liaison problems that existed with the USA's Office in Boise \n     under Ellsworth's leadership were [[Page S7590]] not \n     contacted, and the current U.S. Attorney in Boise and former \n     Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho were never \n     contacted to verify the current excellent liaison that exists \n     between the FBI and USA's Office in Boise. It should be noted \n     that U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho Betty Richardson \n     and former Acting U.S. Attorney Pat Malloy of that office \n     wrote unsolicited letters to both Attorney General Janet Reno \n     and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh describing the current high \n     quality of liaison that exists between the FBI and the USA's \n     Office in Idaho. It is important to note that according to \n     the DOJ report leaked to the media concerning the Ruby Ridge \n     matter.\n      the criticism leveled in the DOJ investigation focused on \n     liaison discrepancies by Headquarters Units of the FBI and \n     their interaction with the USA's Office in Boise, Idaho. \n     Yet, the Mathews report turned the responsibility for \n     deficiencies in liaison with the USA's Office in Boise, \n     Idaho, to the Salt Lake City Field Division without \n     conducting logical investigative steps and without \n     advising those to be charged with these derelictions of \n     the specific allegations they would be facing.\n\n\n                     deficiencies in mathews report\n\n       I have not yet been given access to the Mathews \n     Administrative Summary Report; however, I am aware of other \n     areas that were covered within the scope of this inquiry \n     where A-SAC Mathews: (1) failed to develop/gather all \n     evidence regarding liaison between the FBI, Salt Lake City \n     and the USA's Office in Boise; (2) demonstrated unethical \n     conduct by selectively choosing FBI Field Agents for \n     discipline and omitting others involved jointly with those \n     selected for discipline; (3) selectively choosing ASAC Thomas \n     Miller and SAC Michael Kahoe for discipline regarding the \n     Shooting Review Report for ``inaccurately and incompletely \n     analyzing the report'' while omitting discipline of others \n     who had to have reviewed the report (then Chief Inspector of \n     the Inspection Division, then Assistant Director of the \n     Inspection Division, then Deputy Assistant Director Danny \n     Coulson, CID; then Assistant Director Larry Potts, CID), all \n     of whom had to have read, analyzed, and approved this \n     Shooting Report prior to it being sent to then Deputy \n     Director Doug Gow; (4) and finally, other FBI Agents were \n     interviewed by A-SAC Mathews and were subsequently censured, \n     yet were not advised they were the subjects of an \n     administrative inquiry nor were they given the standard \n     waiver form to sign (FD-645).\n       A-SAC Mathews, a close associate of then DAD Danny Coulson, \n     served as Coulson's ASAC in the Portland Office of the FBI \n     when Coulson was SAC from August 24, 1988, to December 29, \n     1991. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn to \n     explain the deception and lack of completeness in this \n     investigation is that A-SAC Mathews' relationship with \n     Coulson caused him to avoid the development of the necessary \n     facts, and caused him to cover up facts germane to the \n     central issues. It is beyond conceivability that any FBI \n     Agent with 25 years of experience could have inadvertently \n     presented such an incomplete, inaccurate document as the \n     Administrative Summary Report prepared by A-SAC Mathews. Had \n     A-SAC Mathews demonstrated the ethical standards normally \n     associated with someone in the FBI of his position, he would \n     have recused himself from this assignment because of an \n     obvious conflict of interest.\n                 status of proposed disciplinary action\n\n       More than 115 days have passed since I was publicly \n     castigated by Director Freeh during his infamous January 6, \n     1995, national press conference. To date I have not been \n     given copies of the Administrative Summary Report prepared by \n     A-SAC Mathews, the Department of Justice Report concerning \n     Ruby Ridge prepared in 1994 by Barbara Berman (leaked to the \n     media in February, 1995), the FBI report concerning the Ruby \n     Ridge matter prepared by then Inspector Robert E. Walsh in \n     1994 (which report parallels the Berman report but presents \n     findings that differ), and other internal documents I have \n     gone on record requesting under the provisions of FOIPA.\n       Since January 6, 1995, the FBI in concert with the DOJ has \n     moved forward to have affirmed the correctness of the \n     discipline handed out to then Assistant Director Potts, and \n     on May 2, 1995, finalized his promotion to Deputy Director of \n     the FBI.\n       This action was taken while my appeal sits unaddressed in \n     the office of Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick. The \n     DOJ, aware that there are unresolved issues concerning \n     responsibility for authorization of the rules of engagement \n     at Ruby Ridge, chose to ignore the opportunity to hear from \n     SAC Glenn and instead took a course of action which further \n     exasperates an already flawed Administrative Review Process.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       I request that a thorough OPR inquiry be initiated. There \n     are numerous administrative guidelines and procedures that \n     have been violated, and it is conceivable that federal \n     statutes have been violated. The lack of professionalism \n     demonstrated in the handling of the Administrative Summary \n     Report in connection with the Ruby Ridge matter casts a dark \n     cloud over the integrity of the FBI and the DOJ.\n       I would welcome the opportunity to be interrogated \n     regarding this matter, and would likewise welcome the \n     opportunity to submit to a polygraph examination afforded to \n     me by a professional, nationally-recognized operator with a \n     total independent bearing in this matter.\n       This letter has not been referred directly to OPR, \n     Inspection Division, FBI Headquarters, since it would create \n     a conflict of interest for Assistant Director Gore, who was \n     present and intricately involved in discussions involving the \n     Operations Plan (including rules of engagement) utilized \n     during the Ruby Ridge crisis in Idaho.\n           Respectfully yours,\n\n                                              Eugene F. Glenn,\n\n                                          Special Agent in Charge,\n                                          Salt Lake City Division.\n                               Exhibit 2\n\nReport and Recommendations Concerning the Handling of Incidents Such as \n                the Branch Davidian Standoff in Waco, TX\n\n(Submitted to Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann, by Panelist Alan \nA. Stone, M.D., Touroff-Glueck Professor of Psychiatry and Law, Faculty \n of Law and Faculty of Medicine, Harvard University, November 10, 1993)\n\n\n                              i. preamble\n\n       The Justice Department's official investigation published \n     on October 8th together with other information made available \n     to the panelists present convincing evidence that David \n     Koresh ordered his followers to set the fire in which they \n     perished. However, neither the official investigation nor the \n     Dennis evaluation has provided a clear and probing account of \n     the FBI tactics during the stand-off and their possible \n     relationship to the tragic outcome at Waco. This report \n     therefore contains an account based on my own further review \n     and interpretation of the facts.\n       I have concluded that the FBI command failed to give \n     adequate consideration to their own behavioral science and \n     negotiation experts. They also failed to make use of the \n     Agency's own prior successful experience in similar \n     circumstances. They embarked on a misguided and punishing law \n     enforcement strategy that contributed to the tragic ending at \n     Waco.\n       As a physician, I have concluded that there are serious \n     unanswered questions about the basis for the decision to \n     deploy toxic C.S. gas in a closed space where there were 25 \n     children, many of them toddlers and infants.\n       This report makes several recommendations, first among them \n     is that further inquiry will be necessary to resolve the many \n     unanswered questions. Even with that major caveat, I believe \n     the Deputy Attorney General's suggestions for forward looking \n     changes are excellent and endorse them. This report makes \n     further specific recommendations for change building on his \n     proposal.\n\n\n                            ii. introduction\n\n     A: Explanation for the delay in the submission of this report\n\n       This past summer, the Justice and Treasury Departments \n     appointed a group of panelists, each of whom was to prepare a \n     forward-looking report\n      suggesting possible changes in federal law enforcement in \n     light of Waco. For reasons set forth below, I decided that \n     before submitting a report based on my particular \n     professional expertise, it was necessary to have a \n     complete understanding of the factual investigation by the \n     Justice Department. Having now had the opportunity to read \n     and study that report and the Dennis Evaluation, I \n     concluded that I did not yet have the kind of clear and \n     probing view of events that is a necessary prerequisite \n     for making suggestions for constructive change. Deputy \n     Attorney General (DAG) Philip Heymann therefore made it \n     possible for me to pursue every further question I had \n     with those directly responsible for the Justice \n     Department's factual investigation and with the FBI agents \n     whose participation at Waco was relevant to my inquiry. \n     Their cooperation allowed me to obtain the information \n     necessary for this report.\n       The Justice Department has sifted through a mountain of \n     information, some of which, in accordance with Federal \n     Statute, can not be publicly revealed. This evidence \n     overwhelmingly proves that David Koresh and the Branch \n     Davidians set the fire and killed themselves in the \n     conflagration at Waco, which fulfilled their apocalyptic \n     prophecy. This report does not question that conclusion; \n     instead, my concern as a member of the Behavioral Science \n     Panel is whether the FBI strategy pursued at Waco in some way \n     contributed to the tragedy which resulted in the death of \n     twenty-five innocent children along with the adults. The \n     Justice Department Investigation and the Dennis Evaluation \n     seem to agree with the FBI commander on the ground, who is \n     convinced that nothing the FBI did or could have done would \n     have changed the outcome. That is not my impression.\n       I therefore decided it was necessary to include in this \n     report my own account of the events I considered critical. I \n     have attempted to confirm every factual assertion of this \n     account with the FBI or the Justice Department. Although, in \n     my discussions with the Justice Department, I encountered a \n     certain skepticism\n      about what I shall report here, I was quite reassured by \n     interviews with the FBI's behavioral scientists and \n     negotiators, who confirmed some of my impressions and \n     encouraged my efforts. Because they share my belief that \n     mistakes were made, they expressed their determination to \n     have the truth come out, regardless of the consequences. I \n     hope that this report will bolster the FBI and its new \n     Director's efforts to conduct their forthcoming review of \n     Waco, which has not yet begun. I also [[Page S7591]] hope \n     that my report and suggestions for change will in some \n     measure enable the FBI to work more effectively with the \n     Justice Department, the Attorney General, and other law \n     enforcement agencies.\n\n               B. Mandate to the panel as I understood it\n\n       The mandate to the panelists was ``to assist in addressing \n     issues that Federal Law Enforcement confronts in barricade/\n     hostage situations such as the stand-off that occurred near \n     Waco, Texas. . . .'' Specifically, my sub-group (Ammerman, \n     Cancro, Stone, Sullivan) was directed to explore: ``Dealing \n     with persons whose motivations and thought processes are \n     unconventional. How should law enforcement agencies deal with \n     persons or groups which thought processes or motivations \n     depart substantially from ordinary familiar behavior in \n     barricade situations such as Waco? How should the motivations \n     of the persons affect the law enforcement response? What \n     assistance can be provided by experts in such fields as \n     psychology, psychiatry, sociology, and theology?''\\1\\\n     \\1\\Memorandum of June 25, 1993.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       These seemed to be two premises in this request by the \n     Deputy Attorney General (DAG). The first premise was that \n     Waco had been a tragic event, so it was important for the \n     agencies and the people involved to examine the evidence, \n     evaluate their actions, and initiate change based on those \n     conclusions. Second, although there were questions about the \n     psychiatric status of David Koresh, the\n      DAG's use of the term, ``unconventional,'' indicated that we \n     were also broadly to consider groups with ``belief \n     systems'' that might cause them to think and behave \n     differently than ordinary criminals and therefore to be \n     more difficult for law enforcement to deal with and \n     understand. As I understood it, the Branch Davidians' \n     religious beliefs were considered unconventional,'' which \n     was not intended to be a pejorative term, but rather a \n     descriptive one. The panelists were also told that there \n     was concern among federal law enforcement officials that \n     more such ``unconventional'' groups might, in the near \n     future, pose problems for which law enforcement's standard \n     operating procedures might not be suitable.\n       Given this important responsibility and the fact that we \n     were asked to make recommendations ``[c]oncerning the \n     handling of incidents such as the Branch Davidian Standoff in \n     Waco, Texas'' (emphasis added), I felt unprepared to go \n     forward without a thorough grasp of the events and decisions \n     that led to the tragedy. However, the Justice Department was \n     still in the preliminary stage of their own fact-gathering \n     investigation at our panel briefings in early July. Hoping to \n     convey the particular issues of concern to me, I prepared a \n     preliminary report based on the initial briefings. Since the \n     factual information I wanted and needed was still being \n     gathered by the Justice Department, I did not attend the \n     subsequent special briefings arranged for the panel at \n     Quantico, Virginia. Because of my reticence to furnish a \n     report based on incomplete information, the DAG and I \n     resolved that I would submit my report subsequent to the \n     completion of the Justice Department's factual inquiry. I \n     have now had the opportunity to review the following \n     documents:\n       1. Report of the Department of the Treasury on the Bureau \n     of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Investigation of Vernon \n     Wayne Howell Also Known As David Koresh, September, 1993;\n       2. Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at \n     Waco, Texas,\n      February 28 to April 19, 1993 (Redacted Version), October 8, \n     1993;\n       3. Edward S.G. Dennis, Jr., Evaluation of the Handling of \n     the Branch Davidian Stand-off in Waco, Texas, February 28 to \n     April 19, 1993 (Redacted version), October 8, 1993;\n       4. Deputy Attorney General Philip B. Heymann, Lessons of \n     Waco: Proposed Changes in Federal Law Enforcement October 8, \n     1993;\n       5. Recommendations of Experts for Improvements in Federal \n     Law Enforcement After Waco.\n       As previously mentioned, the Justice Department and the FBI \n     have answered my further questions, supplied me with \n     documents, and helped me explore issues of greatest relevance \n     to my inquiry.\n\n\n                   iii. account of the events at waco\n\n       The FBI replaced the BATF at the Branch Davidian compound \n     on the evening of February 28 and the morning of March 1. \n     There had been casualties on both sides during the BATF's \n     attempted dynamic entry. David Koresh, the leader of the \n     Branch Davidians, had been shot through the hip, and the \n     situation was in flux. It would become, as we have been told, \n     the longest stand-off in law enforcement history. The FBI, \n     with agents in place who were trained for rapid intervention, \n     was locked into a prolonged siege. The perimeter was \n     difficult to control, the conditions were extreme, and the \n     stress was intense. Furthermore, the FBI's people had \n     inherited a disaster that was not of their own making. \n     ``Under the circumstances, the FBI exhibited extraordinary \n     restraint and handled this crisis with great \n     professionalism'' the Dennis Evaluation concludes. While this \n     may be true from the perspective of experts in law \n     enforcement, it does not contribute to establishing a clear \n     explanation of what happened at Waco from a psychiatric and \n     behavioral science perspective. The commander on the ground\n      believes that the FBI's actions had no impact on David \n     Koresh. He and others who share his opinion will likely \n     disagree with the account that follows, which is the \n     product of my own current understanding of the events.\n\n                                Phase I\n\n       During the first phase of the FBI's engagement at Waco, a \n     period of a few days, the agents on the ground proceeded with \n     a strategy of conciliatory negotiation, which had the \n     approval and understanding of the entire chain of command. \n     They also took measures to ensure their own safety and to \n     secure the perimeter. In the view of the negotiating team, \n     considerable progress was made--for example, some adults and \n     children came out of the compound; but David Koresh and the \n     Branch Davidians made many promises to the negotiators they \n     did not keep. Pushed by the tactical leader, the commander on \n     the ground began to allow tactical pressures to be placed on \n     the compound in addition to negotiation; e.g., turning off \n     the electricity, so that those in the compound would be as \n     cold as the agents outside during the twenty-degree night.\n\n                                Phase II\n\n       As documented in the published reports and memoranda, this \n     tactical pressure began at the operational level over the \n     objections of the FBI's own experts in negotiation and \n     behavioral science, who specifically advised against it. \n     These experts warned the FBI command about the potentially \n     fatal consequences of such measures in dealing with an \n     ``unconventional'' group. Their advice is documented in \n     memoranda. Nonetheless tactical pressure was added. Without a \n     clear command decision, what evolved was a carrot-and-stick, \n     ``mixed-message'' strategy. This happened without outside \n     consultation and without taking into account that the FBI was \n     dealing with an ``unconventional'' group.\n       Although this carrot-and-stick approach is presented in the \n     factual investigation as though it were standard operating \n     procedure for law enforcement and accepted by the entire \n     chain of command, it was instead, apparently, the result of \n     poor coordination and management in the field. Negotiators \n     and tactical units were at times operating independently in \n     an uncoordinated and counterproductive fashion.\n\n                               Phase III\n\n       During the third phase of the stand-off, the FBI took a \n     more aggressive approach to negotiation and, when that \n     failed, gave up on the process of negotiation, except as a \n     means of maintaining communication with the compound. By \n     March 21, the FBI was concentrating on tactical pressure \n     alone: first, by using all-out psycho-physiological warfare \n     intended to stress and intimidate the Branch Davidians; and \n     second, by ``tightening the noose'' with a circle of armored \n     vehicles. The FBI considered these efforts a success because \n     no shots were fired at them by the Branch Davidians.\n       This changing strategy at the compound from (1) \n     conciliatory negotiating to (2) negotiation and tactical \n     pressure and then to (3) tactical pressure alone, evolved \n     over the objections of the FBI's own experts and without \n     clear understanding up the chain of command. When the fourth \n     and ultimate strategy, the insertion of C.S. gas, was \n     presented to Attorney General Reno, the FBI had abandoned any \n     serious effort to reach a negotiated solution and was well \n     along in its strategy of all-out tactical pressure, thereby \n     leaving little choice as to how to end the Waco stand-off. It \n     is unclear from the reports whether the FBI ever explained to \n     the AG that the agency had rejected the advice of their own \n     experts in behavioral science and negotiation, or whether the \n     AG was told that FBI negotiators believed they could get more \n     people out of the compound by negotiation. By the time the AG \n     made her decision, the noose was closed and, as one agent \n     told me, the FBI believed they had ``three options--gas, gas, \n     and gas.''\n       This account of the FBI's approach at Waco may not be \n     correct in every detail. It is certainly oversimplified, but \n     it has been confirmed in its general outline by FBI \n     behavioral scientists and negotiators who were participants \n     at Waco. This account with their assistance brings into focus \n     for me the critical issues about law enforcement response to \n     persons and a group whose beliefs, motivations, and behavior \n     are unconventional.\n                              iv. analysis\n\n                A. The FBI's behavioral science capacity\n\n1. FBI Expertise in Dealing With Persons Whose Motivations and Thought \n                      Processes Are Unconventional\n\n       The evidence now available to me indicates that, contrary \n     to my previous understanding and that of the other panelists, \n     the FBI's Investigative Support Unit and trained negotiators \n     possessed the psychological/behavioral science expertise they \n     needed to deal with David Koresh and an unconventional group \n     like the Branch Davidians. The FBI has excellent in-house \n     behavioral science capacity and also consulted with reputable \n     experts outside the agency. Panelists may have been misled, \n     as I was, by FBI officials at the original briefings who \n     conveyed the impression that they considered David Koresh a \n     typical criminal mentality and dealt with him as such. They \n     also conveyed the impression that they believed his followers \n     were dupes and he had ``conned'' them. Based on reports and \n     interviews, the FBI's behavioral science experts who were \n     actually on the scene at Waco had an excellent understanding \n     of Koresh's psychology and appreciated the group's intense \n     religious convictions. [[Page S7592]] \n       My preliminary report of August 3 emphasized at some length \n     those aspects of David Koresh's clinical history and \n     psychopathology that contradicted the simplistic and \n     misleading impression given at the first briefings. Much more \n     information has been made available about his mental \n     condition, his behavioral abnormalities, his sexual \n     activities, and his responses under stress. All of this \n     evidence is incompatible with the notion that Koresh can be \n     understood and should have been dealt with as a conventional \n     criminal type with an antisocial personality disorder. \n     However, the evidence available does not lead directly to \n     some other clear and obvious psychiatric diagnosis used by \n     contemporary psychiatry. Nonetheless, based on the FBI's in-\n     house behavioral science memoranda and other\n      information from outside consultants, I believe the FBI \n     behavioral science experts had worked out a good \n     psychological understanding of Koresh's psychopathology. \n     They knew it would be a mistake to deal with him as though \n     he were a con-man pretending to religious beliefs so that \n     he could exploit his followers.\n       This is not to suggest that David Koresh did not dominate \n     and exploit other people. He was able to convince husbands \n     and wives among his followers that only he should have sex \n     with the women and propagate children. He convinced parents \n     on the same religious grounds to permit him to have sex with \n     their young teen-age daughters. He studied, memorized, and \n     was preoccupied with Biblical texts and made much better \n     educated people believe that he had an enlightened \n     understanding of scripture and that he was the Lamb of God. \n     His followers took David Koresch's teachings as their faith. \n     He exacted strict discipline from adults and children alike \n     while indulging himself.\n       Whatever else all this adds up to, it and other information \n     clearly demonstrate as a psychological matter that Koresh had \n     an absolute need for control and domination of his followers \n     that amounted to a mania. He also had the ability to control \n     them. The intensity and depth of his ability and need to \n     control is attested to by everyone in the FBI who dealt with \n     him, from negotiators and behavioral scientists to tactical \n     agents and the commander on the ground.\n       Unfortunately, those responsible for ultimate decision-\n     making at Waco did not listen to those who understood the \n     meaning and psychological significance of David Koresh's \n     ``mania.'' Instead they tried to show him who was the \n     ``boss.''\n       What went wrong at Waco was not that the FBI lacked \n     expertise in behavioral science or in the understanding of \n     unconventional religious groups. Rather the commander on the \n     ground and others committed to tactical-aggressive, \n     traditional law enforcement practices disregarded those \n     experts and tried to asset control and demonstrate to Koresh \n     that they were in charge. There is nothing\n      surprising or esoteric in this explanation, nor does it \n     arise only from the clear wisdom of hindsight. As detailed \n     below, the FBI's own experts recognized and predicted in \n     memoranda that there was the risk that the active \n     aggressive law enforcement mentality of the FBI--the so-\n     called ``action imperative'' would prevail in the face of \n     frustration and delay. They warned that, in these \n     circumstances, there might be tragic consequences from the \n     FBI's ``action imperative,'' and they were correct.\n\n                2. Evaluating the Risks of Mass Suicide\n\n       As I have previously stated, there is, to my mind, \n     unequivocal evidence in the report and briefings that the \n     Branch Davidians set the compound on fire themselves and \n     ended their lives on David Koresh's order. However, I am also \n     now convinced that the FBI's noose-tightening tactics may \n     well have precipitated Koresh's decision to commit himself \n     and his followers to this course of mass suicide.\n       The official reports have shied away from directly \n     confronting and examining the possible causal relationship \n     between the FBI's pressure tactics and David Koresh's order \n     to the Branch Davidians. I believe that this omission is \n     critical because, if that tactical strategy increased the \n     likelihood of the conflagration in which twenty-five innocent \n     children died, then that must be a matter of utmost concern \n     for the future management of such stand-offs.\n       Based on the available evidence and my own professional \n     expertise, I believe that the responsible FBI decision makers \n     did not adequately or correctly evaluate the risk of mass \n     suicide. The Dennis Evaluation's executive summary concludes \n     that ``the risk of suicide was taken into account during the \n     negotiations and in the development of the gas plan.'' It is \n     unclear what ``taken into account'' means. The questions that \n     now need to be explored are: how was the risk of suicide \n     taken into\n      account, and how did the FBI assess the impact of their show \n     of-force pressure tactics on that risk?\n\n                          Gambling with death\n\n       There is a criminology, behavioral science, and psychiatric \n     literature on the subject of murder followed by suicide, \n     which indicates that these behaviors and the mental states \n     that motivate them have very important and complicated links. \n     Family violence often takes the form of murder followed by \n     suicide. Multiple killers motivated by paranoid ideas often \n     provoke law enforcement at the scene to kill them and often \n     commit suicide. Even more important is what has been called \n     ``the gamble with death.'' Inner-city youths often provoke a \n     shoot-out, ``gambling'' with death (suicide) by provoking \n     police into killing them. The FBI's behavioral science unit, \n     aware of this literature, realized that Koresh and his \n     followers were in a desperate kill-or-be-killed mode. They \n     were also well aware of the significance and meaning of the \n     Branch Davidians' apocalyptic faith. They understood that \n     David Koresh interpreted law enforcement attacks as related \n     to the prophesied apocalyptic ending.\n       In moving to the show of force tactical strategy, the FBI's \n     critical assumption, was that David Koresh and the Branch \n     Davidians, like ordinary persons, would respond to pressure \n     in the form of a closing circle of armed vehicles and \n     conclude that survival was in their self-interest, and \n     surrender. This ill-fated assumption runs contrary to all of \n     the relevant behavioral science and psychiatric literature \n     and the understanding it offered of Koresh and the Branch \n     Davidians.\n       Furthermore, there was direct empirical evidence supporting \n     the assumption that the Branch Davidians, because of their \n     own unconventional beliefs, were in the ``gamble with death'' \n     mode. The direct evidence for this was their response to the \n     ATF's misguided assault. They engaged in a desperate\n      shootout with federal law enforcement, which resulted in \n     deaths and casualties on both sides. The AFT claims \n     gunfire came from forty different locations. If true, this \n     means that at least forty Branch Davidians were willing to \n     shoot at federal agents and kill or be killed as martyr-\n     suicide victims defending their ``faith.'' The idea that \n     people with those beliefs expecting the apocalypse would \n     submit to tactical pressure is a conclusion that flies in \n     the face of their past behavior in the ATF crisis. Past \n     behavior is generally considered the best predictor of \n     future behavior.\n\n              Willing to kill but not cold-blooded killers\n\n       The BATF investigation reports that the so-called ``dynamic \n     entry'' turned into what is described as being ``ambushed''. \n     As I tried to get a sense of the state of mind and behavior \n     of the people in the compound the idea that the Branch \n     Davidians' actions were considered an ``ambush'' troubled me. \n     If they were militants determined to ambush and kill as many \n     AFT agents as possible, it seemed to me that given their \n     firepower, the devastation would have been even worse. The \n     agents were in a very vulnerable position from the moment \n     they arrived. Yet, as ordered, they tried to gain entry into \n     the compound in the face of the hail of fire. Although there \n     is disagreement, a senior FBI tactical person and other \n     experts confirmed my impression of this matter. The ATF \n     agents brought to the compound in cattle cars could have been \n     cattle going to slaughter if the Branch Davidians had taken \n     full advantage of their tactical superiority. They apparently \n     did not maximize the kill of ATF agents. This comports with \n     all of the state-of-mind evidence and suggests that the \n     Branch Davidians were not determined, cold-blooded killers; \n     rather, they were desperate religious fanatics expecting an \n     apocalyptic ending, in which they were destined to die \n     defending their sacred ground and destined to achieve \n     salvation.\n       The tactical arm of federal law enforcement may \n     conventionally think of the other side as a band of criminals \n     or as a military force or, generically, as the aggressor. But \n     the Branch Davidians were an unconventional group in an \n     exalted, disturbed, and desperate state of mind. They were \n     devoted to David Koresh as the Lamb of God. They were willing \n     to die defending themselves in an apocalyptic ending and, in \n     the alternative, to kill themselves and their children. \n     However, these were neither psychiatrically depressed, \n     suicidal people nor cold-blooded killers. They were ready to \n     risk death as a test of their faith. The psychology of such \n     behavior-together with its religious significance for the \n     Branch Davidians was mistakenly evaluated if, not simply \n     ignored, by those responsible for the FBI strategy of \n     ``tightening the noose.'' The overwhelming show of force was \n     not working in the way the tacticians supposed. It did not \n     provoke the Branch Davidians to surrender, but it may have \n     provoked David Koresh to order the mass-suicide. That, at \n     least, is my considered opinion.\n       The factual investigation reports in detail the many time \n     negotiators asked Koresh and others in the compound whether \n     they planned suicide. Also documented are Koresh's assurances \n     that they would not kill themselves. Such questions and \n     answers are certainly important from a psychiatric \n     perspective in evaluating a patient's suicidal tendency. But \n     the significance of such communication depends on the \n     context, the relationship established, and the state of mind \n     of the person being interviewed. The FBI had no basis for \n     relying on David Koresh's answers to these questions. \n     Furthermore, his responses provided no guidance to the more \n     pertinent question?--`What will you do if we tighten the \n     noose around the compound in a show of overwhelming power, \n     and using CS gas, force you to come out?'\n\n                       The psychology of control\n       The most salient feature of David Koresh's psychology was \n     his need for control. Every meaningful glimpse of his \n     personality and of day-to-day life in the compound \n     demonstrates his control and domination. The tactic of \n     tightening-the-noose around the compound was intended to \n     convey to David Koresh the realization that he was losing \n     control of his ``territory,'' and that the FBI \n     [[Page S7593]] was taking control. The FBI apparently assumed \n     that this tactic and the war of stress would establish that \n     they were in control but would not convey hostile intent. \n     They themselves truly believed these tactics were ``not an \n     assault,'' and because the Davidians failed to respond with \n     gunfire, the FBI considered their tactics effective and \n     appropriate. The commander on the ground now acknowledges \n     that they never really gained control of David Koresh. But, \n     in fact, my analysis is that they pushed him to the ultimate \n     act of control--destruction of himself and his group.\n       The FBI's tactics were ill considered in light of David \n     Koresh's psychology and the group psychology of the people in \n     the compound. The FBI was dealing with a religious group, \n     with shared and reinforced beliefs and a charismatic leader. \n     If one takes seriously the psychological syndrome of murder/\n     suicide gamble with death and the group's unconventional \n     belief system in the Seven Seals and the apocalypse, then you \n     may conclude, as I have, that the FBI's control tactics \n     convinced David Koresh that, in this situation, he was \n     becoming hopeless and helpless--that he was losing control. \n     In his desperate state of mind, he chose death rather than \n     submission. When the FBI thought they were at last taking \n     control, they had in fact totally lost control of the stand-\n     off.\n\n    3. The Waco Tactics in Light of the Group Psychology of the FBI\n\n       If this had been a military operation, the Waco conclusion \n     would have been a victory. The enemy was destroyed without a \n     single loss of life for the FBI. This situation, however, was \n     not a military operation. The question is; did a ``military''\n      mentality overtake the FBI? We were told that the FBI \n     considers a conflict which results in any casualties on \n     either side a failure. The law enforcement experts on the \n     panel agreed.\n       There is little doubt that the FBI inherited a terrible \n     situation. Federal agents had been killed and wounded, and \n     there were killed and wounded Branch Davidians in and around \n     the compound. The FBI knew that they were in a dangerous \n     situation, and that they confronted a group of religious \n     fanatics who were willing to kill or be killed. The FBI's \n     initial decision to mount a stand-off and negotiate was a \n     remarkable exhibition of restraint under the circumstances. \n     In retrospect, tactical units will wonder whether an \n     immediate full-scale dynamic entry by an overwhelming force \n     would have produced less loss of life.\n       The FBI stand-off, we were repeatedly told, was the longest \n     in law enforcement history. The costs in money and manpower \n     were mounting and, Waco had the media impact of the Iran \n     Hostage taking as the days mounted. The FBI was under \n     enormous pressure to do something. Given what I believe the \n     FBI's group psychology to have been, the desultory strategy \n     of simultaneous negotiation and tactical pressure was enacted \n     as a compromise between doing nothing (passivity) and \n     military assault (the action imperative). The appeal of any \n     tactical initiative to an entrenched, stressed FBI must have \n     been overwhelming. It may have better suited their group \n     psychology than the group psychology of the unconventional \n     people in the compound they wanted to affect. Given the \n     escalating pressure to act, the final tightening-the-noose'' \n     and C.S. gas strategy must have seemed to the tacticians a \n     reasonable compromise between doing nothing and overreacting.\n       This analysis of the FBI's group psychology is not intended \n     as a matter of placing blame. If it is accurate, it at least \n     points to what might be done differently in the future. The \n     FBI should not be pushed by their group psychology into\n      misguided ad hoc decision making the next time around.\n\n             B. Failure To Use Behavioral Science Capacity\n\n1. Failure of coordination between tactical and negotiating arms of the \n                                  FBI\n\n       Throughout the official factual investigation, there are \n     references to the failure of communication between the \n     tactical and negotiation arms of the FBI. The commander on \n     the ground thinks that the official investigation and \n     evaluation exaggerate the extent and significance of that \n     failure. I disagree. The situation can only be fully \n     appreciated by a thoroughgoing review of the documents. \n     Consider the Memo of 3/5/93 from Special Agents Peter Smerick \n     and Mark Young on the subject, ``Negotiation Strategy and \n     Considerations.'' The memorandum not only defines the basic \n     law enforcement priorities at Waco in the identical fashion \n     as the after-the-fact panel of law enforcement experts, also \n     anticipates most of the panel's own behavioral science \n     expertise and retrospective wisdom. Agents Smerick and Young \n     were not Monday morning quarterbacks as we panelists are; \n     they were members of the F.B.I. team on the field of play. \n     The basic premise of their overall strategy was:\n       1. Insure safety of children [emphasis in original], who \n     are truly victims in this situation.\n       2. Facilitate the peaceful surrender of David Koresh and \n     his followers.\n       The agents went on to emphasize that the strategy of \n     negotiations, coupled with ever-increasing tactical presence \n     was inapplicable. They wrote, ``In this situation, however, \n     it is believed this strategy, if carried to excess, could \n     eventually be counter-productive and could result in loss of \n     life.'' p. 2, Memo of 3/5/93. The agents also were fully \n     aware that Koresh's followers believed in his teachings and \n     would ``die for his cause.'' They were fully aware, \n     therefore, of the religious significance of the Branch \n     Davidians' conduct and attitudes and were sensitive to all of \n     the concerns emphasized by the religious experts on the panel \n     in their\n      reports. They suggested that the F.B.I. should consider \n     ``offering to pull back, only if they release more \n     children'' (emphasis in original). The agents further \n     recommended that, ``since these people fear law \n     enforcement, offer them the opportunity of surrendering to \n     a neutral party of their choosing accompanied by \n     appropriate law enforcement personnel.''\n       These agents recognized that although some in the F.B.I. \n     might believe the Davidians were ``bizarre and cult-like,'' \n     the followers of Koresh ``will fight back to the death, to \n     defend their property [described elsewhere by the agents as \n     sacred ground, the equivalent of a cathedral to Catholics, \n     etc.] and their faith'' (emphasis added). Memo of Smerick and \n     Young 3/7/93.\n       My reading of these memos indicates that these agents had \n     placed the safety of the children first, exactly as did AG \n     Reno. They recognized that it was not a traditional hostage \n     situation, as the British law enforcement expert on the \n     panel, C.E. Birt, repeatedly emphasized during our briefings \n     of July 1 and 2, when he found it necessary to correct the \n     misrepresentation of the briefer. They warned against the \n     carrot-and-stick approach, which was employed and has been \n     criticized by several of the panelists in their reports. \n     Professor Cancro speaks of it as a ``double bind,'' a term \n     used by behavioral scientists to describe a mixed message for \n     which their is no correct response and which, as a result, \n     creates anxiety and agitation in the recipient of the \n     message.\n       The factual investigation does not explain how or why these \n     expert opinions of behavioral scientists and negotiations \n     within the FBI were overridden. The Justice Department \n     emphasized that these same agents whose views I have \n     described gave quite contradictory views the very next day. \n     When I asked whether the Justice Department's fact-finders \n     had questioned these agents as to why they had changed their \n     views, no adequate answer was given. I therefore pursued that \n     inquiry with the agent who authored the two reports. He made \n     it quite clear that\n      the contradictory suggestions were offered only in response \n     to an expression of dissatisfaction with the previous \n     recommendations. Although the commander on the ground and \n     the official investigation disagree with my view, I have \n     concluded that decision-making at Waco failed to give due \n     regard to the FBI experts who had the proper understanding \n     of how to deal with an unconventional group like the \n     Branch Davidians.\n\n   2. Was tactical strategy appropriate with so many children in the \n                               compound?\n\n       The pressure strategy as we now know it consisted of \n     shutting off the compound's electricity, putting search \n     lights on the compound all night, playing constant loud noise \n     (including Tibetan prayer chants, the screaming sounds of \n     rabbits being slaughtered, etc.), tightening the perimeter \n     into a smaller and smaller circle in an overwhelming show of \n     advancing armored force, and using CS gas. The constant \n     stress overload is intended to lead to sleep-deprivation and \n     psychological disorientation. In predisposed individuals the \n     combination of physiological disruption and psychological \n     stress can also lead to mood disturbances, transient \n     hallucinations and paranoid ideation. If the constant noise \n     exceeds 105 decibels, it can produce nerve deafness in \n     children as well as in adults. Presumably, the tactical \n     intent was to cause disruption and emotional chaos within the \n     compound. The FBI hoped to break Koresh's hold over his \n     followers. However, it may have solidified this \n     unconventional group's unity in their common misery, a \n     phenomenon familiar to victimology and group psychology.\n       When asked, the Justice Department was unaware whether the \n     FBI had even questioned whether these intentional stresses \n     would be particularly harmful to the many infants and \n     children in the compound. Apparently, no one asked whether \n     such deleterious measures were appropriate, either as a \n     matter of law enforcement ethics or as a matter of morality, \n     when innocent children were\n      involved. This is not to suggest that the FBI decisionmakers \n     were cold-blooded tacticians who took no account of the \n     children; in fact, there are repeated examples showing the \n     concern of the agents, including the commander on the \n     ground. Nevertheless, my opinion is that regardless of \n     their apparent concern the FBI agents did not adequately \n     consider the effects of these tactical actions on the \n     children.\n\n                      3. The plan to insert CS gas\n\n       During U.S. military training, trainees are required to \n     wear a gas mask when entering a tent containing CS gas. They \n     then remove the mask and, after a few seconds in that \n     atmosphere, are allowed to leave. I can testify from personal \n     experience to the power of C.S. gas to quickly inflame eyes, \n     nose, and throat; to produce choking, chest pain, gagging, \n     and nausea in healthy adult males. It is difficult to believe \n     that the U.S. Government would deliberately plan to expose \n     twenty-five children, most of them infants and toddlers, to \n     C.S. gas for forty-eight hours. Although it is not discussed \n     in the published reports, I have been told that the FBI \n     believed that the Branch Davidians had gas masks and that \n     this was one of the reasons for the plan of prolonged \n     exposure. I [[Page S7594]] have also been told that there was \n     some protection available to the children, i.e., covering \n     places where the seal is incomplete with cold wet towels can \n     adapt gas masks for children and perhaps for toddlers though \n     not for infants. The official reports are silent about these \n     issues and do not reveal what the FBI told the AG about this \n     matter, and whether she knew there might be unprotected \n     children and infants in the compound.\n       The written information about the effects of C.S. gas which \n     was presented to the AG has been shared with the panelists. \n     We do not know whether she had time to read it. Based on my \n     own medical knowledge and review of the scientific \n     literature, the information supplied to the AG seems to \n     minimize the potential\n      harmful consequences for infants and children.\n       Scientific literature on C.S. gas is, however, surprisingly \n     limited. In the sixties, the British Home Office, \n     commissioned the Himsworth Report, after complaints about the \n     use of C.S. gas by British troops in Londonderry, Ireland. \n     The report is said by its critics to understate the medical \n     consequences. The published animal research on which the \n     report is based acknowledged that at very high exposure, \n     which the authors deemed unlikely, lethal effects were \n     produced. The researchers assumed (as did the Himsworth \n     report) that C.S. gas would be used primarily in open spaces, \n     to disperse crowds, and not in closed areas.\n       The AG's information emphasized the British experience and \n     understated the potential health consequences in closed \n     spaces. The AG also had a consultation with a physician; but \n     the exact content of that discussion has not been reported, \n     and the available summary is uninformative. The FBI commander \n     on the ground assures me that the agency has detailed, \n     ongoing expertise on C.S. gas and its medical consequences. \n     If so, no such FBI information was supplied in the written \n     material to the AG or subsequently to this panelist.\n       Based on my review, the American scientific literature on \n     the toxic effects of C.S. gas on adults and children is also \n     limited. Of course, there has, been no deliberate \n     experimentation on infants. The Journal of the American \n     Medical Association published two articles in recent years in \n     which physicians expressed concern about the use of C.S. gas \n     on civilians, including children in South Korea and Israel. \n     Anecdotal reports of the serious consequences of tear gas, \n     however, approved as early as 1956. Case reports indicate \n     that prolonged exposure to tear gas in closed quarters causes \n     chemical pneumonia and lethal pulmonary edema. (Gonzalez, \n     T.A., et al, Legal Medicine Pathology and Toxicology East \n     Norwalk, Conn: Appleton Century Crofts, 1957). According to a \n     1978 report, a disturbed adult died after only a half-hour \n     exposure to C.S. gas in closed quarters. Chapman,\n      A.J. and White C. ``Case Report: Death Resulting from \n     Lacrimatory Agents,'' J. Forensic Sci., 23 (1978): 527-30) \n     The clinical pathology found at autopsy in these cases is \n     exactly what common medical understanding and ordinary \n     pulmonary physiology predicts would follow prolonged \n     exposure in closed quarters.\n       The potential effects of C.S. gas are easily explained. \n     C.S. gas causes among other things, irritation and \n     inflammation of mucus membrane. The lung is a sack full of \n     membranes. The inhalation of C.S. gas would eventually cause \n     inflammation, and fluid would move across the membranes and \n     collect in the alveoli, the tiny air sacks in the lungs that \n     are necessary for breathing. The result is like pneumonia and \n     can be lethal. Animal studies are available to confirm that \n     C.S. gas has this effect on lung tissue. Ballantyne, B. and \n     Callaway, S., ``Inhalation toxicology and pathology of \n     animals exposed to omicron-chlorobenzylidene malonitrile \n     (CS),'' Med. Sci. Law, 12 (1972): 43-65. The Special \n     Communication published in J.A.M.A. 220 (1993): 616-20 by \n     Physicians for Human Rights reported that its teams, \n     investigating the use of C.S. gas in South Korea and Panama, \n     found ``skin burns, eye injuries and exacerbations of \n     underlying heart and lung disease . . . on civilians at sites \n     far removed from crowd gatherings.'' Dermatologists have \n     reported blistering rashes on skin exposed to self-defense \n     sprays, which use the same C.S. gas. Parneix-Spake, A. et al, \n     ``Severe Cutaneous Reactions to Self-Defense Sprays, Arch. \n     Dermatol 129 (1993): 913.\n       The medical literature does contain a clinical case history \n     of a situation that closely approximates the expected Waco \n     conditions. Park, S. and Giammona, S.T.m, ``Toxic Effects of \n     Tear Gas on an Infant Following Prolonged Exposure,'' Amer. \n     J. Dis. Child 123,3 (1972). A normal four month-old infant \n     male was in a house into which police officers, in order to \n     subdue a disturbed adult, fired canisters of C.S. gas. The \n     unprotected child's exposure lasted two to three hours. \n     Thereafter, he was immediately taken to an emergency room. \n     His symptoms during the first\n      twenty-four hours were upper respiratory; but, within forty-\n     eight hours his face showed evidence of first degree \n     burns, and he was in severe respiratory distress typical \n     of chemical pneumonia. The infant had cyanosis, required \n     urgent positive pressure pulmonary care, and was \n     hospitalized for twenty-eight days. Other signs of \n     toxicity appeared, including an enlarged liver. The \n     infant's delayed onset of serious, life-threatening \n     symptoms parallels the experience of animal studies done \n     by Ballantyne and Calloway for the Hinsworth Report. The \n     infant's reactions reported in this case history were of a \n     vastly different dimension than the information given the \n     AG suggested.\n       Of course, most people without gas masks would be driven by \n     their instinct for survival from a C.S. gas-filled structure. \n     But infants cannot run or even walk out of such an \n     environment; and young children (many were toddlers) may be \n     frightened or disoriented by this traumatic experience. The \n     C.S. gas tactics, planned by the FBI, and approved by the AG, \n     would seem to give parents no choice. If they wanted to spare \n     their inadequately protected children the intense and \n     immediate suffering expectably caused by the C.S. gas, they \n     would have had to take them out of the compound. Ironically, \n     while the most compelling factor used to justify the Waco \n     plan was the safety of the children, the insertion of the \n     C.S. gas, in my opinion, actually threatened the safety of \n     the children.\n       The Justice Department has informed me that because of the \n     high winds at Waco, the C.S. gas was dispersed; they believe \n     it played no part in the death by suffocation, revealed at \n     autopsy, of most of the infants, toddlers, and children. The \n     commander on the ground, however, is of the opinion that the \n     C.S. gas did have some effect, because the wind did not begin \n     to blow strongly until two hours after he ordered the \n     operations to begin. As yet, there has been no report as to \n     whether the children whose bodies were found in the bunker \n     were equipped with gas masks. Whatever the actual effects may \n     have been, I find it hard to accept a deliberate\n      plan to insert C.S. gas for forty-eight hours in a building \n     with so many children. It certainly makes it more \n     difficult to believe that the health and safety of the \n     children was our primary concern.\n       The commander on the ground has informed me that careful \n     consideration was given to the safety of the children, and \n     that the initial plan was to direct the gas at an area of the \n     compound not occupied by them. We will never know whether \n     that plan would have worked: the Branch Davidians began to \n     shoot at the tank like vehicles inserting the gas canisters, \n     and C.S. gas was then directed at all parts of the compound, \n     as previously decided in a fall back plan recommended by \n     military advisers.\n\n\n                           v. recommendations\n\n    A. The Deputy Attorney General's formulation and recommendations\n\n       The DAG has, in his overview, outlined the critical \n     elements to be considered in dealing with a situation like \n     Waco in the future. This is an excellent formulation. Based \n     on what I have learned and what I have described above, I \n     strongly endorse his formulation and the recommendations \n     which follow. However, unlike the other panelists in my \n     group, I am impressed that the FBI has adequate in-house \n     expertise to deal with unconventional groups like the Branch \n     Davidians. Furthermore, it seems clear that at Waco, the FBI \n     was suffering from information overload, if from anything. \n     Thus, I believe that the crisis management capacity (see DAG \n     recommendations) and what I would describe as information \n     management have to be the particular focus for future change.\n\n                  B. Recommendations of this panelist\n\n                 1. Further investigation is necessary\n\n       On might think that the highest priority after a tragedy \n     like Waco would be for everyone involved to consider what \n     went wrong and what would they now do\n      differently. I must confess that it has been a frustrating \n     and disappointing experience to discover that the Justice \n     Department's investigation has produced so little in this \n     regard. The investigators have assured me that everyone \n     involved was asked these questions and that few useful \n     responses were given. An undercurrent of opinion holds \n     that everything depends and will depend in the future on \n     the commander on the ground. SAC Jamar, the commander on \n     the ground, knows that he is on the spot and that there \n     are those who point to his position as the weak link at \n     Waco. When I asked him what went wrong and what should be \n     done differently, he candidly acknowledged his difficult \n     position; but he emphasized how much was still unknown \n     about what happened, and that he still had not met with \n     the FBI Waco negotiators to discuss their view of what \n     happened. His basic conclusion in retrospect, however, was \n     that nothing the FBI had done at Waco made any real \n     impact. His opinion is that Koresh sent people out because \n     he didn't want them, and not because of the FBI's \n     conciliatory negotiation strategy. His opinion is that \n     Koresh ended it all in mass suicide not because of the FBI \n     tactical strategy, but because that was always his \n     intention. His deep and serious concern about his \n     responsibilities was impressive and he made it \n     convincingly clear how much more I and the other experts \n     needed to know about the acts. On this, he was preaching \n     to the converted. There is no doubt in my mind that much \n     more needs to be known about Waco. In my opinion, it is \n     now time for the FBI itself, with the help and \n     participation of outside experts, to take on that \n     responsibility. Indeed, that is my first recommendation. I \n     agree with the FBI's commander on the ground that we still \n     do not know enough about what happened at Waco. We need to \n     know more, not in the spirit of who is to blame, but in \n     the spirit of what went wrong that can be made right. What \n     can we learn from a careful study of David Koresh and the \n     Branch Davidians that will help us in learning about other \n     unconventional groups? [[Page S7595]] What can the FBI \n     learn about its own behavior at Waco that will help in the \n     future?\n       Just as I believe the FBI has more work to do, I believe \n     the Justice Department has work to do as well. No clear \n     pictures has emerged of how and on what basis the AG made her \n     decision. Given on my current information about C.S. gas, it \n     is difficult to understand why a person whose primary concern \n     was the safety of the children would agree to the FBI's plan. \n     It is critical that in the future, the AG have accurate \n     information, so that she can make an informed decision. If \n     the only information she was given about C.S. gas is what has \n     been shown to the panelists then, given my current \n     understanding, she was ill advised and made an ill-advised \n     decision. None of these matters have been clarified. \n     Certainly for its own effective functioning, the Justice \n     Department needs to sort this out for the future.\n       The sequence of decision making set out in the earlier \n     account indicates that the FBI had already moved very far \n     down the branch of the decision tree before consulting the \n     AG. This made it difficult for her to make any other choice. \n     Presumably, others in the Justice Department had been \n     involved every step of the way. Like the FBI, they need to \n     re-examine their own behavior, the channels of communication, \n     the processing of information, and what went wrong or needs \n     to be done differently in the future. I assume that the DAG's \n     recommendation of a ``senior career official'' within the \n     Justice Department, who maintains ``a familiarity with the \n     resources available to the FBI,'' is a forward looking \n     solution to some of these problems.\n\n  2. The FBI Needs To Make Better Use of Past Experience and Existing \n                      Behavioral Science Capacity\n\n       As we have been told, the commander on the ground was not \n     selected because of his past experience in standoffs or \n     because of his knowledge of unconventional groups. He was the \n     special agent in charge of the geographical area\n      in which the action took place. The DAG has recommended a \n     different command structure. Nonetheless, the FBI had a \n     situation room in Washington and a command structure in \n     place at Waco which could have brought the agency's past \n     experience to bear. At the first briefings, when asked to \n     describe their most successful resolution of a standoff \n     with an unconventional group, an FBI official reported the \n     successful use of a third party intermediary (negotiator). \n     When I subsequently inquired about the FBI's previous \n     experience with the successful use of CS gas, the example \n     given was a prison riot.\n       These examples speak for themselves and suggest to me that \n     in making decisions at Waco, the FBI did not make the best \n     use of its own past experience. The commander on the ground \n     believes his decision to allow lawyers and the local sheriff \n     to meet with Koresh is an example of using a third-party \n     intermediary. However, in their own highly successful \n     resolution of a stand-off with an armed unconventional group, \n     the FBI used a fellow member of the religious faith as the \n     intermediary. This option was apparently rejected at Waco for \n     reasons that I find unconvincing.\n       The DAG has recommended that a computer database of past \n     stand-offs be developed. The critical importance of this is \n     to insure that the FBI makes better use of its own \n     experience. It will be important for the FBI to distinguish \n     between unconventional groups and prison populations in \n     deciding which tactical measures are strategically and \n     ethically appropriate.\n\n      3. The FBI Needs a Clear Policy on Third Party Negotiators/\n                             Intermediaries\n\n       The FBI has well-trained negotiators whose skills are \n     impressive. Nonetheless, there came a time at Waco when the \n     FBI's frustration led them to introduce a new negotiating \n     approach. They changed from a conciliatory, trust-building \n     negotiator to a more demanding and intimidating negotiator. \n     The change\n      had no effect and may have been counterproductive. The \n     negotiators also tried, at times, to talk religion with \n     Koresh but concluded that this was not productive.\n       Some FBI negotiators are convinced that they could have \n     gotten more people out of the compound if the FBI had stayed \n     the course of conciliatory negotiation. Whether or not that \n     is true, the FBI reached a point where tactical strategy \n     became the priority and negotiation under those circumstances \n     became ineffective.\n       It is my recommendation that this point of change be \n     defined as a red light, a time when the decision makers in \n     future standoffs should consider the use of a third party \n     negotiator/intermediary. The red light should go on when the \n     commander on the ground or the chain of command begins to \n     feel that FBI negotiation is at a stand still.\n       The FBI negotiation and behavioral science experts should, \n     at the least, develop a policy in consultation with experts \n     on when they might consider the use of third party \n     negotiators/intermediaries. The current working policy seems \n     to be that third party negotiators are counterproductive. The \n     experience justifying that policy needs to be reviewed in \n     light of Waco. It was a significant omission at Waco not to \n     involve as a third-party negotiator/intermediary a person of \n     religious stature familiar with the unconventional belief \n     system of the Branch Davidians.\n\n  4. The FBI and the Justice Department Need a Systematic Policy for \n             Dealing With Information Overload in a Crisis\n\n       A critical element of crisis management based on my \n     analysis of what happened at Waco is information management. \n     Information overload allows decision-makers to discount all \n     of the expert advice they are given and revert to their own \n     gut instincts. Alternatively--as I believe we learn from \n     Waco--the decision-makers can insist on being given advice \n     compatible with their gut instinct. In my opinion, the gut \n     instinct that prevailed at Waco was the law enforcement mind-\n     set, the action-control imperative.\n       If, as the DAG recommends, the FBI develops a network of \n     academic experts in behavioral science, religion, sociology, \n     and psychiatry, the FBI can certainly expect an information \n     overload in the next crisis. The problem will be how to \n     manage the expert information overload. This is a complex \n     problem that requires careful consideration by appropriate \n     experts. However, one pattern that emerged from my \n     understanding of Waco needs to be changed. The official \n     investigation lists all kinds of experts who allegedly were \n     consulted or who took it upon themselves to offer unsolicited \n     advice. It is almost impossible to determine what all this \n     adds up to. One of my fellow panelists believes--and I am \n     convinced--that the FBI never actually consulted with a \n     religious expert familiar with the unconventional beliefs of \n     Branch Davidians. The investigators at the Justice Department \n     disagree with this conclusion. My concern about this is not a \n     matter of fault-finding: it is critical to my concern about \n     information management in a crisis. The question is: what \n     counts as a consultation with the FBI? One has the impression \n     from the Waco experience that a variety of agents were \n     talking to a variety of experts, and that some of these \n     contacts were listed as consultations. We are not told how \n     those contacts or consultations were sorted through. Who in \n     the process would decide what was relevant and important and \n     what irrelevant and unimportant.\n       In any event, the prevailing pattern in the information \n     flow during the crisis was for each separate expert to offer \n     the FBI an opinion. As a preliminary matter, it seems to me \n     important for the FBI to establish who the relevant experts \n     are and then arrange through conference calls or more high-\n     tech arrangements for sustained dialogue among them, to \n     understand and clarify the dimensions of their disagreements \n     and, when possible, to achieve consensus. Information should \n     be exchanged and differences directly confronted in the \n     circle of consultants; they should not vanish in the \n     information overload.\n5. The FBI Needs a Better Knowledge Base About the Medical Consequences \n                               of CS Gas\n\n       As discussed above, is my opinion that the AG was not \n     properly informed of the risks to infants and small children \n     posed by CS gas. This is not to imply that the FBI \n     intentionally misled her. Indeed, the FBI may not have had \n     the proper medical information. The use of CS gas is, in any \n     event, a controversial matter, and although it is \n     understandable that the Justice Department investigation did \n     not explore medical considerations, a careful evaluation is \n     clearly indicated. The FBI, the Justice Department, and all \n     of law enforcement that uses CS gas ought to have as clear an \n     understanding of its medical consequences as possible. The \n     hasty survey of the medical and scientific literature done \n     for this report is hardly definitive. These matters should be \n     sorted out so that the AG clearly understands what the use of \n     CS gas entails.\n\n  6. The FBI Needs a Specific Policy for Dealing With Unconventional \n                                 Groups\n\n       The basic conclusion of my account and analysis is that the \n     standard law enforcement mentality asserted itself at Waco in \n     the tactical show of force. The FBI should be aware of its \n     own group psychology and of the tendency to carry out the \n     action imperative. Doubtless, that imperative is appropriate \n     in dealing with conventional criminals; it may be necessary \n     even in dealing with unconventional groups. However, the \n     lesson of Waco is that once the FBI recognizes that it is \n     dealing with an unconventional group, those who urge \n     punishing tactical measures should have to meet a heavy \n     burden of persuasion. When children are involved, the burden \n     should be even heavier and ethical considerations, which need \n     to be formulated, would come into play.\n\n\n                             vi. final word\n\n       The events at Waco culminated in a tragic loss of life--on \n     that everyone involved in law enforcement and in the official \n     inquiry agree. There is a view within the FBI and in the \n     official reports that suggests the tragedy was unavoidable. \n     This report is a dissenting opinion from that view. There is \n     obviously no definitive answer; but my account and analysis \n     tries to emphasize what might have been done differently at \n     Waco, and what I believe should be done differently in the \n     FBI's future dealings with unconventional groups. I endorse \n     the DAG's recommendations for change and offer additional \n     suggestions. Although such a determination falls outside my \n     province, it is my considered opinion that the failings of \n     the FBI at Waco involve no intentional misconduct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 1199. Is \nthere further debate?\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7585-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S7596]]\n\n                     NOMINATION OF J. GARVAN MURTHA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nusual courtesy. My remarks will be very brief.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to speak was to thank the distinguished \nchairman and thank the Republican leader, Senator Dole, and thank our \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Biden, and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, for their willingness to move \nthrough a number of judicial nominations last night, one of which was \nfor the State of Vermont.\n  Vermont, as the distinguished chairman knows, is currently, because \nof retirements and promotions and other reasons, the only State in the \nunion that does not have a Federal district judge, other than in senior \nstatus. The distinguished chairman of our committee worked with me, \nSenator Jeffords, and others, to help us move through very quickly the \nnomination of Gar Murtha to be the new Federal district judge. I \napplaud the Senator from Utah for that, and I thank him for his help.\n  Mr. President, I will make a couple of personal comments. I have \nknown Gar Murtha from the years when both he and I were young lawyers, \nyoung prosecutors in the State of Vermont. I knew him as a prosecutor \nof great ability and total integrity. My family and the Murtha family \nhave been close and dear friends from that time. I have watched he and \nhis wife, Meg, raise their three wonderful children, Elizabeth, John \nand Will. They are model members of their community. They are respected \nby everyone--Republican, Democrat, Independent, liberal, conservative \nand moderate--within their community as people of great family values \nand true traditional Vermont values. He is also known as a lawyer of \nthe highest excellence.\n  When the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Gar Murtha as a Federal judge \nlast night, I think it made a very, very wise choice indeed.\n  I told President Clinton, when I asked him to nominate Gar Murtha, \nthat he could do so knowing that this is a decision that would be one \nhe could always be proud of. He would know that it is a decision he \ncould make without any concern or qualm, just as I had no concern or \nqualm in recommending Gar Murtha to the President of the United States.\n  So my feeling as a Vermonter, first and foremost, is that I am glad \nto see we are now going to have a Federal district judge. But, also, as \none who has known Gar Murtha for 25 years, I know that our State is \nfortunate to have him, and the Federal bench is fortunate to have him. \nHe follows in a great tradition of tremendous Federal judges we have \nhad in Vermont--Judge Oakes, Judge Coffrin, Judge Parker, Judge \nBillings, Judge Gibson, Judge Leddy and Judge Holden. These are people \nthat I have known, and I have practiced law before many of them. Gar \nMurtha will now be part of a very stellar constellation indeed.\n  When I recommended Mr. Murtha to the President back in December, I \ndescribed him as a respected lawyer from the southern part of Vermont \nwho has a wide range of legal experience. He has distinguished himself \nby his contributions to the community and by his participation in \nefforts to improve our justice system. I told the President that he \ncould feel very secure in making this nomination and that in the years \nto come it will reflect well on him, the Senate, and Vermont.\n  I have great confidence that Gar Murtha will be a fair, thoughtful, \nand judicious addition to the Federal bench in Vermont.\n  Mr. Murtha is an outstanding lawyer and exceptional person who will \nmake a fine Federal judge and serve all of the people of Vermont and \nthe Nation and the interests of justice by applying the law fairly and \nhonestly.\n  I first met Gar when I was serving as State's attorney for Chittenden \nCounty and he as deputy State's attorney for Windham County. I was in \nthe northwestern part of the State and he in the southeastern. He \ndeveloped and has maintained a reputation of absolute, rock-ribbed \nintegrity.\n  I know of his involvement in the community, in the State, and in the \nbar in a number of positions, including his service as a public \ndefender here in the District of Columbia, his service on the Second \nCircuit Task Force on Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Fairness and on the \nSecond Circuit's Committee on Federal Rules.\n  The father of three, Mr. Murtha has demonstrated in his family life, \nin his civic life, and in his professional life, the sense of community \nthat Vermonters value so highly. He has served on a number of boards \nand commissions in southern Vermont. He is active in youth, community, \nand civic organizations.\n  Gar is a person of great fairness and integrity and an outstanding \nlawyer with wide-ranging experience. I have every confidence that he \nwill make an outstanding Federal judge, who will be just, practical, \nand hardworking on behalf of all. I have heard from lawyers and people \nfrom all over the State who have expressed their support for this \nnomination and their appreciation that their Federal judge will be one \nwho will ensure a fair trial for all, whether plaintiff or defendant, \nwhether poor or rich.\n  Since Judge Billings assumed senior status and Judge Parker was \nconfirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit last \nyear, Vermont has been without a full-time U.S. district judge. Vermont \ndeserves to have its Federal judges considered, confirmed, and in place \nready to rule on important matters.\n  In light of these circumstances, I want to extend special thanks to \nthe majority leader, the Judiciary Committee chairman, the Democratic \nleader and our ranking member and all our colleagues for proceeding \npromptly on this nomination and confirming Mr. Murtha to the Federal \ncourt bench.\n  It was my honor and privilege to recommend J. Garvan Murtha to the \nPresident of the United States and to present him to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for consideration of his nomination to be the next \nU.S. district judge for Vermont. It is now my pleasure to thank our \nSenate colleagues for the consent that they provide to this nomination \nand to announce to the people of Vermont that the nomination of their \nnew Federal judge has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7596-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7596-S7598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is a very important bill. It is \napparent that we are trying to get a list of the amendments that people \nhave so that we can hopefully get a unanimous-consent agreement on \namendments and, when we get that, finish this bill in a very \nexpeditious, good way.\n  Last evening, the President of the United States sent a letter to the \ndistinguished Republican leader with regard to this bill. It is a very \ninteresting letter. President Clinton, in this letter, has expressed \nhis interest in ``working with the Congress toward the enactment of \nthis critical legislation as soon as possible''.\n  I share the President's commitment to do exactly that.\n  His letter outlines a number of provisions which he feels should be \nin the bill. Indeed, most of the proposals he cites are already \naddressed by the substitute, S. 735. To the extent that S. 735 does not \naddress some of these issues, I believe we are already aware of \namendments covering these issues which some of our colleagues plan to \noffer.\n  Accordingly, in order to assure that we can meet the President's \nrequest to enact this critical legislation as soon as possible, I \nbelieve we should try to reach a unanimous-consent agreement on \namendments.\n  The Democrats have already made us aware of at least 17 amendments. I \nbelieve all of what the President has requested in his letter which is \nnot addressed in S. 735 would be addressed by one or more of these \namendments. There are only a handful of Republican amendments thus far. \nThree of them are substantive and a few others are more technical in \nnature.\n  Before we take up amendments, I will say that I hope our Democratic \ncolleagues will do all they can to help us to reach a unanimous-consent \nagreement on the total list so that we can wrap up this bill for today. \nI am dismayed that we need to wait to resolve these matters. \nNevertheless, we are going to do what is right in this area. \n[[Page S7597]] \n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nPresident be printed in the Record at this point, so that all of our \ncolleagues can see the effort the President has put forth in this \nletter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I write to renew my call for a tough, \n     effective, and comprehensive antiterrorism bill, and I urge \n     the Congress to pass it as quickly as possible. The Executive \n     and Legislative Branches share the responsibility of ensuring \n     that adequate legal tools and resources are available to \n     protect our Nation and its people against threats to their \n     safety and well-being. The tragic bombing of the Murrah \n     Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19th, the latest \n     in a disturbing trend of terrorist attacks, makes clear the \n     need to enhance the Federal Government's ability to \n     investigate, prosecute, and punish terrorist activity.\n       To that end, I have transmitted to the Congress two \n     comprehensive legislative proposals: The ``Omnibus \n     Counterterrorism Act of 1995'' and the ``Antiterrorism \n     Amendments Act of 1995.'' In addition, the Senate has under \n     consideration your bill, S. 735, the ``Comprehensive \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995.'' I understand that a \n     substitute to S. 735, incorporating many of the features of \n     the two Administration proposals, will be offered in the near \n     future. I also understand that the substitute contains some \n     provisions that raise significant concerns. We must make \n     every effort to ensure that this measure responds forcefully \n     to the challenge of domestic and international terrorism. I \n     look forward to working with the Senate on the substitute and \n     to supporting its enactment, provided that the final product \n     addresses major concerns of the Administration in an \n     effective, fair, and constitutional manner. The bill should \n     include the following provisions:\n       Provide clear Federal criminal jurisdiction for any \n     international terrorist attack that might occur in the United \n     States, as well as provide Federal criminal jurisdiction over \n     terrorists who use the United States as the place from which \n     to plan terrorist attacks overseas.\n       Provide a workable mechanism to deport alien terrorists \n     expeditiously, without risking the disclosure of national \n     security information or techniques and with adequate \n     assurance of fairness.\n       Provide an assured source of funding for the \n     Administration's digital telephony initiative.\n       Provide a means of preventing fundraising in the United \n     States that supports international terrorist activity \n     overseas.\n       Provide access to financial and credit reports in \n     antiterrorism cases, in the same manner as banking records \n     can be obtained under the current law through appropriate \n     legal procedures.\n       Make available the national security letter process, which \n     is currently used for obtaining certain categories of \n     information in terrorism investigations, to obtain records \n     critical to such investigations from hotels, motels, common \n     carriers, and storage and vehicle rental facilities.\n       Approve the implementing legislation for the Plastic \n     Explosives Convention, which requires a chemical in plastic \n     explosives for identification purposes, and require the \n     inclusion of taggants--microscopic particles--in standard \n     explosive device raw materials which will permit tracing of \n     the materials post-explosion.\n       Expand the authority of law enforcement to fight terrorism \n     through electronic surveillance, by expanding the list of \n     felonies that could be used as the basis for a surveillance \n     order; applying the same legal standard in national security \n     cases that is currently used in routine criminal cases for \n     obtaining permission to track telephone traffic with ``pen \n     registers'' and ``trap and trace'' devices; and authorizing \n     multiple-point wiretaps where it is impractical to specify \n     the number of the phone to be tapped (such as when a suspect \n     uses a series of cellular phones).\n       Criminalize the unauthorized use of chemical weapons in \n     solid and liquid form (as they are currently criminalized for \n     use in gaseous form), and permit the military to provide \n     technical assistance when chemical or biological weapons are \n     concerned, similar to previously authorized efforts involving \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Make it illegal to possess explosives knowing that they are \n     stolen; increase the penalty for anyone who transfers a \n     firearm or explosive materials, knowing that they will be \n     used to commit a crime of violence; and provide enhanced \n     penalties for terrorist attacks against all current and \n     former Federal employees, and their families, when the crime \n     is committed because of the official duties of the federal \n     employee.\n       In addition, the substitute bill contains a section on \n     habeas corpus reform. This Administration is committed to any \n     reform that would assure dramatically swifter and more \n     efficient resolution of criminal cases while at the same time \n     preserving the historic right to meaningful Federal review. \n     While I do not believe that habeas corpus should be addressed \n     in the context of the counterterrorism bill, I look forward \n     to working with the Senate in the near future on a bill that \n     would accomplish this important objective.\n       I want to reiterate this Administration's commitment to \n     fashioning a strong and effective response to terrorist \n     activity that preserves our civil liberties. In combating \n     terrorism, we must not sacrifice the guarantees of the Bill \n     of Rights, and we will not do so. I look forward to working \n     with the Congress toward the enactment of this critical \n     legislation as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just take a few minutes on the \nsubject of habeas corpus reform, so that everybody will understand what \nthe Specter-Hatch habeas corpus reform bill, which is part of this \nbill, will do to significantly reduce the delays in carrying out \nexecutions without unduly limiting the right of access to Federal \ncourts.\n  The bill would reduce the filing of repetitive habeas corpus \npetitions which delay the carrying out of death sentences to such \nextremes as to reduce the deterrent value of the death penalty.\n  Under this bill, death sentences, if upheld, will be carried out, in \nmost cases, within 2 years of final State court action. That will be in \ncontrast to the 10 to 18 years that it is currently taking to get \nfinality in these cases--usually because frivolous appeal after \nfrivolous appeal is filed, all at a cost of millions and millions of \ndollars to the taxpayers of our society. Most prosecutors tell me that \nthey spend a high percentage of their time just answering habeas corpus \npetitions and that it is a tremendous cost to the taxpayers, and almost \nall of them are frivolous. Now, this bill protects those that are not \nfrivolous. It will protect their rights, and it will do right by the \npeople filing.\n  Under this bill, death sentences, if upheld, will be carried out, in \nmost cases, within 2 years of final State court action--at the most, 3 \nyears. The bill would, first, establish a 6-month statute of \nlimitations for filing a Federal habeas corpus petition in capital \ncases if the State makes counsel available in its State court habeas \ncorpus. They have 1-year statute of limitations for noncapital cases.\n  Second, this bill will establish time limits on Federal court \nconsideration on habeas corpus petitions in capital cases if the State \nprovides counsel during State habeas corpus.\n  The Federal district court would have an additional 180 days to \ndecide a capital habeas corpus petition. That would be 120-some days \nfor a briefing and hearing, 60 days for the court to render a decision.\n  Now, the district court will be able to extend the limit for 30 \nadditional days for good cause stated in writing. The court of appeals, \nthen, must decide any appeal in a capital habeas corpus case within 120 \ndays of final briefings.\n  Third, we allow a Federal court to overturn a State court decision \nonly if it is contrary to clearly established Federal law or if it \ninvolves an ``unreasonable application'' of clearly established Federal \nlaw to the facts, or if the State court's factual determination is \nunreasonable.\n  Fourth, we restrict the filing of repetitive petitions by requiring \nthat any second petition be approved for filing in the district court \nby the court of appeals. A repetitive petition would only be permitted \nin two circumstances: One, if it raises the claim based on a new rule \nof constitutional law that is retroactively applicable; or, two, if it \nis based on newly discovered evidence that could not have been \ndiscovered through due diligence in time to present the claim in the \nfirst petition and that, if proven, would show by a clear and \nconvincing evidence that the defendant was innocent.\n  Fifth, we encourage States to provide qualified counsel to indigent \ndefendants in capital cases during State court habeas corpus. The \nConstitution, of course, already requires that States appoint qualified \ncounsel for trial and direct appeal. In this case, we encourage the \nStates to provide qualified counsel in these capital cases during State \ncourt habeas corpus appeals.\n  Sixth, we provide for the Federal Government to provide counsel to \nindigent petitioners and Federal habeas corpus petitions in both \ncapital and noncapital cases, if a Federal judge so orders. And I \nreally do not know of any case, any capital case, where the Federal \njudge will not so order. [[Page S7598]] \n  This outlines, and it is a summary of the Specter-Hatch habeas reform \nbill. I hope our colleagues will realize that this is the time to \nfinally face this issue that has involved just countless frivolous \nappeals throughout the history of jurisprudence in this country.\n  It is time to have some finality in these matters. We protect the \nconstitutional rights and privileges of the individual defendants, but \nwe say, ``The game is over.'' There will not be any more of these \ningenious appeals that are frivolous in nature that literally will not \nmeet those two requisites that I mention.\n  We also say to the American taxpayers, we will not keep funding \nfrivolous appeals by people on death row. We are not going to have \nanother 10, 12, or 18 years, as is the Andrews case in Utah, the case \ncalled ``hi-fi,'' where Andrews participated with another person in \nkilling a variety of people, but only after they tortured them. They \nran pencils through their eardrums, and in one case, poured Drano down \nthe throat of one of the victims. For 18 years, there was no question \nthat Andrews did the murder. No question he was guilty. No question of \nthe heinous nature of the crime. There was no question that the jury \nwas right in rendering the verdict it did. But those appeals went on \nfor 18 years, and in each of these aspects of the appeal the victims \nand their families had to go through the whole unpleasant, vicious, \nterrible experience again.\n  Every one of the appeals was frivolous. For 18 years and 28 appeals. \nAll the way up through the State courts, from the lower trial court, to \nthe immediate appellate court, to the State supreme court. In this \ncase, mainly the trial court and the State supreme court. All the way \nup through the Federal court, district court, circuit court of appeals, \nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United \nStates of America. It made a mockery of the law.\n  I cannot blame anybody who hates the death penalty for trying to do \neverything in his or her power as a defense lawyer to try to deter \nsomebody from going to the final date of execution, but the law is the \nlaw, and whether a person hates the death penalty or thinks it is the \nright thing, the fact is, it is the law.\n  I do not have any fault with any defense lawyer who has done his or \nher best to try and free these people or at least alleviate the death \npenalty. I do not have any problem with their efforts in that regard. I \nhave a problem with the law that allows that type of frivolous \nrepetitive appeals. This is the time to change that law.\n  By the way, this is the only thing we can do in this antiterrorism \nbill, it seems to me, that will do something about the Oklahoma City \nbombing. The only thing we can do, it seems to me, to bring swift \njustice, as the President has called for, to the perpetrators of the \nOklahoma City bombing.\n  Frankly, it is something that we have to bite the bullet on, and get \nit done. We are willing to face the music on this and to fight this \nbattle out on the floor. I would like it to be one of the later aspects \nof this matter. The fact is, it is time to face it.\n  When I talked to families of the victims, and the victims themselves \njust a few days ago, they begged me to make sure that we pass this bill \nand that we pass the habeas corpus reform that we have on the bill. \nMany of the State attorneys general, both Democrats and Republicans \nState attorneys general, want Congress to pass this habeas corpus \nreform bill.\n  I think most everybody wants Congress to pass the whole bill. The \npeople out there are sick and tired of the problems.\n  Frankly, I assured those who have been suffering so much from the \nOklahoma City bombing, and those who suffer all over this country, from \nthe repetitive appeals that are frivolous in nature, and the need to \ncontinually go to all of those hearings, I have assured them we will \nface the habeas corpus problem on this matter, and that we will pass \nthe Specter-Hatch habeas corpus bill.\n  We hope we can do that in this battle, and I will do everything in my \npower to see that it is done. It is no secret that there are some on \nthe floor who do not like our changes in habeas corpus. It is going to \nbe a controversial issue. I do believe that a majority of the Members \nof this body will vote for it.\n  There are many other things that I would like to discuss about the \nbill. It is a very complex bill. It is a very detailed bill. It is a \nbill that covers almost every aspect of antiterrorism. It is one that \nis long overdue. And we are going to handle this.\n  Let me digress for a minute, because my dear colleague from \nPennsylvania is concerned about having hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge. \nI have been in constant contact with the Justice Department, with the \nFBI, and with ATF, and they are willing to do this. They are willing to \ndo this. Whether they are willing or not, they know we are going to do \nthis, sooner or later.\n  They would prefer, as the FBI Director has requested in writing to \nme, that we defer the hearings until they have completed their \ninvestigation in Oklahoma City. They have also indicated that sometime \nthis summer they feel that it will be all right, in any event.\n  So we do intend to press forward. We are putting our investigators on \nthis issue. They have been on it. We will see what we can do.\n  I share my colleagues' deep concern over these incidents. I believe a \nthorough congressional review of these and related Federal law \nenforcement issues is warranted. I intend that these hearings will be \nheld in the near future following Senate consideration of this \ncomprehensive antiterrorist legislation, upon the completion of the \ndepartment's investigation of the Oklahoma tragedy.\n  Notwithstanding my desire to have hearings on this matter, I have \nresisted doing so right at this time, and I believe doing so at this \ntime would only serve to confuse these important issues. I do not \nbelieve that the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents should be linked to the \nOklahoma City incident or to the terrorist issues or hearings at this \ntime.\n  The Senate could, if we held hearings at this time, inappropriately--\nalbeit unintentionally--convey the wrong message regarding the \nculpability of those responsible for the atrocity in Oklahoma City. We \nsimply must not do this. Indeed, the Senate went on record to this \neffect on May 11, 1995, by a vote of 74 to 23, when it tabled a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution which would have set a date certain for these \nhearings. But I assure my colleague from Pennsylvania, we probably will \nhold these hearings before the end of this summer and before our August \nrecess. We will do the best we can. If it does take more time than \nthat, we will certainly state the reasons. But that is our firm \nintention and we hope we can get that done.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, in over 20 years in the Senate I do not \nthink I have done this twice, but I will say, to be safe, I do not \nthink I have done it a half dozen times. I would like to read into the \nRecord a letter that I received yesterday from a woman who is \ngraduating from high school in my State, a woman I have never met. Her \nname is Mrs. Judi Robinson. She lives in old New Castle, DE, which is a \ncommunity over 350 years old, a beautiful place, in a place called Penn \nAcres. I would like to read it, if I may.\n\n       Dear Senator Biden, I am a 48-year-old night student at \n     William Penn High School in New Castle. I'm one of many \n     students who recently wrote to you concerning adult \n     education. Thank you for your letter. It helped me a little \n     more to understand what it concerns.\n       I have been in the program since September 1994 and \n     received my G.E.D. that June. Now I'm at Penn doing very well \n     and will [[Page S7599]] graduate this June. It took me 31 \n     years to get to this point in my life, so I thank God that \n     there was a program available to me. Although my \n     circumstances are different than some of my classmates, we're \n     all there for the same reasons, to get our G.E.D. or better \n     yet our diploma. Senator as far as I'm concerned, I wanted \n     this very badly, but I have been married 27 years, have two \n     children one of which also graduates this year from Penn. I \n     never had to work so my education wasn't the top on my list. \n     Because my husband worked and took care of us and the house. \n     But most of the kids in the program need this educational \n     program to continue to grow into productive adults. Our \n     counselors and teachers are the best, they work very hard to \n     keep things going well at school. These programs need to keep \n     going and I know that you will do your best to keep it going.\n       Now to get to the second reason I'm writing to you. I would \n     like to take this opportunity to invite you to my graduation \n     on June 14 at 7:30 p.m. It will take place at Newark High \n     School. Myself and I know all the other students and staff \n     would be honored to have you there. I know you are a very, \n     very busy man but if you could find it in your heart and \n     schedule to make it, I would be happy to have you there.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Mrs. Judi Robinson.\n\n  Mr. President, the reason I read that into the Record is I do not \nthink we should lose sight of the fact that there are thousands and \nthousands and thousands of women and men like Judi Robinson who are \ngoing back to try to get the basic education that for whatever reasons \nthey did not get when they were children. I think our reluctance to put \nas much emphasis on the educational needs in this country and the \nFederal responsibility to participate in that is a serious mistake. I \nam sure all of my colleagues, and I know the Senator in the chair, the \nSenator from Colorado, like everyone else in here, shares a sense of \npride when there is someone in their State like Judi Robinson who goes \nthrough that effort.\n  I remember discussing with my friend from Colorado how his mother \nwent back and her significant educational accomplishments and what she \nhas done. I just thought it worthwhile to let people know that there \nare a lot of people like Judi Robinson still fighting hard, who still \nhave faith in this operation, still have faith in the system, and still \nthink they can better themselves through education.\n  I thank the Chair for this time and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7598-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment the Labor and Human \nResources Committee for reporting out the nomination of Dr. Henry \nFoster to be Surgeon General of the United States.\n  Earlier this morning, the committee met and by a 9-to-7 vote \nrecommended the confirmation of Dr. Foster for Surgeon General. Two \nRepublicans joined with seven Democrats in favoring his nomination and \nthereby bringing the nomination to the floor.\n  It is my hope that we will take up Dr. Foster in this Chamber. It is \nmy sense that there are sufficient votes to bring Dr. Foster to a vote \nin the face of what has been announced to be a prospective filibuster. \nThere is at least one Senator on the committee as reported who favors \nbringing Dr. Foster to a vote even though that Senator voted against \nhim in committee.\n  I had occasion to meet with Dr. Foster early on, and at that time I \nwas convinced that the sole issue was the issue of whether Dr. Foster \nshould be disqualified from being Surgeon General because he had \nperformed abortions, a medical procedure which is legal and authorized \nby the U.S. Constitution. It seemed to me at that time that all the \nother matters which were brought up were red herrings, and that real \nopposition to Dr. Foster lay in the fact that he had performed \nabortions, a procedure authorized by the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  I said on the Senate floor early on that Dr. Foster was entitled to \nbe heard by the committee, entitled to have his day in court, so to \nspeak, in this Chamber for a vote, both out of fairness to Dr. Foster \nas an individual and really as a sign that nobody would be railroaded \nout of this town without having a day in court, a chance to have an up-\nor-down vote in the Senate.\n  There is a very important precedent beyond Dr. Foster as an \nindividual as to what he is entitled to as a matter of fairness and \nthat is to others who may be interested in coming to Washington, \ntempted to come to Washington to perform public service. And many would \nbe discouraged if Dr. Henry Foster would not be entitled to fair \ntreatment by the Senate of the United States.\n  I thought that reasons given by our colleague, Senator Frist, in \nsupporting Dr. Foster's nomination were very important; that Senator \nFrist, a physician himself, emphasized Dr. Foster's commitment to try \nto combat teenage pregnancy, and that may be the No. 1 social problem \nin America today. If that can be brought under control, then there is \nno better person to try to do that than the Surgeon General of the \nUnited States. And also Dr. Foster's commitment to press for abstinence \nand to press for family values; those are positions which I think are \nvery appropriate for the Surgeon General.\n  So Dr. Foster has cleared a very significant hurdle in the \naffirmative vote of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. Some \npredicted he would never get that far.\n  From what I sense, the climate in our body is to favor his nomination \ncoming to the floor for a vote. I think a filibuster will be defeated \nand I think ultimately Dr. Foster will be confirmed. That is a very \npositive sign of respect for the laws of the United States, as \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court, that a woman does have a right to \nchoose, that a nominee like Dr. Foster is not disqualified because he \nperformed a medical procedure, albeit abortion, authorized by the \nConstitution, and that men and women of character and good will can \ncome to this town and get a fair hearing and perform an important \npublic service.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7599-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7599-S7607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill before the \nSenate at this time, S. 735, the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act \nof 1995.\n  Mr. President, let me say first how pleased I am that the leadership \nof both parties has reached agreement on so much in this bill and met \nPresident Clinton's challenge to reach a prompt and bipartisan \nconsensus on counterterrorism legislation in the aftermath of the \ntragedy in Oklahoma City.\n  Most of the key provisions of the President's counterterrorism bill, \noffered earlier in the year by Senator Biden and others, are included \nin the measure before us. And I thank the majority leadership of the \ncommittee for doing so. But, as Senator Biden mentioned last night, \nthere are a few provisions that have not been included.\n  That is why this morning I will offer two amendments which would \nrestore two provisions from the original bill to this genuinely \nbipartisan effort, and I am hopeful that there is an opportunity here \nfor bipartisan support for these two law enforcement measures, as well.\n  Mr. President, in my view, and in the view of those I have spoken to \nin the Federal and State law enforcement communities who are involved \nin the daily, difficult business of pursuing terrorists, these two \nprovisions, which would increase law enforcement's capacity to be \ninvolved in surveillance through wiretapping of terrorists, would be \nextremely helpful to the law enforcement community's efforts to \npenetrate the highly secretive world of [[Page S7600]] terrorists. \nIndeed, I can imagine a number of situations where the power granted by \nthese two amendments would provide exactly the kinds of tools that \ncould make a difference in stopping terrorists before they strike.\n  Mr. President, since joining the Senate, I have spent a fair amount \nof time and effort considering how we, as a nation, can best prepare \nourselves to counter and stop terrorists' threats because of my fear \nthat, though America domestically has been relatively spared, at least \nwas when I began these inquiries, from the pain of terrorist attack, \ncertainly more so than other nations in the world, that because of \npolitical events in the world, it was inevitable that unless we \ndirected, created some defense there, we would suffer. And, \nunfortunately, we have.\n  As I look back, the first hearing I ever chaired as a Senator \nconcerned the coordination of our antiterrorism efforts. And in every \npresentation on hearings that I have been involved in since, whether as \na member of the Governmental Affairs Committee or involved in the ad \nhoc task force on terrorism, which I was privileged to organize, \nwitness after witness, whether they were from the State Department or \nthe FBI or the U.S. attorney's offices, or think tanks around this city \nor country, emphasized the special importance of surveillance and \ninfiltration to preventing and prosecuting terrorist attacks.\n  Mr. President, this says the obvious, but it needs to be said: \nTerrorists are cowards. Terrorists are cowards because they strike at \nundefended targets. And while we are quite logically now, in the \naftermath of Oklahoma City, attempting to rebuild our defenses around \nmore likely targets, particularly public buildings affected, the \nterrorist group that wants to create panic in our society, wants to \npunish our society, wants to strike at the sense of order and security \nin our society can, as we have seen in other settings, just as easily \nnot strike at a governmental building, but go down the street and \nattack a large private building, an office building, or strike, as some \nhave suggested, at the water supply in a community; so that we can \nnever defend against all the potential targets of terrorists.\n  The best defense is an offense. And the offense in this case, as this \nbill carries out in many ways, is to be watching people who indicate by \ntheir own behavior that they are capable of violent acts. I am not \ntalking about inhibiting political freedoms here. We are not talking \nabout prohibiting anybody from writing or speaking or demonstrating in \na way that they believe, even if we find it abhorrent. But if they act \nin a way that indicates they may be capable of violent acts, criminal \nacts, then we, the people, should have our law enforcement agents there \nwatching them, listening to them, infiltrating their groups to see to \nit that whenever possible we can stop them; we can strike before they \nstrike at the heart of our society to prevent more death and \ndestruction.\n  The witnesses that spoke to committees that I have been on were \ncommenting mostly on internationally inspired terrorism, but they \nfocused again on the importance of electronic surveillance as a \ncomponent of the overall approach of stopping terrorist acts whenever \npossible before they are committed, and electronic surveillance is part \nof that.\n  I would argue that electronic surveillance may be more important with \ndomestically based terrorists than with international terrorism. So far \nas we know, they are not generally reliant on outside State sponsors \nwho, at some point, may be vulnerable to political or military \npressure.\n  Our weapons here are limited to effective law enforcement, including \none of the most powerful tools law enforcement has, which is carefully \ncircumscribed, legally authorized electronic surveillance, particularly \nin this high-technology communication age.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1200 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n     (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to emergency wiretap \n                               authority)\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. So, Mr. President, the first amendment I am offering \ntoday would add the words ``domestic or international terrorism'' to \nthe limited number of situations in which the Attorney General, the \nDeputy Attorney General, or the Assistant Attorney General can obtain \nan emergency 48-hour wiretap without having to go court in that first \nperiod of time. Under current law, those three Justice Department \nofficials and no others may authorize emergency electronic surveillance \nwhere there is ``first, immediate danger of death or serious physical \ninjury to any person; second, conspiratorial activities threatening the \nnational security; and third, conspiratorial activities characteristic \nof organized crime.''\n  This all is when there is not, in the opinion of the law enforcement \nofficials, time to get a court order. But the important condition in \nthis law is that within 48 hours of that emergency authorization for \nelectronic surveillance from within the Justice Department, law \nenforcement officers must obtain a court order for the wiretap under \nthe normal proceedings for court orders.\n  They must submit the same affidavits and documents establishing \nprobable cause that are required for any other wiretap.\n  The top three Justice Department officials who can make these \nemergency authorizations have a strong incentive to be cautious and \ncorrect in authorizing emergency wiretaps without a court order, \nbecause if a judge does not issue a court order supporting a wiretap \nwithin 48 hours, any information obtained via the emergency wiretap is \ninadmissible in court.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, therefore, would simply add the words \n``activities characteristic of domestic or international terrorism'' to \nthe list of emergency situations where law enforcement has hours, and \nnot days, to get the evidence needed to make an arrest, find a chemical \nweapon, diffuse a bomb or perhaps rapidly clear a building that may be \nthe target of a terrorist attack.\n  Given the devastating effects of these terrorist acts, which are \nassaults not only on individuals but on whole communities--in fact on \nour Nation and on the democratic processes and the liberties that we \nhave--do we not want to give our law enforcement officials the same \nauthority to obtain temporary emergency wiretaps they have under \ncurrent law when pursuing organized crime cases? I think so, and I \nbelieve the American people would think so as well.\n  Mr. President, I, therefore, have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1200 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . REVISION TO EXISTING AUTHORITY FOR EMERGENCY \n                   WIRETAPS.\n\n       (a) Section 2518(7)(a)(iii) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting ``or domestic terrorism or \n     international terrorism (as those terms are defined in 18 \n     U.S.C. 2331), for offenses described in section 2516 of this \n     title.'' after ``organized crime''.\n       (b) Section 2331 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting the following words after subsection \n     (4)--\n       ``(5) the term `domestic terrorism' means any activities \n     that involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life \n     that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United \n     States or of any State and which appear to be intended to \n     intimidate or coerce a civilian population or to influence \n     the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to \n     affect the conduct of a government by assassination or \n     kidnapping.''.\n       (c) Section 2518(7) of title 18 is amended by adding after \n     ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,'' \n     ``but subject to section 2516,''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to finally, before yielding the \nfloor, indicate for the Record that the amendment does not change the \nunderlying crimes for which an emergency wiretap can be authorized in \ntitle 18, United States Code, section 2516. It just says that if those \ncrimes are part of a domestic terrorist plot, an emergency wiretap can \nbe ordered. And these crimes include: Any offense punishable by death \nor imprisonment for more than 1 year, including violations of the \nAtomic Energy Act relating to sabotage of nuclear facilities and fuel \nor espionage and treason.\n\n[[Page S7601]]\n\n  Also, let me point out that the definition of ``terrorism'' covers \nviolent acts or acts dangerous to human life.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for the purpose of explaining a bill which I would \nlike to introduce at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 868 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand what my dear colleague from \nConnecticut is trying to do with this expansion of the emergency \nwiretap authority, but I apologize to him because I have to rise to \noppose this amendment which would expand emergency wiretap authority \npermitting the Government to begin a wiretap prior to obtaining court \napproval in a greater range of cases than the law presently allows.\n  I find this proposal troubling, and let me list some reasons. I am \nconcerned that this provision, if enacted, would unnecessarily broaden \nemergency wiretap authority. Under current law, such authority exists \nwhen life is in danger, when the national security is threatened, or \nwhen an organized crime conspiracy is involved. That is title 18, \nUnited States Code, section 2518(7).\n  This authority is constrained by a requirement that the surveillance \nbe approved by a court within 48 hours. The President's proposal \ncontained in this amendment would expand these powers to any \nconspiratorial activity characteristic of domestic or international \nterrorism. I personally do not believe that this expansion is necessary \nto effectively battle the threat of terrorism.\n  Virtually every act of terrorism one can imagine which would require \nan emergency wiretap--that is, the threat is so immediate that the \nGovernment cannot obtain a court order before instituting the wiretap--\nwill certainly also involve ``an immediate danger of death or serious \nphysical injury,'' or ``a conspiratorial activity threatening the \nnational interest,'' as defined in current law. Thus, expanding the \nGovernment's emergency wiretap powers to any conspiratorial activity \ncharacteristic of domestic or international terrorism would add little \nto existing authority. However, the little that it does add or will add \nis particularly troubling.\n  This amendment defines domestic terrorism in an unwise and extremely \nbroad manner. The amendment defines domestic terrorism, in part, as \n``any activities that involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human \nlife and which appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian \npopulation or to influence the policy of Government by intimidation or \ncoercion.''\n  That is a potentially vague and very loose standard. There are \nlegitimate acts of protest that could be caught up in this definition, \nbecause they, in some way, pose a danger or are viewed as \n``intimidating.''\n  No one, of course, would contend that activities that truly threaten \nthe public safety or an individual should go uninvestigated or \nunpunished. However, the standard for initiating a wiretap without a \ncourt order should certainly be higher than this amendment proposes.\n  Mr. President, a wiretap order is deliberately somewhat difficult to \nobtain. It is more difficult because it is more difficult to get the \nJustice Department to approve it than it is to get a judge or \nmagistrate to approve it. Because wiretaps are so intrusive and \nconducted in secret by the Government in circumstances under which the \nsubject has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the courts and \nCongress have required that the Government meet a heightened burden of \nnecessity before using a wiretap to ensure that civil liberties are \nsecure.\n  The law also, of course, recognizes exigent circumstances, because in \na true emergency, when lives are at risk, we would not want law \nenforcement to wait for court-approved wiretaps any more than we expect \na police officer to obtain a search warrant before chasing an armed and \nfleeing suspect into a house. Our present wiretap statute recognizes \nthis with its emergency provision and expanding the exception should \ngive us pause. We must ensure that in our response to recent terrorist \nacts, we do not destroy the freedom that we cherish. I fear that the \namendment does take us a step down that road, and for these reasons, I \noppose the amendment.\n  Let me mention one other thing. The distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is very sincere and well-intentioned with this amendment. I \nacknowledge that. And he is an acknowledged authority on law \nenforcement. But I have to question whether this amendment would permit \nthe Government to obtain emergency wiretaps; in other words, a wiretap \nwithout a court order--let me repeat that; a wiretap obtained without a \ncourt order--of, let us say, some of these groups in our society today, \nranging from the right to the left. Take a gay rights group like Act \nUp, or an environmental group like some of the more vociferous \nenvironmental groups; or you could take some groups on the right that \nare vociferous that stage a sit-in that may violate some State property \nor some loitering felony. It seems to me that a demonstration blocking \na busy street or entrance to a church or hospital could endanger human \nlife under certain circumstances, and certainly a demonstration of this \nnature would be intended to change the Government's policy. This \namendment could thus permit the Government to listen to the \nconversations of such groups without obtaining a court order.\n  This is deeply troubling to me, and I think to anybody who believes \nin the Bill of Rights and in the important protections the Constitution \naffords us. It is easy to come up with circumstances that would justify \na wiretap, but then you meet the emergency requirements already in law. \nSo I would rather stick with the current law.\n  So I urge my fellow Senators to vote against this. That is with a \nfull understanding of what the distinguished Senator from Connecticut \nis trying to do, and with some sympathy toward what he is trying to do, \nexcept I do not think we should expand the wiretap laws any further.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I rise to support Senator Lieberman's amendment on \nemergency wiretap authority. Quite frankly, Mr. President, this \namendment would add to this bill the President's proposal in the \nPresident's original bill to extend authority for emergency wiretaps--\nwhich are already available, I might add, for organized crime cases--to \nterrorism crimes. And I am sure people looking at this debate are \nprobably thinking: Wait a minute. Senator Orrin Hatch is arguing \nagainst this on civil liberties grounds, and Biden being for this--I \nwas going to facetiously say something, but I will not say it. This is \nno time for humor.\n  At any rate, the reason I am for this bill--and I have a pretty long \nrecord and history here of being as vigilant in the civil liberties of \nAmericans and constitutional rights as anyone in this body--is that I \ndo not see a lot of distinction between crimes of terrorism and \norganized crime. It is kind of basic to me. If the justification exists \nfor organized crime, why would it not exist for crimes of terrorism?\n  Now, let me explain first what probably my friend from Connecticut \nhas already explained--I apologize if I am going over old ground; I \nwill be brief--what an emergency wiretap is and how limited an \nemergency wiretap is.\n  In almost all cases, the Government has to get a court order to \ninitiate a wiretap, under stringent standards set out in current law. \nThe emergency wiretap authority allows the Government to initiate a \nwiretap without a court order in emergency situations involving, one, \nimmediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person; \nconspiratorial activities threatening national security; or \nconspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime activities. \nOnly the top three Justice Department officials--the Attorney General, \nDeputy [[Page S7602]] Attorney General, and Associate Attorney \nGeneral--can organize an emergency wiretap.\n  Now, if it stopped there, I could see why a lot of people would say, \neven with that, that is still too dangerous, and there is still too \nmuch exposure for Americans of their civil liberties. But even in those \nemergency situations, the law requires the Government to seek judicial \napproval of the wiretap within 48 hours.\n  So it is not like there can be an emergency wiretap placed on the \nauthority of the top three Justice Department officials, the top three, \nand left on and then the information used. Within 48 hours, they have \nto get a court order or cease and desist. That is the second \nrequirement.\n  First, it has to fit the criteria of immediate danger, death, and so \non, which I read. Second, within 48 hours, there has to be a court \norder. Third, if when they go for the court order, the judge disagrees \nor declines, the wiretap has to end, and any evidence that has been \ngotten in that 48 hours cannot be used. It is sort of an exclusionary \nrule, if you will. It cannot be used.\n  So Senator Lieberman's amendment, consistent with what the President \nasked for, would add to the list of emergency situations the following: \nConspiratorial activities characteristic of domestic or international \nterrorism. It seems to me no less broad than conspiratorial activities \ncharacteristic of organized crime activities.\n  Now, the consistent position for my friends to take here, if they are \ngoing to take on the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, would \nbe to amend the existing law to strike conspiratorial activities \ncharacteristic of organized crime. I doubt whether they would want to \ndo that. So I am kind of at a loss that if they think that is a good \nidea, why not conspiratorial activities characteristic of domestic or \ninternational terrorism? Is someone going to tell me that they are more \nat jeopardy or less at jeopardy from the Gambino family than we are \nfrom some bunch of screwballs running around in the woods who are \nplanning on blowing up a building? When is the last time the Mafia blew \nup a building? They are not good guys; they are all bad guys. But I do \nnot quite understand the logic here. I do not understand the logic.\n  Of course, a wiretap is a powerful and intrusive investigative tool. \nWe have to be careful to guard against its abuses. There are several \nstatutory restrictions that prevent the abuse of emergency wiretaps, \nnone of which would be changed by this amendment.\n  Now, there is much more that I am inclined to say, but I will not. I \nwill conclude by saying, if a wiretap is authorized and the Government \nthen goes to court within 48 hours, if the order is not granted, the \ninterception is treated as a violation of title III and is inadmissible \nin trial. This provision, in my view, works no great expansion on the \nwiretap statute. The Government is still required to get a judicial \norder. But it is simply allowed to get an order after the fact when \nthere is an emergency situation. The amendment simply extends the \nemergency wiretap authority to terrorism offenses and, surely, \nterrorism is as great a threat as organized crime. This is a narrow and \nsensible amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Let me emphasize that the amendment does not expand the list of \noffenses which can be investigated using a wiretap. By the way, most \nAmericans--and I know my friend was a distinguished prosecutor and \nattorney general of his State. He knows full well --but even most \npracticing lawyers do not know--that you cannot, under the Federal law, \nget a wiretap for all felonies. You cannot get them for every crime. \nMost people think that if the FBI has reason to believe any felony is \nbeing committed, they can go get a wiretap.\n That is not true. They cannot even ask for a wiretap for certain \ncrimes.\n\n  This does not expand the list of things for which they can have an \nemergency wiretap. Nor does it expand the list that a judge, when it is \n48 hours later and we say, ``Judge, make this real,'' the judge cannot \nsay, ``Well, it is not covered as subject matter for wiretap under the \nlaw now, but I will let you do it because the change of the law allows \nit.'' It does not do that.\n  It does not expand offenses which can be investigated using a \nwiretap. All it does is allow an emergency wiretap for those domestic \nand international terrorist offenses which involve violent acts and \nacts dangerous to human life. The wiretap must then be approved by the \ncourt. Quite frankly, I do not see how it could be construed to cover a \nsimple political demonstration, as my friend from Utah fears.\n  What I fear is that we are not making a false distinction between \nacts of terrorism and organized crime. I do not hear anybody suggesting \nthat if the Gambino family gets together for a picnic, we are worried \nabout whether or not an emergency wiretap may impact on their right to \nhave a picnic. I do not hear them saying that.\n  If a bunch of wackos get together talking about the Federal \nGovernment, and the Government has reason to believe they are preparing \nfor or engaging in acts of violence, why not them, too?\n  To put it in crass terms, if we can mess up the Gambino picnic, we \nshould be able to mess up the screwball picnic, if there is evidence--\nif there is evidence--that there is a likelihood of a violent act or \nviolent crime to be committed.\n  I do not know who we are protecting, but it does not seem to make any \nsense to me. No safeguards that exist now are being reduced. We are \nadding an additional category, the category seems reasonable to me.\n  I compliment the Senator on his amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the pending amendment, and I do \nso with a deference to my colleague from Connecticut because of his \nexperience as Attorney General.\n  I believe that we ought to be very circumspect and very careful \nbefore expanding wiretapping authority at all until there has been an \nopportunity for very careful study. That opportunity is not present \nhere.\n  As I have listened to the very abbreviated arguments in the course of \nless than 30 minutes, there may be no expansion beyond the current law. \nNobody has cited an illustration as to what would be subject to wiretap \nunder Senator Lieberman's amendment that would not be subject to \nwiretap under existing law. It may well be that there are sufficient \nvagaries in the language of the amendment which could render it \noverbroad.\n  This bill has not been subjected to the usual legislative process of \na markup, which is where the committee sits down and goes over the bill \nand considers amendments in a more deliberative fashion than an \namendment being presented and debated on the floor over the course of \n30 minutes, or a few minutes more.\n  In saying this, I do not fault, at all, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, because these are the rules of procedure in the \nSenate. I do say that it ought to give Members some pause.\n  As we speak, we are on a Friday near noon and many Senators are \nwaiting to catch planes. The distinguished clerk is nodding in the \naffirmative. I do not think we ought to legislate in this kind of a \nrush. Expanding wiretap authority may have a very, very serious impact \non civil liberties. No compelling need has been shown for adopting this \namendment and, therefore, I think the amendment ought not to be \nenacted. Under these procedures and time constraints, I am sure of \nthat. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, let me assure my friend and colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania that I am in no rush.\n  I have been following this question of how we can best counter \nterrorism for a long time, and I have been working with people in the \nFBI, the U.S. attorney offices, and the Justice Department. They tell \nme that that is an expanded authority that will help them combat \nterrorism.\n  I have spent a fair amount of time thinking about this amendment. I \nhave concluded that it gives one more weapon to the folks that are \nfighting on our side against the terrorists.\n  Mr. President, I must say I am a little bit surprised by some of the \nobjections which suggest that this authority, limited as it is, as the \nSenator from Delaware made clear, 48-hour emergency wiretap, three \nofficials at the Justice Department, can authorize on a showing of \nnecessity the same [[Page S7603]] grounds that a court would use if a \ncourt does not similarly authorize the wiretap within 48 hours, it is \nover, and the evidence seized in between is inadmissible.\n  Let me go to the concern about whether this authority might be used \nagainst domestic political groups compromising their civil liberties. \nThere is nowhere in the language of the proposal, let alone the \nunderlying law which it amends, to suggest that that is possible. It is \ncertainly not my intention.\n  The term ``domestic terrorism'' which as Senator Biden has indicated \nis what this is about, we take the language here, conspiratorial \nactivities characteristic of organized crime, which an emergency \nwiretap can be grounded, and add conspiratorial activities \ncharacteristic of domestic terrorism.\n  How do we define ``domestic terrorism?'' It means any activities that \ninvolve violent acts, or acts dangerous to human life, that are \ncriminal--that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United \nStates or any State; and on top of that, which appear to be intended to \nintimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence the policy of \nthe Government by intimidation and coercion.\n  It takes more than the intention to intimidate or coerce the \nGovernment or the American people, one must be contemplating or \ninvolved in violent acts or criminal acts with that purpose.\n  Now, there is no mainstream or out of the mainstream political group \nthat just is expressing points of view that is by any stretch of the \nimagination going to be subject to an emergency wiretap under this \nprovision.\n  There is a general point, and I will make it as my final point. It \ndoes cover international terrorism as well. We are not talking just \ndomestic political groups, but people or agents of foreign governments, \nagents of foreign groups that may be on our soil, moving around, \nattempting or planning acts of violence against us.\n  The general point in terms of the concern of civil liberties. As is \ntrue in so many of these questions of law and order and maintaining \nthat basic order that is the precondition of our liberties, the \nquestion is, who do we give the benefit of the doubt? Are we going to \nside with the potential victims of a terrorist act? Are we going to \nstretch over so far backward in our concern about civil liberties that \nwe give the benefit of the doubt to the would-be terrorists? To me \nthere ought to be a simple answer to that equation.\n  It is, in another sense, do we trust those in positions of authority? \nI have had the privilege of working in law enforcement. The U.S. \nattorneys, the FBI, the Secret Service--they are not perfect. They are \njust people. But by and large these are people who are out there every \nday, as we have seen too often, putting their lives on the line for \nGovernment to maintain the order that does protect our liberty.\n  Give me a choice of giving them another narrowly circumscribed \nauthority to use to stop terrorism, I am going to give it to them with \nthe confidence that in almost every case I can think of, they will use \nit in an appropriate way. If for some reason they do not, within 48 \nhours a judge is going to come along and say ``That is it, take the \nwiretap off.'' And not only that, everything that has been gathered in \nthe 48 hours is inadmissible in court.\n  This power, incidentally, that has existed under this statute \nregarding national security and organized crime cases, has rarely been \nused because of the standard set up in the law and because of the \ndeterrent that if a judge does not confirm the original authorization \nby the Justice Department, evidence is inadmissible.\n  Mr. President, I think this is just one smart tool, another smart \ntool, to give the folks who are out there fighting terrorists on our \nside to make sure we stop the terrorists before they stop us. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware would like to speak?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter and \ntestimony regarding this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Gun Owners of America,\n\n                                    Springfield, VA, May 18, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The tragic bombing in Oklahoma City has, \n     unfortunately, provoked a ``feeding frenzy'' of efforts to \n     manipulate the unfortunate victims for the political \n     advantage of certain special interests and ideological points \n     of view. These efforts have been embodied in attempts to \n     blame pro-Second Amendment organizations, pro-life groups, or \n     Republicans in general for what appear to be the actions of \n     isolated madmen.\n       In this climate, it is particularly important that we not \n     over-react or react foolishly to the heart-rending events \n     which we, as a nation, have witnessed. On April 27, S. 735 \n     was introduced by the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, and was brought directly onto the \n     Senate calendar. While avoiding some of the most extreme \n     proposals which have been posited for political advantage in \n     the wake of the bombing, S. 735 nevertheless contains some \n     provisions which are far too dangerous to be considered \n     without hearings, markup, and the normal checks and balances \n     of the legislative process.\n       As introduced, Gun Owners of America would oppose S. 735, \n     and would rate any vote for that legislation as an anti-gun \n     vote. In particular, we object to provisions of S. 735 which \n     would:\n       Allow the BATF to go after gun dealers for far-reaching \n     ``conspiracy'' charges involving no overt act at all;\n       Significantly broaden the materials which the Secretary of \n     the Treasury could require from law-abiding businesses, \n     groups and individuals;\n       Preempt state law enforcement efforts in many circumstances \n     which are primarily of local concern,\n       Broaden the authority of the FBI to make demands of \n     citizens not suspected of crimes, and, in general, increase \n     the ability of government to intrude on the privacy and \n     rights of individuals.\n       It may well be the Congress, after due consideration, will \n     decide that some changes in federal law are necessary. But \n     this is not an area where legislation should be adopted prior \n     to full consideration of the ramifications of that \n     legislation. I therefore urge you to step back, hold \n     hearings, and take time to consider what, if any, changes in \n     federal law would genuinely address the issue of terrorism, \n     rather than merely serving as a political placebo. The \n     country and the Constitution will both be healthier as a \n     result of your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Pratt,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\nExcerpts From Written Testimony Before the U.S. Senate Committee on the \n    Judiciary, Submitted by David B. Kopel, Associate Policy Analyst\n\n\n                              wiretapping\n\n       Various proposals have been offered to expand dramatically \n     the scope of wiretapping. For example, the Clinton bill \n     defines almost all violent and property crime (down to petty \n     offenses below misdemeanors) as ``terrorism'' and also allow \n     wiretaps for ``terrorism'' investigations.\n       Other proposals would allow wiretaps for all federal \n     felonies, rather than for the special subet of felonies for \n     which wiretaps have been determined to be especially \n     necessary. Notably, wiretaps are already available for the \n     fundamental terrorist offenses: arson and homicide. \n     Authorizing wiretaps for evasion of federal vitamin \n     regulations, gun registration requirements, or wetlands \n     regulations is hardly a serious contribution to anti-\n     terrorism, but amounts to a bait-and-switch on the American \n     people.\n       Currently, FBI wiretapping, bugging, and secret break-ins \n     of the property of American groups is allowed after approval \n     from a seven-member federal court which meets in secret. Of \n     the 7,554 applications which the FBI has submitted in since \n     1978, 7,553 have been approved.\n       Making the request for vast new wiretap powers all the more \n     unconvincing is how poorly wiretap powers have been used in \n     the past. Terrorists are, of course, already subject to being \n     wiretapped. Yet as federal wiretaps set new record highs \n     every year, wiretaps are used almost exclusively for \n     gambling, racketeering, and drugs. The last known wiretap for \n     a bombing investigation was in 1998. Of the 976 federal \n     electronic eavesdropping applications in 1993, not a single \n     one was for arson, explosives, or firearms, let alone \n     terrorism. From 1983 to 1993, of the 8,800 applications for \n     eavesdropping, only 16 were for arson, explosives, or \n     firearms. In short, requests for vast new wiretapping powers \n     because of terrorism are akin to a carpenter asking for a \n     pile driver to hammer a nail, while a hammer lies nearby, \n     unused.\n       Even more disturbing than proposals to expand the \n     jurisdictional base for wiretaps are efforts to remove legal \n     controls on wiretaps. For example, wiretaps are authorized \n     for the interception of particular speakers on particular \n     phone lines. If the interception target keeps switching \n     telephones (as by using a variety of pay phones), the \n     government may ask the court for a ``roving wiretap,'' \n     authorizing interception of any phone line the target is \n     using. Yet while roving wiretaps are currently available when \n     the government shows the court a need, the Clinton and Dole \n     bills allow roving wiretaps for ``terrorism'' \n     [[Page S7604]] without court order. (Again, remember that \n     both bills define ``terrorism'' as almost all violent or \n     property crime.)\n       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides \n     procedures for authorizing wiretaps in various cases. These \n     procedures have worked in the most serious foreign espionage \n     cases. Yet the Clinton and Dole bills would authorize use of \n     evidence gathered in violation of FISA in certain deportation \n     proceedings.\n\n\n                       warrantless data gathering\n\n       Proposals have also been offered to require credit card \n     companies, financial reporting services, hotels, airlines, \n     and bus companies to turn over customer information whenever \n     demanded by the federal government. Document subpoenas are \n     currently available whenever the government wishes to coerce \n     a company into disclosing private customer information. Thus, \n     the proposals do not increase the type of private information \n     that the government can obtain; the proposals simply allow \n     the government to obtain the information even when the \n     government cannot show a court that there is probable cause \n     to believe that the documents contain evidence of illegal \n     activity.\n       Similar analysis may be applied to proposals to increase \n     the use of pen registers (which record phone numbers called, \n     but do not record conversations, and thus do not\n      require a warrant). If a phone company has a high enough \n     regard for its customers' privacy so as to not allow pen \n     registers to be used without any controls, the government \n     may obtain a court order to place a pen register. Business \n     respect for customer privacy ought to be encouraged, not \n     outlawed.\n\n\n          curtailing first amendment rights of computer users\n\n       For some government agencies, the Oklahoma City tragedy has \n     become a vehicle for enactment of ``wish list'' legislation \n     that has nothing to do with Oklahoma City, but which it is \n     apparently hoped the ``do something'' imperative of the \n     moment will not examine carefully.\n       One prominent example is legislation to drastically curtail \n     the right of habeas corpus. Although Supreme Court decisions \n     in recent years have already sharply limited habeas corpus, \n     prosecutors' lobbies want to go even further. Two obvious \n     points should be made: First, habeas corpus has nothing to do \n     with apprehending criminals; by definition, anyone who files \n     a habeas corpus petition is already in prison. Second, habeas \n     corpus has nothing to do with Oklahoma City in particular, or \n     terrorism in general.\n       A second example, of piggybacking irrelevant legislation \n     designed to reduce civil liberties are current FBI efforts to \n     outlaw computer privacy.\n       If a person writes a letter to another person, he can write \n     the letter in a secret code. If the government intercepts the \n     letter, and cannot figure out the secret code, the government \n     is out of luck. These basic First Amendment principles have \n     never been questioned.\n       But, if instead of writing the letter with pen and paper, \n     the letter is written electronically, and mailed over a \n     computer network rather than postal mail, do privacy \n     interests suddenly vanish? According to FBI director Louis \n     Freeh, the answer is apparently ``yes.''\n       Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about \n     Oklahoma City, director Freeh complained that people can \n     communicate over the internet ``in encrypted conversations \n     for which we have no available means to read and understand \n     unless that encryption problem is dealt with immediately.'' \n     ``That encryption problem'' (i.e. people being able to \n     communicate privately) could only be solved by outlawing high \n     quality encryption software like Pretty Good Privacy.\n       First of all, shareware versions of Pretty Good Privacy are \n     ubiquitous throughout American computer networks. The cat \n     cannot be put back in the bag. More fundamentally, the \n     potential that a criminal, including a terrorist, might \n     misuse private communications is no reason to abolish private \n     communications per se. After all, people whose homes are \n     lawfully bugged can communicate privately by writing with an \n     Etch-a-Sketch. That is no reason to outlaw Etch-a-Sketch.\n       Although Mr. Freeh apparently wants to outlaw encryption \n     entirely, the Clinton administration has been proposing the \n     ``Clipper Chip.'' The federal government has begun requiring \n     that all vendors supplying phones to the federal government \n     include the ``Clipper'' chip. Using the federal government's \n     enormous purchasing clout, the Clinton administration is \n     attempting to make the Clipper Chip into a de facto national \n     standard.\n       The clipper chips provides a low level of privacy \n     protection against casual snoopers. But some computer \n     scientists have already announced that the chip can be \n     defeated. Moreover, the ``key''--which allows the private \n     phone conversation, computer file, or electronic mail to be \n     opened up by unauthorized third parties--will be held by the \n     federal government.\n       The federal government promises that it will keep the key \n     carefully guarded, and only use the key to snoop when \n     absolutely necessary. This is the same federal government \n     that promised that social security numbers would only be used \n     to administer the social security system, and that the \n     Internal Revenue Service would never be used for political \n     purposes.\n       Proposals for the federal government's acquisition of a key \n     to everyone's electronic data, which the government promises \n     never to misuse, might be compared to the federal \n     government's proposing to acquire a key to everyone's home. \n     Currently, people can buy door locks and other security \n     devices that are of such high quality that covert entry by \n     the government is impossible; the government might be able to \n     break the door down, but the government would not be able to \n     enter discretely, place an electronic surveillance device, \n     and then leave. Thus, high-quality locks can defeat a lawful \n     government attempt to read a person's electronic \n     correspondence or data.\n       Similarly, it is legal for the government to search through \n     somebody's garbage without a warrant; but there is nothing \n     wrong with the privacy-conscious people and businesses using \n     paper shredders to defeat any potential garbage snooping. \n     Even if high-quality shredders make it impossible for \n     documents to be pieced back together, such shredders should \n     not be illegal.\n       Likewise, while wiretaps or government surveillance of \n     computer communications may be legal, there should be no \n     obligation of individuals or businesses to make wiretapping \n     easy. Simply put, Americans should not be required to live \n     their lives in a manner so that the government can spy on \n     them when necessary.\n       Thus, although proposals to outlaw or emasculate computer \n     privacy are sometimes defended as maintaining the status quo \n     (easy government wiretaps), the true status quo in America is \n     that manufacturers and consumers have never been required to \n     buy products which are custom-designed to facilitate \n     government snooping.\n       The point is no less valid for electronic keys than it is \n     for front-door keys. The only reason that electronic privacy \n     invasions are even discussed (whereas their counterparts for \n     ``old-fashioned'' privacy invasions are too absurd to even be \n     contemplated), is the tendency of new technologies to be more \n     highly restricted than old technologies. For example, the \n     Supreme Court in the 1920's began allowing searches of \n     drivers and automobiles that would never have been allowed \n     for persons riding horses.\n       But the better Supreme Court decisions recognize that the \n     Constitution defines a relationship between individuals and \n     the government that is applied to every new technology. For \n     example, in United States v. Katz, the Court applied the \n     privacy principle underlying the Fourth Amendment to prohibit \n     warrantless eavesdropping on telephone calls made from a \n     public phone booth--even though telephones had not been \n     invented at the time of the Fourth Amendment. Likewise, the \n     principle underlying freedom of the press--that an unfettered \n     press is an important check on secretive and abusive \n     governments--remains the same whether a publisher uses a \n     Franklin press to produce a hundred copies of a pamphlet, or \n     laser printers to produce a hundred thousand. Privacy rights \n     for mail remain the same whether the letter is written with a \n     quill pen and a paper encryption ``wheel,'' or with a \n     computer and Pretty Good Privacy.\n       Efforts to limit electronic privacy will harm not just the \n     First Amendment, but also American commerce. Genuinely secure \n     public-key encryption (like Pretty Good Privacy) gives users \n     the safety and convenience of electronic files plus the \n     security features of paper envelopes and signatures. A good \n     encryption program can authenticate the creator of a \n     particular electronic document--just as a written signature \n     authenticates (more or less) the creator of a particular \n     paper document.\n       Public-key encryption can greatly reduce the need for \n     paper. With secure public-key encryption, businesses could \n     distribute catalogs, take orders, pay with digital cash, and \n     enforce contracts with veriable signatures--all without \n     paper.\n       Conversely the Clinton administration's weak privacy \n     protection (giving the federal government the ability to spy \n     everywhere) means that confidential business secrets will be \n     easily stolen by business competitors who can bribe local or \n     federal law enforcement officials to divulge the ``secret'' \n     codes for breaking into private conversations and files, or \n     who can hack the clipper chips.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                      right to keep and bear arms\n\n                       Cracking down on militias\n\n       Equating all militias with white supremacists is nonsense. \n     Like the Los Angeles Police Department, some militias may \n     have members, or even officers, who are racist, but that does \n     not mean that the organization as a whole, or the vast \n     majority of its members are racists. Most militias are \n     composed of people with jobs and families; people who are \n     seeking to protect what they have, not to inflict revenge on \n     others for their own failings.\n       The frenzy of hatred being whipped up against law-abiding \n     militia members is not unlike the hatred to which law-abiding \n     Arab-Americans would have been subjected,\n      had Oklahoma City been perpetrated by the Libyan secret \n     service. It is not unlike the hatred to which Japanese-\n     Americans were subjected after World War II. Ironically, \n     some politicians who complain about the coarse, angry tone \n     of American politics do so in speeches in which they heap \n     hate-filled invective upon anyone and everyone who belongs \n     to a militia.\n       As this Issue Brief is written, no evidence has developed \n     which ties any militia (let [[Page S7605]] alone all of them) \n     to the Oklahoma City crime. At most, two suspects are said to \n     have attended a few militia meetings and left because the \n     militias did not share their goals. This fact no more proves \n     a militia conspiracy than the hypothetical fact that the \n     suspects went to church a few times would prove that the Pope \n     and Jerry Falwell masterminded the Oklahoma City bombing.\n       That someone who perpetrated a crime may have attended a \n     militia meeting is hardly proof that all militias should be \n     destroyed. The step-father of Susan Smith (the alleged South \n     Carolina child murderer) sexually molested her one night \n     after he returned from putting up posters for the Pat \n     Robertson presidential campaign. What if someone suggested \n     that the ``radical'' patriarchal theories espoused by \n     Robertson and the Christian Coalition created the \n     ``atmosphere'' which led to the incestuous rape, and that \n     therefore all Christian Coalition members were responsible \n     for the crime, and the FBI should ``crack down'' on them? The \n     claim would be dismissed in a second; equally outrageous \n     claims about gun owners should likewise be dismissed.\n       It is a sad testament to the bigotry of certain segments of \n     the media that totally unsubstantiated, vicious conspiracy \n     theories of the type which were once employed against \n     Catholics and Jews are now being trotted out against militia \n     members, patriots, and gun owners.\n       No militia group was involved with the Oklahoma City \n     bombing. Despite the hate-mongering of the media, the \n     ``need'' to start spying on militia groups is a totally \n     implausible basis for expansion of federal government powers.\n       Moreover, militia groups hold public meetings, sometimes \n     advertising in local newspapers. There is hardly a need for \n     greater ``surveillance'' of such public groups.\n       To respond intelligently to the militia and patriot \n     movements, we must acknowledge that, although the movements \n     are permeated with implausible conspiracy theories, the \n     movements are a reaction to increasing militarization, \n     lawlessness, and violence of federal law enforcement, a \n     genuine problem which should concern all Americans.\n       We must also remember that it is lawful in the United \n     States to exercise freedom of speech and the right to bear \n     arms. Spending one's weekends in the woods practicing with \n     firearms and listening to right-wing political speeches is \n     not my idea of a good time, but there is not, and should not, \n     be anything illegal about it.\n       If we want to shrink the militia movement, the surest way \n     is to reduce criminal and abusive behavior by the federal \n     government, and to require a thorough, open investigation by \n     a Special Prosecutor of what happened at Waco and at Ruby \n     Ridge, Idaho. If, as the evidence strongly suggests, the law \n     was broken, the law-breakers should be prosecuted, even if \n     they happen to be government employees.\n       Conversely, the persons responsible for the deaths of \n     innocent Americans should not be promoted to even-higher \n     positions in the FBI or federal law enforcement. If the \n     Clinton administration were trying to fan the flames of \n     paranoia, it could hardly do better than to have appointed \n     Larry Potts second-in-command at the FBI.\n       Militias and patriot groups have been understandably \n     ridiculed for a paranoid world-view centered on the United \n     Nations and international banking. But ironically, many of \n     the people doing the ridiculing share an equally paranoid \n     world-view. Most members of the establishment media and the \n     gun control movement have no more idea what a real militia \n     member is like than militia members have about what a real \n     international banker is like. In both cases, stereotyping \n     substitutes for understanding, and familiar devils (the \n     United Nations for the militia, the National Rifle \n     Association for the establishment media) are claimed to be \n     the motive force behind the actions of a man who (allegedly) \n     believes that the government put a microchip in his buttocks.\n       Nearly twenty years ago, an article in the Public Interest \n     explained the American gun control conflict:\n       ``[U]nderlying the gun control struggle is a fundamental \n     division in our nation. The intensity of passion on this \n     issue suggests to me that we are experiencing a sort of low-\n     grade war going on between two alternative views of what \n     America is and ought to be. On the one side are those who \n     take bourgeois Europe as a model of a civilized society: a \n     society just, equitable, and democratic; but well ordered, \n     with the lines of authority clearly drawn, and with decisions \n     made rationally and correctly by intelligent men for the \n     entire nation. To such people, hunting is atavistic, personal \n     violence is shameful, and uncontrolled gun ownership is a \n     blot upon civilization.\n       ``On the other side is a group of people who do not tend to \n     be especially articulate or literate, and whose world view is \n     rarely expressed in print. Their model is that of the \n     independent frontiersman who takes care of himself and his \n     family with no interference from the state. They are \n     `conservative' in the sense that they cling to America's \n     unique pre-modern tradition--a non-feudal society\n      with a sort of medieval liberty at large for every man. To \n     these people, `sociological' is an epithet. Life is tough \n     and competitive. Manhood means responsibility and caring \n     for your own.''\n       The author explained the disaster that America will create \n     for itself if fearful in government attempt to ``crack down'' \n     on fearful gun-owners, thereby fulfilling the worst fears \n     that each group has of the other:\n       ``As they [the gun-owners] say to a man, `I'll bury my guns \n     in the wall first.' They ask, because they do not understand \n     the other side, `Why do these people want to disarm us?' They \n     consider themselves no threat to anyone; they are not \n     criminals, not revolutionaries. But slowly, as they become \n     politicized, they find an analysis that fits the phenomenon \n     they experience: Someone fears their having guns, someone is \n     afraid of their defending their families, property, and \n     liberty. Nasty things may happen if these people begin to \n     feel that they are concerned.\n       It would be useful, therefore, if some of the mindless \n     passion, on both side, could be drained out of the gun-\n     control issue. Gun control is no solution to the crime \n     problem, to the assassination problem, to the terrorist \n     problem. . . . [S]o long as the issue is kept at a white \n     heat, with everyone having some ground to suspect everyone \n     else's ultimate intentions, the rule of reasonableness has \n     little chance to assert itself.''\n\n\n                            ASSAULT WEAPONS\n\n       Perhaps the most cynical effort to exploit the Oklahoma \n     City tragedy is the effort of gun prohibition advocates to \n     use the murders as a pretext for preserving the federal ban \n     on so-called ``assault weapons.'' To state the obvious, the \n     Oklahoma City bombing was perpetrated with a bomb, not a gun. \n     The bombers may have attended meetings of groups which \n     support the right to keep and bear arms, but that does not \n     prove that gun rights groups were coconspirators, despite the \n     vicious insinuations of some gun prohibition advocates.\n       The reasons for repealing the gun ban remain as strong as \n     ever. First of all, Congress has no Constitutional power \n     (under the Constitution's text and original intent) to ban \n     the simple possession (as opposed to sale in interstate \n     commerce) of anything.\n       Second, if one looks at actual police data (rather than \n     unsupported claims from anti-gun police administrators), \n     ``assault weapons'' constitute only about one percent of \n     crime guns.\n       Third, despite the menacing looks of so-called ``assault \n     weapons,'' they are not more powerful or more deadly than \n     firearms with a more conventional appearance. Instead, the \n     ``assault weapon'' ban is based on cosmetics, such as whether \n     a gun has a bayonet lug--as if criminals were perpetrating \n     drive-by bayonetings.\n       Finally, the ban has already been nullified for all \n     practical purposes. Since the law defines an ``assault \n     weapon'' based on trivial characteristics like bayonet lugs, \n     gun manufacturers have already brought ought new versions of \n     the banned guns, minus the cosmetically offensive bayonet \n     lugs and similar components.\n       Repeal of the ``assault weapon'' ban makes sense as a move \n     towards a more rational federal criminal justice policy. It \n     makes even more sense when its social impact is considered. \n     Many gun control advocates acknowledged that ``assault \n     weapons'' were a tiny component of the gun crime problem, but \n     they still liked the ban because of its symbolic value. A \n     great many other people, however, were very upset by the \n     symbolic message of the gun ban. Some of them have joined \n     militias, patriot groups, or similar organizations. Indeed, \n     it would be no exaggeration to say that President Clinton, \n     Representative Schumer, and Senator Feinstein have, through \n     pushing the gun ban through Congress, done more to promote \n     the surge in militia membership than anyone else in the \n     nation.\n       If we want to reduce the number of people who are \n     frightened by the federal government, the federal government \n     should stop frightening so many people. Given the irrelevance \n     of the ``assault weapon'' ban to actual crime control, repeal \n     of the ban would be a very important step that the federal \n     government could take to convincing millions of Americans \n     that it is not a menace to their liberty. Conversely, \n     retention of a ban on cosmetically-incorrect firearms by law-\n     abiding citizens would be a strong statement to the American \n     people that their federal government does not trust them; and \n     if so, why should they trust it?\n\n\n                            BAN ON TRAINING\n\n       Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center has begun \n     promoting a federal ban on group firearms training which is \n     not authorized by state law. First of all, state governments \n     are perfectly capable of banning or authorizing whatever they \n     want. The proposal for a federal ban amounts to asking \n     Washington for legislation similar to that which various \n     allies of Mr. Dees promoted at the state level in the 1980s, \n     with little success. The vast majority of states having \n     rejected a training ban, the federal government should hardly \n     impose the will of the small minority on the rest of the \n     states.\n       A former direct-mail fundraiser for the antigun lobby, Mr. \n     Dees may be forgiven for a low level of concern for the \n     exercise of the right to keep and bear arms. But the right to \n     keep and bear arms necessarily includes the right to practice \n     with them, just as the Constitutional right to read a \n     newspaper editorial about political events necessarily \n     includes the right to learn how to read. Just as the \n     government may not forbid people from learning how to read in \n     groups, it may not forbid people from learning how to use \n     firearms in groups.\n       ``Organizing, arming, and training in conjunction with a \n     political agenda would be [[Page S7606]] seen as dangerous in \n     any other society but our own,'' a private security \n     consultant recently told Congress, demanding that ``these \n     groups be flatly dealt with as `enemies of our society.'''\n       Of course the United States was founded by ``religious nuts \n     with guns,'' and later achieved independence as a result of a \n     war instigated by people who organized, armed, and trained \n     with a political agenda. The spark of the revolutionary war, \n     the battle of Lexington and Concord, was prompted by the \n     ruling government's attempts to confiscate the ``assault \n     weapons'' of the day held by local militias. It was at the \n     Concord Bridge where militiamen were ordered to ``wait until \n     you see the whites of their eyes'' and then shot government \n     employees who were coming to arrest them for possessing an \n     illegal ``assault weapon'' (a cannon). The Texan revolution \n     against Mexico likewise began over civilian possession of \n     ``military'' arms, when the Mexican government demanded that \n     settlers hand over a cannon, and the Texans replied, ``Come \n     and take it!''\n       The militiamen of Concord Bridge and Texas may have broken \n     the law, but they were great men, worthy of admiration by \n     every schoolchild, and every other American. ``You need only \n     reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a \n     reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go around \n     repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in \n     their struggle for independence,'' observed American \n     historian Charles A. Beard.\n\n\n                bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms\n\n       Some people have claimed that criticism of an alleged \n     pattern of criminal conduct at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \n     and Firearms is tantamount to complicity in the Oklahoma City \n     bombing. If so, then the United States Senate is the party \n     ultimately at fault. In 1982, the Senate Subcommittee on the \n     Constitution investigated the BATF and unanimously concluded \n     that the agency had habitually engaged in:\n       ``. . . conduct which borders on the criminal. . . . \n     [E]nforcement tactics made possible by current firearms laws \n     are constitutionally, legally and practically reprehensible. \n     . . . [A]pproximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions \n     were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal \n     intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into \n     unknowing technical violations.''\n       If it is legitimate for a United States Senate subcommittee \n     to find that BATF operations consist of ``conduct which \n     borders on the criminal,'' it is hardly inappropriate for \n     other persons to point out similar conduct.\n       The Waco raid was the most spectacular, but hardly the only \n     instance of abuse of power by BATF in conducting search \n     warrants.\n       On December 16, 1991 (the first day of the third century of \n     the Bill of Rights), sixty BATF agents, accompanied by two \n     television crews, broke into the Oklahoma home of John \n     Lawmaster. Acting on a tip (suspected to be from Lawmaster's \n     ex-wife) that Lawmaster had illegally converted a semi-\n     automatic to full automatic, BATF worked with the ex-wife to \n     lure Lawmaster away from his home before the raid. With \n     Lawmaster absent, BATF knocked down his front door with a \n     battering ram. While some agents stood guard with weapons \n     drawn, other agents broke open his gun safe, scattered his \n     personal papers, spilled boxes of ammunition onto the floor, \n     and broke into a small, locked box that contained precious \n     coins. To look through some ceiling tiles, one agent stood on \n     a table, breaking the table in the process.\n       Neighbors who asked what BATF was doing were threatened \n     with arrest. Having found nothing illegal, BATF left weapons \n     and ammunition strewn about the home, and departed. They \n     closed the doors, but since BATF had broken the doors on the \n     way in, the doors could not be latched or locked. Upon \n     returning to the shambles that remained of his home, \n     Lawmaster found a note from BATF: ``Nothing found.'' Utility \n     company representatives arrived, and told Lawmaster that they \n     had been told to shut off all his utilities.\n       One of the field commanders of the Waco raid was Ted \n     Royster, head of BATF operations for Texas, Oklahoma, and New \n     Mexico. Royster also supervised the Lawmaster ``raid,'' \n     watching the operation from a parked vehicle with tinted \n     windows.\n       On February 5, 1993--23 days before the Waco raid--BATF \n     ransacked the home of Janice Hart, a black woman in Portland, \n     Oregon, terrorizing her and her three children for hours, \n     destroying her furniture, slamming a door on a child's foot, \n     forcing two children to wait outside in a car while Ms. Hart \n     was interrogated inside, and refusing to allow her to call an \n     attorney, until BATF discovered that there was a case of \n     mistaken identity. (BATF had been looking for Janice Harold, \n     who bears no resemblance to Mrs. Hart.) In this case, unlike \n     most others, BATF did at least send a\n      check for damages, although no apology was offered.\n       As reported by the Washington Times:\n       ``In 1990, [Louis Katona] lent a military-style grenade \n     launcher to ATF for use in an unrelated prosecution, but it \n     was never returned.\n       ``In May 1992, ATF executed a search warrant at his home. \n     During the search, Mr. Katona said his car's tires were \n     flattened, his firearms were intentionally damaged and his \n     pregnant wife was manhandled so roughly that she had a \n     miscarriage.\n       ``In September, he was charged with 19 felonies * * * When \n     the case went to trial in April 1994, U.S. District Judge \n     George W. White directed a verdict of not guilty--asking on \n     the record, `Where's the beef?'''\n       In a case which is widely known among the gun community, \n     but which has been ignored by the national press, except for \n     the Washington Times, the home of gun show promoters Harry \n     and Theresa Lamplugh was raided by BATF in 1994. At least \n     fifteen BATF agents, armed with machine guns, burst into \n     Lamplugh's home one morning. Mr. Lamplugh asked the men, most \n     of whom were not wearing uniforms, if they had a warrant. \n     ``Shut the fxxxx up mother fxxxer; do you want more trouble \n     than you already have?'' they responded, sticking a machine \n     gun in his face.\n       Over the next six and half hours, BATF agents demolished \n     the home, refused to let the Lamplughs get dressed, held a \n     pizza party, killed three house cats (including a Manx kitten \n     which was stomped to death), scattered Mr. Lamplugh's cancer \n     pills all over the floor, and carted off over eighteen \n     thousand dollars worth of the Lamplugh's property, plus their \n     medical records. Nearly a year later, the government has \n     neither filed any criminal charges, nor returned any \n     property, even the medical records.\n       The first of BATF's notorious raids came on June 7, 1971, \n     when agents broke into the home of Kenyon Ballew. A burglar \n     had told the police that Ballew owned grenades. Ballew did \n     own empty grenade hulls, which are entirely legal and \n     unregulated. Wearing ski masks and displaying no \n     identification, BATF agents broke down Ballew's door with a \n     battering ram. Responding to his wife's screams, Ballew took \n     out an antique blackpowder pistol, and was promptly shot by \n     BATF. Nothing illegal was found. He remains confined to a \n     wheelchair as a result of the shooting, and now subsists on \n     welfare.\n       If the sear (the catch that holds the hammer at cock) on a \n     semiautomatic rifle wears out, the rifle may malfunction and \n     repeat fire. The BATF arrested and prosecuted a smalltown \n     Tennessee police chief for possession of an automatic weapon \n     (actually a semiautomatic with a worn-out sear), even though \n     the BATF conceded that the police chief had not deliberately \n     altered the weapon. In March and April of 1988, BATF pressed \n     similar charges for a worn-out sear against a Pennsylvania \n     state police sergeant. After a 12-day trial, the federal \n     district judge directed a verdict of not guilty and called \n     the prosecution ``a severe miscarriage of justice.''\n       Today, observes Robert E. Sanders, a former head of BATF's \n     criminal division, the bureau's leaders, to the great dismay \n     of many high-quality field agents, have ``shifted from the \n     criminal to the gun,'' and are now waging ``an all-out war \n     against the gun.'' Sanders noted that ``Instead of focusing \n     on selected criminals, there is an indiscriminate focus on \n     anyone who owns guns. They are in total consonance with the \n     Clinton administration's anti-gun position and with the gun \n     control groups.''\n       BATF's management has consistently proven itself unwilling \n     to obey statutory law. The Firearm Owners' Protection Act \n     specifically forbids BATF to gather registration information \n     about guns to gun owners, except in connection with a \n     criminal investigation. Nevertheless, BATF is implementing \n     ``Project Forward Trace'' to register the owners of certain \n     legal semiautomatic firearms.\n       The Treasury Department defends the Waco attack on the \n     basis that ``the raid fit within an historic, well-\n     established and well-defended government interest in \n     prohibiting and breaking up all organized groups that sought \n     to arm or defend themselves.'' The candid admission of BATF's \n     objective, however, conflicts with the fact that nothing in \n     existing law makes it illegal for persons, alone or in \n     groups, to collect large number of weapons and to defend \n     themselves. To the contrary, the ownership of large numbers \n     of weapons is specifically protected by federal statute, by \n     federal case law, and of course by the Second Amendment.\n       One approach to improving BATF's conduct would be \n     incremental reforms of the statutes governing BATF. Such an \n     approach was attempted by the Firearm Owners' Protection Act, \n     signed into law in 1986. The 1986 reforms, pushed by the \n     National Rifle Association and other pro-gun organizations, \n     reduced BATF search authority, especially for paperwork \n     technicalities, and increased penalties for armed career \n     criminals. Yet even today, the armed career criminal statutes \n     are often enforced in a manner targeting small-scale, unarmed \n     offenders.\n       The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (a descendant \n     of the Bureau of Prohibition) enforces the federal alcohol \n     laws in a manner also characterized by administrative abuse, \n     over-reaching beyond statutory power, and selective \n     enforcement against persons or companies who dare to \n     criticize BATF.\n       Nor are people outside of BATF the only victims. Planning \n     for the BATF raid on the Mount Carmel Center in Waco began \n     shortly after the Bureau found out that\n      Sixty Minutes was working on a story about sexual harassment \n     at BATF. Months later, Sixty Minutes host Mike Wallace \n     opined ``Almost all the agents we talked to said that they \n     believe the initial attack on that cult in Waco was a \n     publicity stunt--the main goal of which was to improve \n     AFT's tarnished image.'' (The codeword for the beginning \n     of the BATF raid was ``showtime.'') [[Page S7607]] \n       The Sixty Minutes report was devastating. BATF agent \n     Michelle Roberts told the television program that after she \n     and some male agents finished a surveillance in a parking \n     lot, ``I was held against the hood of my car and had my \n     clothes ripped at by two other agents.'' Agent Roberts \n     claimed she was in fear of her life. The agent who verified \n     Ms. Roberts' complaints claims that he was pressured to \n     resign from BATF. Another agent, Sandra Hernandez, said her \n     complaints about sexual harassment were at first ignored by \n     BATF, and she was then demoted to file clerk and transferred \n     to a lower-ranking office. BATF agent Bob Hoffman said \n     ``[T]he people I put in jail have more honor than the top \n     administration in this organization.'' Agent Lou Tomasello \n     said, ``I took an oath. And the thing I find totally \n     abhorrent and disgusting is these higher-level people took \n     that same oath and they violate the basic principles and \n     tenets of the Constitution and the laws and simple ethics and \n     morality.'' Black BATF agents have complained about \n     discrimination in assignments.\n       Abolishing BATF is no solution, for abolition would leave \n     in place the federal alcohol, tobacco and firearms laws, and \n     transfer their enforcement responsibility to some other \n     agency. It is the very nature of the victimless crimes--such \n     as laws criminalizing the peaceful possession or manufacture \n     of alcohol or firearms--which lead to enforcement abuses. As \n     long as the consensual offense laws remain in the U.S. Code, \n     abusive enforcement is likely, as has been the historical \n     norm since the enactment of such laws. Removing most firearm \n     (and alcohol and tobacco) laws from the federal statutes does \n     not imply that alcohol, tobacco, and firearms should be \n     subject to no legal controls. Rather, the control of those \n     objects can continue to be achieved at the state level, \n     without a redundant layer of federal control and the manifold \n     temptations of federal abuse.\n       Since 1985, BATF's size has increased 50%, from 2,900 \n     employees to 4,300. In a time of vast budget deficits, simply \n     restoring BATF to its former size might save both taxpayer \n     dollars and taxpayer lives.\n       While BATF's performance at Waco was disgraceful, two facts \n     should be kept in mind: First, the BATF has a large number of \n     honorable, admirable employees who have quietly gone about \n     their work for years enforcing federal regulations applicable \n     to gun dealers, and enforcing federal laws against possession \n     of guns by persons with felony convictions for violent crime. \n     Misbehavior of some BATF staff (and some BATF leadership) \n     should not be taken as proof that all BATF employees are bad.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I address the Senate today with respect to \nthe May 22, 1995, Washington Post style section story by Howard Kurtz. \nThe substance of the article was to highlight the double standard \nadopted by columnist George Will in criticizing the Clinton \nadministration's decision to add tariffs to Japanese luxury cars.\n  In lampooning the Clinton White House for taking the tough trade \nstand with Japan, Mr. Will failed to mention his wife's relationship as \na lobbyist for the Japanese automobile industry. According to the \narticle, Mr. Will was quite indignant to think that anyone would \nsuspect his motives. If a Member of Congress or an administration \nofficial in a similar situation had taken such a position, you can be \nsure that the press, including Mr. Will, would have taken him or her to \ntask. Tomes would have been written about the abuse of power and \ncorruption of the system. Efforts would have been made to discredit and \nto embarrass the individual. This railing would have gone on until \neither an apology was forthcoming or, in some cases, until a \nresignation was tendered.\n  It is exactly this type of lack of an ethical barometer on the part \nof the media that tips the scales of fairness in reporting. Members of \nthe legislative, executive, and judicial branches must file regular \nfinancial reports and must abide by stringent rules of ethics. This is \nonly proper in matters involving the public's trust.\n  My argument rests with the total lack of parity in the communications \nindustry. There are no comparable ethical standards or rules which \ngovern the media. This is true despite the fact that the levels of \npower and persuasion are as great or greater with the press than they \nare with those in public service. Until some effort is made to level \nthe playing field and throw out the bias, the rampant cynicism and \ndistrust on the part of the people will continue. Nothing points more \ndramatically to the need for change than Mr. Will's arrogance and lack \nof candor in this instance.\n  I thank Mr. Kurtz for bringing this matter to the attention of the \nAmerican public, and I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle be printed in the Record. I suggest that all Senators who have \nnot read it, do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n[[Page S7608]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 23, 1995]\n\n A Conflict of Will's?--Pundit Kept Quiet About Wife's Role as Lobbyist\n\n                           (By Howard Kurtz)\n\n       In his syndicated column Friday, George F. Will assailed \n     the Clinton administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese \n     luxury cars, calling them ``trade-annihilating tariffs to \n     coerce another government into coercing its automobile \n     industry.''\n       He repeated his criticism Sunday on ABC's ``This Week With \n     David Brinkley,'' calling the 100 percent tariffs ``illegal'' \n     and ``a subsidy for Mercedes dealerships.''\n       What Will did not mention is that his wife, Mari Maseng \n     Will, is a registered foreign agent for the Japan Automobile \n     Manufacturers Association. Her firm, Maseng Communications, \n     was paid $198,721 last year to lobby for the industry.\n       Will dismissed any suggestion of a conflict. ``I was for \n     free trade long before I met my wife. End of discussion,'' he \n     said yesterday. ``There are people in Washington whose entire \n     life consists of raising questions. To me, it's beyond \n     boring. I don't understand the whole mentality.\n       ``What's to disclose? What would I say? That one of my \n     wife's clients agrees with my long-standing views on free \n     trade? Good God,'' he said.\n       But several newspaper editors said Will should have \n     disclosed his wife's paid lobbying. ``I'm very distressed,'' \n     said Dennis A. Britton, editor of the Chicago Sun-Times. \n     ``That's one of those material facts an editor should know \n     before placing a story in the paper. That's like a financial \n     writer having a stake in a company he's writing about.''\n       Will did disclose on the Brinkley show last month that his \n     wife was advising Sen. Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) in his \n     presidential campaign and would become the campaign's \n     communications director. Will, who mentioned this before \n     questioning Dole, said he did so only ``because ABC asked me \n     to.'' He said his wife's role would not inhibit him in \n     commenting on the Dole campaign.\n       Will is probably the nation's most prominent conservative \n     writer. He appears on the Brinkley show, opines in Newsweek \n     and writes a newspaper column that is syndicated to 475 \n     papers by The Washington Post Writers Group. Maseng served as \n     White House communications director and assistant secretary \n     of transportation during the Reagan administration. The two \n     were married in 1991.\n       The Washington Post was initially told of Maseng's lobbying \n     by a Clinton administration staffer. The administration has \n     been trying to deflect criticism that the tariffs would hurt \n     American consumers and some car dealers. Will wrote that the \n     13 models of Japanese cars would be ``unsalable in the land \n     of the free and the home of the brave.''\n       According to Maseng's Justice Department filings, her firm \n     is paid $200 an hour to deal with reporters, follow \n     legislation, place advertising, issue press releases and \n     draft op-ed pieces with such titles as ``Selling Cars in \n     Japan: It Isn't About Access'' and ``Fixing the Outcome of \n     Trade With Japan Is a Dangerous Way to Do Business.'' The \n     firm also sought to arrange for the industry's top Washington \n     lobbyist to meet the Chicago Tribune editorial board, tried \n     to place an opinion piece in the Washington Times and drafted \n     letters to the New York Times and Detroit Free Press.\n       Maseng Communications began representing the Japanese in \n     1992 and was paid $47,422 the following year. Maseng did not \n     respond to a request for comment.\n       ``What Maseng provides is the strategic public affairs \n     direction for the communications program,'' said Charles \n     Powers, a senior vice president at Porter/Novelli, another \n     Washington public relations firm that works for the \n     automakers in partnership with Maseng's company.\n       Stephen Isaacs, associate dean of Columbia University's \n     journalism school, said a spouse's employment ``does matter. \n     The same kind of conflict questions that apply to us also \n     apply to our extended families. He made a mistake. . . . The \n     fact that he doesn't see a problem shows he just doesn't get \n     it.''\n       Isaacs also cited a 1980 incident in which Will helped \n     Ronald Reagan prepare for a presidential campaign debate and \n     then praised Reagan's performance on television without \n     disclosing his own role.\n       As for last week's column, some editorial page editors also \n     expressed concern. ``I would have preferred to have known in \n     advance,'' said Brent Larkin, editorial director of the \n     Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n       Dorrance Smith, executive producer of ``This Week With \n     David Brinkley,'' said he was not aware of the connection. He \n     said he had urged Will to disclose his wife's employment with \n     Dole, but that a round-table discussion is ``a different \n     context'' from interviewing a senator.\n       ``I'm not sure where you draw the line,'' Smith said. ``I \n     don't know who Cokie Roberts's brother's clients are.'' \n     Roberts, another Brinkley panelist, is the sister of \n     Washington lobbyist Tommy Boggs.\n       Alan Shearer, general manager of The Washington Post \n     Writers Group, said he saw no evidence that Maseng's \n     employment ``has affected George's judgment. . . . A lot of \n     us have spouses who have careers of their own, and whether \n     that requires us to disclose everything they do is a \n     difficult question. It doesn't bother me.''\n       Will, for his part, doesn't see what the fuss is about. He \n     says he has never discussed the issue with his wife.\n       ``My views on free trade are well known and antecedent to \n     Mari's involvement with whatever the client is,'' Will said. \n     ``It's just too silly.''\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it seems rather obvious we are not going to \nbe able to complete action on the antiterrorism bill, S. 735. I have \nbeen notified that there are at least probably 60 or more amendments to \na bill that we thought the President requested and that we wanted to \ncooperate with the President to try to get to him, as I indicated, \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  But, in view of the 50-some votes we had on the budget, we lost a \nday, and in view of the list of amendments, even though there may be a \nnumber of amendments which may not be offered, it is now very clear \nthat we cannot complete action on this bill today. I think the next \nbest thing is to try to get some agreement to at least limit the number \nof amendments.\n  I do not know how you can have many more than 60, but I assume staff \nlistening in could probably get it up to 90 in 20 minutes if they \nreally tried.\n  But I would just say to the President and particularly the people of \nOklahoma, those who have suffered the tragedy, that we are serious \nabout this legislation. I am not certain whether we can finish on the \nMonday we are back. I do not want to delay telecommunications. We have \npromised and promised both Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings we \nwould address that very important issue. So I will have to decide what \ncourse of action to pursue.\n  I know the House has not acted on this, so even if we did complete \naction today, we could not get the bill to the President until after \nthe Memorial Day recess.\n  And having discussed this with the Democratic leader, I think many of \nthese amendments on both lists are just--there are some that say \n``relevant.'' We do not have any idea what it is or even what it is \nrelevant to. But it is relevant as far as not being able to finish the \nbill if everybody intends to offer their amendments. One Member has 10 \namendments; another on our side has 7, or whatever.\n  So I am going to ask consent that we enter into some agreement that \nwe limit the number of amendments to those that have been identified, \nif that is satisfactory with the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, like the majority leader, I also would \nlike to be able to accommodate the schedule to move this legislation as \nquickly as we can. We need to send a clear message, not only to the \npeople of Oklahoma, but others as well, that this is important.\n  As the majority leader knows, we just received a copy of the draft \nlast night. As I understand it, it has not yet been printed in the \nRecord. We will be taking a closer look at it.\n  I think, in spite of the fact that there may be some questions \nrelating to the draft itself, we would be willing to enter into an \nagreement on the list of amendments so we can work through them. There \nare a lot of amendments there that may or may not be offered, but I \nthink it does protect Senators since they have not had the opportunity \nto look at it more carefully. Certainly, over the course of the next \nseveral days, everyone will do that. But we want to expedite our \nprogress on this and, hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we can \nresolve what outstanding differences remain and come to a point where \nwe can vote on final passage.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I hope we can obtain a consent agreement and \nthe managers of the bill can stay here. There may be amendments on each \nside that can be taken, indicating we are making an effort to move \nforward, even though we have only had one vote [[Page S7609]] today and \nopening statements yesterday. That, I think, will be helpful if we can \ntake a few minutes on each side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \nfirst-degree amendments in order; that they be subject to relevant \nsecond degrees after a failed motion to table, with the exception of \nthe amendments described only as ``relevant,'' and they be subject to \nrelevant second degrees prior to any motion to table; and that the \namendments be limited to the following time agreements where \ndesignated, to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  I just suggest, if there is no objection, I understand they are \nworking on a final draft of amendments on that side. I think we have a \nfinal draft. I will not read each of the amendments and the sponsors, \nbut I ask unanimous consent that the amendments on the Democratic list \nbe printed in the Record, as well as those on the Republican list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, but in the \nspirit of trying to help the two leaders, especially on this type of \nlegislation, obviously with the rights of every Senator that are well \nknown and abound and are used more than infrequently, on legislation \nlike this I think it possibly would be wise to at least consider a set \nnumber of amendments and then seek a unanimous-consent agreement that \nthe Republican leader and the Democratic leader--depending on how many \nthey want--would ask to be the final authority on what amendments and \nin what order are offered on something I think as critically important \nas this piece of legislation.\n  If we had not had the 50-hour time limit on the budget resolution, \nobviously we would have been here this weekend and through next \nWednesday. I was one who had to wrestle with it.\n  I guess somewhere along the line we have to appeal to all the Members \nwith the idea of moving things--not in all cases--but in cases like \nthis, maybe we could have some kind of appeal to have the leaders say \nhow many amendments will be called up and in what order and the others \nwould not be in order.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I hope we will be able \nto do that indirectly, maybe working with the managers. I think many of \nthese amendments will not be called up. Many are acceptable, many are \nimprovements on the bill. Some are going to be debated.\n  I do not see any partisan effort on this legislation. I think it is a \nquestion of trying to find how do we get a good bill, how do we protect \nconstitutional rights down the road. I am hopeful we can do that rather \nquickly once we get all these in a net here. I can see they are growing \nas we speak, and as fast as they can write, amendments are being added \nto the list. So I hope quickly we can stop the bleeding.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Republican leader will yield for a \nmoment, reserving the right to object. I am confident the reason why \nthe list is growing is because no one has seen the bill. It has not \nbeen printed in the Record. There have been several of us who have seen \nthe bill. Our colleagues have not seen the bill. Their staffs have not \nseen the bill.\n  So I am absolutely confident that a significant portion of the \namendments that are being added are being added in the blind. They just \nwant to make sure that the bill does not do what it is rumored to do in \nthe press.\n  I think this is one of those cases where we should not spend a whole \nlot more time trying to narrow it. If we can get a list now, great, do \nit, but I am confident that the Senator from Utah and I, over the \nperiod of the remainder of the day and during the recess, will be able \nto go a long way to narrowing down that list as our colleagues get a \nchance and their staffs get a chance to read this bill, which is not in \nthe Record yet.\n  We always spend time weighing bills around here. This is a 150-page \nbill that no one has seen other than me, and I have not read it yet. I \ngot it at 6 o'clock last night. I am not being critical of anyone, but \nthat is just by way of explanation.\n  I do not think amendments being added are added for any other reason \nthan to protect some issue Members are concerned about in this \nlegislation.\n  I beg your pardon, it is in the Record. I stand corrected, it is in \nthe Record as of last night. Based on the last vote, 15 to 20 people \nare gone. That is the only point I make. I am sure we can work that \nthrough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The list of the amendments is as follows:\n                      Amendments to Terrorism Bill\n\n\n                         Republican amendments\n\n       Kyl: Habeas corpus.\n       Hatch: Technical.\n       Gramm:\n       (1) Sentencing\n       (2) Relevant\n       Abraham: Alien terrorist removal.\n       Pressler: Federal building.\n       Pressler: False identification of documents.\n       Smith: Technical.\n       Craig: Relevant.\n       Craig: Relevant.\n       Craig: Mandatory minimums.\n       Brown: Sanctions on terrorist countries.\n       Brown: Relevant.\n       Specter: Secret proceedings/deportation.\n       Specter: Attorney generals classification of terrorist \n     organizations.\n       Specter: Wiretap.\n       Specter: Habeas corpus exhaustion of remedies.\n       Specter: Habeas corpus/full and fair determination.\n       Specter: Habeas corpus.\n       Specter: Relevant.\n       Dole: Relevant.\n       Dole: Relevant.\n       Coverdell: I.D. cards.\n       Helms: International terrorism.\n       Helms: International terrorism.\n       Helms: International terrorism.\n       Hatch: Relevant.\n       Hatch: Relevant.\n       Cohen: Posse comitatus.\n       Ashcroft: Citizen rights.\n       Kempthouse: Relevant.\n       Warner: Relevant.\n                         Democratic amendments\n\n       Biden:\n       1.

Mr. President, let me indicate, I think I count 89 or 90 \namendments--they went up 30 as I was getting ready here. Obviously, \nthey will not all be offered. If they will, I just will not bring the \nbill back up again.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no assault weapons amendments be \nin order to the terrorism bill, and that following the disposition of \nthe above-listed amendments, the Hatch substitute be agreed to. That is \nas far as we can go, I think, at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my friend, the Democratic leader, and the manager \nof the bill. I hope maybe in the course of the next hour or two, they \nmay be able to dispose of 30 or 40 of these amendments.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Fifty or sixty, Mr. President, I am sure we could, if we \nwork extra hard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader if he can give \nus some indication as to the schedule for the remainder of the day and \nperhaps on Monday when we return.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. DOLE. There will be no more votes today, and on Monday, June 5, I \nsuggest, I hope there will be votes, but any votes ordered not occur \nprior to 5 p.m., so some Members coming from a distance will be able to \nbe here if they leave their homes early Monday morning.\n  At that point--and I will advise the Democratic leader hopefully this \nafternoon--maybe we will move to the telecommunications bill or stay on \nthis bill, and much will depend on whether or not the managers believe \nwe can finish this bill rather quickly, say, by Tuesday afternoon. Then \nwe can still go on the telecommunications bill for the remainder of the \nweek.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have just concluded that it would \nbe a better procedure if we would give the managers, starting today, an \nopportunity to go through these amendments. Some they may be prepared \nto take, but they have not been fully reviewed; some have not been \nfully drafted, but they have the concept. We have to see the exact \nlanguage.\n  The leadership of both sides suggest that we start that process today \nand, in the meantime, I am going to suggest that we now have a period \nfor the transaction of routine morning business, with Senators \npermitted to speak for not more than 5 minutes each.\n  Mr. HATCH. Before the leader does that, I want to say I think the \nmajority leader is right. We are going to get our staffs together and \nsift through the amendments and see which ones we can agree on and \ndispose of quickly. Hopefully, we will get that done.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' so \nwrites Montana State Senator Ethel Harding of Polson. On January 21, \n1974, Senator Harding's daughter, Lana, was brutally murdered. It was \nnot until just 2 weeks ago, over 21 years later, that justice was \nfinally carried out and Lana's murderer was executed by the State of \nMontana.\n  This tragedy has haunted Senator Harding and her family for far too \nmany years. The unfortunate thing is that the Harding family is not \nalone.\n  And so it is encouraging to see the Senate act upon true habeas \ncorpus reform as part of the overall Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention \nAct of 1995.\n  I cannot agree with some of my colleagues who would suggest that \nhabeas corpus reform should not be a part of this legislation. No one, \nincluding the families of the 167 innocent people killed in the \nOklahoma City bombing, should have to wait as long as the Harding \nfamily to see that justice is carried out.\n  Habeas corpus reform is long overdue in my opinion and the quicker we \ncan bring about change in this area of the law the better. I appreciate \nthe efforts of Montana's attorney general, Joe Mazurek, who along with \n11 other attorneys general from around the country wrote to the \nPresident in support of habeas corpus reform. This is not a partisan \nissue and should not get bogged down in partisan politics.\n  In addition, I am encouraged that Senators Dole and Hatch have taken \ngreat pains to ensure that this legislation reaffirms our longstanding \ncommitment to constitutional protections, and that any provision of the \nact which is held unconstitutional, will be severed from the act and \nwill not affect the remaining provisions.\n  I am also pleased to see that we have not weakened the prohibition on \nthe use of the U.S. Armed Forces for domestic police purposes and that \nwe have not expanded the authority of roving wiretaps by removing the \nrequirement of intent.\n  In the wake of this great national tragedy, it is critical that we \nunite behind our law enforcement personnel. From the local, to the \nState, to the Federal authorities, law enforcement and public service \npersonnel should be commended for the fine work they have done thus \nfar.\n  At the same time, it is important that we do not overreact out of \nfear or heightened emotions. In Montana, we continue to have situations \nin which individuals feel threatened by an imposing, uncaring, and \noverwhelming Federal Government and bureaucracy. As a result, some \nindividuals have been driven to illegal acts such as a variety of \nFederal and felony charges, including gun violations, threatening and \nimpersonating public officials, and tax evasion.\n  Such actions cannot be condoned for we are a civilized nation of \nlaws. The Montana law enforcement community has responded cautiously \nbut appropriately to these situations. They have taken a \nnonconfrontational approach, responding swiftly and\n firmly to any activities that have resulted in a violation of the law. \nAnd they have done so without jeopardizing human lives.\n\n  If we can help our local law enforcement community detect and prevent \nfuture violations of the law by providing our law enforcement community \nwith the resources to effectively carry out their responsibilities, we \nshould do so. This legislation is a reasoned, balanced approach in that \nregard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7608-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on a \nmatter that has caused me great personal concern and that has rapidly \nbeen allowed to escalate into another tragic example of political class \nwarfare in the United States.\n  I am speaking of the overzealous and counterproductive rhetoric of \nextremists and extremism. Most recently, the National Rifle Association \nhas provided an example of the worst in political debate.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I include a letter I recently received \nfrom Mr. Jack Sands, of Waldorf, MD. Mr. Sands is typical of many \nformer NRA members who have seen its leadership become more violent in \nits rhetoric over the years. Addressing his letter to Wayne R. \nLaPierre, he states:\n\n       I hereby resign as a life member of the NRA. Enclosed is my \n     membership card dated 1973. Please remove my name from all \n     mailing lists. I have chosen today to take this action, since \n     this is Peace Officers Memorial Day when we pay tribute to \n     the nearly 14,000 American law enforcement officers who died \n     in the line of duty. As a retired Federal officer, I no \n     longer wish to be affiliated with the NRA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jack M. Sands.\n\n  I commend the national leadership for its courage in apologizing for \nits most recent example of political hatred. The comments circulated by \nthe NRA were both offensive and irresponsible. I commend them for their \napology, but I condemn them, Mr. President, for not having the good \nsense to exercise responsible restraint in the first place.\n  There is a popular ad campaign that says ``I'm the NRA,'' and we are \nshown a normal, everyday, person. The message from that ad is that the \nNRA is just a rank-and-file, next-door-neighbor organization.\n  Well, Mr. President, there are two NRA's. There is the leadership of \nthe NRA and there is the rank and file reflected in this memo sent to \nseveral Members. This is their way of lobbying Congress. It is a \npicture of a gun-toting person speaking about ``jack-booted BATF \nthugs.''\n  Mr. President, I was in the NRA but I quit a year ago. So did some of \nour friends and colleagues like Congressman Brewster who dropped off \nthe board, and Congressmen John Dingell and Tom Foley. Just like former \nPresident George Bush.\n  It is time for the rank and file membership of the NRA to take back \ntheir association. Otherwise, Mr. President, they will be tarred with \nthe same brush as those few, but vocal, zealots who have initiated this \nmost destructive campaign of hatred, innuendo, fear, animosity, and \nintimidation which are the NRA leadership's favorite tools for lobbying \nelected officials.\n  Those who preach hatred and disrespect for the law bear some \nresponsibility if their message of hatred contributes to lawless acts \nof others. Likewise, those in the Government who act with arrogance or \ndisrespect for the rights of our law abiding citizens--regardless of \nthe political or social beliefs of the citizens--will bear some \nresponsibility if their official behavior contributes to an atmosphere \nof distrust and animosity toward the Government.\n  There is no excuse to justify vigilante-ism or open lawlessness. It \nis absolutely inexcusable and irresponsible for a national \norganization--such as the NRA--which claims it speaks for a great \nnumber of our constituents--to openly promote lawlessness or disrespect \nfor our law enforcement personnel.\n  That is precisely what our system of government was created to avoid.\n   Political debate, discussion, recall, referendum, and involvement is \nhow we keep our Government responsive to the needs of the people in the \ntraditional and acceptable way.\n\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, that I also resigned my membership \nfrom the NRA. I did that over a year ago because some of its fanatical \nmembers actually made threats against me and my staff if I did not vote \ntheir way. I will not lend my name to an organization which appears to \ncater to that kind of violent behavior.\n  I can also tell you, Mr. President, that views of the beltway NRA is \nnot reflective of the majority of its members' attitudes. Certainly not \nthe Coloradans who have been such dedicated and generous members.\n  Those NRA members would, I am certain, join me in condemning the \nirresponsible behavior of earlier this month.\n  I am personally highly offended that there is now a trend to \npoliticize the tragedy in Oklahoma City. That was a heinous, terrible, \ncriminal act. These responsible deserve nothing more than due process \nof law and total, complete, scorn from society. That was contemptible \nand it was barbarism.\n  It is almost equally contemptible to use that tragedy to further a \npolitical agenda. It does not matter what the agenda is, whether \nadditional forms of gun control or whether it is an agenda of anti-\ngovernmentalism. To use that tragedy for political or personal \nadvantage cheapens the lives of the innocent victims and it cheapens \nthe rights protected by our Constitution.\n  The NRA is not the only national organization to use lies, hate, \nfear, or intimidation to generate contributions and to influence public \npolicy. This is a phenomenon that has become quite popular among many \ngroups who wish to influence national policy despite representing \nsmall, minority, views on a given issue.\n  However, I can think of no other organization in our history which \nhas advocated acts of outright violence against the Government or law \nenforcement. That was a new low and I am relieved--somewhat--that the \nNRA has at least apologized. Let's have no more.\n  The NRA held its national convention this week. To the NRA membership \nin Colorado and the Nation, I say: Take back your association before it \nis destroyed--before it destroys itself--from within.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7611-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       RICHARD P.

Mr. President, today, I rise to support S. 768, the \nEndangered Species Act Reform Amendments of 1995.\n  I wish to compliment Senator Gorton and Senator Johnston on the \nthought and effort which has obviously gone into the crafting of this \nlegislation.\n  Reform of the Endangered Species Act is way overdue, and I am very \npleased that the Congress is finally addressing this issue in a \nsubstantive way. Field hearings on ESA reform will be underway next \nweek under the guidance of my colleague from Idaho, Senator Dirk \nKempthorne, who chairs the subcommittee of jurisdiction within the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I will be joining Dirk in \n[[Page S7612]] Lewiston, ID, on June 3 for the ESA hearing there.\n  I want to be counted as one who recognizes the value of our fish and \nwildlife. I have repeatedly said that I cannot support outright repeal \nof the Endangered Species Act, as many have urged. But the act needs \nsubstantial revision if it is to be brought back in balance with the \neconomic well-being of this country and with the needs of its citizens. \nFar beyond its original intent, the act has been made a bludgeon to \nsuppression legitimate use of public lands and to threaten private \nlandowners and communities.\n  Nowhere is that fact more obvious than in my State of Idaho. Earlier \nthis year, an Endangered Species Act Lawsuit brought by two \npreservation groups resulted in a perverse opinion which threatened to \nshut down all economic activity on 14 million acres in Idaho.\n  Mr. President, that is an area the size of Rhode Island, Connecticut, \nMassachusetts and New Hampshire combined. If the courts can find reason \nunder the existing law to render such a devastating opinion as was done \nin this case, then it is imperative that Congress correct the obvious \nflaws in the law.\n  As chair of the two subcommittees in the Senate with jurisdiction \nover forest policy, I have embarked on a series of hearings to \nunderstand and correct the myriad of conflicting laws and regulations \nwhich have strangled the practice of good forestry in this country. The \npractice of forestry is at a standstill on our western public lands, \nand the primary culprit is the Endangered Species Act. The forests are \nruled by the Endangered Species Act, not the Forest Service or the \nBureau of Land Management, and that is a reality which must be changed.\n  Senator Gorton's bill provides many of the needed changes. It \nincludes language which Senator Kempthorne and I introduced as S. 455 \nearlier this year to prevent a repeat of the court opinion I have \nalready described. it would streamline the section 7 consultation \nprocess, which has proven to be unworkable in our experience with \nthreatened and endangered salmon. It brings cost-consciousness, state \nrights and private landowners back into the equation for conservation \nof species.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 768. I have told Senator Gorton \nthat I will assist him in any way possible to accomplish a balanced \nreform of the ESA. It must be done this year--we have waited too long \nalready. I hope our colleagues will join us in this effort.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7611-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KRESIMIR COSIC\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today to honor the life of Kresimir \nCosic, a Croatian patriot and an adopted son of Utah, who died \nyesterday morning after a long illness. On behalf of Utahns he inspired \nand charmed for over a quarter-century, I wish to extend our deepest \ncondolences to his wife and children.\n  When he died, Kresimir Cosic was the Republic of Croatia's Deputy \nAmbassador to the United States, a position in which he played an \ninvaluable role. But sports fans in this country and around the world \nwould know him more for his brilliant career in basketball--a career \nthat spanned nearly two decades and brought him to the Olympics four \ntimes.\n  His close ties to our country began nearly 30 years ago, when the \ncoaches at Brigham Young University, who had seen the young Croat from \nZadar lead his team from the former Yugoslavia to claim the silver \nmedal in the 1968 Olympics, invited him to play for the BYU team. \nKresimir Cosic's decision to accept was, in one way, his first \ncontribution in diplomacy: He would become the first foreign basketball \nplayer to win All-American honors, which he did in 1972 and 1973.\n  At BYU, he endeared himself to Utahns by his brilliant sportsmanship \nand his personal decency. As a great center he dazzled us all, \ndribbling behind his back, putting up an amazing defense, and breaking \nthe record of all-time high scorer and rebounder. Off the court, he \nshared our faith and warmed our homes. In all the years I have known \nhim, including the last year when he was personally suffering a great \ndeal, I never saw him without a smile.\n  After his 4 years, he was drafted by the L.A. Lakers and the Carolina \nCougars, but he chose to return home. Fans of world basketball saw him \nwin most-valued-player honors in the former Yugoslavia, on All-European \nteams, and in the Olympics, where in Montreal in 1976 his team won the \nsilver medal and in Moscow in 1980 his team beat the Soviets to win the \ngold.\n  Kresimir was a Croatian patriot, who dedicated the last part of his \nlife to the rebirth of Croatia's independence, and to building strong \nrelations between his country and ours. The most brilliant sports men \nand women combine extraordinary skill, a sophisticated sense of \nstrategy, and spirit. I suggest that these are the attributes that also \nmake good diplomats, for Kresimir was one of the best.\n  Since 1991, Kresimir was one of my wisest counsels on the crisis in \nthe Balkans. Always with optimism, he would outline the regional \ncomplexities with a shrewd notion of strategy that effortlessly \ncombined historical sense with the ability to see three moves down the \ncourt. In a world where so much foreign policy is merely reactive, \nKresimir always counseled on how to anticipate.\n  While Croatia suffered attack, he did not despair. His love of \ncountry never wavered, and his dedication to a free and democratic \nCroatia was as strong as his character because it was his character. In \nWashington, he served his country with great distinction, as a paragon \nof probity. And always he insisted that Croatia's greatest ally should \nbe the United States. In my experience, no one could embody a greater \nwarmth between two countries than Kresimir Cosic's friendship with \nAmericans.\n  Kresimir Cosic lived an example of physical discipline, mental focus, \nand spiritual stamina. He was an inspiration to all who saw him on the \ncourt, to all who engaged him in the halls of diplomacy and, above all, \nto all who had the enriching experience of being his friend. Kresimir \nCosic was one of the finest human beings I have ever known.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to revise \nthe estate and gift tax in order to preserve American family \nenterprises, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the national family enterprise preservation act of 1995\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nNational Family Enterprise Preservation Act of 1995 which will provide \nestate tax relief to many of our Nation's family owned farms and \nbusinesses.\n  Our current tax laws are forcing many inheritors of family farms and \nbusinesses to sell the enterprise in order to pay estate taxes. A \nfamily farm or business is not only a productive component of our \neconomy, it is a distinctive part of our American economic system and \nthe personal dream of millions of Americans.\n  But all this is being threatened by high taxes that are imposed by \ngovernment when the owner dies.\n  Small businesses are being forced to merge into large corporations \nbecause marketable stock can be acquired tax free and many estate tax \nproblems can be avoided. In 1942, the estate tax affected only 1 estate \nout of 60. Today, this number has increased to 1 out of 20.\n  Another consideration is that inflation has pushed the value of many \nfamily farms and businesses into the range of estate tax liability. The \nresult has been that heirs of these enterprises often sell their \nbusiness to pay estate taxes.\n  Family owned farms and businesses are a vital component of our \neconomy and society and should be preserved. They give families a sense \nof freedom, accomplishment, and pride in ownership. This is the essence \nof free enterprise.\n  Mr. Chairman, earlier this year I had the opportunity to visit with a \ntree farmer from my State who was recognized this year by the \nMississippi Forestry Association as ``Forester of the Year.'' His name \nis Chester Thigpen, and he is truly a remarkable man. \n[[Page S7616]] Chester Thigpen and others like him represent the \ntaxpayers for whom I am introducing this legislation today.\n  Mr. Thigpen and his wife, Rosett, live in Montrose, MS. When he was a \nchild, he dreamed of owning land. He first brought a small parcel of \nland in 1940, continued to save and slowly added acreage to his farm. \nHe worked hard to improve his land and that land allowed him to provide \nfor his family and made it possible to put his five children through \ncollege.\n  This land represents a tremendous amount of pride and hard work for \nThigpens. They always thought they would be able to leave a legacy for \ntheir children as a reward for their hard work and as a symbol of their \nfamily's success.\n  But there is a big problem. The Thigpen's land over the last 50 years \nhas increased considerably in value. The estate tax burden is going to \nmake it nearly impossible for their children to keep the farm when \ntheir parents die.\n  Mr. and Mrs Thigpen and other hard working Americans should not have \nto sacrifice their lifelong dreams because of unnecessary tax burdens. \nTheir. children should have the same opportunity their parents have \nhad, to use their property to be productive citizens.\n  The legislation I am introducing will increase from $600,000 to $1 \nmillion the value of property that may pass free of Federal estate and \ngift taxes. In addition, the current annual gift tax exclusion of \n$10,000 would be increased to $20,000 in the case of gifts to qualified \nfamily members of family enterprise property. This legislation will \nalso change special use valuation. Currently, special use valuation \ncannot reduce the gross estate by more than $750,000. This amount would \nbe increased to $1 million. And finally, this bill will make changes in \nthe family enterprise interest on estates.\n  Mr. Chairman, I submit an editorial from the March 3, 1995 issue of \nthe Washington Times and a copy of Mr. Thigpen's remarks to the U.S. \nHouse Committee on Ways and Means, which I ask a unanimous consent be \nprinted in the Record, along with a copy of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

My wife Rosett and I are Tree \n     Farmers from Montrose, Mississippi.\n        Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear \n     before this Committee. You are debating an issue that is very \n     important to more than 7 million people who own most of the \n     nation's productive timberland. Most of us have been at it \n     for a long time. Professor Larry Doolittle of Mississippi \n     State University published a paper in 1992 that suggested \n     half the Tree Farmers in the Mid-South were 62 years old or \n     over. This pattern holds true in other parts of the country \n     as well. So it should come as no surprise to the Committee \n     that, when Tree Farmers gather, one of the things we discuss \n     is estate taxes. [[Page S7617]] \n       Estate taxes matter not just to lawyers, doctors and \n     businessmen, but to people like Rosett and me. We were both \n     born on land that is now part of our Tree Farm. I can \n     remember plowing behind a mule for my uncle who owned it \n     before me. My dream then was to own land. I bought a little \n     bit in 1940 and inherited some from my family's estate in \n     1946, and then bought some more. Back when I started, the \n     estate tax applied to only one estate in 60. Today it applies \n     to one in 20--including mine. I wonder if I would be able to \n     achieve my dream if I were starting out today.\n        Mr. Chairman, you have heard many witnesses talk about the \n     technical details of estate tax reform. They know far more \n     about it than I do. With your permission, I'd like to take a \n     few minutes to talk about what I do know: what estate tax \n     reform will mean in places like Montrose, Mississippi and to \n     Tree Farmers like me and Rosette.\n       We first got started in forestry in 1960. Much of our land \n     was old cotton and row crop fields, so early on I spent 90 \n     percent of my time trying to keep it from washing away. We \n     developed a management plan and started growing trees. Today, \n     we manage our property for timber, wildlife habitat, water \n     quality and recreation. We have built ponds for erosion \n     control and for wildlife. Deer and turkey have come back, so \n     we invite our neighbors to hunt on our land.\n       It took us half a century, but Rosett and I have managed to \n     turn our land into a working Tree Farm that has been a source \n     of pride and income for my entire family.\n       Our Tree Farm made it possible to put our five children \n     through college. It made it possible for Rosette and me to \n     share our love of the outdoors and our commitment to good \n     forestry with our\n      neighbors. And finally, it made it possible for us to leave \n     a legacy that makes me very proud: beautiful forests and \n     ponds that can live on for many, many years after my wife \n     and I pass on. We wanted to leave the land in better \n     condition than when we first started working it. And we \n     will.\n       We also want to leave the Tree Farm in our family. But no \n     matter how hard I work, that depends on you.\n       Right now, people tell me my Tree Farm could be worth more \n     than a million dollars. All that value is tied up in land or \n     trees. We're not rich people. My son and I do almost all the \n     work on our land ourselves. So, under current law, my \n     children might have to break up the Tree Farm or sell off \n     timber to pay the estate taxes. I am here today to endorse a \n     proposal called the National Family Enterprise Preservation \n     Act which would totally exempt over 98 percent of all family \n     enterprises, not just Tree Farms, from the Federal estate \n     tax. A copy is attached to my written testimony.\n       Giving up the Tree Farm we worked fifty years to create \n     would hurt me and my family. I don't think it would be good \n     for the public either. If the Tree Farm had to be sold or the \n     timber cut before its time, what would happen to the erosion \n     control programs we put in place, or the wildlife habitat? \n     Who would make certain that the lands stayed open for our \n     neighbors to visit and enjoy? I know my children would. And I \n     hope their children will have an opportunity after them.\n       I think too often people focus on just the costs of estate \n     tax reform and not the benefits. In forestry, the benefits \n     will be substantial. I mentioned earlier that most of the 7 \n     million landowners in this country are close to retirement \n     age or, like me, way past it. Without estate tax reform, many \n     of their properties will be broken up into smaller tracks or \n     harvested prematurely. Some may no longer be economical to \n     operate as Tree Farms and will perhaps be converted to other \n     uses or back into marginal agriculture. Other properties may \n     become too small or generate too little cash flow to support \n     the kind of multiple use management we practice on our \n     property. Healthy, growing forests with abundant wildlife \n     provide benefits to everybody. Without estate tax reform, it \n     will become harder and harder for people like me to remain \n     excellent stewards of our family-owned forests.\n       Mr. Chairman, a few months ago, Rosett and I were named \n     Mississippi's Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year. It was a \n     great honor to be selected from among the thousands of \n     excellent Tree Farmers in Mississippi. I'm told one reason we \n     were recognized was because Rosett and I have been speaking \n     out on behalf of good forestry for almost four decades.\n       That's why I made this trip to Washington: to remind the \n     Committee that estate tax reform is important to preserve \n     family enterprises like ours. It is also important for good \n     forestry. We just planted some trees on our property a few \n     months ago. I hope my grandchildren and great-grandchildren \n     will be able to watch those trees grow on the Thigpen Tree \n     Farm--and I know millions of forest landowners feel the same \n     way about their own Tree Farms. We applaud estate tax reforms \n     that will make this possible.\n       Thank you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 13, 1995]\n\n                            Death and Taxes\n\n       There are two certainties in life of which Americans are \n     all too well aware: death and taxes. Less well known is the \n     fact that taxes don't stop with death.\n       Consider the case of Mississippi resident Chester Thigpen, \n     a man who has painstakingly built a reputation for \n     overachievement during his 83 years. The grandson of slaves, \n     he was born on a farm when cotton was king and grew up \n     dreaming that one day he would own land of his own. He bought \n     a little land in 1940 and slowly added to his holdings, \n     raising trees and children along the way with his wife \n     Rosett.\n       Today he has 850 acres of farm land to his name, five \n     children with college educations financed from timber \n     harvests there and a roomful of honors for his stewardship of \n     the land and his outreach work on behalf of forestry. Already \n     he is in Mississippi's Agriculture and Forestry Museum's Hall \n     of Fame and this year was named the state's Outstanding Tree \n     Farmer. Such achievements may not mean much in a city like \n     Washington, where productivity is something one measures in \n     red ink. But lawmakers might want to consider where they \n     would be without tree byproducts the next time they try to \n     introduce a bill or send a memo.\n       There is, however, one thing that the Thigpens don't have, \n     and that is the peace of mind that comes with knowing they \n     can pass on their version of the American dream to their \n     children. The federal estate tax, you see, begins taking a \n     progressively larger bite out of any estate worth more than \n     $600,000. Mr. Thigpen's advisers have warned him that his \n     estate may top that figure by as much as $1 million. The \n     projected estate tax bill? Some $345,000.\n       That's a problem because Mr. Thigpen is effectively ``tree \n     poor.'' Although he is comfortably well off on paper, his \n     wealth is all tied up in the trees. And unless the Thigpens \n     or, in the event of their deaths, their children, clear cut a \n     swath through the farm, they won't have the money to pay off \n     the feds. The only alternative is to sell a lot of the land \n     now, which would leave Mr. Thigpen with substantial capital \n     gains taxes to pay. Or his children could sell it upon their \n     parents' deaths to raise the money, thereby breaking up the \n     family farm.\n       The latter is particularly painful to Mr. Thigpen, whose \n     holdings include land inherited from his family. ``Giving up \n     the tree farm we worked 50 years to create would hurt me and \n     my family,'' he told members of the House Ways and Means \n     Committee last month. ``If the tree farm had to be sold or \n     the timber cut before its time, what would happen to the \n     erosion control programs we put in place, or the wildlife \n     habitat? Who would make certain that the lands stayed open \n     for our neighbors to visit and enjoy? I know my children \n     would. And I hope their children will have an opportunity \n     after them.''\n       Once upon a time, or course, families like the Thigpens \n     didn't have to worry about the likes of estate taxes. They \n     were designed to hit the very wealthiest Americans. But as \n     inflation moved Americans into one higher bracket after \n     another, suddenly they found they too were ``rich.'' Where \n     only one in 60 families paid estate taxes, now one in 20 do.\n       This week the committee is scheduled to begin marking up \n     tax legislation--including estate-tax changes--as part of the \n     Contract with America. The question is whether lawmakers can \n     see, well, the forest for the trees.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (by request):\n  S. 868. A bill to provide authority for leave transfer for Federal \nemployees who are adversely affected by disasters or emergencies, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n         FEDERAL EMPLOYEES EMERGENCY LEAVE TRANSFER ACT OF 1995\n\n   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the administration has sent to my office \na bill to provide additional authority for leave transfer to Federal \nemployees who are adversely affected by disasters or emergencies. I \nthink it is appropriate to raise this at this time, and because it has \ncome in just before we are going into recess, I want to introduce it \nand take this time to explain it, with the hope that we will be able to \nmove it very rapidly when we get back.\n  This is a bill that would be called the Federal Employees Emergency \nLeave Transfer Act of 1995. In the event of a major disaster or \nemergency, the President would have the authority to direct the Office \nof Personnel Management to create a special leave transfer program for \nFederal employees affected by the disaster emergency.\n  Under current law, Federal employees may donate annual leave to other \nemployees who face medical emergencies. Current law is limited to \nmedical emergencies and requires recipients to exhaust their own leave \nbefore using donated leave.\n  Under this proposal I will introduce today, the emergency leave \ntransfer program would extend to employees who do not face a medical \nemergency but need extra leave because of other effects of disasters or \nemergencies, such as a flood that has destroyed an employee's home or \nan earthquake has affected their lifestyle.\n  It would allow an agency-approved recipient to use donated leave \nwithout having to first exhaust their own leave. It would allow \nemployees in any executive agency to donate leave for transfer \n[[Page S7618]] to affected employees in the same or in other agencies. \nIt would allow current agency leave banks to donate leave to emergency \nleave transfer programs. OPM would have the authority to establish \nappropriate operating requirements for the emergency leave transfer \nprogram, including program limits on the amount of leave that could be \ndonated and used under this program.\n  I want to emphasize that this leave transfer will permit employees to \nhelp other employees at no cost to the taxpayer, other than incidental \nadministrative costs, because there is no additional leave provided \nunder this program to any employee beyond that which is already \ncredited to an employee which has been earned by that employee.\n  I think the aftermath of the Oklahoma disaster showed an overwhelming \ninterest in employees being able to do something to assist fellow \nemployees who are affected by a major disaster or emergency.\n  I commend OPM for thinking of this concept, and I am pleased to \nintroduce at their request this bill to provide authority for leave \ntransfer for Federal employees who are adversely affected by disasters \nor emergencies.\n  I thank my good friend from Utah for permitting me to take this time \nat this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Rocord, as follow:\n\n                                 S. 868\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Federal Employees Emergency Leave \n     Transfer Act of 1995''.\n       Sec. 2.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require a \nrefund value for certain beverage containers, and to provide resources \nfor State pollution prevention and recycling programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             the interstate waste act amendment act of 1995\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, during the Senate consideration \nof the interstate waste bill, I reminded my colleagues that 10 States \nhave achieved great success in dealing with solid waste by implementing \nsome form of beverage container deposit system. My home State of \nOregon, for example, has had remarkable success with its own bottle \nbill for over 20 years. Consequently, I offered the National Beverage \nContainer Reuse and Recycling Act as an amendment to that legislation.\n  My amendment was ultimately withdrawn, but not before the chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, agreed to \nhold a hearing in his committee on this issue during the 104th \nCongress. I am enthused by this opportunity for the bottle bill and am \nformally introducing this legislation today. Although it will be \nreferred to the Commerce Committee because of precedent, the \nEnvironment Committee is also an appropriate forum to consider reducing \nour solid waste stream. The National Beverage Container Reuse and \nRecycling Act of 1995 is identical to the bill I introduced in the 103d \nCongress.\n  As someone who grew up during the Great Depression, I am constantly \nreminded of the throw-away ethic that has emerged so prominently in \nthis country. In this regard, Oregon's deposit system serves as a much \ngreater role than merely cleaning up littered highways, saving energy \nand resources or reducing the waste following into our teeming \nlandfills. The bottle bill acts as a tutor. It is a constant reminder \nof the conservation ethic that is an essential component of any plan to \nsee this country out of its various crises. Each time a consumer \nreturns a can for deposit, the conservation ethic is reaffirmed, and \nhopefully the consumer will then reapply this ethic in other areas.\n  This legislation will accomplish national objectives to meet our \nNation's massive waste management difficulties. A national deposit \nsystem will reduce solid waste and litter, save natural resources and \nenergy, and create a much needed partnership between consumers, \nindustry, and local governments for the betterment of our communities.\n  So often, States serve as laboratories for what later emerges as \nsuccessful national policies. The State of Oregon and other bottle bill \nStates have proven that deposit programs are an effective method to \ndeal with beverage containers, which make up the single largest \ncomponent of waste systems. According to the General Accounting Office \ndeposit law States, which account for only 18 percent of the \npopulation, recycle 65 percent of all glass and 98 percent of all PET \nplastic nationwide. That means\n 82 percent of the population is recycling less than 25 percent of our \nnation's beverage container waste.\n\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have a 20 year history on this issue \nand have been greatly enthused by developments in recent years in \npromoting the establishment of a national bottle bill. The commitment I \nreceived earlier this year for a hearing in the Environment \n[[Page S7619]] and Public Works Committee is greatly encouraging. \nAlthough this bill has historically been referred to the Senate \nCommerce Committee, in recent years significant actions on this measure \nhave come in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  Senator Jeffords offered the bill as an amendment to the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act [RCRA] in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee during the 102d Congress. Even though this attempt \nfailed by a vote of 6 to 10 it was a monumental step forward. \nAdditionally, during the same Congress a hearing was held in the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee on the energy conservation \nimplications of beverage container recycling as outlined in that \nsession's bottle bill, S. 2335.\n  I regret that I frequently have come to the Senate floor to force the \nSenate to take action on this matter, but that seems to be the only \neffective procedure for moving forward on this bill. For example, \nduring the 1992 Presidential campaign candidate Bill Clinton declared \nhis support for a national bottle bill. However, once he took office he \nand the Congress were surprisingly silent on the issue. Consequently, I \nwas forced to offer the Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act as \nan amendment on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, It is widely acknowledged that recycling is the wave \nof the future and this legislation will facilitate the recycling of \nbeverage containers. I firmly believe the time has come for Congress to \nfollow the wise lead of these States and encourage deposit systems on a \nnational level. I strongly urge my colleagues to fully examine the \nbenefits of a national beverage container deposit system and to support \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters of support for the \nbottle bill amendment to the Interstate Waste bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Container Recycling Institute,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 1995.\n     Senator Mark Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield, The Container Recycling Institute \n     salutes you for your unyielding support for a national \n     deposit system for the collection of used beverage \n     containers. With return rates of over 85 percent, the ten \n     states which require deposits on beverage containers are \n     doing the ``lion's share'' of the nation's recycling. It is \n     the most effective recycling and litter reduction system on \n     the books today. Residents of bottle bill states enjoy \n     streets, beaches, parks and playgrounds that are virtually \n     free of beverage container litter.\n       One-way beverage containers are the epitome of the throw-\n     away society. Every year, over 30 billion beverage containers \n     are either burned or landfilled in the Unites States. This \n     senseless waste represents more than unwisely used landfill \n     space, but also a squandering of the world's natural \n     resources. A recent draft study of deposit laws by the Tellus \n     Institute found that a national bottle bill would save $1.60 \n     cents per person per year in avoided manufacturing emissions \n     from beverage container production. The same study found that \n     we would save $2.78 person per year from avoided litter pick \n     up costs.\n       Deposit laws shift a major portion of the burden of \n     recycling and litter pick up from state and local governments \n     onto those who produce, sell and consume the product. In \n     other words, the ``polluter pays''. For too long, the general \n     population has been forced to pay for the social consequences \n     of throwaway packaging. The unclaimed deposits, estimated to \n     be about $1.7 billion per year, would be used by the states \n     to help fund other recycling programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Sheila Cogan,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     May 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I strongly endorse the National \n     Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 1995. The ten \n     states that have passed container deposit legislation have \n     demonstrated that this system is an effective litter and \n     solid waste reduction mechanism. It has been successfully \n     implemented in both rural and industrial states, providing a \n     convenient recycling opportunity for practically everyone in \n     the states that have passed it.\n       Several reputable studies have shown that deposit systems \n     are fully compatible with curbside recycling programs. In \n     fact, statistics show that more than half of all the people \n     served by curbside recycling in the U.S. live in states that \n     have deposit/redemption systems. With recent reports showing \n     that municipal solid waste generation in on the rise, we need \n     as many recycling tools as possible to ensure that we meet \n     our recycling targets.\n       With recycling markets showing unprecedented strength, a \n     national bottle bill will just barely satisfy the markets \n     voracious appetite for recovered PET soft drink bottles. \n     Carpets, shoes, containers, and recyclers are in danger of \n     going out of business if they don't find more supplies of \n     recyclable materials.\n       So, in the interest of creating jobs, diverting millions of \n     tons of solid waste and virtually ridding the landscape of \n     littered beverage containers, I wholeheartedly lend my \n     support to the Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of \n     1995.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                                  Tina Hobson,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Renew America.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                           Resource Recycling,\n\n                                       Portland, OR, May 12, 1995.\n     Senator Mark Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: As technical editor of Resource \n     Recycling, the nation's most widely distributed magazine \n     dedicated to recycling issues, I endorse the National \n     Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 1995.\n       Deposit laws have an impressive track record, both \n     internationally and in the U.S. Sweden's recycling rate for \n     aluminum cans of 90 percent in 1994, the highest in the \n     world, is due to that country's deposit on cans. The ten \n     states that have passed container deposit legislation, \n     including our home state of Oregon, have demonstrated that \n     this system is an effective litter and solid waste reduction \n     mechanism. California recently reported a 75 percent decrease \n     in beverage container litter since 1986. Deposit laws have \n     been successfully implemented in both rural and industrial \n     states, providing a convenient recycling opportunity for \n     practically everyone in the states that have passed it. I can \n     say with confidence that the recycling movement would not be \n     as healthy as it is today were it not for the consistent high \n     return rates of the deposit law states.\n       Several reputable studies have shown that deposit systems \n     are fully compatible with curbside recycling programs. In \n     fact, statistics show that over half of all people served by \n     curbside recycling collection in the U.S. today, live in \n     states that have deposit or redemption systems. With recent \n     reports showing that municipal solid waste generation is on \n     the rise, we need as many recycling tools as possible to \n     ensure that we meet our recycling targets.\n       With recycling markets showing unprecedented strength, a \n     national bottle bill will just barely satisfy the market's \n     voracious appetite for recovered PET soft drink bottles. \n     Carpets, containers and textiles are some of the uses for \n     recovered soft drink bottles, and plastic reclaimers are in \n     danger of going out of business for lack of supplies of \n     recyclable materials.\n       So, in the interest of creating jobs, diverting millions of \n     tons of solid waste into high quality feedstocks for our \n     factories and ridding the landscape of littered beverage \n     containers, I would enthusiastically support the National \n     Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 1995.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Steve Apotheker,\n     Technical Editor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Poly-Anna Plastic\n\n\n                                               Products, Inc.,\n\n                                      Milwaukee, WI, May 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: My hope is that this letter reaches you while \n     there is still a live amendment on the floor for a National \n     Container Deposit (A.K.A. ``Bottle Bill.'') As a recycler, I \n     promise you that nothing brings in the bottles and cans as a \n     deposit does and never has a market gone begging for that \n     material more than it does today. If a deposit law is written \n     to overcome the problems that were evident in the first group \n     of state bills now in force, we could solve many of the \n     recycling, solid waste, litter and financial problems in one \n     fell swoop. The solution is to have the system based on the \n     California redemption system now in place with some \n     improvements. The key is to let redemption take place at \n     recycling centers that desire it and not in the grocery store \n     that hates it. The second target is to allow the approximate \n     1.6 Billion dollars in unredeemed deposits (estimate based on \n     national ten cent deposit) to go directly to the cities \n     responsible for administering recycling programs. This money, \n     plus the cans and jugs that they too could redeem for full \n     deposit from the waste stream would solve problem for cities \n     such as DC where programs have just recently been shut down.\n       I am a board member of the National Recycling Coalition and \n     have authored a position statement on such a bill that will \n     be debated this Friday afternoon in Alexandria at the NRC's \n     spring board meeting. I have studied the issue quite in \n     detail and would be happy to answer any questions you may \n     have either here from my office or while in the DC area this \n     Friday and Saturday at the Holiday Inn Old Town. This is a \n     chance for a great victory for recycling and our environment. \n     I hope you can get behind it. [[Page S7620]] \n       Thank you.\n                                                     Marty Forman,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Northeastern Connecticut Regional Resource Recovery \n           Authority,\n                                       Dayville, CT, May 12, 1995.\n     Senator Mark Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I wish to lend my support for the \n     National Beverage Container Recycling Act. As a regional \n     recycling coordinator in one of the nation's few bottle bill \n     states I can unquivocally say that deposit legislation has \n     greatly aided our recycling efforts. As a professional in the \n     field of solid waste management the benefits of the National \n     Beverage Container Recycling Act are many and clear:\n       Bottle Bills effect a far greater recovery rate for \n     beverage containers than curbside recycling programs.\n       Bottle Bills dramatically reduce beverage container litter, \n     including broken glass.\n       Deposit legislation results in a much higher grade of \n     scrap.\n       By effectively capturing PET plastic recyclers are not \n     faced with including light weight material at curbside.\n       Beverage containers have unique properties; they are one-\n     use containers often consumed away from home (and recycling \n     programs). For much of the rural U.S, expansive and expensive \n     curbside recycling are not practical. Bottle bills help \n     address this fact.\n       Refillable containers, once the mainstay of the beverage \n     industry, are really only viable with deposits that ensure \n     the containers are returned for refilling.\n                                                  Winston Averill,\n\n                           Regional Recycling Coordinator.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSTON (for himself and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 871. A bill to provide for the management and disposition of the \nHanford Reservation, to provide for environmental management activities \nat the reservation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    THE HANFORD LAND MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, earlier this spring the \nDepartment of Energy released a report on the estimated cost of \ncleaning up the Department's nuclear weapons complex. The report \nprovides the first realistic assessment of the cost of the cleanup \nprogram since it began in 1989.\n  The results of this assessment are sobering. The Department concluded \nthat it would cost anywhere between $175 billion and half a trillion \ndollars to clean up these sites, depending on the baseline case would \ncost $230 billion over the next 75 years.\n  Even these figures exclude the cost of cleaning up problems for which \nno feasible cleanup technology exists, the $23 billion we have already \nspent, and the $50 to $75 million per year we will spend monitoring and \nmaintaining them after 2070.\n  The Department's report follows on the heels of the Blush report on \nthe Department of Energy's efforts to cleanup the Hanford Reservation. \nLast fall, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources commissioned \nSteve Blush, a former director of the Department of Energy's nuclear \nsafety office, to evaluate the Hanford cleanup.\n  The committee asked Mr. Blush to focus on Hanford because it is the \nlargest of the Department's weapons sites and it poses some of the most \nintractable cleanup problems. Hanford now receives about one quarter of \nthe $6 billion we spend on this program each year. We have already \nspent $7.5 billion on the Hanford cleanup and are currently spending \n$1.5 billion per year.\n  Mr. Blush found that the Hanford cleanup is ``floundering in a legal \nand regulatory morass.'' His report describes regulatory requirements \nthat are:\n\n     unworkable, disjunctive, lack scientific and technical merit, \n     undermine any sense of accountability for taxpayer dollars, \n     and most importantly, are having an overall negative effect \n     on worker and public health and safety.\n\n  The Blush report gives no aid or comfort to those who think all our \nproblems can be solved by abolishing the Department of Energy. The \nreport makes it clear that the responsibility for creating and \nperpetuating this unworkable system lies with us, the Congress.\n  We have given the Department of Energy an impossible task. We have \ntold it to meet standards that cannot be attained, to use technologies \nthat do not exist, to meet deadlines that cannot be achieved, to employ \nworkers that are not needed, and to do it all with less money than it \nrequested. To make matters worse, the law now provides for criminal \npenalties, including jail time, for senior Department officials if they \nfail to do the impossible.\n  Mr. President, the Hanford cleanup cannot continue on its present \ncourse. The administration has already proposed a $4.4 billion \nreduction in the overall cleanup program over the next 5 years, over a \nbillion of which is likely to come out of the Hanford cleanup. Lower \nfunding will result in deadlines being missed, which will result in the \nDepartment being fined. Fines will have to be paid out of cleanup \nfunds, which will result in more deadlines being missed and more fines \nbeing levied. Moreover, senior officials will be forced to leave their \nposts rather than face criminal sanctions.\n  If the cleanup program is not reformed, it will, in time, collapse of \nits own weight to the detriment of all concerned. The only question is \nhow much money will have been wasted before that happens.\n  The problems besetting the Hanford cleanup cannot be fixed by the \nDepartment itself or by Congress through the appropriations process. \nThe Blush report makes clear that ``Congress must fundamentally change \nthe underlying legal and regulatory framework.* * *'' What is needed is \n``legislation that redefines the regulatory framework and establishes \nfiscal responsibility, a more realistic timeframe, better standards, \nand a more clearly defined mission for the cleanup.''\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, Senator Murkowski and I are today \nintroducing a bill to establish a comprehensive program to clean up the \nHanford site. The bill requires the Department of Energy to prepare a \ncomprehensive environmental management plan for Hanford. The plan is to \ninclude a future land-use plan for the 560-square-mile site, an \nassessment of the risks posed by conditions at the site, and new \nprograms for managing radioactive and hazardous substances and cleaning \nup environmental contamination at the site.\n  While the reforms made by this bill are necessary, they are not \nsufficient. Additional legislation will be needed to address conflicts \nbetween the new cleanup requirements and the existing jumble of \nenvironmental laws, regulations, and agreements that now govern \nHanford. In addition, legislation is urgently needed to fix the problem \nof fines and criminal liability. Senator Murkowski and I will also \noffer an amendment to the bill to address those matters.\n  The bill we are introducing today focuses solely on Hanford. That was \nthe site the Blush report examined and, therefore, the site we know \nmost about. Many of the problems at Hanford are systemic to the entire \nweapons complex. Many of the reforms we are proposing for Hanford can, \nand probably should be, extended to other sites. My hope is that \nHanford might serve as a pilot for the rest of the complex.\n  Rumors about this bill have already excited considerable fear, \nconsternation, and resentment in the Hanford community. Some of the \nconditions at Hanford pose serious health and safety risks that the \npublic has every right to have remedied. In addition, the cleanup \nprogram is extremely important to the area's economy. A local paper has \ndescribed the cleanup as bringing a ``river of money'' into the \ncommunity. Understandably, residents do not want to see the flow \ndiminished.\n  I want to assure the people of the Northwest and their able \nrepresentatives in this body that my purpose in offering this bill is \nto create a program that works, that is sustainable within the \nDepartment of Energy's shrinking budget, that adequately protects the \npublic health and safety and the environment, and that is \nscientifically sound and achievable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n               Summary of the Hanford Land Management Act\n\n     Sec. 1. Short title\n       Self-explanatory.\n     Sec. 2. Definitions\n       Self-explanatory.\n     Sec. 3. Environmental management plan\n       Directs the Secretary of Energy to prepare a comprehensive \n     plan governing environmental management activities at \n     Hanford. [[Page S7621]] Environmental management activities \n     include both the management (i.e., treatment, storage, and \n     disposal) of hazardous substances and radioactive materials \n     and environmental cleanup activities. The plan is to include \n     a future land use plan for the site, an assessment of the \n     risks at the site, and programs both for managing hazardous \n     substances and radioactive materials and for cleaning up the \n     site.\n     Sec. 4. Land use\n       Requires the Secretary to prepare a comprehensive land use \n     plan for Hanford as part of the environmental management \n     plan. The Secretary is to designate future uses for parcels \n     within the Hanford Reservation after consideration of risks \n     to the public and cleanup workers; the technical feasibility \n     and cost of cleaning up the site for other uses; the \n     importance of the site for other purposes; the views of the \n     Department of the Interior, the Governor of Washington, \n     affected communities, and Indian tribes; and the availability \n     of federal funds.\n       Implementation of the Secretary's recommendations to \n     release parcels from federal ownership will require \n     subsequent legislation.\n     Sec. 5. Risk assessment\n       Requires the Secretary to conduct a comprehensive risk \n     assessment of all major activities, substances, and \n     conditions at Hanford that pose a risk to human health, \n     safety, or the environment. The risk assessment protocol is \n     based upon S. 333, the Risk Management Act of 1995, reported \n     from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n     Sec. 6. Materials and waste management\n       Directs the Secretary to set new standards for the \n     treatment storage, and disposal of hazardous waste and \n     radioactive materials at Hanford. The standards must provide \n     adequate protection to the health and safety of the public \n     and accord with the common defense and security (i.e., the \n     standard applied to civilian nuclear power plants licensed by \n     the Nuclear Regulatory Commission).\n       In setting these standards, the Secretary must consider \n     reasonably anticipated future land uses, the views of the \n     affected communities and Indian tribes, the availability of \n     cost-effective technology, the risk assessment conducted \n     under section 5, comparable federal and state standards, and \n     the recommendations of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety \n     Board.\n       In addition to the standards, the environmental management \n     plan must include an inventory of hazardous substances and \n     radioactive materials at Hanford and designate the method \n     chosen to manage such substance or material.\n       In selecting management options, the Secretary must \n     consider risk to the public and workers, cost, the \n     possibility of interim storage pending radioactive decay or \n     technological development, and the views of federal and state \n     regulators and the affected communities and Indian tribes.\n     Sec. 7. Site restoration\n       Directs the Secretary to set new standards for cleaning up \n     the site. The standards must provide adequate protection to \n     the health and safety of the public and accord with the \n     common defense and security (i.e., the standards applied to \n     civilian nuclear power plants licensed by the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission).\n       In setting these standards, the Secretary must consider \n     reasonably anticipated future land uses, the views of the \n     affected communities and Indian tribes, the availability of \n     cost-effective technology, the risk assessment conducted \n     under section 5, comparable federal and state standards, and \n     the recommendations of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety \n     Board.\n       In addition to the standards, the environmental management \n     plan must designate the remedial actions chosen to clean up \n     the site.\n       In selecting remedial actions, the Secretary must consider \n     the effectiveness of the remedy, risk to the public and \n     workers, cost, and the views of the affected communities and \n     Indian tribes (i.e., the factors proposed by the \n     Administration in its Superfund reform bill in 1994). The \n     Secretary must also consider the possibility of interim \n     containment pending radioactive decay and technological \n     development.\n     Sec. 8. Workforce restructuring\n       Requires the Secretary to reduce the number of employees at \n     Hanford to the number needed to accomplish authorized \n     activities.\n     Sec. 9. Authorization of appropriations\n       Authorizes appropriation of such sums as may be necessary \n     for environmental management activities at Hanford.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 872. A bill to provide for the establishment of a modernized and \nsimplified health information network for Medicare and Medicaid, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the health information modernization and security act\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an old friend--the \nHealth Information Modernization and Security Act. In past years, I had \nworked with Senator Riegle in developing this legislation. I am now \nvery pleased that Senator Lieberman has been working with me to present \nthis legislation for this Congress. Also, as in past years, we are very \nfortunate to have the bipartisan support of Congressmen Hobson and \nSawyer from Ohio who will introduce this bill in the other Chamber.\n  Our health care system today needlessly wastes billions of dollars on \nred tape and paperwork. This administrative waste effectively adds a \n10-percent surcharge to every health insurance and health bill in the \ncountry. In a world that is increasingly automated and computerized, \nhealth professionals must still largely rely on an antiquated and \ninefficient paper-based system to file claims with insurers and \ncoordinate benefits.\n  The bill that I am introducing today is the latest in a project that \nbegan 3 years ago with the introduction of the Health Insurance \nSimplification and Portability Act. That legislation has evolved \nconsiderably since then and we have sought the input of hundreds of \nexperts from across the Nation. Last year during the health care reform \ndebate, this effort received broad bipartisan support and was included \nin nearly every major health care reform bill.\n  The first and most obvious question is: Why is Federal legislation \nneeded? The answer to that question goes back to 1991 when the \nWorkgroup for Electronic Data Interchange, or WEDI as it is now called, \nwas formed by then Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis \nSullivan. WEDI was formed to respond to the challenge of reducing \nadministrative costs in the Nation's health care system. WEDI is made \nup of health insurers, hospital officials, physicians, dentists, \nnurses, pharmacists, privacy experts, businesses, and technology \nexperts. WEDI has strongly recommended that the Federal Government \nadopt standards for the electronic data interchange of financial and \nadministrative information to ensure uniformity across State lines.\n  There is a blizzard of paperwork that is a nightmare for patients, \nhospitals, doctors and businesses in this country. Everyone agrees that \na solution must be found that reduces these costs and the burden they \nare placing on our health care system and the ability of people to \nafford it. A study conducted by Lewin-VHI estimated that administrative \ncosts add $135 billion in health costs in the United States. These \ncosts are escalated by the unwieldy inefficient paperwork-blizzard \nbilling system that has evolved in this country.\n  In other sectors where accurate and timely information is key to \nproduction, the investment has been made in information systems. There \nare good explanations for why health care has been slow to invest in \ninformation systems. There are barriers such as so-called quill pen \nlaws that require information to be sent and kept on paper. There is a \nlack of standards for the data and there is a lack of discipline on the \npart of insurers to agree unanimously to a common set of data to use \nfor billing purposes. These are just a couple of examples of the \nbarriers to overcome.\n  In March 1992, I introduced, along with Senator Riegle, the Health \nInsurance Simplification and Portability Act. The main purpose of that \nbill was to reduce administrative costs and protect consumers from \ninsurance rip-offs. I am proud to say that it was one of the few \nbipartisan health bills that were introduced during that Congress. \nLater in 1992, I introduced the Medical and Health Insurance \nInformation Reform Act which was the Bush administration's proposal for \nbringing administrative costs under control.\n  My goal has been to draft legislation to propose what the experts are \nsaying must be done to reduce administrative costs. The steps they \nrecommend would facilitate the development of a viable market in this \narea and lead to the eventual implementation of electronic solutions to \nmany information problems that exist in health care today.\n  In determining the proper Federal role, the experts have been telling \nus is that first they don't want Government to be part of the problem. \nThat should be obvious, but as we all know it many times is easier said \nthan done.\n  Second, they want the Government to adopt a set of standards and \nconventions for electronic data interchange for financial and \nadministrative transactions in the health care system. In adopting \nthese standards, the Government should recognize the value of standards \nthat have already been [[Page S7622]] adopted or are in development and \nnot try to reinvent the wheel. Where standards already exist, those are \nthe standards that should be adopted.\n  And lastly, but most importantly, legislation is needed to protect \nthe privacy and confidentiality of patient data. The importance of this \neffort must be underscored. We must ensure that access to data that \nincludes patient identifiers is secure.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary would adopt national standards \nfor electronic health claims and other financial and administrative \ntransactions. The standards that would be adopted by the Secretary \nwould be those that have been developed by private standards-setting \norganizations that seek broad consensus and input to their standards. \nIf the Secretary determines, however, that the standards that have been \ndeveloped by these standard-setting organizations are not practical and \nwould lead to substantially greater administrative costs compared to \nother alternatives, then the Secretary could adopt other standards that \nare in use and generally accepted.\n  Two years after these national standards for electronic transactions \nare adopted, all health care plans including Medicare and Medicaid \nwould be required to accept health claims electronically or perform any \nof the standardized transactions electronically with any doctor, \npharmacist, dentist, hospital, or any health provider that wants to \ntake advantage of the new electronic standards. Smaller health plans \nwould be given an additional year, for a total of three years, to \naccept the electronic transactions.\n  Putting this system of standards in place means that all health \nproviders would be able to send their insurance claims electronically \nto the universe of payors using the same formats and data. These \nstandards would create an electronic universal claims form. It further \nmeans that payors would be able to perform coordination of benefits \nactivities electronically with all other payors. This will help crack \ndown on fraud and dramatically reduce the number of improperly paid \nclaims. This will save consumers billions of dollars each year.\n  Having a system with these national standards in place will also mean \nthat providers will no longer be forced to wade through the multiple \nforms and formats and requests for additional data for billing in order \nto get reimbursed for their services. In addition, health plans would \nreap large savings from the increased number of claims they would \nreceive electronically. When insurers accept claims on paper an \nexpensive data entry system is in place today to computerize the data \nfrom the paper claim.\n  This bill would also repeal the controversial Medicare and Medicaid \nDatabank. This databank was created in OBRA 93 to collect data at the \nHealth Care Financing Administration to identify cases in which claims \nwere improperly paid by Medicare when they should have been paid by a \nprivate insurer. By law, when a Medicare beneficiary has private \ninsurance, the private insurance plan is the primary payor. The \ndatabank had proved to be unworkable, but the need still exists. \nMedicare loses billions of dollars each year by paying claims \nimproperly.\n  In estimating the amount of savings that would result from this \neffort, the workgroup for electronic data interchange [WEDI] conducted \nan extense study and analysis of data to determine the costs of \nimplementation and the net savings possible from moving to electronic \ndata interchange of health data. Using the WEDI data, it is estimated \nthat the changes that would result from this bill would produce a net \nsavings of over $29 billion over a 5-year period to health plans, and \nproviders.\n  In closing, the Government should play only the minimal role needed \nto help the market work. Government should not design the solution. If \nthe Government tried to design the solution we would end up with \nanother set of multimillion dollar DOD toilet seats and we would not \nsolve the problems that exist.\n  In the past I have been told to wait for passage of a comprehensive \nhealth care plan to enact this legislation into law. I have agreed with \nthat strategy in the past, but it did not happen and the legislation \nhas died in two previous Congresses. Had we gone ahead in 1992, this \nsystem would be in place today. I do still want to see comprehensive \nhealth care reform and will await action by Congress to take that \nimportant step. I believe this legislation will and should be included \nin comprehensive reform of the health care system. However, I will ask \nthe committee of jurisdiction and the majority leader to move this \nlegislation as a free standing bill.\n  This health care information system will lower administrative costs, \nimprove the quality of care and help us to learn what works and what \ndoes not work in health care. This system will provide innumerable \nbenefits to our health care system and to the patients who rely on it.\n  I still agree that we need comprehensive health care reform. I want \nto see that done. I want this bill to be considered. I believe it will \nbe included in most of the major reform packages coming forward. But I \nbelieve that, if no comprehensive legislation passes, we can pass this \nbill.\n  If we had gone ahead and passed it in 1992, the 2 or 3 years needed \nto get the system up and running would have been accomplished and we \ncould have that process in place now.\n  If it appears that we will not have comprehensive health legislation \nI will ask the committee of jurisdiction and the majority leader to \nmove this legislation as a freestanding bill. It will lower \nadministrative costs, improve the quality of health care, and help us \nlearn what works and what does not work.\n  I welcome inquiries of my colleagues. We solicit support. Senator \nLieberman and I would be delighted to have other colleagues join with \nus in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n    Summary of the Health Information Modernization and Security Act\n\n\n                title i--purpose and repeal of databank\n\n       Purpose: the purpose is to improve the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs and the efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     health care system by encouraging the development of a health \n     information network through the establishment of standards \n     and requirements for electronic transmission of certain \n     health information.\n       Repeal of databank: Repeals the Medicare and Medicaid \n     Coverage Databank established in OBRA 93 when the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services provides written notice to \n     Congress that the Medicare and Medicaid Coverage Data Bank is \n     no longer necessary because of the operation of the health \n     information network established pursuant to this Act.\n\n\n                title ii--administrative simplification\n\n       Adoption of electronic transaction standards: The Secretary \n     adopts standards so that certain common health care \n     administrative transactions may be conducted electronically \n     to reduce the costs of paying and providing health care. \n     These transactions include claims, coordination of benefits, \n     claims attachments, enrollment and disenrollment, \n     eligibility, payment and remittance advice, premium payments, \n     first report of injury, claims status, and referral \n     certification and authorization of services. These standards \n     must be those that have been developed by a private standards \n     setting organization such as the American National Standards \n     Institute.\n       The Secretary may adopt additional standards if the \n     Secretary determines that the standards developed by private \n     standards setting organizations are impractical and more \n     costly to implement than a standard that is in use and \n     generally accepted. The Secretary is required to publish in \n     the Federal Register the analysis upon which such a \n     determination is made.\n       The Secretary may adopt different standards for data \n     elements than those developed by a standards setting \n     organization through the use of negotiated rulemaking if a \n     different standard would substantially reduce administrative \n     costs.\n       The Secretary also adopts standards for unique health \n     identifiers, code sets, electronic signatures and \n     coordination of benefits.\n       Security standards: The Secretary is required to adopt \n     security standards to protect the confidentiality of health \n     information, to protect against threats or hazards to the \n     security or integrity of the information, and to protect \n     against unauthorized uses or disclosures of health \n     information.\n       Privacy standards: The Secreatry is required to adopt \n     privacy standards including the rights of individuals with \n     respect to their health information and the procedures for \n     exercising these rights. Privacy standards shall also include \n     standards describing the uses and disclosures which are \n     authorized, and the security of such information.\n       Health information advisory committee: The Secretary must \n     consult with other appropriate federal agencies in carrying \n     out these duties and must rely on recommendations from the \n     Health Information Advisory [[Page S7623]] Committee. The \n     Secretary is required to publish in the Federal Register the \n     recommendations of the advisory committee regarding adoption \n     of standards.\n       Timetables for adoption of standards: Initial standards are \n     to be adopted within 18 months of enactment with the \n     exception of standards for claims attachments which are to be \n     adopted within 30 months. The Secretary reviews and modifies \n     these standards as determined appropriate but not more \n     frequently than every 6 months. These modifications must \n     still be those adopted by a private standards-setting \n     organization or follow the procedures outlined earlier.\n       Requirements for health plans: If anyone desires to conduct \n     any of the standardized financial and administrative \n     transactions with a health plan (which includes government \n     health plans), then the health plan must conduct that \n     standard transaction in a timely manner. A health plan can \n     satisfy this requirement by using a health information \n     network service or ``clearinghouse'' to translate a \n     transaction into the standardized form.\n       Timetables for compliance with requirements: Large health \n     plans, as defined by the Secretary, must comply within 24 \n     months of the adoption of a standard. Small health plans must \n     comply within 36 months. Health plans must comply with \n     modification to standards in a timeframe determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary, but not sooner than 180 days.\n       General penalty for failure to comply with requirements and \n     standards: A penalty of $100 for each violation is imposed. \n     No penalty higher than $25,000 may be imposed during a \n     calendar year for a violation of a specific standard or \n     requirement. Penalties do not apply if it established that \n     the person did not know and would not have known by \n     exercising reasonable diligence. If the failure was due to \n     reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and the failure \n     is corrected within 30 days (or longer as determined by the \n     Secretary), no penalty is applied. A penalty not already \n     waived, may be further reduced if the failure is due to \n     reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and the penalty \n     would be excessive relative to the compliance failure.\n       Criminal penalties for wrongful disclosure of health \n     information: Any person who knowingly (1) uses or causes a \n     unique identifier to be used for a purpose not authorized by \n     the Secretary, (2) obtains individually identifiable health \n     information in violation of the privacy standards or (3) \n     discloses individually identifiable health information to \n     another person in violation of the privacy standards shall \n     (1) be fined up to $50,000, imprisoned for up to a year, or \n     both, (2) if the offense is committed under false pretenses, \n     fined up to $100,000, imprisoned for up to 5 years, or both; \n     and (3) if the offense is committed with intent to sell \n     transfer, or use individually identifiable health information \n     for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm, \n     fined up to $250,000, imprisoned for up to 10 years, or both.\n       Effect on State law: Provisions, requirements and standards \n     under this Act supersede contrary provisions of State law \n     including laws that require medical plan records or billing \n     information to be maintained in written rather than \n     electronic form (so-called ``quill pen'' laws) and provisions \n     which are more stringent than the requirements or standards \n     under the Act. Exceptions: (1) state laws which establish \n     more stringent requirements or standards with respect to \n     privacy of individually identifiable health information (2) \n     state laws which require health providers to transmit \n     financial and administrative health transactions \n     electronically, (3) state laws which provide for the \n     coordination of health benefits which are in effect on the \n     date of enactment, (4) state laws that the Secretary \n     determines are necessary to prevent fraud and abuse. Nothing \n     in this Act preempts or invalidates any state or federal laws \n     for public health reporting of certain health data.\n       Health information advisory committee: Establishes a Health \n     Information Advisory Committee of 15 members; 3 appointed by \n     the President, 6 appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives after consultation with the Minority Leader, \n     and 6 appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     after consultation with the Minority Leader of the Senate.\n       Standards for patient medical record information: Not \n     earlier than 4 years, but sooner than 6 years after \n     enactment, the Secretary is required to recommend to Congress \n     a plan for developing and implementing uniform data standards \n     for patient medical record information and the electronic \n     exchange of such information.\n       Grants for demonstration projects: The Secretary is \n     authorized to make grants for demonstration projects to \n     promote the development and use of electronically integrated \n     clinical information systems and computerized patient medical \n     records.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Bond in \nintroducing the Health Information Modernization and Security Act. The \nbill will reduce the cost and paperwork associated with processing \nhealth care transactions by speeding the transition from a paper-based \nsystem to a system where claims are processed electronically. We worked \ntogether on similar legislation in the last Congress in the context of \ncomprehensive health care reform. I thank Senator Bond for his \nleadership on the bill.\n  Mr. President, virtually everyone agrees that simplifying the \nadministrative processes in our health care system will have important \nbenefits. Administrative overhead costs can be cut dramatically by \nstandardizing claims forms and converting as many paper claims as \npossible to electronic transactions. In a hearing I chaired last year \nbefore the Regulation and Government Information Subcommittee of the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, Linda Ryan, director of the New York \nState demonstration project, testified that participating hospitals in \nNew York were saving over $8 a claim by filing electronically.\n  Even more money could be saved by improving the so-called \ncoordination of benefits process whereby insurers determined who should \npay first, and who should cover only the remainder of the bill. This \nprocess could be automated and completed electronically. At times, \nhowever, it is still done with telephone calls. We need to give our \nadministrative systems a dose of high-technology medicine.\n  Reducing paperwork burdens and costs for doctors, hospitals, \ninsurance companies, and patients will free up time and money so that \nmore of our health care resources can go to delivering health care. The \nGovernment will also benefit, particularly from improved coordination \nof benefits. Since Medicare is often the second payer, better \ncoordination of benefits will save the Medicare program--and taxpayers \nthat fund it--millions, perhaps billions, of dollars.\n  Experience counsels caution in building or imposing new information \nrequirements in health care. The legislation we are introducing today \nimposes minimal burdens on the private and public sectors and will \nproduce substantial savings throughout the health care industry. Under \nthe bill, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \nwill develop standards, rules and procedures to facilitate the \nelectronic exchange of data.\n  Health plans will be required to use standard data formats. The \nSecretary will also establish standards to ensure the security and \nprivacy of medical information.\n  The bill establishes a Health Information Advisory Committee to \nprovide private sector input to the Secretary in developing standards \nfor electronic claims submittal. The committee will also study the \nfeasibility of adopting uniform data standards for patient medical \nrecord information, a challenging objective that, if achieved, will \ngreatly reduce paperwork and improve the information available for \nhealth care research. The bill also authorizes the Secretary to provide \ngrants for demonstration projects to promote the development and use of \nelectronically integrated clinical information systems and computerized \npatient medical records.\n  Finally, the bill repeals an ineffective and burdensome law Congress \npassed as part of the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. That bill \nestablished the Medicare data bank to improve coordination of benefits. \nThe law requires employers to annually provide to the Federal \nGovernment the names, social security numbers, and dates of coverage \nfor all employees, spouses and dependents receiving health coverage. \nLast year in a Government Affairs Committee hearing the General \nAccounting Office testified that the Medicare data bank will not even \nadd significantly to Medicare or Medicaid's ability to collect mistaken \npayments. The bill we are introducing today will improve Medicare \ncoordination of benefits without imposing an unnecessary burden on \nemployers.\n  Mr. President, health care information processing is, to be frank, a \ndry and complicated subject. But by addressing this ``below the \nhorizon'' issue we can significantly reduce the cost of our health care \nsystem and improve its effectiveness. I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Bond and I in our effort to do just that by supporting the \nHealth Information Modernization and Security Act.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, may I take this opportunity to commend \nthe senior Senator from the State of Missouri for his persistence on a \nmost important matter as it relates to health care of Americans. I know \nhis diligence in this area has resulted from [[Page S7624]] a long time \nof study and an understanding of medical recordkeeping. I am pleased to \nhave the opportunity to commend him and to thank him for his \nperformance in this respect.\n\n\n                    THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MARK HAYES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, because of the limitations of time during \nmorning business, I gave only a summary of the statement I had on the \nHealth Information Modernization and Security Act.\n  There is another very important part of it that I would like to have \nadded to that record. The fact that this measure has been worked on for \nat least 3, and perhaps 4\\1/2\\ or five years by Mark Hayes, a very \ncapable member of my staff.\n  Mark has worked tirelessly contacting all of the interested parties \nworking with governmental agencies, private standard setting \norganizations, and people who are concerned about privacy, and all \nother aspects of the measure. It is due in large part to his \ndedication, his skill, and his good humor to put up with all of the \nmany, many different variations and different ideas that we were able \nto produce what I think is a very good measure.\n  I am very pleased with that measure. But I also note that this is the \nlast day that Mr. Hayes will be working with me on the Small Business \nCommittee staff. And I take this opportunity to express to him my \nsincere appreciation for his dedicated efforts.\n  I can say from those who have contacted me who have worked with him \nthat there are many, many people who join with me in expressing \nappreciation for the great leadership that he has shown.\n  We shall miss him in the Federal Government. But I know that he will \ndo well in the private sector, and the work that he has done on the \nHealth Information Modernization and Security Act I think will serve \nthe cause of improving and making more efficient the health care \ndelivery system in the United States.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER:\n  S. 875. A bill to amend section 202 of the Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act of 1949 to exclude certain property in the \nState of South Dakota; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                       land transfer legislation\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to stop \nthe proposed transfer of Federal land in South Dakota to the Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe. The bill is simple: It removes any authority for the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers to transfer lands in South Dakota acquired \nby the U.S. for construction and operation of reservoirs on the \nmainstem of the Missouri River and transfer them pursuant to Public Law \n93-599, or any other law.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  This issue is not new to the Senate and to the people of South \nDakota. In October 1992, Congress passed the Three Affiliated Tribes \nand Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act. This law \ncalled for the transfer of approximately 15,000 acres along Lake Oahe \nand the Missouri River in South Dakota from the corps to the Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe. However, it soon became clear that this proposed \ntransfer was a mistake. The transfer had significant public opposition, \nbeginning with the Governor of South Dakota. It also was learned that \nthe costs to the Federal Government to transfer these lands was \nsignificantly more than the actual value of the land itself.\n  As a result Mr. President, on February 9, 1994, the Senate voted to \nrepeal the proposed land transfer. However, the Senate repeal was \namended by the House and the final version signed into bill contained \nlanguage directing the corps to proceed with the transfer. The House \nlanguage directed the Corps to pursue these land transfers pursuant to \nPublic Law 93-599--a 1975 Federal law that deals with the disposal of \nsurplus government lands.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that the Senate last year \nrejected the land transfer language due to the costs involved. Even \nunder the best scenario, the costs of the transfer was more than double \nthan value of the land. Some costs estimates were more than five times \nthe estimated land value. Hardly a wise use of taxpayers' dollars.\n\n\n            legislation is needed for the transfer of lands\n\n  Mr. President, I have been very hesitant to support Federal land \ntransfers since they were first suggested in 1992. I also am quite \ntroubled with the process being used by the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. The corps appears to be intent in doing all it can to \ntransfer the land, regardless of what is in the best interests of all \nSouth Dakotans. In fact, I believe the corps lacks the statutory \nauthority to transfer the large tract of land near Lake Oahe. This is \nmost troubling since the corps has regulations pending to transfer \nthese lands.\n  As I stated earlier, Public Law 93-599 deals with the disposal of \nexcess government lands. The corps previously conducted an assessment \nof excess lands along Lake Oahe and determined that only 386 acres \ncould be deemed excess. Yet, the corps intends to transfer 15,000 \nacres.\n  Mr. President, when I learned of the proposed transfer in March of \nthis year I wrote to the Secretary of the Army questioning the legal \nauthority of the corps to transfer Federal land beyond what it deemed \nto be excess. I asked the Secretary to provide me with a justification \nof the corps' legal authority to carry out the transfer, prior to the \nissuance of any regulations.\n  I was surprised to learn that the corps issued the land transfer \nregulations on April 10, 1995. It was more than a month after that, on \nMay 17, that I received response to my inquiry to the Secretary of the \nArmy.\n  The response is very troubling. Essentially, the corps' intends to \nredefine the regulations to expand what is deemed excess in order for \nthe corps to carry out the transfer. In short, rather than alter the \ntransfer to make it consistent with the law, the corps intends to twist \nthe law so that it is consistent with the transfer.\n  Mr. President, that is unacceptable. The Army clearly is intent on an \nill-advised and illegal transfer of Federal land. The lands under \nconsideration are neither excess land nor conditionally excess lands \nwithin the meaning of the law as currently defined. Given this fact, \nand the clear will of Congress to restrict the corps' land transfer \nauthority, this land transfer must be decided by legislation--not \nregulation.\n\n\n                        strong public opposition\n\n  Mr. President, plain and simple the proposed land transfer is not in \nthe best interest of South Dakota. As disturbed as I am that the corps \nis acting beyond its legal authority, I am equally astounded that the \ncorps would take this action without hearing from the State of South \nDakota and its citizens. Their concerns must be heard.\n  What are these concerns? First, South Dakotans are concerned about \nfuture access to the land. Sportsmen in the State are concerned that \nhunting and fishing could be restricted. Others are concerned with \npossible restrictions on the use of shorelines for recreational \nactivities, such as swimming, boating and picnicking.\n  Those supporting the transfer state that access will be secured. How \ncan they be so sure? Nothing has been proposed to ensure continued \naccess. The interests of all South Dakotans are not being considered.\n  In addition, the Governor of South Dakota also has serious concerns \nwith the transfer. In fact, both the Governor and attorney general of \nSouth Dakota support the legislation I am introducing today.\n  Wildlife management is a major concern should corps lands be \ntransferred. That is why the South Dakota Wildlife Federation opposed \nthe transfer. As a recent editorial in the Yankton Press and Dakotan \nopposing the transfer said ``* * * the real public concern is the \nenvironment. Environmental management along the Missouri already is \ndamaged by dozens of jurisdictions with different agendas. Imagine the \ndifficulty if the corps needed a few acres back for a bird breeding \nbank.'' The editorial concluded the corps ownership of the land offers \na systems management concept for the river. This would be lost if the \nlands were transferred.\n  In addition, the issue of jurisdiction over land and water in the \naffected areas needs to be addressed. Jurisdiction on power generation \nfacilities must be spelled out.\n\n\n                   DANGEROUS PRECEDENTS ARE BEING SET\n\n  Mr. President, should the proposed regulations be carried out, a \ndangerous precedent clearly would be set that [[Page S7625]] could \nimpact future land transfers. Remember, Congress passed legislation to \ndo the transfer in 1992, and in 1994 passed legislation to restrict the \ntransfer.\n  By permitting this transfer through a clearly unfair regulatory \nprocess, future land transfers could take place throughout the country \nthat are not in the public interest. As a recent editorial in the \nWatertown Public Opinion stated ``The authority for the corps to \ntransfer excess property away from the taxpayers who finance their \nproject is inconceivable, and if allowed to progress will have far-\nreaching ramifications in other states.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent several documents be placed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the central issue here is fairness--fairness for all \nimpacted by land transfers. The issue is about doing the right thing \nfor the State of South Dakota and all its citizens.\n  Do not be misled. The corps' transfer would be precedent setting.\n  Similar transfers could take place that include land that is part of \na county's tax base. Transfer of these lands would remove them from the \ntax base and may cause financial hardships in counties where budgets \nare already stretched to the limit.\n  Mr. President, ultimately what we must put in place is a legislative \nprocess that ensures citizen consultation and input on all transfers of \nFederal land. All citizens--Native American and non-Native American--\nshould have the opportunity to have a fair chance to determine how \npublic land is to be used and administered.\n  Mr. President, while this bill simply addresses the land transfers in \nSouth Dakota along Lake Oahe, I also am preparing legislation to ensure \nthat land currently on a county's tax roll, stays there. Under that \nproposal, the mere purchase of land, whether it be by the Federal \nGovernment, tribe or other entity, should not result in the removal of \nland from the local tax rolls. If it is the Federal government, acting \non behalf of the tribes, or just the tribes itself, it should require \nlegislation passed by Congress to remove the purchased land from the \ncounty tax rolls. Again, the issue is fairness. This is one area that \nneeds to be carefully addressed.\n  Mr. President, I will save those comments for when that bill is \nready. Today I wish to bring the land transfer bill into the public \ndebate. I urge my colleagues to work with me to seek a solution. Today, \nit is Lake Oahe, SD. Tomorrow, it could in Utah, Arizona, California or \nelsewhere. Again, the issue is fairness--a fair process is necessary to \nachieve a fair and just use of the public lands. That is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRANSFER OF EXCESS PROPERTY TO SECRETARY OF THE \n                   INTERIOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF INDIAN TRIBES.\n\n       Section 202(a)(2) of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 483(a)(2)) is \n     amended in the first sentence by striking ``real property \n     located'' and inserting ``real property (not including lands \n     in the State of South Dakota that were acquired by the United \n     States for construction and operation of reservoirs on the \n     main stem of the Missouri River) that is located''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Office of Attorney General,\n\n                                         Pierre, SD, May 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Proposed bill ``To amend Section 202 of the Federal \n         Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to \n         exclude certain property in the State of South Dakota''\n       Dear Senator Pressler: This letter is in relation to the \n     bill which you plan to propose which would have the effect of \n     excluding lands acquired on reservations in South Dakota for \n     the construction and operation of the Missouri River \n     mainstream reservoirs from the operation of 40 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 483(a)(2).\n       I endorse the bill because it would preserve the public use \n     and access of these lands consistent with the ruling of the \n     United States Supreme Court in South Dakota v. Bourland.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                     Mark Barnett,\n     Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Department of the Army\n\n\n                            Office of the Assistant Secretary,\n\n                                      Washington DC, May 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: This replies to your letter to the \n     Secretary of the Army, concerning the proposed rule which \n     would authorize excessing of former trust lands at Lakes \n     Sakakawea and Oahe to the General Services Administration \n     (GSA) for ultimate transfer to the Department of the Interior \n     to be held in trust for the Standing Rock Sioux Trade (SRST) \n     and Three Affiliated Tribes (TAT).\n       Our legal authority for the proposed rule is based on long-\n     standing Federal property law. The Federal Property and \n     Administrative services Act of 1949 (the Act), the law \n     governing all Federal real property transactions, and the \n     Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR), promulgated \n     by the GSA pursuant thereto, authorize transfers of excess \n     real property between Federal agencies.\n       The Act provides that each executive agency shall \n     ``transfer excess property under its control to other Federal \n     agencies.'' (Title 40, U.S. Code, section 483(c)) ``Excess \n     property'' is defined by the Act as ``any property under the \n     control of any Federal agency which is not required for its \n     needs and the discharge of its responsibilities, as \n     determined by the head thereof.'' (Title 40, U.S. Code, \n     section 472(e)).\n       The statute and the guidelines for utilization of excess \n     real property, contained in the FPMR, make it clear that a \n     Federal agency has much discretion in determining whether \n     ``any'' property is ``not required'' for its needs. The \n     guidelines (41 Code of Federal Regulations 101-47.201-2) also \n     make it clear that other interests may be considered in \n     making this determination:\n       ``Each executive agency shall . . . survey real property \n     under its control . . . to identify property which is not \n     needed, underutilized, or not being put to optimum use. When \n     other needs for the property are identified or recognized, \n     the agency shall determine whether continuation of the \n     current use or another Federal or other use would better \n     serve the public interest, considering both the agency's \n     needs and the property's location.''\n       While the corps has promulgated regulations which outline \n     and address corps policy regarding property requirements for \n     civil works projects, it is within the authority of the Chief \n     of Engineers to make exceptions to, waive, or alter those \n     regulations. The proposed rule is such an alteration.\n       This rule, which was published in the Federal Register on \n     April 10, 1995, would expand the corps' policy regarding \n     excess Federal property at two specific Indian reservations. \n     Under the proposed rule, former trust lands at the Corps \n     projects located within the SRST and TAT reservations would \n     be considered potentially excess to project purposes if the \n     legislatively authorized project purposes could be protected \n     through the retention of appropriate interests in the \n     property or the imposition of conditions. The property would \n     be deemed excess only if three conditions were met. First, \n     individuals who have made substantial capital investments on \n     the property through arrangements with the Corps must be able \n     to recover their investments prior to the excessing. Second, \n     there must be no unreasonable impact on access to public and \n     private land. Third, there must be no unreasonable impact on \n     municipal and rural water supply systems.\n       The property that is deemed excess to the corps ultimately \n     would be transferred to the Department of the Interior to be \n     held in trust for the SRST and TAT. Implementation of the \n     proposed rule would allow the corps to maintain such property \n     or interests in property as are required for the operation of \n     the project, while at the same time, allow for other \n     productive and compatible uses of the land by the tribes. The \n     Corps believes that implementation of the proposed rule would \n     provide for the optimum use of Federal property in the public \n     interest.\n       This initiative is consistent with congressional intent \n     expressed in Public Law 103-211. That statute repealed the \n     general land transfer provisions of the Equitable \n     Compensation Act which provided for the return of certain \n     corps project lands to former non-Indian and Indian owners as \n     well as to the tribes. This repeal further provided that the \n     corps should proceed with the Secretary of the Interior to \n     designate excess lands and transfer them ultimately to the \n     Department of Interior to be held in trust for the tribes \n     pursuant to Public law 93-599. Public Law 93-599 is special \n     legislation that recognizes the trust obligations the \n     Department of the Interior has to Indian tribes.\n       In the corps' view, the proviso contained in Public Law \n     103-211 is a clear indication that congress wanted the corps \n     to provide for the transfer of lands at Lakes Sakakawea and \n     Oahe to the tribes to the extent the corps can designate \n     property as being excess to\n      corps needs. The Corps has developed a procedure for \n     identifying excess property and, under the rule, would \n     convey only such lands or interests in lands that are not \n     necessary for the project purposes. The Corps is cognizant \n     of the requirements of the original project authorizing \n     legislation, and I assure you that the Corps will retain \n     sufficient interests in the property or impose such \n     conditions as are necessary to protect all legislatively \n     mandated project purposes, including public access for \n     recreation. [[Page S7626]] \n       Thank you again for your interest in this issue. We trust \n     that this letter addresses your concerns and that it explains \n     why the Corps believes that the proposed rule is consistent \n     with existing law. Their intent is to allow the public 90 \n     days to provide comments, which will be considered carefully \n     before publishing a final rule.

Tom Daschle could \n     threaten public access on portions of the Missouri River, the \n     director of a state sportsmens group said Wednesday.\n       But a Daschle spokesman said the senator is committed to \n     maintaining public access to the river while seeing if some \n     surplus lands can be returned to previous owners, including \n     American Indian and non-Indians. The issue will be discussed \n     today beginning at 11 a.m. at the Wrangler Motel conference \n     room in Mobridge.\n       Roger Pries of Pierre, executive director of the South \n     Dakota Wildlife Federation, is angry over the discussion \n     about returning certain public lands along the northern \n     portion of Lake Oahe to private ownership.\n       ``Something like that would cause a bigger uproar among a \n     lot of sportsmen in South Dakota than trying to give the \n     Black Hills back,'' Pries said. ``Once you give some land \n     back to a few landowners, all the rest are going to want the \n     same thing.''\n       Pries wrote Daschle a letter questioning why he wasn't \n     notified of the Mobridge meeting. He said the proposal \n     ``flies in the face of nearly all South Dakota citizens and \n     sportsmen.''\n       Daschle staff member Eric Washburn said Wednesday that no \n     legislation has been introduced. Daschle is working with \n     federal, tribal, state and local officials as well as \n     landowners and the general public to develop a fair proposal, \n     Washburn said.\n       He said the meeting was advertised in the Mobridge paper \n     and Daschle was hoping for a good turnout and a variety of \n     suggestions.\n       The land issue arose years ago in a federal effort to \n     return to the Standing Rock Sioux and Three Affiliated tribes \n     of North Dakota certain surplus lands that had been acquired \n     for the Oahe and Garrison reservoirs. The Standing Rock \n     reservation is on the west bank of the Oahe Reservoir in both \n     North Dakota and South Dakota.\n       Some non-Indian landowners told Daschle they wanted to \n     regain their land and the senator said the issue should be \n     considered, Washburn said.\n       Daschle's staff is gathering information to help write \n     proposed legislation. In South Dakota, it is intended to be \n     limited to surplus land within the Standing Rock reservation \n     on the west side of the river, Washburn said. ``This is not \n     at all intended to set any sort of precedent,'' he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               Land Transfer at Lake Oahe Is Bad Decision\n\n       South Dakota's congressional delegation can get together on \n     some stuff, but they're having problems agreeing on one that \n     could make a big difference on a number of South Dakota \n     issues.\n       It appears that a few high-ranking folks inside the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers, and South Dakota's two Democrats in \n     Congress want to turn Corps land along Lake Oahe to the \n     Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.\n       The single South Dakota Republican in Congress, Sen. Larry \n     Pressler, and a whole bunch of lower-ranked folks in the \n     Corps think it's bad to give the land to anybody.\n       Some Corps folks see it as a major problem in future \n     management of the Missouri and its reservoirs.\n       Pressler recently sent out a letter opposing the giveaway \n     of as much as 15,000 acres on grounds ranging from doubts \n     that the transfer is legal to restriction of the land for \n     hunting, fishing, livestock use, irrigation and power \n     generation.\n       The problem is that under a ``politically correct'' but \n     legally questionable transfer of land to anybody, it takes \n     some degree of courage to argue against it.\n       But there are overwhelming reasons why this could create a \n     major environmental and economic problem for South Dakotans \n     and Americans in general. Sen. Pressler only touches on them.\n       In the first place, the land involved already was bought \n     and paid for by the Corps when the dams were built. Some was \n     bought from tribes, some from private owners. How can the \n     government legally give land to some former owners and not \n     others?\n       Second, regardless of possible cutoff of public access to \n     these lands, the real ``public'' concern is environmental. \n     Environmental management along the Missouri already is \n     damaged by dozens of jurisdictions with different agendas. \n     Imagine the difficulty if the Corps needed a few acres back \n     for a bird breeding bank.\n       Third, in many cases there may be more reason to keep the \n     land than when the dams were built. Erosion is happening. Is \n     it good for fish, wildlife and plants or not? Shouldn't we \n     know?\n       Elsewhere the government is restricting private land use \n     for environmental reasons. Shouldn't they keep vital land \n     they already control rather than risk confrontation with \n     tribal officials over a fish or bird?\n       This position should not be seen as anti-tribal ownership. \n     The same argument would be made if a couple of hundred \n     ranchers were involved.\n       The Missouri and its recreational potential are vital to \n     South Dakota's economic future. We already have plenty of \n     problems promoting that priority with downstream states and \n     with ``environmentalist'' groups that disagree with each \n     other.\n       Continuing Corps ownership offers the potential, at least, \n     for a ``systems management'' concept for the river. And \n     that's the only sensible foreseeable future.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             Giving Back Purchased Land Sets Poor Precedent\n\n                          (By Brett Tschetter)\n\n       The original boundaries of the Indian reservations along \n     the Missouri River included the land and water to the center \n     of the Missouri River channel. Private ownership was much the \n     same outside of the reservation boundaries.\n       When the Oahe Daum was formed and Lake Oahe began the fill, \n     the Missouri River disappeared and a new body of water was \n     developed. The new lake flooded land on both sides of the old \n     river and eliminated that land for purposes previously \n     utilized.\n       These lands were purchased by the United States government \n     and new boundaries were set up. The land that was purchased \n     above the high-water mark was determined to be used in later \n     years for erosion and re-establishment of the habitat loss \n     from the flooding.\n       The lands that bordered the lake were established as public \n     lands because the government had purchased the land from the \n     previous owners. Access to that land has been open to the \n     public ever since the purchase.\n       In the case of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, the \n     tribe and other owners have been paid more than $20 million \n     for the original 56,000 acres taken for the formation of the \n     Oahe Project within the reservation boundaries.\n       Other tribes and private landowners were paid for the lands \n     that were below the take-line boundaries set up by the Oahe \n     Project.\n       The take-line boundary was set up on both sides of the \n     river to makr the boundary between public and private land.\n       In 1975, Congress passed a law that would allow the U.S. \n     Corps of Engineers to declare land within the projects as \n     excess and transfer that land back to the original owner if \n     found kthat the land was not needed for the continuation of \n     the project.\n       The Corps is currently reviewing the Oahe Project and \n     considering returning the land above the highwater mark to \n     the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The land would be turned over \n     to the Department of the Interior and held in trust for the \n     tribe.\n       This would give the tribe jurisdiction over previously \n     public land and eliminate the public uses established upon \n     the land's purchase.\n       The precedence of this issue is sure to continue with other \n     land on other reservations and private land on both sides of \n     the river.\n       Those lands within the Oahe Project will not be the only \n     ones considered. Soon after this action, the land along Lake \n     Sharpe and other Corps of Engineers lands will be under the \n     same scrutiny.\n       The lands within the take line boundaries are no more \n     excess than water itself. The government has already had to \n     buy more land that has eroded farther than the project \n     originally purchased.\n       The government still has to solve the mitigation issue and \n     restore 233,000 acres of habitat that was flooded. Where will \n     that land come from if the take land is given back? A 90-day \n     hearing period is currently under way to hear the comments of \n     the public.

That repeal \n     contained language stating that the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers (Corps) should proceed with the Secretary of the \n     Interior to designate excess land within the Fort Berthold \n     and Standing Rock Sioux Reservation reaches of Lake Sakakawea \n     and Lake Oahe, respectively. The land identified as excess \n     would then be transferred to the Secretary of the Interior to \n     be held in trust for the benefit of the tribe of Indians \n     within whose reservation such excess real property is \n     located, as contemplated in Public Law 93-599.\n       In what was called an effort to gain a more complete \n     understanding of the public's perception of this transfer, \n     two public meetings were held in June 1994. Both of these \n     meetings were held in remote areas of the two reservations. \n     Based on the comments offered as a result of those meetings, \n     it is apparent that the Corps is again proceeding to identify \n     and transfer these excess properties.\n       The lands along the Missouri were purchased \n     indiscriminately with federal dollars [[Page S7627]] and \n     without regard to race or nationality of the affected \n     sellers. The attempt to restore ownership to only one segment \n     of the population from which these lands were purchased is an \n     affront to everyone who sacrificed their lands to the \n     Missouri River impoundments.\n       Whether justified by law, this is clearly a discriminatory \n     and political maneuver which will do more to foster prejudice \n     in South Dakota than the late Gov. Mickelson's Reconciliation \n     Act could have ever dreamed of overcoming.\n       Values for the relinquishment of hunting and fishing rights \n     were also specifically included in the land purchases. In \n     addition, the Supreme Court decision, South Dakota vs. \n     Bourland, decided June 14, 1993, reaffirmed ``that in taking \n     tribal lands for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project and \n     opening these lands for public use, Congress, through the \n     Flood Control and Cheyenne River Act, eliminated the tribe's \n     power to exclude non-Indians from these lands, and with that \n     the incidental regulatory jurisdiction formerly enjoyed by \n     the tribes.''\n       These facts should have clarified for all time the public's \n     right to the use of these lands. However, the Corps of \n     Engineers has taken the position that they do not exercise \n     authority over fish and wildlife resources nor do they have \n     the authority to delegate wildlife management. This lack of \n     or unwillingness to assume responsibility for the hunting and \n     fishing rights will result in the reversion of those rights \n     with the transferred lands. Argument can be made that this \n     will effectively nullify the Bourland decision, restrict the \n     public's use of land and adjoining water and jeopardize the \n     millions of dollars that the states have invested in their \n     fisheries programs.\n       We should all question why the Corps of Engineers has taken \n     such rapid steps to comply with Public Law 93-599 while for \n     35 years has ignored its mitigation promises of the Pick \n     Sloan Act which required 972,000 acres of irrigation \n     development for South Dakota.\n       The authority for the Corps to transfer excess property \n     away from the taxpayers who finance their projects is \n     inconceivable, and if allowed to progress will have far-\n     reaching ramifications in other states.\n       We strongly urge everyone who has the desire to impact this \n     decision to take action now. Instead of pitting Dakotan \n     against Dakotan, we suggest that the Corps consider a more \n     equitable transfer to an entity, such as the S.D. Department \n     of Game, Fish and Parks, that will hold the land in trust for \n     all people and will manage the land in the best interests of \n     the public.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON (for himself and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 876.

Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nensure that Department of Defense supplemental payments are made to \nheavily impacted school districts like Bellevue, NE without reducing \ntheir payments from the Department of Education as is unfortunately \nhappening now. I am pleased to have my colleague, Senator Kerrey, as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  The DOD supplemental payments are used to reduce 1994 impact aid \npayments being made now. The use of the funds is a new and in my \nopinion erroneous interpretation by the Department of Education as to \nthe meaning of ``all funds available,'' which is contained in its \nregulation. The intent of the DOD appropriation was to provide a \nsupplemental, not a substitute, payment to these heavily impacted \nschool districts. The offset which is being implemented by the \nDepartment of Education makes no sense.\n  This legislation clears up any ambiguities.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation can be considered by the \nappropriate committee in a timely fashion. The 1994 impact aid payments \nare needed by these school districts to meet current budget \nrequirements. The only payment for 1995 received so far by these \ndistricts has been the hold-harmless payment. In some cash-strapped \nschool districts, funds are being borrowed to meet current payrolls and \nother obligations. Prompt passage of this legislation will help \nalleviate the problem for many of these districts and will ensure that \nthe Education Department understands and carries out the will of \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 877. A bill to amend section 353 of the Public Health Service Act \nto exempt physician office laboratories from the clinical laboratories \nrequirements of that section; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n             clinical laboratory improvement act amendments\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that \nwill overturn an expensive and unnecessary regulatory burden that \ncontributes significantly to the high cost of health care.\n  In 1988, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, as \na reaction to reports about laboratories that inaccurately analyzed PAP \nsmears. CLIA 1988 was intended to address the quality of laboratory \ntest performance. Unfortunately, the Federal regulations that flowed \nout of the CLIA 1988 legislation do not reflect the intent of the act \nand have not resulted in any documented improvement in lab results and \nhealth care. What these new regs have done is add a huge new paperwork \nburden on doctors. This unhappy result is a classic case of out-of-\ncontrol regulations driving up medical costs.\n  A recent Texas Medical Association study pegs the annual cost of just \nthe paperwork and administrative overhead added by the CLIA at an \naverage of $4,435 per physician. This is in addition to the cost of \nregistration, labor controls, proficiency testing, and inspection or \naccreditation. At a time when the entire health care industry is under \npressure to control health care costs, the CLIA regulations not only \nsubject physicians to increased administrative costs but also decrease \nthe amount of time devoted to patient care.\n  Dr. McBrayer from the Texas panhandle described his experience with \nthe CLIA inspection process as follows:\n\n       We were written up for such monumental things as the fact \n     that I had not signed the procedure manual for one of our lab \n     machines. Therefore, everything done on that machine, \n     including the training, was out of compliance. The fact that \n     the manufacturer's rep had come and trained the staff was to \n     no avail. Everything was out of compliance because I didn't \n     sign it. It didn't matter that (my lab staff) had learned how \n     to use it. That was irrelevant.\n\n  Dr. McBrayer's experience is not unique. CLIA regulations that pile \non paperwork and silly penalties do not help the patient or the doctor; \nthey simply create lots of unnecessary busywork for Government \nregulators.\n  The CLIA amendments I am introducing will reduce the burdens on \nphysicians who perform laboratory tests in their offices, and thereby \nfree up resources and time to dedicate to patient care. In Texas alone, \nof the physicians who provided testing services in their offices prior \nto CLIA, 27 percent have closed their office labs, and another 31 \npercent have dropped some types of testing, as a direct result of the \nCLIA 1988 reforms.\n  Reduced availability of testing labs has measurably affected the \nhealth care of a number of rural areas of Texas. Many physicians are \nconcerned about the possible consequences to patients caused by the \ndecreased access to testing or the delay in obtained results. Rather \nthan promoting better health care quality, the regulations promulgated \npursuant to the 1988 CLIA legislation have had the perverse result of \ndiminishing quality and increasing the costs of health care delivery.\n  Mr. President, the CLIA 1995 amendments will not jeopardize the \nquality of laboratory testing. The CLIA amendments I am introducing \ntoday are aimed at ensuring that essential laboratory testing performed \nby physicians remains a viable diagnostic option for physicians and \ntheir patients--without the excessive rules and administratively \ncomplex requirements that currently exist. It will roll back health \ncare cost increases caused by overregulation and protect patients in \nrural areas who are losing access to necessary testing and care.\n  I hope that all my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Warner, Mr. McConnell, \n        Mr. Santorum, Mr. Abraham, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Bond, Mr. Pressler, \n        Mr. DeWine, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Kassebaum, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 878.

Res. 36. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to allow the States to limit the \nperiod of time U.S. Senators and Representatives may serve; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         TERM LIMITS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT JOINT RESOLUTION\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in morning business to submit for \npassage a joint resolution that relates to Congressional term limits \nand the potential of States to have term limits and the right of the \nStates to be involved in creating term limits for Members of the U.S. \nCongress.\n  On November 29 of last year, the Clinton administration argued before \nthe Supreme Court of the United States that States should not have the \nright to limit congressional terms. Thus, the executive branch has \nspoken, and spoken against the right of the states and of the people to \nlimit the number of terms individuals may serve in the U.S. Congress.\n  Earlier this week, on Tuesday, in a 5-4 decision entitled The State \nof Arkansas versus Hill, the United States Supreme Court ruled that \nStates do not have the authority to limit the number of terms \ncongressional representatives may serve. The judicial branch has \nspoken.\n  Both the executive branch, through the Clinton administration, and \nthe judicial branch, have spoken against the right of States and of the \npeople to limit the terms of individuals who represent States and \ndistricts in the U.S. Congress.\n  There is only one hope for the overwhelming number of people in this \ncountry who endorse term limits. If Congress extends them the \nopportunity to amend the United States Constitution in a way that would \nallow individual States to limit the terms Members of Congress may \nserve, then the people will have spoken.\n  There has been much debate about term limits in this Congress. \nEarlier in the year, the House of Representatives fell well short of \nthe two-thirds majority required to forward to the people a \nconstitutional amendment on term limits. Of the 290-vote margin \nrequired for a constitutional amendment, they only had 227 votes. What \nwould normally be a significant majority vote in the House, was clearly \nnot enough to make sure that States would have the opportunity to vote \non a constitutional amendment permitting term limits.\n  Last January, I introduced a constitutional amendment that would have \nlimited Members of Congress to three terms in the House and two terms \nin the Senate. Today, as a result of its defeat and of the \nadministration's refusal to recognize the will of \n[[Page S7629]] the people, I am introducing a different kind of \nconstitutional amendment. An amendment that would simply give States \nthe explicit right to limit congressional terms. It would not mandate \nthat any State limit the nature or extent of the terms of the \nindividuals who represent it in the Congress, but would give the \nStates, if they chose to do so, the right to limit the Members' terms \nwho represent that State.\n  In the Arkansas case, which was announced earlier this week, Justice \nClarence Thomas wrote, ``Where the Constitution is silent it raises no \nbar to action by the States or the people.''\n  I believe that he is correct. Where the Constitution does not speak, \nthe people and their States should have a right. Unfortunately, a \nmajority of Supreme Court Justices did not agree with Justice Thomas. \nIn order to supply them with what they appear to require, I believe we \nshould allow the Constitution a way to shout out ``freedom.'' This is a \nfreedom the American people want and a freedom the American people \nunderstand is necessary.\n  More than 3 out of 4 people in the United States endorse the concept \nof term limits. They have watched individuals come to Washington and \nspend time here, captivated by the Beltway logic, the spending habits \nand the power that exists in this city. The people of America know that \nthe talent pool in America is substantial and there are many who ought \nto have the opportunity of serving in the U.S. Congress. Furthermore, \nthey know that term limits would make sure that individuals who go to \nWashington return someday to live under the very laws that they enact.\n  I believe the people in the various States of this Republic should \nhave the opportunity to limit the terms of those who serve them in the \nU.S. Congress. In light of the fact that the administration has argued \nagainst term limits, the executive branch is not going to support term \nlimits, and because the judicial branch has ruled conclusively now in \nthe United States Supreme Court that the States have no constitutional \nauthority, it is up to those of us who serve in the U.S. Congress to do \nsomething to extend to the people their right to speak.\n  This is the house of the people. This Congress is the place where the \nvoice of the people can, and should, be heard. Let us provide another \navenue where the voice of the people regarding this important matter \ncan be heard.\n  It is my pleasure to announce that today I am proposing a joint \nresolution to be enacted or passed by a two-thirds vote of each Chamber \nof Congress, which merely reads:\n\n       ``Section 1. Each State or the people thereof may prescribe \n     the maximum number of terms to which a person may be elected \n     or appointed to the Senate of the United States.\n       ``Section 2. Each State or the people thereof may prescribe \n     the maximum number of terms to which a person may be elected \n     to the House of Representatives of the United States.\n       ``Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it \n     shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution \n     by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States \n     within seven years from the date of its submission to the \n     States by the Congress.''.\n\n  Obviously section 3 is simply the ratification clause.\n  It is a simple amendment to accord to the people of the United States \nof America a profound right--the right to make sure that the \nindividuals who represent them in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives are people who stay in touch with their needs and \nconcerns, the aspirations, the hopes and the wishes of those who sent \nthem here. The right to limit the terms of Members of the U.S. Senate \nand the right to limit the terms of those individuals who represent \ndistricts in our States in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Because that right has been rejected--argued against by the executive \nbranch, the Clinton administration, and ruled against by the U.S. \nSupreme Court--we, the Members of the U.S. Congress, are forced to \naccord that right to the people. We must at least give them the \nopportunity to vote on that right by sending to them this joint \nresolution on the right of States and individuals to limit Members' \nterms who serve the States and the districts of those States in the \nU.S. Congress.\n  It is a profoundly important expression of our confidence in the \npeople of this country to extend to them the right to be involved in \nmaking this judgment. I submit this joint resolution today in the hopes \nthat democracy will continue to flourish as people have greater \nopportunities to be involved.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7615-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 768\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gorton, the names of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Craig], and the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 768, a bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of \n1973 to reauthorize the act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 853\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gorton, the name of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Baucus] was withdrawn as a cosponsor of S. 853, a bill to amend \ntitle 28, United States Code, to divide the ninth judicial circuit of \nthe United States into two circuits, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 21\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thompson, the name of the Senator from Texas \n[Mr. Gramm] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 21, a \njoint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to limit \ncongressional terms.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7629-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n           THE COMPREHENSIVE TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      LIEBERMAN AMENDMENT NO. 1200\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1199 proposed by \nMr. Dole to the bill (S. 735) to prevent and punish acts of terrorism, \nand for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, the unmatched disbursement \nproblem at the Pentagon has been simmering on a back burner for years.\n  All of a sudden, it is on the front burner, and it is boiling.\n  The issue is so bothersome right now because it undermines the \ncredibility of the defense budget numbers and the case for pumping up \nthe defense budget.\n  There is another article on it in the Washington Post on Tuesday.\n  This one zeros right in on the main problem: the lack of \naccountability at the Pentagon.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 23, 1995]\n\n                 The Pentagon's Accountability Problem\n\n                         (By Coleman McCarthy)\n\n       Speaking of welfare abuse--and who isn't--have you heard \n     about the $13 billion the government handed out over the past \n     decade but doesn't know where it went or to whom? Then \n     there's the $6 billion spent in excess of what Congress \n     authorized.\n       The welfare recipients who have taken this money and run--\n     or lazed about or bought Cadillacs, as it is derisively said \n     of poor people--are in a category of their own. They are \n     military contractors. Their welfare agency is the largest of \n     them all, the Department of Defense, which has a defense \n     against enemies great and small except the one within: fiscal \n     stupidity and indifference.\n       Some of the details of this welfare abuse were revealed May \n     16 before the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on \n     readiness. It wasn't much of a hearing: just a half-day of \n     testimony from a Pentagon undersecretary and the head of the \n     General Accounting Office, a few senators and not much in the \n     national media that evening or the next day.\n       If $19 billion in lost or untracked tax money had been \n     dispensed by the Department of Education on mismanaged \n     reading programs or if this were $19 billion that vaporized \n     in the Medicare or food stamp bureaucracy, no hearing room \n     would have been large enough to hold the media and outraged \n     public, no time limit on hearings would have been imposed and \n     no senator's publicist would have passed up the chance to \n     paper Washington with the boss's deploring of bureaucrats, \n     welfare cheats and, for sure, liberals.\n       But this was the Pentagon--the Department of Giveaways--and \n     its dollar-mates, military contractors and their rent-a-\n     general execs. Both givers and takers are on permanent \n     dispensations from standards of competence, accountability \n     and honesty that apply elsewhere.\n       At the hearings, Charles A. Bowsher of the GAO ran through \n     what he called the Pentagon's ``serious problem of not being \n     able to properly match disbursements with obligations.'' \n     Pentagon overpayments, flawed contracts, duplicative business \n     practices, shoddy or no record-keeping and multiple payroll \n     systems have meant that the money might as well have been \n     thrown out of airplanes for all anyone knew where it went.\n       On such a routine matter as travel, Bowsher reported that \n     the Pentagon has ``over 700 processing centers, 1,300 pages \n     of regulations and some 40\n      steps to get travel approval and reimbursement. The result: \n     DOD spent over 30 percent of each travel dollar on \n     administrative cost. By contrast, companies with the best \n     travel processes have one disbursing center . . . and 10 \n     or fewer process steps. These companies spend as little as \n     1 percent of their travel dollar on administrative \n     costs.''\n       According to John Hamre, the Pentagon undersecretary and \n     comptroller, each month the Pentagon deals with 2.5 million \n     invoices and 10 million paychecks. He spun: ``It isn't that \n     we have wicked people trying to screw up, it's that we have a \n     system that's so error-prone that good people working hard \n     are going to make mistakes.''\n       In the past 18 months, the hard-working good folk at the \n     Pentagon have miscalculated Hamre's paycheck six times.\n       Because no wicked people are involved in the missing \n     billions, no mention was made of firings, much less possible \n     indictments. On the issue of ``problem disbursements,'' Hamre \n     was the model of managerial thoughtfulness. It is too late or \n     too burdensome to go back and see what or who went awry: ``I \n     decided to suspend, on a one-time basis, the requirement to \n     research old transactions.'' To DOD's contractor buddies, the \n     message, unlike the money, was not lost: Relax, we're good \n     people, you're good people. It was ``the system.''\n       Hamre reassured Congress that the era of reform is here: \n     ``The department has refined and advanced its blueprint to \n     eliminate its long-standing financial management \n     problems.'' [[Page S7631]] \n       Sure. In his 1989 book ``The Pentagonists: An Insider's \n     View of Waste, Mismanagement, and Fraud in Defense \n     Spending,'' A. Ernest Fitzgerald wrote that the military's \n     rote reaction to scandal is to promise reform, pledge self-\n     policing and spout Caspar Weinberger's favorite cliche about \n     the ``few bad apples in any barrel.'' And then go back to \n     writing checks.\n       Down the hall on the same day from the hearing on the \n     missing billions was another Senate Armed Services panel \n     reaching for its appropriations pen--debating a $60 billion \n     contract to build 30 attack submarines for the Navy. To \n     attack who? Russia.\n       It was a day of symmetry: one Senate committee looking for \n     phantom money and another pondering a phantom enemy.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Billions of dollars in DOD checks can't be hooked up to \nauthorizing documents, but ``no mention is made of firings or possible \nindictments,'' the article says.\n  The Pentagon will promise reform, pledge self-policing, and get right \nback to writing bad checks.\n  This is what worries me, Mr. President.\n  Some of my colleagues would like to give the Pentagon some extra \nmoney, so the Pentagon bureaucrats can write more bad checks.\n  This is the very problem I spoke about on the floor last Friday.\n  Last Friday I came to the floor to express concern about a new policy \nbeing pushed by the Comptroller at the Department of Defense [DOD], Mr. \nJohn Hamre.\n  Mr. Hamre is proposing to write off billions of dollars of \nunmatchable disbursements.\n  Unmatchable disbursements are payments which he claims cannot be \nlinked to supporting documentation.\n  In my mind, Mr. President, the plan would set a dangerous precedent \nand underscores the continuing lack of effective internal financial \ncontrols at the Pentagon.\n  My speech last Friday merely expressed concerns and raised questions \nabout the new policy.\n  Well, at the conclusion of my statement, my friend from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, and my friend from Maine, Senator Cohen, launched an \nunwarranted attack on what I had said.\n  I feel as though their criticism was misdirected. It misinterpreted \nand mischaracterized what I had said.\n  Unfortunately, I was participating in the Canada-United States \nInterparliamentary Group meeting in Canada and had to run to catch an \nairplane.\n  I was unable to respond to their critical remarks on Friday.\n  I would like to do that now.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to clarify for Senator Cohen's \nunderstanding of what I actually said about the IRS. Had his \nrecollection of what I said been clear, he would have known that he and \nI are in total agreement on the management flaws at IRS.\n  Senator Cohen seemed to think that I was holding up the IRS as some \nkind of model accounting bureau for Pentagon bureaucrats to copy.\n  That was not my point at all. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  In fact, I am as frequent a critic of the way the IRS manages the \npeoples' money as he is.\n  What I was suggesting in my comments was that the plan to write off \nbillions of dollars of unmatchable disbursements would be an insult to \nthe taxpayers.\n  This is what I said:\n\n       This money was taken out of the pockets of hard working \n     American taxpayers, and the Pentagon bureaucrats say it is \n     just too much trouble to find out how their money was spent.\n       Could you imagine how the IRS would treat a citizen who \n     claimed to have no documentation for $100,000 of income? The \n     IRS would say: We know you got the money. You pay the tax. \n     Period. End of discussion.\n       We should hold the Pentagon bureaucrats to the same \n     standard that the IRS holds the taxpayers to. The DOD should \n     have to play by the same rules imposed on the taxpayers.\n       We should tell the Pentagon bureaucrats: We know you \n     received $10 billion in appropriations. Now, how did you \n     spend it? No extra money until we get the answer.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the point I was trying to make.\n  The IRS is relentless and thorough in collecting tax money from the \npeople.\n  I want the Pentagon bureaucrats to be just as relentless and just as \nthorough in controlling and accounting for the expenditure of the \npeoples' money as the IRS is in collecting it.\n  I would now like to turn to Senator McCain's remarks.\n  I take strong exception to what was said by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCain suggested that I ``enjoy savaging'' the Pentagon for \nshortcomings and deficiencies but never offer ``viable solutions.'' \nFirst of all, I do not remember ever making a critique of DOD's \nmanagement without offering a solution, contrary to my friend's \nflippant remark.\n  On Friday, I made two very specific recommendations for handling the \nnew policy.\n  I would like to restate those two recommendations. I said:\n\n       We in the Congress should not approve this plan until two \n     stringent conditions are met:\n       Number 1: Those responsible must be held accountable for \n     what has happened; Heads must roll.\n       Number 2: A new DOD policy should be put in place that \n     specifies: Effective January 1, 1996, all DOD disbursements \n     must be matched with obligations and supporting accounting \n     records before a payment is made.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said on Friday, these two recommendations will \nhelp to strengthen and reinforce section 8137 of the fiscal year 1995 \nDOD Appropriations Act--Public Law 103-335. Senator Stevens \nacknowledged my proposed solution in a hearing on this issue May 23 \nbefore his Defense Subcommittee.\n  Section 8137 was a carefully crafted piece of legislation designed to \ncorrect the unmatched disbursement problem at the Pentagon.\n  It was a phased approach I developed in close cooperation with the \nDOD Comptroller, Mr. Hamre.\n  Section 8137 specifies that by July 1, 1995, a disbursement in excess \nof $5 million must be matched with appropriate accounting documents \nbefore the payment is made.\n  Then, under the law, the mandatory matching threshold is lowered to \n$1 million on October 1, 1995.\n  My amendment was adopted by the Senate on August 11, 1994.\n  The next day I received a warm, handwritten thank you note from Mr. \nHamre. I would like to read it. I quote:\n\n       I would like to thank you for sponsoring the amendment \n     requiring DOD to match disbursements with accounting records \n     prior to actual disbursement of funds. I especially \n     appreciate your willingness to work with me to adopt your \n     amendment to ensure we could implement it in the least \n     disruptive manner. You will be very proud of the long-term \n     benefit it will produce in our business practices.\n\n  Mr. President, to my friend from Arizona, I say: I have been working \nhard to fix this problem. I do not claim to have the answer but I am \nsearching for it.\n  And the recommendations I made on Friday are the logical next step to \nthe phased approach contained in section 8137 of the law.\n  They would lower the threshold to zero, effective January 1, 1996.\n  Let me also say to my friend from Arizona that my recommendations are \nfully consistent with current DOD policy.\n  To back up that point, I would like to quote from Mr. Hamre's letter \nof May 5, 1995, to Senator Glenn where the plan to write off \nunmatchable disbursements was first revealed to the public.\n  I quote from the Hamre letter: ``We have adopted a policy that we \nwill not disburse funds until we pre-match them to the accounting \nrecords.''\n  That is recommendation No. 2 in Friday's speech.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona that I have been \nworking diligently to fix the problem.\n  I have already helped to develop one viable solution and am working \non another.\n  Right now, I am working with the Comptroller General, Chuck Bowsher, \nto find a more comprehensive solution to the Pentagon's accounting \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, sometimes in the heat of debate, our arguments and \nproposed solutions fall on deaf ears.\n  I would caution my friend from Arizona to listen to the arguments \nbefore blindly dismissing them.\n  Unless that is done, the credibility of one's opposition is lost.\n  Mr. President, I would like to add one new idea to the discussion.\n  I do not believe the use of the word ``writeoff'' accurately \ndescribes what DOD is proposing to do.\n  Normally, the word ``writeoff'' is used to describe a procedure for \ncanceling from accounts a legitimate business loss.\n  What Mr. Hamre is proposing to do is write off billions of dollars of \nunauthorized payments. [[Page S7632]] \n  A payment that cannot be linked to supporting documentation is an \nunauthorized payment. It may not be legitimate.\n  Without documentation, we do not know how the money was used.\n  That is my concern, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, Pentagon bureaucrats have an unblemished record of \nmismanaging the peoples' money.\n  Now, is it smart to give a bureaucratic institution like the Pentagon \nthat cannot control and account for the use of public money more public \nmoney--as some of my colleagues propose?\n  DOD should not get any extra money until it cleans up the books.\n  More money is not the answer. Better management is.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7630-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nA TRIBUTE TO COMMAND SGT. MAJ. WILLIAM H. ACEBES ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM \n                                THE ARMY\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, today I want to congratulate Command \nSgt. Maj. William H. Acebes on the occasion of his retirement from the \nU.S. Army.\n  Command Sergeant Major Acebes began his Army career 30 years ago when \nhe completed basic training at Fort Polk, LA. I am pleased to note that \nhe completed his advanced individual training in my home State of \nGeorgia, at Fort Gordon. Since then, he has served in virtually every \nnoncommissioned officer leadership position.\n  Overseas, Command Sergeant Major Acebes has served numerous tours of \nduty with United States Forces in both Europe and Asia. In Germany he \nwas assigned to the Berlin Brigade and later, to the 1st Battalion, \n10th Special Forces Group (Forward) at Bad Toelz. During the Vietnam \nwar, he served with the 173rd Airborne Brigade and was an advisor with \nthe United States Army Military Assistance Command. His most recent \noverseas assignment was in South Korea, where he was the command \nsergeant major of the 2nd Infantry Division.\n  Bill Acebes' stateside assignments have included serving as the first \nsergeant of Headquarters Company and the command sergeant major of the \n1st Battalion (Ranger), 75th Ranger Regiment. Also, he served as the \nbattalion command sergeant major for the 1st Battalion, 64th Armor \nRegiment, 2d Brigade, 24th Infantry Division, at Fort Stewart, Georgia. \nSince 1992, he has served as the U.S. Army Infantry Center Command \nSergeant Major at Fort Benning, GA.\n  During his 30-year Army career, Bill Acebes has received numerous \nawards and decorations in recognition of his exemplary service to the \nUnited States. These awards and decorations include the Legion of \nMerit, the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army \nCommendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Vietnam Cross \nof Gallantry.\n  I know of no soldier who sought more tough, demanding assignments \nthan Bill Acebes. I also know of no soldier who has spent more time \nwith the infantry--with infantry soldiers and families, than Bill \nAcebes. Whenever our country called, over a 30-year period, Command \nSergeant Major Acebes answered. His leadership and talents will be \nmissed.\n  Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to join me in thanking Command \nSergeant Major William H. Acebes for his distinguished service to the \nArmy and people of the United States.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7632-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 COMMERCIAL SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to commend the \nSenator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] for the statement yesterday on the \nneed to develop a timely solution for the management of spent nuclear \nfuel from the Nation's 109 commercial nuclear power plants.\n  As the new chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Murkowski has \nalready assumed a leading role in examining America's policy on high-\nlevel radioactive waste management and I appreciate the chairman's \nongoing commitment to change that policy to ensure that we continue to \nmake progress in a program so vital to the national interest.\n  Mr. President, the United States has struggled to fashion a workable \npolicy on high-level radioactive waste disposal since the Congress \npassed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  In 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed amendments to that act to \ndirect the Department of Energy to study Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a \nlikely repository site. A cadre of world-class scientists have been \nconducting first-of-a-kind experiments at Yucca Mountain to determine \nif the site is suitable for the ultimate disposition of spent nuclear \nfuel from civilian nuclear reactors a well as defense high-level \nradioactive waste.\n  Electric consumers have committed $11 billion since 1983 to finance \nthese studies, a total that includes $563 million collected from \nconsumers of nuclear electricity generated in South Carolina. \nUnfortunately, the year 2010 is the earliest possible date that a \nrepository might be ready to accept spent fuel.\n  In the meantime, nuclear power plants across the country are running \nout of capacity to store spent fuel. By 1998, 26 plants will have \nexhausted existing capacity to store spent fuel, including the Oconee \nand Robinson plants in South Carolina.\n  In addition to designating Yucca Mountain, the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct made the Federal Government responsible for taking title to spent \nnuclear fuel beginning in 1998.\n  In order to meet its obligations, therefore, the Federal Government \nmust now develop a temporary storage facility for spent fuel from the \nNation's nuclear power plants. In just 3 years DOE is scheduled to \nassume responsibility for the spent nuclear fuel from commercial \nnuclear power plants. It must begin planning now to build and operate a \nfacility to fulfill that obligation.\n  Legislation introduced in both the Senate and House would develop an \nintegrated approach to spent fuel management, including the \nconstruction and operation of a single Federal facility to store spent \nfuel until a permanent solution is available. Legislation in both \nChambers identifies the sensible location for such a storage facility--\nthe Nevada test site.\n  This Federal facility is the most logical location for such an \ninterim site. It borders Yucca Mountain, a remote, unpopulated, and \narid location in the Nevada Desert. Moreover, the site is on land that \nhas been dedicated to underground nuclear testing for more than 40 \nyears, and thus appropriately dedicated to a project like this one.\n  Building a central storage facility at the Nevada test site does not \nprejudge the question of whether Yucca Mountain is suitable, but there \nare tremendous advantages to locating it there. Among the most \nappealing is ease of transportation of the spent fuel from storage \nfacility to repository.\n  Building a central storage facility that is operating by 1998 and a \nrepository by 2010 will save electric consumers $5 billion over the \nlife cycle of the waste management program. These cost savings will be \nfurther enhanced, primarily through ease of transportation, if the \nstorage facility is located near the repository site.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to address the problems that have \nplagued the Department of Energy's nuclear waste management program. We \ncan take the first step this year by authorizing and using funds \nalready contributed by electricity consumers to develop a central \nstorage facility in Nevada.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7632-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7632-S7633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      DESECRATION OF THE U.S. FLAG\n\n Mr. HEFLIN.

Mr. President, the sale of Russian submarines to \nIran and the People's Republic of China have the potential to \nsignificantly jeopardize regional stability and pose a grave threat to \ninternational trade. The United States must take a firm stand on this \nissue.\n  Iran, which borders the Straits of Hormuz, has obtained two and is \nexpected to take delivery of a third Russian Kilo class submarine. \nThese submarines, particularly when armed with the wake-homing \ntorpedoes that the Iranian's have tested, are optimized to cut off the \npassage of merchant shipping through the straits. Roughly 50 percent of \nthe oil in international trade passes through these straits. Any \ninterruption of this supply would result in an international energy \ncrisis, and a sustained interruption would have dramatic economic \nconsequences.\n  We must ask ourselves, ``why are the Iranian's developing this \ncapability?'' Could the answer be that they wish to close the straits? \nClearly, it is not in our national interest to allow a country which \nsponsors international terrorism to do this, holding the world's oil \nsupply and the key to the global economy hostage.\n  The People's Republic of China is also buying modern Russian \nsubmarines. For what purpose? Their lawless efforts to seize control of \nthe Spratley Islands already indicate an intent to control the South \nChina Sea. Are these submarines intended to bolster this effort or are \nthey intended to threaten our friends in Taiwan?\n  As an island nation, Taiwan is desperately dependent on the free \npassage of shipping. If this were to be threatened or cut off, the \nTaiwanese economy would flounder. Would we, should we, allow this to \nhappen? I think not. Taiwan is our sixth largest trading partner and, \nunlike the People's Republic of China, a democratic state.\n  Since 1776 the United States has supported the freedom of navigation \nand must continue to do so. Twice in this century a country with a \nrelatively small submarine force caused havoc with the merchant \nshipping of free nations. This can not happen again.\n  The United States does not build submarines for foreign nations and \nneither should the Russians. We must increase our efforts to discourage \nthe Russians from proliferating this, as well as other, dangerous \ntechnology and we must vigorously maintain our supremacy in \nantisubmarine warfare capabilities. Furthermore, we must make it \nabsolutely clear to Iran and the People's Republic of China that the \nUnited [[Page S7634]] States can not, and will not, tolerate any action \nwhich impacts regional stability by threatening the merchant trade of \npeaceful nations.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7633-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  24TH ANNUAL POLISH HERITAGE FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnici-ties, and \nreligions--that grows increasingly diverse with each passing year. \nNowhere is this incredible diversity more evident than in the State of \nNew Jersey. In New Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak \n120 different languages at home. These different languages are used in \nover 1.4 million homes in my State. I have always believed that one of \nthe United States greatest strengths is the diversity of the people \nthat make up its citizenry and I am proud to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an event in New Jersey that celebrates the importance of \nthe diversity that is a part of America's collective heritage.\n  On June 4, 1995, the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ, will \nbegin its 1995 Spring Heritage Festival Series. This Heritage Festival \nprogram will salute some of the different ethnic communities that \ncontribute so greatly to New Jersey's diverse makeup. Highlighting old \ncountry customs and culture, the festival programs are an opportunity \nto express pride in the ethnic backgrounds that are a part of our \ncollective heritage. Additionally, the Spring Heritage Festivals will \ncontribute proceeds from their programs to the Garden State Arts \nCenter's cultural center fund which presents theater productions free-\nof-charge to New Jersey's school children, seniors, and other deserving \nresidents. The Heritage Festival thus not only pays tribute to the \ncultural influences from our past, it also makes a significant \ncontribution to our present day cultural activities.\n  On Sunday, June 4, 1995, the Heritage Festival Series will open with \nthe 24th Annual Polish Heritage Festival. Chaired by Stanley \nKostenowcyk, this year's event commemorates the end of World War II and \npays tribute to the bravery of American and Polish soldiers in their \nwar efforts. A special commemorative exhibition on the Polish people's \ninvolvement in World WAr II will be held in the Robert Meyner Reception \nCenter and will honor the memory of the 6 million Poles that \ndisappeared during this dark period in world history. The festival will \nalso feature food, crafts, music, and traditional Polish folk dancing \nas well as an outdoor liturgy concelebrated by Rev. Msgr. Joseph \nMarjanczyk, pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel R.C. Church of Bayonne, \nNJ, and Rev. Eugene Koch, pastor of St. Theresa's R.C. Church in \nLinden, NJ. Immediately following the outdoor liturgy will be a program \nfeaturing many talented Polish artists including: Lenny Gormulka and \nThe Chicago Push; the Jimmy Sturr Orchestra with Carl Buda directing \nthe St. Cecilia's Choir; Raymond Wojcik conducting the Garden State \nPhilharmonic Orchestra; the pianist Jacek Zganiacz; the Hejnal Polish-\nAmerican Dancers; and Emcee Barry Kaminski. On behalf of all New \nJerseyans of Polish descent, a group that numbers over 400,000 people, \nI offer my congratulations on the occasion of the 24th Polish Heritage \nFestival.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7634-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       SET A GOOD EXAMPLE PROGRAM\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize two elementary schools from Shreveport, LA, \nthat placed in the top five in the 1994-95 Set a Good Example Contest \nsponsored by the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America. \nWestwood Elementary School placed first and Lakeshore Elementary School \nplaced fifth in this competition, which is based on the idea that \nteaching children common sense values and encouraging them to serve as \nrole models for their peers is a workable solution for preventing \njuvenile crime, drug abuse, illiteracy, and delinquency. More than \n7,500 schools and close to 7 million students have participated in this \ninnovative and visionary program since its creation in 1984.\n  The Set a Good Example Contest is unique because students design \ntheir own program to improve their school environment. The students at \nWestwood Elementary chose the theme ``Westwood Respects All,'' and \ndecided to strive for a 95-percent improvement in discipline and \nbehavior schoolwide. Lakeshore Elementary students decided on the \nconcept ``Tell the Truth,'' and also emphasized stopping violence both \nin school and at home. The children from these two Louisiana schools \norganized several impressive activities to educate themselves and \nothers on the dangers of gangs, drugs, and violence. The initiative and \ncreativity they showed in organizing food drives, encouraging \nrecycling, decorating their schools with antidrug and antiviolence \nslogans, and improving the environment are worthy of our admiration and \ncommendation.\n  I am pleased and proud to acknowledge this fine accomplishment by the \nWestwood and Lakeshore schools. These students, who will be the leaders \nof tomorrow, have shown dedication to bettering themselves and their \nenvironment. If this type of involvement is any indication of the way \nAmerica's youth will address issues in the future, then we should not \nworry, for we are headed in the right direction. The bold stand against \nviolence and the endorsement of positive values like honesty and \ndiscipline by these students should service as an outstanding example \nand inspiration for their peers. I salute the students and faculty of \nthe Westwood and Lakeshore elementary schools and hope that the youth \nof our Nation will follow in your footsteps.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7634-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7634-S7635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO VICE ADM. THOMAS J. KILCLINE, USN (RETIRED)\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President. Today I rise to pay tribute to my \nlongtime friend and mentor, Vice Adm. Thomas J. Kilcline, USN \n(Retired). We served together in the Navy's legislative affairs office \nin the late 1970's and over the intervening years I have grown to \nrespect him as an insightful leader, dedicated humanitarian, and sage \ncounselor. On the eve of his retirement from his position as President \nof the Retired Officers Association, I considered it extremely \nappropriate to formally recognize him for his more than 50 years of \nservice to this Nation.\n  Tom Kilcline was born in Detroit, MI, on December 9, 1925. He \nenlisted in the Navy in 1943, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in \n1949, and was designated a naval aviator in November 1950, after which \nhe flew with VR-5 until 1953.\n  Admiral Kilcline attended the Naval Postgraduate School and later \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a masters degree \nin aeronautical engineering in 1956.\n  He then joined Heavy Attack Squadron Nine, serving on the U.S.S. \nSaratoga (CV-60) and U.S.S. Ranger (CV-61). In 1959, he was assigned to \nthe staff of the Commander Sixth Fleet. He completed the command and \nstaff course at the Naval War College and in 1962 completed test pilot \nschool. He was later assigned as coordinator of test programs for all \nattack aircraft at the Naval Air Test Center.\n  In January 1965, Tom reported to Heavy Attack Squadron Eleven (VAH-\n11) aboard the U.S.S. Forrestal (CV-59). He commanded an RA5C squadron \ndeployed to the Vietnam theater. He returned to the staff of the \nCommander Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet in August 1967, and a \nyear later was assigned as operations officer and later executive \nofficer aboard the U.S.S. Ticonderoga  (CVA-14) during combat \noperations off Vietnam. He\n then became program manager for acquisition and support of the RA-5C \naircraft, Naval Air Systems Command. In October 1970, he was named \nDirector of Liaison with the House of Representatives under the Navy \nOffice of Legislative Affairs.\n\n  From August 1972 until May 1974, Tom was commanding officer, Navy Air \nStation, Patuxent River, MD. He was then assigned as director of \naviation officer distribution, aviation captain detailer and later, \nAssistant Chief of Naval Personnel, Officer Distribution and Education. \nIn August 1975, he assumed command of Naval Base Subic Bay with duties \nas Commander in Chief Pacific Representative in the Philippines and \nCommander U.S. Naval Forces, Philippines. He became Chief, \n[[Page S7635]] \nLegislative Affairs in February 1978 and in July 1981, was assigned as \nCommander Naval Air Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. He retired from the \nNavy in 1983.\n  His awards include the Distinguished Service Medal; the Legion of \nMerit with three gold stars; the Bronze Star; the Air Medal; and awards \nfrom the Governments of the Philippines and the Republic of Vietnam.\n  Following retirement, Admiral Kilcline formed a military and \ncongressional consulting firm which he disestablished when he became \nthe Retired Officers Association president in December 1986.\n  Through his stewardship, the Retired Officers Association played a \npivotal role in convincing Congress to enact several legislative \ninitiatives to maintain readiness and improve the quality of life for \nall members of the military community--active, reserve, and retired, \nplus their families and survivors. I will not describe all of his \naccomplishments, but will briefly focus on a few to illustrate the \nbreadth of his concern for military people of all uniforms.\n  One particularly noteworthy effort resulted from his unwavering \ncommitment to affordable health care for the military community. In \n1988, after assessing the onerous and ill-advised seniors' only surtax, \nassociated with the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, he worked \nclosely with me and other Members of Congress and threw the full \nresources of his organization behind the successful effort to repeal \nthat act--a feat that has become a case study in grassroots activism. \nLikewise, under his direction, the Retired Officers Association \nsupported strengthening the underpinning of the Montgomery GI bill and \nthus provided a solid foundation for our Nation's future leaders by \nplacing the wherewithal for a college education on the horizons of more \nthan 1,000,000 young men and women who otherwise might have been denied \nthat opportunity.\n  Finally, he was ever mindful of the adverse effects on morale and \nretention caused by broken commitments and inadequate compensation and \nforcefully championed the causes of fairness and equity. His leadership \nefforts to preserve the long-standing commitment to lifetime care in \nmilitary health care facilities, to fight for retiree cost of living \nadjustments, and to provide adequate military pay raises are some of \nhis other significant contributions. Most recently, he fought for and \nwon the battle for a transition plan that provides a comprehensive \nbenefits package for those personnel and their families who are forced \nout of active service as a result of the force structure drawdown that, \nhopefully, is in its final stages.\n  It's also most appropriate to recognize Tom's wife of 44 years, the \nformer Dornell Thompson of Pensacola, FL. Dornell has stood steadfastly \nat his side, championing the cause of military people, particularly \ntheir families and survivors, everywhere. For her vital contribution, \nwe owe her a debt of gratitude.\n  I wish to extend to this great American and dear friend a grateful \nnation's thanks, our best wishes for a long life, and fair winds and \nfollowing seas.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7634-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7635-S7636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nAmerican Jewish Committee for its contributions to the ongoing debate \non the appropriate role for our Nation in international affairs.\n  Through a series of advertisements in national and local publications \nin recent days, the American Jewish Committee has engaged in a worthy \neducation effort to broaden public understanding of, and support for, \nAmerica's investment in its leadership role in world affairs.\n  This effort could not be more timely. The budget resolutions that \nhave been adopted in this and the other body in the past week, along \nwith measures approved by the respective authorizing committees to \nreorganize international affairs functions and sharply reduce foreign \naid spending, could profoundly compromise our ability to protect \nAmerica's vital economic, political, and strategic interests around the \nworld.\n  Underlying these shortsighted actions, I fear, is the common \nassumption that the public simply does not and will not support \nexpenditures for international affairs. Indeed, public opinion surveys \nhave consistently shown weak support for foreign aid. But they also \nhave revealed a general and significant misunderstanding of the \nNation's international affairs programs--including an overestimation, \nby a factor of 15 in one recent survey, of the portion of the Federal \nbudget devoted to foreign aid.\n  That profound misunderstanding of the cost, and I submit the cost-\neffectiveness, of American engagement in international affairs must be \nconfronted and reversed; it must not be allowed to dictate or excuse a \nretreat from American leadership.\n  It is to raise awareness of the value and necessity of America's \ncontinued international engagement, and to place the current debate on \nforeign aid and related programs in the proper context of America's \nleadership role and the protection of America's interests, that the \nAmerican Jewish Committee has launched its current public education \neffort, I commend AJC's message to my colleagues, and hope that it \ngains the serious attention it so clearly merits.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the American Jewish Committee's \nad, as it appears in the current issues of the Washington Post weekly \nedition and Roll Call, be printed in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n American Leadership in World Affairs Is Expensive Until You Consider \n                            the Alternative\n\n       During this century, America has played a proud and \n     unparalleled role in the leadership of formal alliances and \n     informal coalitions to vanquish tyrants, extend human \n     freedom, and craft the rules and institutions of commerce and \n     peace.\n       The cost of our leadership in world affairs has been high; \n     we honor the profound sacrifices made in the exercise of that \n     leadership. At the same time, we know that, for the \n     realization of our fundamental principles and the welfare of \n     our country, the cost of withdrawal from leadership--or of \n     its assumption by other nations--would have been intolerable. \n     Through two world wars and five decades of post-war conflict \n     between the Soviet bloc and the Western alliance, America's \n     role has been central and irreplaceable. In the uncertainties \n     and conflicts that lie ahead, we foresee no diminution--\n     indeed, a likely extension--of the call for American \n     leadership in international affairs.\n       It is in the interest of human progress, and the particular \n     interest of our own nation, that America continue to answer \n     that call to leadership. In fact, America's national and \n     international interests are mutually reinforcing. In the \n     developed world, American commitment to free trade in goods \n     and ideas, and to the entrenchment and protection of \n     democracy, strengthens our and our partners' economies, the \n     well-being of our people, and our political and strategic \n     infrastructures. In the developing world, American commitment \n     to human rights and to the relief of human suffering, to the \n     creation and sustenance of democratic institutions, and to \n     defense against extremism, ultranationalism and expansionism, \n     is not only morally compelling but yields alliances, markets \n     and regional security regimes vital to American economic and \n     political interests.\n       The American Jewish Committee, founded in 1906 in part to \n     spur U.S. action against the oppression of Jews in czarist \n     Russia, has consistently advocated our nation's leadership in \n     world affairs. A participant in the Versailles conference of \n     1919 and consultant to the American delegation to\n      the San Francisco conference that chartered the United \n     Nations in 1945, the American Jewish Committee has long \n     recognized the singular role of the United States as a \n     defender of freedom, protector of human rights, and \n     proponent of peaceful relations between states.\n       As Americans, inheritors of the world's longest and most \n     successful experiment in constitutional democracy, we know \n     the provenance of our freedoms--the struggle to found a \n     nation free of religious persecution, intolerance and \n     political oppression; we know, as well, that our nation's \n     struggle for freedom is incomplete and ongoing. As Jews, \n     inheritors of an ancient and noble tradition of laws and \n     culture, whose communities in other lands have been decimated \n     by political and religious decree, we cherish the American \n     ideal of liberty, a beacon of hope to all the world.\n       For these reasons--America's role and investment in shaping \n     the modern world; the dangers of alternative or absent \n     leadership; the economic, political and strategic benefits of \n     active international engagement with both the developed and \n     developing worlds; and the history, virtue and motivating \n     power of the American ideal--we commend our Government's \n     continued dedication to the projection of American leadership \n     in world affairs. To that end, we urge the following:\n       Vigorous resistance to neo-isolationist calls for American \n     withdrawal or retreat from international commitments. \n     American [[Page S7636]] economic, political and strategic \n     interests cannot be isolated or insulated from world affairs; \n     their successful engagement in world affairs are America's \n     guarantor of prosperity and peace.\n       An understanding of the cost-effectiveness of U.S. foreign \n     aid and a strong commitment to maintain it as an efficient \n     instrument of foreign policy. Reduced in real-dollar terms in \n     recent budgets to less than 1 percent of Federal spending--\n     and the lowest, as a percentage of GNP, among major \n     industrialized nations--U.S. foreign aid serves to safeguard \n     America's political and economic interests abroad and spurs \n     the development of new markets, generates American jobs (with \n     3 out of 4 aid dollars spent at home), and helps ease foreign \n     crises that could escalate into instability and military \n     conflict.\n       Continued U.S. leadership in efforts to resolve regional \n     conflicts in areas of vital economic, political and strategic \n     interest; to bar the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction; and to combat international terrorism that \n     threatens America, Israel, moderate Arab states, and the \n     values and institutions of modern civilization. America's \n     role in the pursuit of Arab-Israeli reconciliation, and in \n     the development of regional economic and security \n     arrangements to promote Middle East peace, has been, and \n     continues to be, indispensable.\n       Continued U.S. leadership, active participation, and \n     appropriate investment in multilateral and bilateral \n     institutions, including international lending agencies, trade \n     and health organizations, and the United Nations. These \n     institutions are valuable tools through which the United \n     States, with vital security and economic interests across the \n     globe, seeks global consensus on issues of national \n     importance.\n       The protection of international human rights as an \n     essential component of U.S. foreign policy, reflecting \n     America's deepest values while advancing its interests in a \n     safer world. Indeed, at the founding conference of the United \n     Nations 50 years ago, it was American Jewish Committee \n     representatives Joseph Proskauer and Jacob Blaustein who \n     argued persuasively that governments which respect human \n     rights in their own countries are less likely to upset \n     regional and global stability.\n       This message, one of a series on public policy issues, was \n     adopted by the Board of Governors of the American Jewish \n     Committee at its 89th Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C., on \n     May 3, 1995.\n       The American Jewish Committee, Robert S.

Through his \nvision and efforts, 2,148 USUHS physicians have been commissioned into \nthe uniformed services; and, of those fine, uniformed doctors, over 81 \npercent remain on active duty in the service of their Nation beyond \ntheir initial service obligation.\n  Senator Thurmond's leadership and foresight played a major role in \nthe conception of USUHS. Through his consistent support and recognition \nof the importance of pre-war and wartime knowledge of military medical \nrequirements, the Congress established USUHS and the scholarship \nprogram [HPSP] as complementary sources of accession for military \nphysicians. In 1972, Public Law 92-426 established the HPSP program to \nbe a flexible source for the quantity of doctors required by the Armed \nForces. USUHS was established to provide a corps of military medical \nofficers--presently 14 percent of the total physician force--who would \nprovide continuity and leadership to the medical services.\n  It was Senator Thurmond's sound and correct judgment that without \ncontinuity and leadership, the lessons learned in military medicine \nfrom past wars are forgotten and must be relearned at the expense of \nthe fighting forces. Senator Thurmond has continuously understood that \nit is essential for military medical readiness to maintain enough \nphysicians in the military services to ensure that the lessons learned \nin military medicine during both combat and peacetime will be \nsafeguarded. Because of his tenacity, the USUHS military medical \npersonnel, faculty, active duty alumni and programs continue to serve \nas the institutional memory for military medicine.\n  During four major assaults attempting to close USUHS, Senator \nThurmond's fortitude and mettle have provided the steadfastness of \npurpose to thwart those who do not understand that there is a vast \ndifference between a civilian doctor in the military and a military \nphysician. Senator Thurmond's military physicians have demonstrated \nimmediate deployability and played key roles in numerous military and \nhumanitarian operations at home and abroad, including: Operation Just \nCause (Panama); Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; Operation \nProvide Comfort (Kurdish relief); Somalia, Bosnia, Croatia, and \nHurricanes Hugo and Andrew relief operations; the 1993 Midwestern flood \nrelief; the\n operations to restore democracy in Haiti, and in operational planning \nsupport provided in response to the 1995 bombing of the Federal \nbuilding in Oklahoma.\n\n  Without a doubt, through the passage of time, the immediate \ndeployability of USUHS physicians to military and humanitarian \noperations, the extraordinary retention rates of the USUHS graduates, \nthe testimony of military medical combat experts during congressional \nhearings in March and April of 1994, the exceptional support from both \nmilitary and civilian medical leadership and associations, the \ndocumentation from economic analyses that verifies USUHS is a wise \ninvestment for the Federal Government, and the renewed recognition of \nthe need for military medical readiness in support of those whom we \nsend into harm's way, have all combined to illuminate the foresight and \nleadership of Senator Strom Thurmond. He has truly proven himself to be \na visionary for the special needs of military medicine.\n  I sincerely thank Senator Thurmond for his magnificent service to the \nSenate and to the Nation and join in the standing ovation of the 2,000 \nattendees at the USUHS commencement ceremony in recognition of his \noutstanding leadership.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the citation conferring the \nhonorary degree upon Senator Thurmond.\n\n Senator James Strom Thurmond, Doctor of Medical Jurisprudence Honoris \n                                 Causa\n\n       Senator Thurmond, over 70 years ago you unselfishly \n     answered your nation's call for service. Since that time, \n     your commitment to patriotism and concern for those who serve \n     their nation has won you the undying respect of all \n     Americans. Tens of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, \n     and Marines have benefitted from your uncompromising \n     commitment to excellence in military service and in \n     particular, military medicine. To provide the care to those \n     who serve when called is sometimes more perilous in the \n     legislature than on the battlefield. You are a luminary of \n     health care delivery and support of those who serve. Your \n     vision has been tested and proven from the battlefields of \n     Vietnam, Grenada, Lebanon, Panama, Haiti, Somalia, and the \n     Persian Gulf to the clinics and health centers that serve the \n     American people. Your spirit and humanity, together with your \n     legislative acumen, have left a legacy for this nation which \n     is unmatched and truly enviable. Through your efforts, this \n     University is now a part of that legacy. Doctors, nurses, and \n     scientists are now serving their nation because of your \n     vision and commitment to purpose. Your nation's health care \n     University takes great pride in awarding you the degree of \n     Doctor of Medical Jurisprudence Honoris Causa.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7636-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7636-S7647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The text of the concurrent resolution (H.

BUDGET SURPLUS ALLOWANCE.\n\n       (a) Adjustments.--For the purposes of points of order under \n     the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 \n     and this concurrent resolution on the budget, the revenue \n     aggregates shall be reduced and other appropriate budgetary \n     aggregates and levels shall be revised to reflect the \n     additional deficit reduction achieved as calculated under \n     subsection (c) for legislation that reduces revenues by \n     providing family tax relief and incentives to stimulate \n     savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n       (b) Revised Aggregates.--Upon the reporting of legislation \n     pursuant to subsection (a), and again upon the submission of \n     a conference report on such legislation (if a conference \n     report is submitted), the Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate shall submit to the Senate appropriately \n     revised budgetary aggregates and levels by an amount that \n     does not exceed the additional deficit reduction calculated \n     under subsection (d).\n       (c) CBO Revised Deficit Estimate.--After the enactment of \n     legislation that complies with the reconciliation directives \n     of section 105, the Congressional Budget Office shall provide \n     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate a \n     revised estimate of the deficit for fiscal years 1996 through \n     2005.\n       (d) Additional Deficit Reduction.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``additional deficit reduction'' means the \n     amount by which the total deficit levels assumed in this \n     resolution for a fiscal year exceed the revised deficit \n     estimate provided pursuant to subsection (c) for such fiscal \n     year for fiscal years 1996 through 2005.\n       (e) CBO Certification and Contingencies.--This section \n     shall not apply unless--\n       (1) legislation has been enacted complying with the \n     reconciliation directives of section 105;\n       (2) the Director of the Congressional Budget Office has \n     provided the estimate required by subsection (c); and\n       (3) the revisions made pursuant to this subsection do not \n     cause a budget deficit for fiscal year 2002, 2003, 2004, or \n     2005.\n\n     SEC. 205. SCORING OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 606(d)(2) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 and beginning with fiscal year 1996, the \n     determinations under sections 302, 303, and 311 of such Act \n     shall take into account any new budget authority, new \n     entitlement authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit effects \n     as a consequence of the provisions of section 251(b)(2)(D) \n     and 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n\n     SEC. 206. SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the prohibition on scoring asset sales has discouraged \n     the sale of assets that can be better managed by the private \n     sector and generate receipts to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit;\n       (2) the President's fiscal year 1996 budget included \n     $8,000,000,000 in receipts from asset sales and proposed a \n     change in the asset sale scoring rule to allow the proceeds \n     from these sales to be scored;\n       (3) assets should not be sold if such sale would increase \n     the budget deficit over the long run; and\n       (4) the asset sale scoring prohibition should be repealed \n     and consideration should be given to replacing it with a \n     methodology that takes into account the long-term budgetary \n     impact of asset sales.\n       (b) Budgetary Treatment.--For purposes of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget and the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the amounts realized from \n     sales of assets shall be scored with respect to the level of \n     budget authority, outlays, or revenues.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (d) Treatment of Loan Assets.--For the purposes of this \n     section, the sale of loan assets or the prepayment of a loan \n     shall be governed by the terms of the Federal Credit Reform \n     Act of 1990.\n     SEC. 207. CREDIT REFORM AND GUARANTEED STUDENT LOANS.\n\n       For the purposes of allocations and points of order under \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and this resolution, the \n     cost of a direct loan shall be the net present value, at the \n     time when the direct loan is disbursed, of the following cash \n     flows for the estimated life of the loan:\n       (1) Loan disbursements.\n       (2) Repayments of principal.\n       (3) Payments of interest and other payments by or to the \n     Government over the life of the loan after adjusting for \n     estimated defaults, prepayments, fees, penalties, and other \n     recoveries.\n       (4) In the case of legislation increasing direct loan \n     commitments for a program in which loan commitments will \n     equal or exceed $5,000,000,000 for the coming fiscal year (or \n     for any prior fiscal year), direct expenses, including--\n       (A) activities related to credit extension, loan \n     origination, loan servicing, training, program promotion, \n     management of contractors, and payments to contractors, other \n     government entities, and program participants;\n       (B) collection of delinquent loans; and\n       (C) writeoff and closeout of loans.\n\n     SEC. 208. EXTENSION OF BUDGET ACT 60-VOTE ENFORCEMENT THROUGH \n                   2002.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 275(b) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as amended by sections \n     13112(b) and 13208(b)(3) of the Budget Enforcement Act of \n     1990), the second sentence of section 904(c) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (except insofar as it \n     relates to section 313 of that Act) and the final sentence of \n     section 904(d) of that Act (except insofar as it relates to \n     section 313 of that Act) shall continue to have effect as \n     rules of the Senate through (but no later than) September 30, \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 209. REPEAL OF IRS ALLOWANCE.\n\n       (a) Section 25 of House Concurrent Resolution 218 (103d \n     Congress, 2d Session) is repealed.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the revenue levels \n     contained in the budget resolution should assume passage of \n     the ``Taxpayers Bill of Rights 2'' and that the Senate should \n     pass the Taxpayers Bill of Rights 2 this Congress.\n       (c) It is the sense of the Senate that funding for tax \n     compliance efforts should be a top priority and that the \n     assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the administration's full request for the \n     Internal Revenue Service.\n\n     SEC. 210. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       The Senate adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \n     and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of \n     the Senate, and such rules shall supersede other rules only \n     to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     the Senate) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.\n            TITLE III--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS AND THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. RESTRUCTURING GOVERNMENT AND PROGRAM TERMINATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that to balance the Federal \n     budget in a rational and reasonable manner requires an \n     assessment of national priorities and the appropriate role of \n     the Federal Government in meeting the challenges facing the \n     United States in the 21st century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that to balance the budget the Congress should-- \n     [[Page S7644]] \n       (1) restructure Federal programs to meet identified \n     national priorities in the most effective and efficient \n     manner so that program dollars get to the intended purpose or \n     recipient;\n       (2) terminate programs that have largely met their goals, \n     that have outlived their original purpose, or that have been \n     superseded by other programs;\n       (3) seek to end significant duplication among Federal \n     programs, which results in excessive administrative costs and \n     ill serve the American people; and\n       (4) eliminate lower priority programs.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING RETURNING PROGRAMS TO \n                   THE STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) section 8 of article I of the Constitution grants the \n     Federal Government limited powers and the 10th amendment to \n     the Constitution expressly provides that the powers not \n     delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the \n     States and the people;\n       (2) in fiscal year 1993, the Federal Government provided \n     funds to States and localities through 593 categorical \n     programs totaling $206,000,000,000;\n       (3) in attempting to solve every problem of society, the \n     Federal Government is overburdening the States and its \n     citizens with cumbersome and intrusive laws, programs, \n     regulations, and mandates; and\n       (4) in administering many Federal programs, the States are \n     often better equipped to determine and respond to the \n     particular needs of the people than the Federal Government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Federal programs should be reviewed to determine \n     whether they are an appropriate function of the Federal \n     Government and whether they are more appropriately a \n     responsibility of the States consistent with the 10th \n     amendment to the Constitution;\n       (2) Federal resources should be provided in a manner which \n     rewards work, promotes families, and provides a helping hand \n     during times of crisis;\n       (3) the Federal Government should seek a new partnership \n     with States that recognizes that ``one size fits all'' \n     solutions of the past are flawed;\n       (4) this new partnership should include block grants that \n     provide maximum flexibility to States and localities in terms \n     of the design and structure of programs to ensure the maximum \n     benefit at the least cost to the American taxpayer;\n       (5) Federal funds must not be used to supplant existing \n     expenditures by individuals, localities, and States;\n       (6) block grants should not be reduced to revenue sharing;\n       (7) adequate safeguards should be in place to protect the \n     Federal investment, such as auditing or maintenance of effort \n     provisions; and\n       (8) the inclusion of Federal goals and principles in block \n     grant programs may be appropriate, as well as essential data \n     collection requirements for evaluation purposes.\n\n     SEC. 303. COMMERCIALIZATION OF FEDERAL ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there are a number of functions being performed by the \n     Federal Government that should not be performed by the \n     Federal Government because they could be more conveniently \n     and efficiently provided by the private sector;\n       (2) our Founding Fathers wrote a Constitution that created \n     a Federal Government of limited powers and limited \n     responsibility;\n       (3) the current Federal Government owns one-third of the \n     land of this great Nation, oil fields, hospitals, railroads, \n     Tokyo office buildings, electric companies, 4,900,000 housing \n     units which are owned outright by Housing and Urban \n     Development or are eligible for Housing and Urban Development \n     subsidy payments, and loan portfolios that are larger than \n     most of the financial institutions in the country; and\n       (4)(A) the Federal Government's encroachment into the \n     private sector is significant, often duplicative, \n     inconsistent with free market principles, and costly for \n     taxpayers;\n       (B) when the Federal Government monopolizes a service that \n     could be provided by the private sector it usually costs \n     taxpayers 30 percent more; and\n       (C) one-fourth of the work done by Federal employees \n     competes with the private sector.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should better define privatization and how it \n     can contribute to ``right sizing'' the Federal Government and \n     at the same time achieve better service, more innovation, and \n     significant deficit reduction;\n       (2) privatization can take at least four forms: asset \n     sales, contracting out, creating corporate enterprises under \n     strict and clearly defined deadlines designed to achieve full \n     privatization, and eliminating legislative barriers, \n     generically called ``private sector lockouts'';\n       (3) provisions of law that prohibit or ``lockout'' the \n     private sector from competing for providing certain services \n     should be examined and eliminated;\n       (4) the private sector from Main Street, Wall Street and \n     Academia should be encouraged by the President and the \n     Congress to bring forward their privatization best practices \n     and proposals for privatization;\n       (5) the Head of each Federal agency and department and the \n     Office of Management and Budget should designate senior level \n     staff persons to develop and evaluate private sector \n     privatization initiatives that should be included in the \n     President's budget;\n       (6)(A) the Office of Management and Budget should set \n     appropriate privatization goals for each agency; and\n       (B) no expansions of programs under a department's \n     jurisdiction should be approved by the Office of Management \n     and Budget unless the agency has achieved those privatization \n     goals;\n       (7) section 257(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act which prohibits crediting savings from \n     asset sales should be repealed or modified; and\n       (8) Congress should evaluate privatization processes taking \n     place in other countries to determine what lessons could be \n     learned so that United States could develop a comprehensive \n     privatization policy by the end of the next fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 304. NONPARTISAN ADVISORY COMMISSION ON THE CPI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress intended to insulate certain government \n     beneficiaries and taxpayers from the effects of inflation by \n     indexing payments and tax brackets to the Consumer Price \n     Index (CPI);\n       (2) approximately 30 percent of total Federal outlays and \n     45 percent of Federal revenues are indexed to reflect changes \n     in the CPI; and\n       (3) the overwhelming consensus among experts is that the \n     method used to construct the CPI and the current calculation \n     of the CPI both overstate the estimate of the true cost of \n     living.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a temporary advisory commission should be established \n     to make objective and nonpartisan recommendations concerning \n     the appropriateness and accuracy of the methodology and \n     calculations that determine the CPI;\n       (2) the Commission should be appointed on a nonpartisan \n     basis, and should be composed of experts in the fields of \n     economics, statistics, or other related professions; and\n       (3) the Commission should report its recommendations to the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics and to Congress at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON A UNIFORM ACCOUNTING \n                   SYSTEM IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND \n                   NONPARTISAN COMMISSION ON ACCOUNTING AND \n                   BUDGETING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal \n     internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress \n     has been made in recent years, there still exists no uniform \n     Federal accounting system for Federal Government entities and \n     institutions.\n       (2) As a result, Federal financial management continues to \n     be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and \n     fiscal practices have failed to identify costs, failed to \n     reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions, and \n     failed to accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not adequately \n     report financial problems of the Federal Government or the \n     full cost of programs and activities. The continued use of \n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data, contributes to \n     waste and inefficiency, and will not assist in achieving a \n     balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in Federal Government undermine \n     the confidence of the American people in the Government and \n     reduces the Federal Government's ability to address \n     adequately vital public needs.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, a uniform Federal accounting system, that \n     fully meets the accounting standards and reporting objectives \n     for the Federal Government, must be immediately established \n     so that all assets and liabilities, revenues and expenditures \n     or expenses, and the full cost of programs and activities of \n     the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately \n     recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout all \n     government entities for budgeting and control and management \n     evaluation purposes.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the following assumptions:\n       (1) Uniform federal accounting system.--(A) A uniform \n     Federal accounting system should be established to \n     consistently compile financial data across the Federal \n     Government, and to make full disclosure of Federal financial \n     data, including the full cost of Federal programs and \n     activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and \n     agency management.\n       (B) Beginning with fiscal year 1997, the President should \n     require the heads of agencies to--\n       (i) implement and maintain a uniform Federal accounting \n     system; and\n       (ii) provide financial statements;\n     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles \n     applied on a consistent basis and established in accordance \n     with proposed Federal accounting standards and \n     interpretations recommended by the Federal Accounting \n     Standards Advisory Board and other applicable law.\n       (2) Nonpartisan advisory commission on accounting and \n     budgeting.--(A) A temporary advisory commission should be \n     established to make objective and nonpartisan recommendations \n     for the appropriate treatment of capital expenditures under a \n     uniform Federal accounting system that is consistent with \n     generally accepted accounting principles.\n       (B) The Commission should be appointed on a nonpartisan \n     basis, and should be composed of public and private experts \n     in the fields of finance, economics, accounting, and other \n     related professions.\n       (C) The Commission should report to the President and the \n     Congress by August 1, 1995, on its recommendations, and \n     should include in its report a detailed plan for implementing \n     such recommendations.\n     [[Page S7645]]\n     \n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT 90 PERCENT OF THE \n                   BENEFITS OF ANY TAX CUTS MUST GO TO THE MIDDLE \n                   CLASS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incomes of middle-class families have stagnated \n     since the early 1980's, with family incomes growing more \n     slowly between 1979 and 1989 than in any other business cycle \n     since World War II; and\n       (2) according to the Department of the Treasury, in 1996, \n     approximately 90 percent of American families will have \n     incomes less than $100,000.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that if the 1996 Concurrent Budget Resolution includes any \n     cut in taxes, approximately 90 percent of the benefits of \n     these tax cuts must go to working families with incomes less \n     than $100,000.\n\n     SEC. 307. BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Health Insurance for the Aged Act, which created \n     the medicare program, was enacted on July 30, 1965, and, \n     therefore, the medicare program will celebrate its 30-year \n     anniversary on July 30, 1995;\n       (2) on April 3, 1995, the Trustees of medicare submitted \n     their 1995 Annual Report on the Status of the Medicare \n     Program to the Congress;\n       (3) the Trustees of medicare have concluded that ``the \n     medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present \n     form'';\n       (4) the Trustees of medicare have concluded that ``the \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays inpatient hospital \n     expenses, will be able to pay benefits for only about 7 years \n     and is severely out of financial balance in the long range'';\n       (5) the Public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund shows a rate \n     of growth of costs which is clearly unsustainable'';\n       (6) the Trustees of medicare have recommended ``legislation \n     to reestablish the Quadrennial Advisory Council that will \n     help lead to effective solutions to the problems of the \n     program'';\n       (7) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     concluded that, absent long-term changes in medicare, \n     projected medicare outlays will increase from about 4 percent \n     of the payroll tax base today to over 15 percent of the \n     payroll tax base by the year 2030;\n       (8) the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform \n     recommended, by a vote of 30 to 1, that spending and revenues \n     available for medicare must be brought into long-term \n     balance;\n       (9) the Public Trustees of medicare have concluded that \n     ``We had hoped for several years that comprehensive health \n     reform would include meaningful medicare reforms. However, \n     with the results of the last Congress, it is now clear that \n     medicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct \n     legislative initiative''; and\n       (10) the Public Trustees of medicare ``strongly recommend \n     that the crisis presented by the financial condition of the \n     medicare trust funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive \n     basis, including a review of the programs's financing \n     methods, benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) a special bipartisan commission should be established \n     immediately to make recommendations concerning the most \n     appropriate response to the short-term solvency and long-term \n     sustainability issues facing medicare;\n       (2) the commission should report to Congress its \n     recommendations on the appropriate response to the short-term \n     solvency of medicare by July 10, 1995, in order that the \n     committees of jurisdiction may consider those recommendations \n     in fashioning an appropriate congressional response; and\n       (3) the commission should report its recommendations to \n     respond to the Public Trustees' call to make medicare's \n     financial condition sustainable over the long term to \n     Congress by February 1, 1996.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF \n                   AGRICULTURE SAVINGS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, in response to the \n     reconciliation instructions in section 105 of this \n     resolution, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry should provide that no more than 20 percent of \n     the savings be achieved in commodity programs.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING PROTECTION OF \n                   CHILDREN'S HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Today's children and the next generation are the prime \n     beneficiaries of the benefits of attaining a balanced Federal \n     budget. Without a balanced budget, today's children must bear \n     the increasing burden of the Federal debt. Continued deficit \n     spending would doom future generations to slower economic \n     growth and lower living standards.\n       (2) The health of children is essential to the future \n     economic and social well-being of the Nation.\n       (3) Medicaid covers one in four children and one in three \n     births. Nearly 60 percent of children covered by medicaid are \n     from working families.\n       (4) While children represent one-half of all people \n     eligible for medicaid, they account for less than 25 percent \n     of medicaid expenditures.\n       (5) Medicaid provides a broad range of services essential \n     for the health of a significant portion of the Nation's \n     children with disabilities.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the health care needs of low-income pregnant women and \n     children should be a top priority;\n       (2) careful study must be made of the impact of medicaid \n     reform proposals on children's health and on vital sources of \n     care including children's hospitals and community and migrant \n     health centers; and\n       (3) medicaid reform legislation which would allow greater \n     State flexibility in the delivery of care and in the control \n     of the rate of growth in costs of the program should also \n     encourage States to place a priority on coverage for pregnant \n     women and children.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT LOBBYING EXPENSES SHOULD \n                   REMAIN NONDEDUCTIBLE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that ordinary Americans \n     generally are not allowed to deduct the costs of \n     communicating with their elected representatives.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that lobbying expenses should not be tax deductible.\n\n     SEC. 311. EXPATRIATE TAXES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress should revise the Internal Revenue Code to \n     ensure that very wealthy individuals are not able to reduce \n     or avoid their United States income, estate, or gift tax \n     liability by relinquishing their United States citizenship; \n     and\n       (2) the increased revenues resulting from the revision \n     should be used to reduce the deficit.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LOSSES OF TRUST FUNDS \n                   DUE TO FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the General Accounting Office estimates that as much as \n     $100,000,000,000 are wasted each year in the health care \n     system due to fraud and abuse;\n       (2) outlays for the medicare program under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act during fiscal year 1994 were \n     $161,100,000,000, and the General Accounting Office estimates \n     that up to 10 percent of those outlays were wasted because of \n     fraud and abuse;\n       (3) medicare beneficiaries incur higher out-of-pocket costs \n     and copayments due to inflated billings resulting from \n     fraudulent and abusive practices perpetrated against the \n     medicare program; and\n       (4) funds lost because of fraud and abuse are contributing \n     to the financial crises of the Federal Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance \n     Trust Fund, as identified by the Boards of Trustees of such \n     trust funds in their 1995 annual reports.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that as the Committee on Finance of the Senate and, if \n     established, the Bipartisan Commission on the Solvency of \n     Medicare recommended under section 307, address the long-term \n     solvency of the medicare program under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), high priority \n     should be given to proposals which identify, eliminate, and \n     recover funds expended from the Federal Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance \n     Trust Fund due to fraud and abuse in such program. In \n     addition, the Senate assumes that funds recovered from \n     enhanced anti-fraud and abuse efforts be used to fund health \n     care anti-fraud and abuse enforcement efforts, reimbursements \n     to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for losses due to \n     fraud and abuse, and deficit reduction.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FULL FUNDING FOR \n                   DECADE OF THE BRAIN RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) long-term health care costs associated with diseases \n     and disorders of the brain have a substantial impact on \n     Federal expenditures for medicaid and medicare, and on the \n     earning potential of the Nation;\n       (2) to highlight the impact of brain diseases and disorders \n     on the economy and well being of the Nation the Congress has \n     declared the 1990's the Decade of the Brain;\n       (3) meaningful research has been initiated as part of the \n     Decade of the Brain;\n       (4) if fully funded this research could provide important \n     new medical breakthroughs; and\n       (5) these breakthroughs could result in a significant \n     reduction in costs to the Federal Government.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that in furtherance of the goals of the Decade of the Brain \n     the appropriate committees should seek to ensure that full \n     funding is provided for research on brain diseases and \n     disorders in each of the fiscal years to which this \n     resolution applies.\n\n     SEC. 314. CONSIDERATION OF THE INDEPENDENT BUDGET FOR \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS, FISCAL YEAR 1996.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Whereas over 26,000,000 veterans are eligible for \n     veterans health care;\n       (2) Whereas the Veterans Health Administration of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs operates the largest Federal \n     medical care delivery system in the United States, providing \n     for the medical care needs of our Nation's veterans;\n       (3) Whereas the veterans' service organizations have \n     provided a plan, known as the Independent Budget for Veterans \n     Affairs, to reform the veterans' health care delivery system \n     to adapt it to the modern health care environment and improve \n     its ability to meet the health care needs of veterans in a \n     cost-effective manner;\n       (4) Whereas current budget proposals assume a change in the \n     definition of service-connected veterans;\n       (5) Whereas proposals contained within the Independent \n     Budget may provide improved service to veterans;\n       (6) Whereas current budget proposals may not have fully \n     considered the measures proposed by the veterans' service \n     organizations in the Independent Budget. [[Page S7646]] \n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the reforms and proposals contained within the Independent \n     Budget for Veterans Affairs, Fiscal Year 1996 should be given \n     careful consideration in an effort to ensure the Nation's \n     commitment to its veterans.\n\n     SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE COSTS OF THE \n                   NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT OF 1993.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that within the assumptions \n     under budget function 800 funds will be spent for \n     reimbursement to the States for the costs of implementing the \n     National Voter Registration Act of 1993.\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION \n                   CAMPAIGN FUND.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying function 800 include the following: That payments \n     to presidential campaigns from the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund, as authorized by the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1974, should not be used to pay for or augment damage \n     awards or settlements arising from a civil or criminal \n     action, or the threat thereof, related to sexual harassment.\n\n     SEC. 317. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FUNDS TO DEFEND AGAINST \n                   SEXUAL HARASSMENT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that no Member of Congress or \n     the Executive Branch may use campaign funds or privately \n     donated funds to defend against sexual harassment lawsuits.\n     SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FINANCIAL \n                   RESPONSIBILITY TO SCHOOLS AFFECTED BY FEDERAL \n                   ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds as follows:\n       (1) In order to fulfill its responsibility to communities \n     that were adversely affected by Federal activities, the \n     Congress established the Impact Aid program in 1950.\n       (2) The Impact Aid program is intended to ease the burden \n     on local school districts for educating children who live on \n     Federal property. Since Federal property is exempt from local \n     property taxes, such districts are denied the primary source \n     of revenue used to finance elementary and secondary \n     education. Most Impact Aid payments are made for students \n     whose parents are in the uniformed services, or for students \n     who reside on Indian lands or in federally subsidized low-\n     rent housing projects. Over 1,600 local educational agencies \n     enrolling over 17,000,000 children are provided assistance \n     under the Impact Aid program.\n       (3) The Impact Aid program is one of the few Federal \n     education programs where funds are sent directly to the \n     school district. Such funds go directly into the general fund \n     and may be used as the local educational agency decides.\n       (4) The Impact Aid program covers less than half of what it \n     costs to educate each federally connected student in some \n     school districts, requiring local school districts or States \n     to provide the remainder.\n       (5) Added to the burden described in paragraph (4) is the \n     fact that some States do not rely upon an income tax for \n     State funding of education. In these cases, the loss of \n     property tax revenue makes State and local education funding \n     even more difficult to obtain.\n       (6) Given the serious budget constraints facing State and \n     local governments it is critical that the Federal Government \n     continue to fulfill its responsibility to the federally \n     impacted school districts in our Nation's States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that in the assumptions for the overall accounts it is \n     assumed that the Federal Government has a financial \n     responsibility to schools in our Nation's communities which \n     are adversely affected by Federal activities and that funding \n     for such responsibilities should not be reduced or \n     eliminated.\n\n     SEC. 319. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO ELIMINATE THE EARNINGS \n                   PENALTY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution include \n     that the increased revenues resulting from the revision of \n     the expatriate tax loophole should be used to eliminate the \n     earnings penalty imposed on low and middle income senior \n     citizens receiving social security.\n\n     SEC. 320. STUDENT LOAN CUTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in the 20th century, educational increases in the \n     workforce accounted for 30 percent of the growth in our \n     Nation's wealth, and advances in knowledge accounted for 55 \n     percent of such growth;\n       (2) the Federal Government provides 75 percent of all \n     college financial aid;\n       (3) the Federal student loan program was created to make \n     college accessible and affordable for the middle class;\n       (4) increased fees and interest costs discourage college \n     participation by making higher education more expensive, and \n     more of a risk, for students and their families;\n       (5) full-time students already work an average of 25 hours \n     per week, taking time away from their studies; and\n       (6) student indebtedness is already increasing rapidly, and \n     any reduction of the in-school interest subsidy will increase \n     the indebtedness burden on students and families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume the Labor and Human Resources Committee, in \n     seeking to achieve mandatory savings, should do their best to \n     not increase the cost of borrowing for students participating \n     in the Robert T. Stafford Federal Student Loan Program.\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NUTRITIONAL \n                   HEALTH OF CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal nutrition programs, such as the school lunch \n     program, the school breakfast program, the special \n     supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and \n     children (referred to in this section as ``WIC''), the child \n     and adult care food program, and others, are important to the \n     health and well-being of children;\n       (2) participation in Federal nutrition programs is \n     voluntary on the part of States, and the programs are \n     administered and operated by every State;\n       (3) a major factor that led to the creation of the school \n     lunch program was that a number of the recruits for the \n     United States armed forces in World War II failed physical \n     examinations due to problems related to inadequate nutrition;\n       (4)(A) WIC has proven to be extremely valuable in promoting \n     the health of newborn babies and children; and\n       (B) each dollar invested in the prenatal component of WIC \n     has been shown to save up to $3.50 in medicaid costs related \n     to medical problems that arise in the first 90 days after the \n     birth of an infant;\n       (5) the requirement that infant formula be purchased under \n     a competitive bidding system under section 17 of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786) saved $1,000,000,000 \n     in fiscal year 1994 and enabled States to allow 1,600,000 \n     women, infants, and children to participate in WIC at no \n     additional cost to taxpayers; and\n       (6) a balanced Federal budget will provide economic \n     benefits to children alive today and to future generations of \n     Americans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the assumptions that--\n       (1) schools should continue to serve lunches that meet \n     minimum nutritional requirements based on tested nutritional \n     research;\n       (2) the content of WIC food packages for infants, children, \n     and pregnant and postpartum women should continue to be based \n     on scientific evidence;\n       (3) the competitive bidding system for infant formula under \n     section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n     1786) should be maintained;\n       (4) foods of minimum nutritional value should not be sold \n     in competition with school lunches in the school cafeterias \n     during lunch hours;\n       (5) some reductions in nutrition program spending can be \n     made without compromising the nutritional well-being of \n     program recipients;\n       (6) in complying with the reconciliation instructions in \n     section 6 of this resolution, the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate should take this \n     section into account; and\n       (7) Congress should continue to move toward fully funding \n     the WIC program.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MAINTAINING FEDERAL FUNDING \n                   FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security;\n       (2) law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation and \n     support;\n       (3) law enforcement officers and agencies are under \n     increasing attacks, both to their physical safety and to \n     their reputations;\n       (4) on April 7, 1995, the Senate passed S.J. Res. 32 in \n     which the Senate recognizes the debt of gratitude the Nation \n     owes to the men and women who daily serve the American people \n     as law enforcement officers and the integrity, honesty, \n     dedication, and sacrifice of our Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement officers;\n       (5) the Nation's sense of domestic tranquility has been \n     shaken by explosions at the World Trade Center in New York \n     and the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and by the \n     fear of violent crime in our cities, towns, and rural areas \n     across the Nation;\n       (6) Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts need \n     increased financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     and not the reduction of such commitment to law enforcement \n     if law enforcement officers are to carry out their efforts to \n     combat violent crime; and\n       (7) on April 5, 1995, and May 18, 1995, the House of \n     Representatives has nonetheless voted to reduce \n     $5,000,000,000 from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund in \n     order to provide for tax cuts in both H. R. 1215 and H. Con. \n     Res. 67.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that the Federal Government's commitment to \n     fund Federal law enforcement programs and programs to assist \n     State and local efforts should be maintained and funding for \n     the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund should not be reduced \n     by $5,000,000,000 as the bill and resolution passed by the \n     House of Representatives would require.\n\n     SEC. 323. NEED TO ENACT LONG TERM HEALTH CARE REFORM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the One Hundred Fourth \n     Congress should enact fundamental long-term health care \n     reform that emphasizes cost-effective, consumer oriented, and \n     consumer-directed home and community-based care that builds \n     upon existing family supports and achieves deficit reduction \n     by helping elderly and disabled individuals remain in their \n     own homes and communities.\n\n     SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MANDATORY MAJOR \n                   ASSUMPTIONS UNDER FUNCTION 270: ENERGY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that within the mandatory \n     major assumptions under budget function 270, none of the \n     power marketing administrations within the 48 contiguous \n     States will be sold, and any savings that were assumed would \n     be realized from the sale of those power marketing \n     administrations will be realized through cost reductions in \n     other programs within the Department of Energy.\n\n     SEC. 325. DEFENSE OVERHEAD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the major discretionary assumptions in this concurrent \n     budget resolution include 15 percent [[Page S7647]] reduction \n     in overhead for programs of nondefense agencies that remain \n     funded in the budget and whose funding is not interconnected \n     with receipts dedicated to a program;\n       (2) the Committee Report (104-82) on this concurrent budget \n     resolution states that ``this assumption would not reduce \n     funding for the programmatic activities of agencies.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations \n     should make a reduction of at least three percent in overhead \n     for fiscal year 1996 programs of defense agencies, and should \n     do so in a manner so as not to reduce funding for the \n     programmatic activities of these agencies.\n\n     SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESSENTIAL AIR \n                   SERVICE PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the essential air service program of the Department of \n     Transportation under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title \n     49, United States Code--\n       (A) provides essential airline access to isolated rural \n     communities across the United States;\n       (B) is necessary for the economic growth and development of \n     rural communities;\n       (C) connects small rural communities to the national air \n     transportation system of the United States;\n       (D) is a critical component of the national transportation \n     system of the United States; and\n       (E) provides air service to 108 communities in 30 States; \n     and\n       (2) the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive \n     Airline Industry established under section 204 of the Airport \n     and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement, and \n     Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992 recommended maintaining \n     the essential air service program with a sufficient level of \n     funding to continue to provide air service to small \n     communities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the essential air service program of the Department of \n     Transportation under subchapter II of chapter 417 of title \n     49, United States Code, should receive, to the maximum extent \n     possible, a sufficient level of funding to continue to \n     provide air service to small rural communities that qualify \n     for assistance under the program.\n\n     SEC. 327. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PRIORITY THAT \n                   SHOULD BE GIVEN TO RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY \n                   EFFICIENCY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND \n                   DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) section 1202 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (106 \n     Stat. 2956), which passed the Senate 93 to 3 and was signed \n     into law by President Bush in 1992, amended section 6 of the \n     Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology \n     Competitiveness Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 12005) to direct the \n     Secretary of Energy to conduct a 5-year program to \n     commercialize renewable energy and energy efficiency \n     technologies;\n       (2) poll after poll shows that the American people \n     overwhelmingly believe that renewable energy and energy \n     efficiency technologies should be the highest priority of \n     Federal research, development, and demonstration activities;\n       (3) renewable technologies (such as wind, photovoltaic, \n     solar thermal, geothermal, and biomass technology) have made \n     significant progress toward increased reliability and \n     decreased cost;\n       (4) energy efficient technologies in the building, \n     industrial, transportation, and utility sectors have saved \n     more than 3 trillion dollars for industries, consumers, and \n     the Federal Government over the past 20 years while creating \n     jobs, improving the competitiveness of the economy, making \n     housing more affordable, and reducing the emissions of \n     environmentally damaging pollutants;\n       (5) the renewable energy and energy efficiency technology \n     programs feature private sector cost shares that are among \n     the highest of Federal energy research and development \n     programs;\n       (6) according to the Energy Information Administration, the \n     United States currently imports more than 50 percent of its \n     oil, representing $46,000,000,000, or approximately 40 \n     percent, of the $116,000,000,000 total United States \n     merchandise deficit in 1993; and\n       (7) renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies \n     represent potential inroads for American companies into \n     export markets for energy products and services estimated at \n     least $225,000,000,000 over the next 25 years.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution include the assumption that renewable energy and \n     energy efficiency technology research, development, and \n     demonstration activities should be given priority among the \n     Federal energy research programs.\n\n     SEC. 328. FOREIGN SALES CORPORATIONS INCOME EXCLUSION.\n\n       The assumption underlying the functional totals include \n     that it is the sense of the Senate that cuts in student loan \n     benefits should be minimized, and that the current exclusion \n     of income of Foreign Sales Corporations should be eliminated.\n\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Sunday the Nation lost one of its \nforemost leaders on military and defense policies, and I lost a good \nfriend, with the passing of Les Aspin.\n  I came to know and appreciate Les Aspin when we served together in \nthe House of Representatives, and he and Junket, his huge, hairy sheep \ndog, shared an office down the hall from me in the Cannon House Office \nBuilding.\n  I came to know and appreciate Les as a good and decent man who was \nnever too busy to stop and exchange a joke with you.\n  I also came to admire and respect him as a dedicated, selfless public \nservant. At the time of his death, he had spent more than 3 decades in \npublic service as a Member of the House of Representatives, as chairman \nof the House Armed Services Committee, as a chief adviser on military \npolicy to the Clinton-Gore campaign, as Secretary of Defense, and as \nthe head of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.\n  No person could have been better prepared for these important and \ndemanding positions. Les Aspin brought to them the best of education, \nincluding an undergraduate degree from Yale, a master's degree from \nOxford University, and a Ph.D. in economics from MIT.\n  And he had the best of training, as he had worked on the staffs of \nSenator William Proxmire, Dr. Walter Heller when he chaired the Council \nof Economic Advisers, and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.\n  Not only was Les well educated and well versed in public policy, he \nwas a person who cared deeply for his country and its citizens.\n  Les Aspin may well be most remembered for his brief, but stormy \ntenure as the Secretary of Defense. To those who were surprised by his \ncontroversial tenure in this position, I can only say that I am \nsurprised that they were surprised.\n  Les Aspin has always been controversial--he was never afraid to take \na position--at times, a lonely, unpopular decision. He was elected to \nCongress as a critic of the Vietnam war, but backed President Reagan's \nmilitary buildup and the decision to go to war against Iraq.\n  As chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin was a \none-man think tank, as he always seemed on the cutting edge of defense \nissues. An AP reporter dubbed him a ``strategic intellectual.'' He was \nas comfortable in dealing with foreign policy and defense issues as he \nwas in reviewing Pentagon procurement practices. And he had that \nincredible and marvelous ability to present\n the most complicated and difficult public policy issues in simple and \neasily understood ways.\n\n  Congressman Aspin was a logical choice to reshape the Pentagon and \nU.S. military in the post-cold-war era. When President-elect Clinton \nnominated him for the position of Secretary of Defense, the Washington \nPost noted that it seemed that Mr. Aspin had ``spent most of his \nprofessional life preparing for the defense secretary's job.'' The \nWashington Times remarked that he had ``devoted nearly every waking \nhour as a student, professional, and politician to thinking about \nweapons and soldiers.''\n  Everyone knew that the adjustments to the post-Soviet world would be \ndifficult and controversial--and they were. Secretary Aspin did not \nshrink from these challenges. He welcomed them. His time as head of the \nPentagon was a time of shifting international commitments, and new \nchallenges posed by the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This \nincluded the painful [[Page S7648]] downsizing of the military and the \nreview and revision of the Pentagon's budget and procurement \nprocedures.\n  It was a time for the reshaping of a military that for a half-century \nhad been designed to fight global war, and would now be remolded for \nworld peace, keeping missions and for international humanitarian \nexpeditions.\n  Mr. President, the accolades and eulogies now being delivered in \nhonor of Les Aspin, are well deserved and well earned. The United \nStates is indeed indebted to Congressman and Secretary Aspin for his \nyears of public service, for his legislative achievements, and for his \ntremendous contributions to the defense of our great and free country.\n  But I will always remember him as my good and decent friend down the \nhall, with that huge hairy dog, who was never too busy to stop and \nshare a laugh with you.\n  Mr. President, my wife Linda and I extend to the family of Les Aspin \nour most heartfelt condolences. We share their grief and their loss.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7647-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM KETCHUM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 25 years ago, we created the Office of \nCurator of the U.S. Senate. And since that time, that job has been \nfilled by just one man--Jim Ketchum.\n  Jim has now announced his retirement, and it is entirely fitting that \na resolution we adopted earlier this week designated him as curator \nemeritus of the Senate.\n  After working in the Office of the White House Curator for many \nyears, Jim came to the Senate in 1970, when he accepted an invitation \nto organize the Office of Senate Curator.\n  For the past quarter century, Jim has devoted his career to \npreserving the works of art in the Senate and the history and \ntraditions of this institution.\n  Jim was the driving force behind the restoration of the old Senate \nand old Supreme Court Chambers, the President's room, and countless \nother important Senate treasures.\n  Painting and documents have been recovered and preserved due to Jim's \ntireless efforts. He has helped us all better understand this \ninstitution and the Capitol through exhibitions, lectures, \npublications, and other educational programs.\n  I know Jim is especially proud of the exhibit, ``a necessary fence * \n* *: The Senate's first century,'' which opened in the summer of 1989 \nin celebration of the Senate's bicentennial.\n  Jim has also made an important contribution to protecting the dignity \nof this institution by helping to develop legislation prohibiting abuse \nof the Senate seal.\n  Finally, one cannot mention Jim without remembering his efforts on \nbehalf of the State of the Union dinners. I am just one of many \nSenators who has enjoyed one of Jim's trademark chicken pies.\n  Mr. President, for all that he has done for this institution, Jim has \ntruly earned the designation as ``curator emeritus.''\n  I know all Senators will join me in thanking Jim for his \nextraordinary efforts in preserving the history and traditions of this \ninstitution, and in extending our best wishes to him, as he and his \nwife, Barbara, head to their farmhouse in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7648-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GERALD HACKETT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate adopted a \nresolution expressing our appreciation for the outstanding service of \nGerald Hackett, our Senate executive clerk, who will retire from the \nSenate effective June 30, 1995.\n  I now want to add my personal thanks for his many 33 years of \ndedication to the Senate--nearly 29 of those as Senate executive clerk.\n  As Members know, the executive clerk assists the Senate with its \nconstitutional duty to consider nominations and treaties under its \nadvise and consent authority. The office's many responsibilities \ninclude managing original documents, maintaining records, transmitting \ncopies of Presidential messages, compiling the executive calendar, and \npreparing all resolutions of confirmation for nominations and \nresolutions of ratification for treaties.\n  Gerry has dedicated his Senate service not only to these duties, but \nalso to improving the operation of the executive clerk's office.\n  He was instrumental in the computerization of the treaty and \nnomination processes. Moreover, under his direction, publishing the \nexecutive journal is now done on-line, with a substantial savings of \ntax dollars.\n  I know all Senators agree with me in saying that Gerry has always \nacted with the best interests of the Senate in mind, and in wishing him \nand his wife, Mary Ellen, best wishes for a long, healthy, and happy \nretirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7648-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRED BROOMFIELD\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate adopted a \nresolution paying tribute to Fred Broomfield, a member of the \nDepartment of Office Services in the Office of the Secretary of the \nSenate, who will retire July 15, 1995.\n  Fred has worked in the Office of the Secretary for over 19 years. \nAmong his numerous responsibilities is to deliver to our offices the \nmany many important documents necessary for the legislative process.\n  In fulfilling those duties, Fred has ably carried out a tradition \nthat dates back to the very beginning of the Senate. Just 2 days after \nthe first Senate convened in 1789, the Members elected their first \nSecretary and chose their first messenger. And if I am not mistaken, \nthe first message was delivered to Senator Thurmond.\n  Fred is well known in the Secretary's office as a loyal, reliable, \nand hard working civil servant. He will be missed by all of us.\n  I know all Senators will join with me in thanking Fred, his wife \nHilda, and his five children for his dedicated and distinguished \nservice, and in extending our best wishes for a long and healthy \nretirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7648-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THANKING RUSSELL KING\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in my role as Senate majority leader, I also \nserve as a member of the Joint Leadership Commission for our program \nfor America's young people, the Congressional Award.\n  As such, it is my responsibility, from time to time, to appoint \nindividuals to serve on the Congressional Award Foundation's board of \ndirectors, which works with us to implement the program nationwide.\n  Several years ago, when we were reorganizing the volunteer board, I \nasked Russell King, a senior vice president of Freeport-McMoran, if he \nwould be willing to serve, and to make this program a truly national \nopportunity. He agreed, and has since become the foundation's \ntreasurer, and two-term chairman, where he has presided over the \nexciting growth of the program.\n  As Russ ends his tenure as chairman, I extend the appreciation of the \nSenate to him for his tireless devotion to the Congressional Award, and \nfor his commitment to America's youth. We are fortunate that he will \nremain on the board, and will continue to work with us as this \noutstanding program grows throughout the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator from Maine\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7648-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7648-S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MARGARET CHASE SMITH\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, recently Senator Margaret Chase Smith \nsuffered a severe stroke and is now in critical condition at her home \nin Maine. I just want to take a few moments to express my deep regret \nover this recent turn of events and to spend a few moments talking \nabout Senator Margaret Chase Smith.\n  I think as the Senator from Alaska knows, and virtually all the \nMembers of this Chamber know, Senator Smith served with distinction in \nthe Senate from 1949 to 1973 in the seat I now occupy. Directly before \nthat she served four terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. [[Page S7649]] \n  Many in this Chamber know of this wonderful woman's accomplishments. \nShe was the first woman to have her name placed in nomination for \nPresident by a major political party; she cast an impressive 2,941 \nconsecutive roll call votes; she delivered her famous Declaration of \nConscious speech in 1950 criticizing Senator Joseph McCarthy and his \nstormtrooper tactics in exposing suspected communists.\n  During her Declaration of Conscience speech, Senator Smith remarked \nthat Senator McCarthy's investigation was playing on Americans' worst \nfears and was chipping away at the soul of the country. She said the \nSenator and his supporters were parceling away individual freedoms and \nliberties in the name of a fight that history has proved to be \nwrongheaded. In that speech, she noted,\n\n       Those of us who shout the loudest about Americanism in \n     making character assassinations are all too frequently those \n     who, by our own words and acts, ignore some of the basic \n     principles of Americanism--The right to criticize; the right \n     to hold unpopular beliefs; the right to protest; the right of \n     independent thought. The exercise of these rights should not \n     cost one single American citizen his reputation or his right \n     to a livelihood nor should he be in danger of losing his \n     reputation or livelihood merely because he happens to know \n     someone who holds unpopular beliefs.\n\n  To understand the significance of the speech, and the courage of the \nwoman who delivered it, we must remember the times during which it was \ndelivered. These were days when it would have been easy to join the \ncrowd--days when many were barking at every shadow, challenging and \naccusing anyone who disagreed with popular opinion as being disloyal. \nIt was a phenomenon we have not seen since in American politics. It was \nnot simply a group or a movement or a passing fad--it was a tidal wave \nof hatred and suspicion that engulfed many of the supposedly thoughtful \npoliticians of the day.\n  There have been many occasions when I also invoke the name of Joan \nBenoit. Joan Benoit, who hails from Maine, was the great marathon \nrunner. Many of us can recall that moment when she broke out in that \nmarathon, and she began so fast she moved away out ahead of the crowd \nand every one of the commentators said, ``She can never maintain that \npace. She will fall behind.''\n  To the astonishment of virtually everyone who watched that historic \nevent, she not only maintained the pace but she continued it throughout \nthe entire marathon race.\n  Throughout her career, Margaret Chase Smith has set her own pace, \ncharted her own course, ignored her critics and never looked back at \nthose who followed far behind her leadership. She has known the glory \nand loneliness, I should say, of the long distance runner.\n  When thinking of Senator Smith, I am reminded of an ancient proverb \nthat says, ``When drinking water, don't forget those who dug the \nwell.''\n  Americans are, by nature, a forward-looking people. But, as the \nproverb suggests, we should also pay tribute to those who have gone \nbefore us, those who have paved the way for us and for future \ngenerations. We should remember those who have dug the well. Margaret \nChase Smith dug the well for me and for many Maine politicians.\n  Senator Smith has also remained politically active following her \nretirement from the Senate. With the Senator's support, the Margaret \nChase Smith Center for Public Policy was created in 1989 to serve as a \nnonpartisan public service organization at the University of Maine. \nThrough the center, university students and other scholars study public \npolicy and work to improve the quality of dialog on policy issues. It \nhas greatly enhanced the study of politics at the University of Maine, \nand it is a fine testament to the impact that Senator Smith had on \nMaine and the country.\n  In America, every person stands equal before the law, but in \npolitics, the aristocracy of talent is supreme. Maine can rightfully \ntake pride in the fact that Margaret Chase Smith has stood at the top \nof that aristocracy.\n  I thank the Chair and Senator Dole for yielding this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7648-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR MARGARET CHASE SMITH\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Having had \nthe honor and privilege, as did the Presiding Officer, of serving with \nSenator Margaret Chase Smith, I can certainly appreciate his remarks. I \ncan almost see her seated at that desk, with a rose--there was a rose \nthere every morning on her desk.

Mr. President, it had been our hope that we could have \nappointed conferees today on four major pieces of legislation: Medicare \nselect, regulation reform, product liability, and line-item veto. But \nfor a number of reasons we are not able to do that today. We hope to be \nable to be in a position to appoint conferees in all four of those \nmeasures when we return on Monday, June 5. At least we will make the \neffort. If there is objection at that time, the objection will be \nnoted.\n  We have done all the nominations on the calendar with one exception, \nbecause I had requests from some of my colleagues that we make certain \nwe did that before recess. They have been done.\n  I would say it will be my intention now, when we come back on Monday, \nto stay with the terrorism bill at least through Monday to see what \nhappens. I apologize to Senators Pressler and Hollings because we \nthought we would go to the telecommunications bill that day, but we did \nlose a day yesterday with the votes. In the last 2 days we had 50-some \nvotes. We might have been able to finish the terrorism bill this week. \nSo we will make an effort on Monday, June 5, and maybe up through noon \non Tuesday, and at that point we will see what the situation is, how \nmany amendments are remaining, whether or not we can have time \nagreements. But it is still my hope to go to the telecommunications \nbill early the week we are back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7649-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 5, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreconvenes at 10 a.m. on Monday, June 5, 1995, that following the \nprayer, the Journal of proceedings be deemed approved to date, no \nresolutions come over under the rule, the call of the calendar be \ndispensed with, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time \nfor the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; there \nthen be a period for the transaction of morning business not to extend \nbeyond the hour of 11 a.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n5 minutes each.\n  I further ask consent at the hour of 11 o'clock the Senate resume \nconsideration of S. 735, the antiterrorism bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I should have said at the outset, this has \nbeen cleared by the Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7649-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. So I would say for the information of all Senators, when \nthe Senate is reconvened following the Memorial Day recess, we will \nresume consideration of the antiterrorism bill. Under the previous \nconsent agreement, amendments are limited to the bill. Therefore \nSenators should be aware that rollcall votes can be anticipated on \nMonday. However, we will have no rollcall votes until--they will not \nbegin before 5 o'clock on Monday, June 5. Both Senators Biden and Hatch \nhave indicated to both leaders, Democratic and Republican leaders, that \nthey will have amendments. There will be votes. And that they will be \nprepared at 11 o'clock on Monday, June 5, to move forward as rapidly as \npossible on the antiterrorism bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/26/senate-section/article/S7649-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 5, 1995, AT 10 A.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
